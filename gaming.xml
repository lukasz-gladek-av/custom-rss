            <p>Let’s try and get you up to speed on the fascinating oddity that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ecosystem">Ecosystem</a>, on the off chance that Nate's coverage of it hasn't stuck with you like an unwelcome brain parasite you’re nonetheless unwilling to get removed for fear of the lingering emptiness it might cause (he once described an eel as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-a-virtual-eel-nearly-became-intelligent-enough-to-grind-my-pc-to-a-halt">“a quaver with erectile dysfunction”</a>). Broadly speaking, this game is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spore">Spore</a>’s evolutionary-biology-degree-having cousin. It’s been in early access for about three years now, but with the latest "Crustacean" update, it’s just hit 1.0. Once again, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-animals-keep-evolving-into-crabs/">carcinization has come for all things</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here’s how the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133120/Ecosystem/">Steam page</a> describes it:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The nervous system of a virtual lifeform is a pipeline computer where, every moment, data from sense organs passes through a network of neurons and finally contracts a muscle in a specific body part. Creatures swim just like real sea-life, applying torque at their joints to push against the water in a way coordinated to propel themselves forward.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Nate’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ecosystem-has-burst-my-mind-and-you-could-be-playing-it-right-now">attempts to play Poseidon</a> are worth reading up on if you’re curious, but in short, Ecosystem lets you tweak certain environmental factors or traits to guide the evolutionary trajectories of your aquatic abominations, or just start with a clutch of random lifeforms and see how they get on. Most will be too stupid to live - or even move - but a few will have traits that let them survive, and these traits will be passed down to their offspring. 

</p><p>Since Nate last played, the game has added <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1133120/view/3675554043635333909">fishy combat</a>, in which animals now directly attack one another and evolve spikes and hard skin to defend themselves from predators. There's also now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1133120/view/4209252160976023355">more complex behaviour</a> that will see them building nests and swimming in groups. Everything down to the way they traverse the ocean is simulated. It looks fascinating. Also: Data!</p>
<blockquote><p>For players who want to monitor their ecosystems closely, there is a lot of data at your fingertips. We’ve got you covered for all the statistics and analysis of your world that you could possibly want - from ecosystem overviews showing population charts for both animals and plants to phylogenetic trees for individual species, allowing you to track your species evolution.</p></blockquote>
<p>To celebrate 1.0, there’s also a chunky 30% discount running until the 22nd of November. I’m very tempted, if only to see how close I get to turning one of these hapless, flailing lifeforms into Godzilla.</p>

Nintendo will hold a special Direct broadcast later today - but, once again, it's not to announce <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, the Super Nintendo World Direct will focus on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-expansion-for-super-nintendo-world-opens-in-spring-2024">upcoming addition of Donkey Kong Country</a> to Universal Studios Japan. 
</p>
<p>
Announcing the broadcast, which is scheduled for 10pm UK time tonight (that's 2pm Pacific or 5pm Eastern), Nintendo said the stream would last for roughly 10 minutes and that no information on upcoming games will be featured.

"Please note, there will be no game announcements or mentions of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation," Nintendo noted.

<p>
Super Nintendo World finally opened its doors at Universal Studios Japan in late 2020. A slightly smaller version, at Universal Studios Hollywood, opened in early 2023. 
</p>
<p>
Two other incarnations of Super Nintendo World are under construction and due to open in 2025. These will be located at Universal Studios Singapore and at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/universal-floridas-super-nintendo-world-park-gets-may-2025-opening-date">Universal Epic Universe in Florida, the latter of which will include Donkey Kong Country from the off</a>.

<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> is set to add a new rollercoaster, Mine-Cart Madness, that is designed to make riders feel like their cart has jumped the track.

			<p>The Metal Slug series would have been low on my list as a candidate for a tactics game. Better known for bombastic 2D run ‘n’ gun shooting, it’s the antithesis of a slower, more thoughtful tactics games. Like its iconic pixellated tanks though, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-slug-tactics">Metal Slug Tactics</a> is ready to blow those expectations to smithereens.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metal Slug Tactics - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JZlvf_m8Zc0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>General Donald Morden is the returning big bad, and having escaped justice – as bad men always seem to do – he’s declared martial law in Sirocco City. This is A. Bad. Thing. and you are part of the ragtag team sent in to stop him.</p>


<p>There’s plenty of early familiarity to the way that Metal Slug Tactics works. An isometric view is broken down into a grid, and you move your units about the map as far as their movement allows, before then using whatever offensive technique is available to you.</p>
<p>Leikir Studios haven’t sat on their pixelated laurels though, and while publisher Dotemu is behind stellar upgrades and reimaginings like Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap and Streets of Rage 4, it’s nice to see that they’ve taken a fresh approach to the tactics genre. The further your unit moves, the more Dodge resources they generate, and that stat reduces how much damage your character takes. Combined with using cover to further protect you, you can effectively charge through the enemies’ defences and unleash devastation. This makes it feel like Metal Slug.</p>


<p>Your special abilities further enhance that feel. These are powered by Adrenaline, another resource you gain with longer movement, via jumps, or through certain passive abilities and actions. You can save these abilities up to cause massive damage, calling in airstrikes or amping up your unit’s weaponry, and they’re critical to success against some of the larger tanks and enemy units you come up against.</p>
<p>The last key to the tactical puzzle is syncing up your attacks, positioning your team so that they’ll all join in with their own additional attacks, whittling down the enemies’ health bars as they do. In other series, this might feel optional, but here it’s downright essential, particularly at the start of each run before you’ve had a chance to buff your team.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Metal Slug Tactics all starts to make sense. Leikir have translated the run ‘n’ gun ethos of the original into a tactics game with startling clarity, without overcomplicating things, and it’s somehow balanced the outlook of the series and its new form. As a long-time fan of Metal Slug, who also happens to love games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/17/fire-emblem-engage-review/">Fire Emblem</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/04/triangle-strategy-review-nintendo-switch/">Triangle Strategy</a>, it’s a perfect mix.</p>

<p>It helps that it looks so pretty. The isometric viewpoint leans into the original’s pixel-art design, and everything feels authentic to the series. That’s before the hi-res artwork appears, lifting the UI, character conversations and special abilities so that it feels unequivocally modern.</p>
<p>That modernity then stretches into the game’s progression system, lifting roguelike elements so that you start a new run each time, gaining experience to level up your characters and their abilities as you advance. You choose your route across each stage, the map offering different rewards in each area. Again, it makes perfect sense with Metal Slug’s arcade roots, and it retains the addictive one-more-go design that would have ensured you kept ploughing money into the slot.</p>
<p>It definitely doesn’t go easy on you, and there’s that early punishment you’d expect from a Roguelike, but once you’ve got a handle on what it expects of you, and you’ve started to level up your team, things start to become easier for you.</p>

<p>Fans of 90s arcade games will love the sound design as well, which is thoroughly old-school. Between the energetic electronic soundtrack and the digitised voice work, Metal Slug Tactics sounds like you could be in the 90s, and it’s utterly brilliant, at least if you’re old enough to be played by the nostalgia card.</p>

		I love what Dotemu and Leikir Studios have achieved with Metal Slug Tactics. The unlikeliest pivot for a franchise aside, it mixes interesting tactical action, Roguelike progression and brilliant visuals into an indie title that nails the balance between nostalgia and modernity.	</p></div>

            <title><![CDATA[India’s Gaming Market To Be Bigger Than Bollywood by 2029]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/india-gaming-market-bigger-bollywood/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/india%E2%80%99s-gaming-market-to-be-bigger-than-bollywood-by-2029.1032333/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/india-gaming-market-bigger-bollywood/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been estimated that there is rampant growth for the Indian gaming sector on the horizon. Per a recent report published by Lumikai, it was predicted that the region would see a CAGR of 20% leading to 2029, causing the market’s valuation to grow from around $3.8 billion today to $9.2 billion by 2029.</p>



<p>It was noted that gaming is India’s ‘fastest-growing new media segment’ behind video and OTT media.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-the-future">To The Future</h2>



<p>India boasts an audience of 591 million gamers, with a split of around 44% – 66% in favour of male players. Mobile games are king in the country, and Lumikai estimated that India is the second-largest consumer of mobile games in the world. That’s why games like BGMI, Call of Duty Mobile, and Free Fire do so well in the country.</p>



<p><em>As a side note, if you’re a Free Fire fan and are looking to score some free Diamonds, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-diamonds-in-free-fire-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out our guide</a>.</em></p>



<p>In recent years, the numbers have shown that Indian gamers (particularly those in the 18 to 30-year-old age group) have boosted their average weekly gaming time by around 30%. We’re also seeing a rapid expansion of the region’s esports industry, with more competitive gamers than ever appearing across the country.</p>



<p>Lumikai, a data aggregation firm, revealed that when it started collecting data in 2020, there were just 25 notable gaming companies in India. In the most recent pass, more than 2,300 companies (‘leads’) were recorded in the country. One senior associate at Lumikai, Aditya Deshpande, suggested that the growth of gaming will <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/indias-game-market-could-grow-from-3-8b-to-9-2b-by-2029-lumikai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">surpass the value of Bollywood</a> in the coming years.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that <a href="https://www.lumikai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lumikai</a> is an Indian venture capital firm <strong>focused </strong>on the Indian market, but external firms have predicted similar growth.</p>

<p>The 2025 iteration of the Grammy Awards is fast approaching, and once again, the nominees for ‘Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media’ have been revealed. Put simply, it’s the award that crowns the best soundtrack from a video game that has emerged in recent months, but the line-up is slim and PlayStation has dominated this time around.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-games-nominated-for-a-grammy">Games Nominated for a Grammy</h2>



<p>Ubisoft and PlayStation are dominating the nominee roster this year for the ‘Best Video Game Soundtrack’ category at the Grammy Awards:</p>



<ul>
<li>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</li>



<li>God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla</li>



<li>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</li>



<li>Star Wars Outlaws</li>



<li>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</li>
</ul>



<p>Bear McCreary (God of War) is a regular nominee at this point—he’s had his name thrown into the pot during every Grammy Awards ceremony where this category has existed. The category was only opened up in 2023, and previously, it was won by Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla in 2023 and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor in 2024.</p>



<p>Could Ubisoft go for the triple header and win again this time with Star Wars Outlaws or Avatar?</p>



<p>Unfortunately, fans have had issues with this category at the Grammy Awards since it debuted in 2023. Back then, the likes of <strong>Call of Duty </strong>made it into the running, which rankled with gamers worldwide. It seemed then – and it still seems now – that indie titles with better soundtracks are being snubbed for the big, mainstream names.</p>



<p>It reached a point where one of the voting board members <a href="https://x.com/masonlieberman/status/1592916480160473088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">took to social media</a> to explain how things work behind the scenes. He explained that low participation led to few nominations and that the vast majority of the voters on the board were film composers who rarely – if ever – interacted with the video game world.</p>



<p>This year, the only game that isn’t one of the ‘bigger hitters’ is a remake of a game that was released in 1980, which feels almost shoehorned in to hit a diversity requirement.</p>



<p>Do you want to see more diversity in this category at the Grammy Awards? Let us know in the comments.</p>

Square Enix released a physical edition last year, but the small print run sold out extremely fast. Last month's re-release brought the collection to major retailers for the first time as the Anniversary Edition. It's worth emphasizing that this is a true physical release, as all of the games are on the Switch cart or PS4 disc.</p><div title="6525641 - Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2557" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6525641 - Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DCKFWW1V,B0DCKFZ1V6&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DCKFWW1V,B0DCKFZ1V6&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DCKFWW1V,B0DCKFZ1V6&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (PlayStation)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DCKFWW1V,B0DCKFZ1V6&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DCKFWW1V,B0DCKFZ1V6&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DCKFWW1V,B0DCKFZ1V6&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$55 (was $75)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition includes the Pixel Remasters of the following games:</p><ul><li>Final Fantasy I (NES, 1987)</li><li>Final Fantasy II (NES, 1988)</li><li>Final Fantasy III (Famicom, 1990)</li><li>Final Fantasy IV (SNES, 1991)</li><li>Final Fantasy V (SNES, 1992)</li><li>Final Fantasy VI (SNES, 1994)</li></ul><p>All six games received comprehensive graphical and audio overhauls for the Pixel Remaster series. Square Enix remodeled the sprites using the original pixel art as a foundation. Series composer Nobuo Uematsu supervised the creation of the rearranged soundtracks. You can also play the games with the original soundtracks, but the rearranged versions are great.</p><p>Numerous quality-of-life features were added, including quick save, customizable text fonts, experience multipliers, auto-battling, the ability to turn off random encounters, and more. You can also browse the in-game bestiary and illustration gallery as well as listen to classic tunes with a music player.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch\/dp\/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (Nintendo Switch)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch\/dp\/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$71.49 (was $75)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Unfortunately, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch version</a> hasn't received nearly as substantial of a discount, but you can grab it for $71.49 at Amazon.</p><p>Alternatively, you can get the original edition for $69.49.

The collection was ported to PlayStation and Switch last year and to Xbox Series X|S in September.</p><p>The proper Final Fantasy III was exclusive to Japan until the release of the 3D remake for Nintendo DS. Long-time fans in North America may remember Final Fantasy VI, arguably the best game in the franchise, as Final Fantasy III.</p><p>The games can be played in any order, but it's really cool to see how the series evolved from the 8-bit era on the Nintendo Entertainment System to the 16-bit era of the Super Nintendo.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FF-DOT-Pixel-Final-Fantasy/dp/1506713521?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/FF-DOT-Pixel-Final-Fantasy\/dp\/1506713521?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/FF-DOT-Pixel-Final-Fantasy/dp/1506713521?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">FF Dot: The Pixel Art of Final Fantasy</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FF-DOT-Pixel-Final-Fantasy/dp/1506713521?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/FF-DOT-Pixel-Final-Fantasy\/dp\/1506713521?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/FF-DOT-Pixel-Final-Fantasy/dp/1506713521?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$20.71 (was $25)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you love classic Final Fantasy games, you should also check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FF-DOT-Pixel-Final-Fantasy/dp/1506713521?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FF Dot: The Pixel Art of Final Fantasy</a>.

Each villain is represented as a sculpted figurine. Star Wars Villainous also comes with over 200 illustrated cards as well as various tokens and trackers used to keep track of the action.</p><p>Ravensburger's Villainous series is recommended for players ages 10 and up, and games last roughly an hour. Most entries in the series, including the Star Wars-themed edition, support two to four players out of the box. If you combine sets, the player count can reach six. It is worth noting that Bigger and Badder, the version of Villainous focused on Pixar animated movies, is only for two to three players.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-disc-drive-is-sold-out-at-most-retailers-but-walmart-has-it-for-now/1100-6526391/">PS5 Pro Disc Drive Is Sold Out At Most Retailers, But Walmart Has It (For Now)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorders-live-at-amazon-walmart-and-best-buy/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Is Available Now And Eligible For One-Day Delivery At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-games-on-sale-for-great-prices-tears-of-the-kingdom-for-45-echoes-of-wisdom-for-50/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom And Echoes Of Wisdom Get Stellar Discounts</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition In Stock On Launch Day For PS5 And Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/build-shadow-the-hedgehogs-head-out-of-720-lego-bricks-for-only-56/1100-6525229/">Target's Exclusive Shadow The Hedgehog Lego Set Is Discounted Just Weeks After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/king-boos-haunted-mansion-lego-mario-set-gets-first-price-cut-at-amazon/1100-6525381/">King Boo's Haunted Mansion Lego Mario Set Gets First Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-official-art-books-are-b1g1-50-off-at-amazon-get-both-for-only-59/1100-6527378/">Elden Ring Official Art Books Are B1G1 50% Off At Amazon - Get Both For Only $59</a></li>   </ul> </div>

It’s an encouraging sign for the theme park expansion devoted to Mario’s first nemesis, the opening of which was <a href="https://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/202404/10170/">delayed earlier this year</a>. </p><p>Nintendo first confirmed that it was building the area, which will feature a mine cart rollercoaster ride, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697850/super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-area-confirmed">back in 2021</a>. Nintendo and Universal Studios showed the region off — or a digital render of it, anyway — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147170/universal-orlando-super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-country">earlier this year</a>, and confirmed that when the Orlando, Florida version of Super Nintendo World opens on May 22nd, 2025, it will have all of the same attractions as its Osaka counterpart.</p><p>As for Nintendo Switch 2 news, well, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276650/nintendo-switch-2-predictions-playtest-alarmo">don’t get your hopes up</a>. Nintendo says “no game information will be featured.”</p><p>Nintendo <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fsuper-nintendo-world-coming-to-universal-epic-universe-in-2025%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooX9dh_AxAr4vSXVvl_R98i8BzL8a7s9cwNfBDsFaQqD-G4lwG_">said in May</a> that Donkey Kong Country’s Mine-Cart Madness rollercoaster will have “jaw-dropping maneuvers” that include being “blasted out of a barrel, seemingly jumping over gaps as they speed along the rickety track.” And like other parts of the park, visitors can expect Donkey Kong-themed merchandise and interactive experiences. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Hitting the milestone unlocks a bevy of treats for all who pre-register.</p>

            <p>Over 30 million people have pre-registered for Infinity Nikki.</p>
<p>Consequently, Infold Games confirmed all registration milestones have been unlocked, meaning players across PC, PS5, and mobile devices will secure a four-star outfit, 20 Resonite Crystals, 300 Threads of Purity, and 50,000 Blings.</p>

<p>To mark the achievement, Infold dropped a new gameplay overview trailer subtitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54yRMWCF3hs">Unfold Your Whim</a>, "offering a glimpse into the journey ahead".</p>
<p>Infinity Nikki tasks players with collecting Whimstars and special outfits that give Nikki unique abilities.</p>
<p>"Each new ability allows Nikki to explore deeper, discover hidden paths, and interact with the vibrant open world around her," Infold teases. "Alongside her, Momo, her loyal companion, offers a camera feature for players to capture memorable moments throughout their adventure."</p>
<p>For some, this milestone may not be surprising. In August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-dress-up-adventure-from-legend-of-zelda-dev-has-over-12-million-pre-registrations">over 12 million of us had already signed up</a> for the "cosy open-world adventure" follow-up to the highly successful mobile series of dress-up games.</p>
<p>We still don't have a release date for Infinity Nikki yet, however when the time does come, it will be available across PlayStation and PC, alongside Android and iOS devices. In the meantime, you can still <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/news/2">sign up for the Infinity Nikki playtest here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Welcome to <em>Installer</em> No. 60, your guide to the best and <em>Verge</em>-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, it’s a lot of gaming stuff this week, and also you can read all the old editions at the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/installer-newsletter"><em>Installer</em> homepage</a>.)&nbsp;</p><p>This week, I’ve been… doomscrolling about the election, if I’m honest. But let’s not talk about that. I’ve also been reading about <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/11/11/the-shipwreck-detective?__readwiseLocation="><strong>shipwrecks</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/final-flight-airline-magazine-united-digital.php?__readwiseLocation="><strong>in-flight magazines</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-10-25/influencer-brothers-are-selling-more-baseball-bats-than-pro-athletes"><strong>baseball bat influencers</strong></a>, making a bunch of lists in <a href="https://listy.is/"><strong>Listy</strong></a><strong>, </strong>dusting off my <a href="https://bsky.app/"><strong>Bluesky</strong></a> account as Threads becomes increasingly worse,<strong> </strong>logging a surprising number of hours in VR with <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/batman-arkham-shadow/3551691271620960/"><em><strong>Batman: Arkham Shadow</strong></em></a>, playing with tasks and notes in the <a href="https://www.craft.do/"><strong>Craft</strong></a> beta, seeing if I can replace Gmail with <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/mobile/"><strong>Thunderbird for Android</strong></a>, and trying really, really hard to convince myself I don’t need a new <a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?subId1=VergeInstaller110824&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmac-mini%2F"><strong>Mac Mini</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I also have for you a couple of new games to play this weekend, some fun stuff to watch, a nifty new way for Mac users to take notes, and more. And I have some ideas for everyone looking for a place to put all their articles, newsletters, and other online stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, housekeeping note: <strong><em>Installer</em>’s off next week</strong>. We have some planning meetings going on, and also, honestly, this is one of the driest times of the year when it comes to new stuff. I’ll be back with a big issue in two weeks ahead of Thanksgiving, and then we have some fun plans through the rest of the year.</p><p>All right, it’s a lot of games this week. Which feels right. Let’s go.</p><p>(As always, the best part of <em>Installer</em> is your ideas and tips. What are you comfort watching this week? What have you been playing / reading / downloading / baking that everyone else should know about, too? Tell me everything: <a href="mailto:installer@theverge.com">installer@theverge.com</a>. And if you know someone else who might enjoy <em>Installer</em>, tell them to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/installer-newsletter-sign-up">subscribe here</a>.)</p><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p> / <span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div><p><h3>The Drop</h3></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fmario-and-luigi-brothership-switch%2F"><em><strong>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>It feels like we get a fun new Mario game like every two weeks these days. And I’m not complaining! I’m into the teamwork-y vibe of this one — and the amount of pure unadulterated exploring it asks you to do.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/275103-game-changers"><em><strong>Game Changers</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> The first two episodes of this new Discovery series tell the story of two of my favorite things in gaming: Nintendo and Madden. There are also episodes coming about <em>Call of Duty, </em>Scrabble<em>,</em> and other iconic games. The nostalgia is through the roof with this one. <em>&nbsp;</em></li><li><a href="https://www.raycast.com/blog/raycast-notes"><strong>Raycast Notes</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Raycast has become one of my most-used Mac apps: it’s a launcher, a clipboard manager, a window reorder-er, and a million other things. Its built-in notes app just got a big upgrade —&nbsp;it’s as simple as opening a text file but much more powerful.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://nytimesguild.org/tech/guild-builds/index.html"><strong>Guild Builds</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289937/nyt-tech-workers-strike-games-wordle">striking <em>New York Times </em>tech workers</a> created a pretty fun set of games you can play instead of <em>Wordle </em>this week. <em>Match Strike </em>is hilarious and fun, as is <em>Scabby’s Fair Contract Builder. </em>Who knew you could build a good game that’s also a sick burn against your boss?</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1138194-heretic?language=en-US"><em><strong>Heretic</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>I’ve been excited for this movie ever since I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24241767/heretic-review-a24-hugh-grant">read Andrew Webster’s review</a>, which confirmed that Hugh Grant can be as terrifying as he is charming. Plus, a bad guy you can describe as “a theological debate bro?” I’m in.</li><li><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/9000-series/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d.html"><strong>The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This CPU is power-hungry and expensive, but Tom Warren called it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24288948/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">the best gaming CPU on the market</a>, and that is no small feat. If you’re building a gaming PC this holiday season, this is where to start.</li><li><a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/blog/"><strong><em>Stardew Valley</em> 1.6.9</strong></a><strong>. </strong>I have heard from a <em>lot </em>of folks who retreated into <em>Stardew Valley </em>this week as a reprieve from the real world. The newest update adds new items, the ability to retrieve things you’ve dropped in water, and lots of other useful and delightful changes.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/274413-countdown-paul-vs-tyson"><em><strong>Countdown: Paul vs. Tyson</strong></em></a><strong>. </strong>Look, I’m not proud of the fact that I’m fascinated by next week’s Tyson / Paul fight. Is it even a real fight? Is it all a bit? Who knows! But leave it to Netflix to milk it for all its worth; I bet you $10 this series will be more fun and dramatic than the fight itself.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/940139-here"><em><strong>Here</strong></em></a><em><strong>. </strong></em>By most accounts, this movie is bad. But director Robert Zemeckis did some fascinating and AI-forward work to de-age Tom Hanks and Robin Wright in order to make the movie work, and I’ve enjoyed the way all three have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/movies/tom-hanks-robin-wright-here-forrest-gump.html">talked about the process</a>. This feels like a movie we’ll remember in the story of AI filmmaking.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/videos/"><strong>Google Vids</strong></a><strong>. </strong>The pitch for Vids — “what if making a video were as easy as making a Google Doc?” — is a really clever one. And now, months after Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24124168/google-vids-video-ai-workspace-app">first announced the app</a>, you can give it a whirl. Send me all the weird stuff you make!</li></ul></div><p><h3>Group project</h3></p><p>Last week, a lot of you reached out saying you were bummed to see that <a href="https://omnivore.app/"><strong>Omnivore</strong></a>, a really great app for reading articles, newsletters, and other stuff, <a href="https://blog.omnivore.app/p/details-on-omnivore-shutting-down">was shutting down</a>. I was bummed, too! I’ve recommended Omnivore to a lot of people and really liked the app. (PSA, by the way: if you’re still using Omnivore, you only have a few more weeks to get your stuff out.)&nbsp;</p><p>Now, a bunch of us are stuck trying to figure out where to go. So I asked you all to share what you need most in an app like this —&nbsp;and lots of you did! Thanks, as always, to everyone who reached out with thoughts and recommendations. I think I have a pretty good sense of what we’re all looking for, so let me try and recommend a few things.&nbsp;</p><div><ul><li>If all you need is a place to save articles and read them later, you have lots of options. <a href="https://readwise.io/read"><strong>Readwise Reader</strong></a> is the most powerful (and the only one that also does RSS and newsletters), but it’s also $8 a month. <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/"><strong>Matter</strong></a> is a lovely app but is mostly Apple-only. <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/"><strong>Instapaper</strong></a> is a great option and works across basically all platforms — it’s probably the one I’d recommend to most people. <a href="https://getpocket.com/home"><strong>Pocket</strong></a> is solid, too, but I just don’t like the interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>If you want something a little more open and versatile, I’d go with an RSS tool. I use <a href="https://feedbin.com/"><strong>Feedbin</strong></a>, which I love. <a href="https://feedly.com/"><strong>Feedly</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.newsblur.com/?next=premium"><strong>NewsBlur</strong></a> are also good for this kind of thing. All three give you an email address you can use to subscribe to newsletters and a way to manually save a page to your reader.</li><li>If you’re trying to build more of a database of stuff that you can search through later, I’d start with a bookmarking tool. <a href="https://raindrop.io/"><strong>Raindrop</strong></a> is my go-to, but if you’re an Apple user, there’s also <a href="https://goodlinks.app/"><strong>GoodLinks</strong></a> and <a href="https://anybox.app/"><strong>Anybox</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.plinky.app/"><strong>Plinky</strong></a>. You can also use an app like <a href="https://obsidian.md/"><strong>Obsidian</strong></a>, with its web clipper, to turn webpages into text files.</li><li>If you want something that will truly last forever, the best move is to host something yourself. A few of you recommended apps like <a href="https://wallabag.org/"><strong>Wallabag</strong></a>, <a href="https://linkwarden.app/"><strong>Linkwarden</strong></a>, and <a href="https://linkding.link/"><strong>Linkding</strong></a>, and if you’re willing to do the work, this is the most durable option by far. There are some folks working on <a href="https://github.com/omnivore-app/omnivore/pull/4465"><strong>ways to self-host Omnivore</strong></a>, too, so keep an eye on that.</li></ul></div><p>The best answer for most people, I think, is to use an RSS reader like Feedbin to compile all your incoming stuff and then a read-later app like Instapaper to go through your reading list. Readwise Reader is the closest thing I’ve found to Omnivore’s all-in-one capability, and it’s definitely the one I’d recommend to people looking for a one-to-one replacement, but you’ll pay pretty handsomely for it. Maybe Omnivore was too good to be true this whole time.</p><p><h3>Screen share</h3></p><p>I’ve been listening to Brian McCullough talk for a <em>really </em>long time. I think I first encountered his work on the <a href="https://www.internethistorypodcast.com/"><em><strong>Internet History Podcast</strong></em></a>, which is like a treasure trove of early Silicon Valley stories. He also hosts the <a href="https://www.ridehome.info/show/techmeme-ride-home/"><em><strong>Techmeme Ride Home</strong></em></a> podcast, which is an awesome way to get daily tech news. And more recently, I’ve been listening to his newest show, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG053d_xzCEervxkoBeZR1w"><em><strong>RAD! 80s90s History</strong></em></a><em>. </em>(I might even be on that show in a few weeks… stay tuned.) And in addition to all that, McCullough is a general partner at the <a href="https://www.ridehomefund.com/"><strong>Ride Home Fund</strong></a>, investing in tech companies. Busy guy, that Brian.</p><p>I asked Brian to share his homescreen to see if we might learn how he manages it all. Here it is, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:</p><p><strong>The phone: </strong>An iPhone 16 Pro. For the first time in my life of using iPhones, I have a case on it,&nbsp; because my son dropped my previous one twice and shattered the front and back glass. I wouldn’t have upgraded this year except for that. So, lesson learned. <em>Kids</em>.</p><p><strong>The wallpaper: </strong>The wallpaper is a picture I took some night on Prospect Park West years ago. The lockscreen is obviously an old iPod interface, my favorite version of the iPod. I bought it from some collection of wallpapers about a year ago. Can’t remember where from, though.</p><p><strong>The apps: </strong>Phone, Fantastical, Apple Maps, Settings, Slack, Microsoft Word, Shopify, Citi Bike, Audible, Microsoft OneNote, Carrot Weather, Amazon, Jersey Mike’s, Wallet, Tovala, Threads, X, York, Claude, Messages, Overcast, Safari, Superhuman.</p><p>I’m fairly basic with the apps, as you can see. Apps to get news from, like Threads and Twitter. Slack for work. Superhuman for email.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve totally moved over to <a href="https://claude.ai/login?returnTo=/?"><strong>Claude</strong></a> in the last few months thanks to <a href="https://www.bigtechnology.com/"><strong>Alex Kantrowitz</strong></a> evangelizing it to me constantly. So much so that I’ve canceled my OpenAI subscription. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tovala.com%2Fsmart-ovens"><strong>Tovala</strong></a> is a smart oven / meal plan company that I’ve been using religiously since the pandemic. Basically my lunch every single day is a Tovala meal. <a href="https://www.jerseymikes.com/mobile-app"><strong>Jersey Mike’s</strong></a> finally came to Park Slope and so that’s also a meal go-to. I use <a href="https://citibikenyc.com/how-it-works/app"><strong>Citi Bike</strong></a> once or twice a day.&nbsp;</p><p>The app that says “York” is interesting. That’s my subway stop for my office in Dumbo. This random dude made this thing that you can get at <a href="https://nextstop.nyc/"><strong>Nextstop.nyc</strong></a>. Basically, it gives you real-time train times for whatever subway stops you use all the time, and then you put an icon for that on your phone. IT. IS. AMAZING. It is insane that, 20 years into my living in NYC, it took this long for someone to do this right. “I’m about to leave the office, when is the next train? Should I leave now or wait five minutes?” Amazing.</p><p><em>I also asked Brian to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back:</em></p><div><ul><li>My kids and I are playing tons of <a href="https://pouncelight.games/tiny-glade/"><em><strong>Tiny Glade</strong></em></a>. “Relaxing” game that can also be super complex and sophisticated if you put in the time. It’s like <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us"><em><strong>Minecraft</strong></em></a> in that way, but with a sort of romanticist feel.&nbsp;</li><li>The book I’m obsessed with right now is Rick Atkinson’s <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781627790437/thebritisharecoming"><em><strong>The British Are Coming</strong></em></a>. I’ve read Rick’s other books about the US Army in World War II, but he has a new series about the American Army in the Revolutionary War. It’s amazing and detailed like all of Rick’s books, but full of stuff I didn’t know. Like, the battle of Lexington and Concord: oh, Paul Revere, the British go and try to shut down a weapons depot and the minutemen take potshots at them? Oh no. WAY more bloody than that. Like hundreds of people died on both sides. Savage fighting. Very interesting stuff. I’m almost to the Battle of Brooklyn and can’t wait.&nbsp;</li><li>I rewatched <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/379-miller-s-crossing?language=en-US"><em><strong>Miller’s Crossing</strong></em></a> a few nights ago, and god damn if that movie isn’t the most underrated and underseen of the whole Coen filmography.</li><li>I’m looking forward to the next book in Brandon Sanderson’s Stormlight Archive series, which is coming next month: <a href="https://read.macmillan.com/torforge/the-stormlight-archive/"><em><strong>Wind and Truth</strong></em></a>. Even though the previous book in the series was pretty boring.</li></ul></div><p><h3>Crowdsourced</h3></p><p><em>Here’s what the </em>Installer<em> community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email </em><a href="mailto:installer@theverge.com"><em>installer@theverge.com</em></a><em> or message me on Signal —&nbsp;@davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For even more great recommendations, check out the replies to </em><a href="https://www.threads.net/@imdavidpierce/post/DCEt4_OxA0i?xmt=AQGzBRHBqj-VXhiRBNEjVovPPqhGlquH1fleLtygHVPXLA"><em>this post on Threads</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>“<a href="https://superfan.nyc/"><strong>Superfan</strong></a>. A beautiful app to keep tabs on ongoing sports events and matches.” – Karan</p><p>“I’ve been using this little-known news app called <a href="https://info.adarga.ai/panoptic"><strong>Adarga Panoptic</strong></a>. Has this interesting take on the news where it’s provided through the lens of a person’s perspective rather than just headlines. Content is a bit limited, but with some added customization options, this could be a really cool way to see the news differently.” –&nbsp;Alen</p><p>“<a href="https://www.scribenotes.io/"><strong>Scribe Notes</strong></a>. It’s like Whisper Memos but has more features. Sort of like Cleft but cheaper. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and I love it. Helps me get my scrambled thoughts and to-dos out of my head and into a place where I can make sense of them all.” –&nbsp;David</p><p>“Check out the <a href="https://www.mobapad.com/products/mobapad-m6-hd"><strong>Mobapad M6 HD</strong></a> for the Nintendo Switch! It’s a Joy-Con alternative that has ergonomic grips, Hall effect joysticks, and gyro and HD rumble. It essentially has every feature of the Joy-Cons, but they’re actually comfy to hold. The buttons are a little clicky, and the travel case is almost as bulky as my Steam Deck, but it’s definitely the most comfortable and feature-packed Joy-Con alternative I’ve found. I picked one up on a recent trip to Hong Kong, and it completely changed my Switch playing experience.” –&nbsp;Kevin</p><p>“I’ve been keeping an eye on an app called <a href="https://openvibe.social/"><strong>Openvibe</strong></a>. It’s able to aggregate your Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon (and Nostr, too, if you’re into that kind of thing) feeds into a single feed you can scroll. The home feed algorithm is hit or miss, but the trending feed is great, especially because it’s not something Mastodon or Bluesky have natively. Also, it lets you cross-post to all four networks for free!” –&nbsp;Drake</p><p>“Winter is looming, so I got myself a <a href="https://us.zwift.com/collections/all/products/zwift-ride-kickr-core?variant=45155409920256"><strong>Zwift Ride</strong></a> smart bike for days when running outside just isn’t a great idea. Great hardware. The app feels older than it is, but the gamification kinda works. More fun than staring at the wall!” –&nbsp;Robert</p><p>“With *gestures around wildly* going on, I’m pouring less of my time into social media and more into a personal blog using a great service called <a href="https://pika.page/"><strong>Pika</strong></a>. It’s dead simple to set up and I love how barebones it is.” – Kaleb</p><p>“Started collecting sports cards, primarily NFL. It’s not something I’ve thought about since I was 14, but it has been a fun distraction. These are two great YouTube channels to get into: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarketMovers"><strong>Market Movers</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SportsCardInvestor"><strong>Sports Card Investor</strong></a>. And getting in on “breaks” on <a href="https://www.whatnot.com/"><strong>Whatnot</strong></a>, where you buy into a live box opening, is some fun entertainment.” –&nbsp;Travis</p><p>“I’ve been reading <a href="https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/richard-ii/"><em><strong>Richard II</strong></em></a>, which feels of a piece with the moment, and due to which I discovered how much more complicated sideloading a Gutenberg ebook to a Kindle is than it should be. The right format wasn’t the one labeled for Kindles!” –&nbsp;Jeanne</p><p>“I’ve been playing a lot of <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/maestro/6963344583787383/"><em><strong>Maestro</strong></em></a> lately on my Quest 2. It’s such an amazing and immersive experience. If you ever wanted to feel like an orchestra conductor, this is as close as you can get (unless you’re an actual orchestra conductor, in which case, congrats, such a cool job!).” –&nbsp;Gonzalo</p><p><h3>Signing off</h3></p><p>So I have this Apple Watch. It’s fine, I like it, whatever, but I’d rather wear another watch. So I went down a YouTube rabbit hole: can you turn an Apple Watch into a standalone, pocketable device that works even when it’s not on your wrist? Turns out, you can! There are a lot of good ideas out there, but I’m basically just following the ideas in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tzvmRp1EJY"><strong>this video from Jose Briones</strong></a><strong>. </strong>(I’m also intrigued by the <a href="https://thetinypod.com/"><strong>TinyPod</strong></a>, but that one doesn’t <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rJa-0YOkwk">seem to be very good</a>.) I’m turning my Watch into basically a teeny-tiny iPod and backup communications device that I carry around like a pocket watch. It’s silly, but it’s fun. And it works!&nbsp;</p><p>See you in two weeks!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Mark your calendars! Black Myth: Wukong arrives in physical form on 12th December, 2024!" PM Studios posted to X/Twitter.</p>
<p>Asked if that date also applied to UK purchases, PM Studios simply replied: "Yep!", then <a href="https://x.com/PMStudiosUSA/status/1854923502605783056">confirmed</a> the same release date for players in Europe.</p> <div>

<p>At the time of writing, it's unclear if the physical edition will ship with any accompanying goodies, such as an instruction manual, but it has been confirmed that it includes the "deluxe edition upgrade" as well as the base game.</p>
<p>The deluxe edition includes the Bronzecloud Staff weapon, Wind Chimes curio, and the Folk Opera armour set. You'll also get a "selected" digital soundtrack.</p>
<p>Microsoft has again confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delay to the Xbox release of Black Myth: Wukong</a> is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">not due to "platform limitations"</a>.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong was released in August on PC and PS5, but the Xbox version was delayed for an unknown reason. Speculation grew the developer was struggling to run the game on the Series S console, while other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">rumours suggested the game was, in fact, a PlayStation console exclusive</a>.</p>
<p>A representative from Microsoft has now confirmed the game is still on the way, though it won't comment "on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-its-dominance-with-new-milestone">Black Myth: Wukong had already sold 10m copies</a> after just three days on sale, even without an Xbox version.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro's modest CPU upgrade, only 10% better than the CPU powering the base model, is the system's primary limitation that continues to impact CPU-bound games such as Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>In their in-depth analysis of the mid-generation refresh system released a few days back, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> went over the console's CPU and how it impacts the performance of both unpatched and PS5 Pro Enhanced games. Unpatched games such as Cyberpunk 2077 do see a small performance improvement in line with the 10% CPU improvement over the base model, but still cannot keep a steady 60 FPS framerate. The situation is not much different in patched games like Baldur's Gate 3, which still struggles to run smoothly in the city of Baldur's Gate, one of the game's most CPU-intensive scenarios, even on the PlayStation 5 Pro, although it does run slightly better than on the base model. At the end of the day, the console still delivers as a mid-generation refresh, but its dated Zen2 CPU falls behind today's mainstream CPUs in the gaming space, which deliver way better performance.</p>

<p>Another limitation that the PlayStation 5 Pro shared with the base model is 4K, 120Hz output, which is still limited by the HDMI controller. In turn, this also somewhat compromises 8K output, although the limited adoption of 8K display and games supporting the resolution makes it less of an issue.</p>

<p>Digital Foundry also took a good look at the PlayStation 5 Pro's PS4 Image Enhancement feature, which brings a variety of improvements to PlayStation 4 games. This feature is a post-processing upscaling filter likely using machine learning, which reportedly only applies to games that render to up to 1080p resolution, improving details. Unfortunately, this feature doesn't improve antialiasing in any way, so games with AA issues continue to have them. In addition, it does seem to impact performance in some titles and causes visual glitches in others. Overall, this feature seems to be a preview of future backward compatibility that will bring some visual improvements with upscaling and very little additional work.</p>

			<p>I don’t think it’s especially controversial to say that Dragon Age: Inquisition sort of sucked. Well, it wasn’t bad – it did win a bunch of Game of the Year awards – but it certainly fell short of the first two games, and the open-world take on the game ended up being a painful slog of side-quests and wasted time. It wasn’t bad, but I never felt like it did the series justice. I’m pretty happy, then, that Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a far more focused affair, with a generally faster pace, and open zones rather than full open-world gameplay. It’s so much better, and while it’s not perfect, it does feel like a return to form for the series and for Bioware as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdtmtuzICOI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Things kick off really fast, with you being introduced to Rook, your character, as they’re going into a bar to try and meet one of their companions. Things don’t quite go according to plan, and you soon find yourself instead teaming up with the familiar old face of Varric. Not that this really improves matters as things continue to go south, one thing leading to another, some ancient Elven gods getting released, and it now being your job to try and un-release them. Classic RPG stuff, really.</p>


<p>The trials and tribulations that you’ll have to navigate on The Veilguard’s overarching quest will often have you battling your way through demons and blightspawn. So it’s a pretty good thing that the combat is an absolute blast, letting you easily switch between two weapons, regardless of the class that you settle on. As a mage, that meant switching between a magical staff, and an orb and dagger combo that let me cause miniature explosions.</p>


<p>Levelling up naturally gains your character new abilities, and you can easily respec within your class if you want to try out a different build, which is nice, though you’re locked into your overall class from the beginning. You don’t get to test the classes out before deciding what to be, just watch a video showing what they can do. Would it kill big old RPGs to allow us to test the classes for a bit? At the very least, there’s only three fighting classes – rogue, mage or warrior – and they’re broad enough that you should know what you want to be.</p>
<p>Of course, you’re not going to go alone – that’d be dangerous, wouldn’t it? Two companion characters can go into battle with you. Dragon Age has changed a lot since the original game, and with the more action-heavy combat, BioWare has scaled back the control you have over the rest of the party, now more about ordering and using their abilities to the fullest. It’s a simple system to use through the ability wheel and feels incredibly smooth, allowing you to feel like you’re half-controlling your whole crew.</p>
<p>While we’re talking companions, gosh, it’s a good group. The mix of characters here is very good, and you’re bound to find a couple of characters you like spending time with, and writing and performances that you’ll enjoy. I was a big fan of Neve, mostly, and her general “Sherlock Holmes but fantasy” vibe was incredibly cool to play along with. This helped a lot as, during the character creation process, I chose to be from the Shadow Dragon faction, which Neve and I had in common. I do feel as though I preferred the options in Dragon Age 2 overall, mostly because of Isabela, but it’s still a good bunch to mesh with this time around.</p>

<p>And the writing is mostly good throughout the game… mostly. It lacks the same backwards-facing decisions as the original trilogy, which is something of a shame, and the way that your decisions in The Veilguard impact the world and your team tends to be a lot more immediate. It’s more immediate that way, letting you know what’s going down straight away, but is another shift for the series.</p>
<p>In the moment-to-moment, though, there’s a weird, uncanny feeling that permeates a lot of the general chatter between characters. It feels like Iron Man or Loki could pop out at any given moment; it’s all just a bit Marvel. There are quips, and a vibe that just doesn’t quite mesh with the high fantasy feel, and which feels rooted in scriptwriting trends that felt played-out half a decade ago. That’s my main gripe though – and specifically with Bellara, who was the biggest offender on this front – and plenty of you will enjoy having that style of conversation sprinkled throughout.</p>
