<p>Call of Duty: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> is bringing a plethora of new content to the game, from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-maelstorm-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new weapons</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-details-on-new-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-maps-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps</a> to a huge overhaul for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> and an exciting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a>.</p>



<p>On top of all that, Zombies fans will be excited to hear that a new map is also on the way – Citadelle des Morts. For those eager to find out more about the new BO6 Zombies map, here’s everything you need to know, including its release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-the-new-bo6-zombies-map-have-a-release-date">Does the new BO6 Zombies map have a release date?</h2>



<p>Citadelle des Morts will arrive in the <strong>mid-season update for Black Ops 6 Season 1</strong>. As the new season arrived on November 14, and seasons tend to last around 8 weeks, we expect the Season 1 Reloaded update to arrive on <strong>Thursday, December 12, 2024</strong>.</p>



<p>Take this with a pinch of salt, as this is just speculation and not an official release date. Once Treyarch confirm the date for the mid-season update, we’ll be sure to let you know exactly when the new Zombies map will be arriving.</p>

<h2 id="h-citadelle-des-morts-map-details">Citadelle des Morts map details</h2>



<p>Citadelle des Morts (Citadel of the Dead) is a <strong>round-based Black Ops 6 Zombies map that’s located in Europe</strong>, specifically the Principality of Avalon. It’s an <strong>abandoned medieval castle</strong> that is host to ghoulish horrors and hidden secrets. We don’t know many details, but from the teaser image, we expect the map to be fairly big.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Citadelle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD blog</a>, players will take control of the BO6 Zombies crew, <strong>Weaver, Maya, Carver, and Grey, directly after the events of Terminus</strong>.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time players have fought waves of the undead in a castle, as Black Ops 3 brought Der Eisendrache. Hopefully, Citadelle des Morts can live up to the setting, as Der Eisendrache is one of the most beloved maps of all time.</p>



<p>The new map also arrives alongside a new Perk, Wonder Weapon, Gobblegums, Augments, and enemy types.</p>

Black Dragon is Mortal Kombat’s mercenary clan headed up at various points (the timeline is pretty complicated!) by fan-favorites Kabal and Kano. The lore justification here is Ghostface has been transported to Lui Kang's timeline without his partners from the movies, so recruits two members of the Black Dragon clan to help him out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, Ghostface is actually three characters in one. You can switch to temporarily playing as The Enforcer or The Assassin by holding a button during certain moves. You can tell them apart by their knives, if you look closely. You get 12 seconds to play as an alternative Ghostface before you revert back to the OG, or your opponent lands a hit and triggers the OG to come running back in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have analyzed The Enforcer and The Assassin’s unique movesets for hints at the Black Dragon characters’ true identities. Already, there are two outstanding suggestions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for the identity of Ghostface in Mortal Kombat 1 follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat fans have identified moves that are directly related to Kobra (Enforcer) and Kira (Assassin), two human Black Dragon members who each made their debut in 2004’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-deception">Mortal Kombat: Deception</a>. We also see Assassin do Kano’s famous roll attack, but Kira does this move as well in both Deception and 2006’s Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. As you can see from the movesets, this one looks nailed on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to this revelation has been positive, not only because it’s a clever way of bringing back two rather obscure Mortal Kombat characters that perhaps would never have seen the light of day otherwise, but also because it leaves the door open for other, perhaps more wanted characters to appear as Kameos or even fleshed out DLC characters with a potential, but so far unannounced Kombat Pack 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Ghostface, the OG version is voiced by Roger L. Jackson, who has voiced the character throughout the Scream franchise. Ghostface joins the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on November 19 as part of the early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners, followed by wide availability for purchase on November 26. Up next is Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 Terminator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

</p>
<p>

</p>

This latest entry boasts involvement from Nintendo veteran Kentaro Tominaga, who worked for 20 years at the Mario maker and served as game designer on Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
</p>
<p>
Infold's hopes for this new entry are clearly high, with a worldwide marketing push and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-tops-30m-registrations-and-its-not-even-out-yet">30m registrations for Infinity Nikki</a> already under its brightly-coloured belt. And yes, that is Jessie J singing the song for the game's trailer, above.
</p>
<p>
Infinity Nikki's smartphone predecessor Shining Nikki was downloaded 100m times, though was the subject of a cultural spat in South Korea over traditional costumes - leading to the game's Korean version being pulled, and criticism of the developer's handling of the issue.
</p><p>
At Nintendo, Tominaga served as assistant director on GameCube classics such as Zelda: The Wind Waker, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-twilight-princess">Twilight Princess</a> and Mario Kart: Double Dash. More recently, he worked on Zelda: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-link-between-worlds">A Link Between Worlds</a> and received a special thanks credit in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.

            <p>
There's a lot to love about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, but one of its most impressive and remarked-upon technical aspects is undoubtedly its advanced rendering of characters' hair. 
</p>
<p>
Hairstyles move and sway naturally as you and your party walk, while long hair streams out behind as you run. Your whole hairdo reacts if you are impacted by a sudden force or object.
</p>
<p>
There are up to 50,000 strands of hair on each of Dragon Age: The Veilguard's main characters, powered by something BioWare and EA's Frostbite engine team call Strand Hair technology. It's something originally worked upon for EA Sports FC, but which has been expanded upon greatly here.

<figcaption>Here's a video version of our Dragon Age: The Veilguard review.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f0BX-JXzek" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>

<p>
"While Strand Hair is present in other EA games, the BioWare team had to push the limits even further for Dragon Age: The Veilguard," EA writes in a new deep-dive <a href="https://www.ea.com/technology/news/strand-hair-dragon-age-the-veilguard">blog post</a> on Stand Hair. "For example, implementing Strand Hair technology for characters who have waist-length hair with horns on their head presented some unique challenges.
</p><p>
"With hair attachments that move seamlessly, and the decoupling of simulation and render tessellation, this is the first EA game to offer such detailed physics-driven long hairstyles. The Frostbite team increased maximum hair length from 63 points to 255, and implemented a new system for complex hair structures like braids."
</p>
<p>
Tomb Raider's TressFX eat your heart out.
</p>
<p>
There's some detailed technical notes on how it all works, though perhaps the most interesting bit here is how BioWare had to overcome difficulties dealing with the wealth of other semi-transparent objects on screen. In EA Sports FC, this hadn't been much of an issue. Here, in scenes frequently enveloped in fog, smog or fire, it was. 
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, BioWare developed a system where each hairdo is rendered multiple times, with opaque and transparent layers rendered and then blended on the fly.
</p>
<p>
"We first render the opaque part of strand hair, and then we render transparent objects," BioWare's senior rendering engineer James Power noted. "The shaders for the transparent objects use the transparent hair depth texture to determine whether the shading pixel is 'under' or 'on top' of the strand hair. If it's below, it renders the hair and marks a stencil bit (think of it as a masking texture)."
</p>

</figure>
<p>
There's discussion here too of how Strand Hair's "high memory footprint" is handled without degrading the performance. Dragon Age The Veilguard was never going to have a full squad of 22 characters on-screen all with Strand Hair at once, as is the case in EA Sports FC. But the added complexity of longer hair and more technical environments mean BioWare needed ways to adjust memory usage when multiple characters are shown.
</p>
<p>
For lower quality settings on PC, as well as Xbox Series S, the ability to ditch Strand Hair for more standard hairdo assets is also supported.

		<p>A long-awaited update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-vermintide-2">Warhammer: Verminitde 2</a> is here, with the Versus PvP mode now available to play after a free update. Not only that, but Fatshark has announced another free DLC level pack, Verminous Dreams, will be released starting in December.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer: Vermintide 2 - Versus PvP Mode | Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lpzON3pVSO8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Versus play has been a much requested feature in the Vermintide community, given how close in style it is to Left 4 Dead, which had an excellent take on PvP play.</p>
<p>That’s roughly what has been translated to Vermintide 2, with two teams of four facing off against each other, taking turns to play as the Ubersreik Five heroes and the Pactsworn, giving players five Skaven beasts to choose from, each of which has a specific ability – you’ll know them as the special enemies that you regularly face off against in PvE.</p>
<p>There’s a new set of challenges and rewards to go alongside this, designed specifically for and earned through playing Versus, but letting you show off in other modes as well.</p>

<p>Fatshark has also revealed that a new free DLC pack, Verminous Dreams, will be added to the game. This will feature three new levels, the first of which arrives for all platforms on 9th December, with the remaining two levels coming in early 2025.</p>

<p>While it originally launched in 2018 for PC, and has now been followed by the sci-fi fuelled Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, Vermintide 2 has remained a fun co-op staple. We revisited Vermintide 2 back in 2022 and had a fantastic time once again. Jim said:</p>
<p>“Overall, Vermintide 2 offers a brilliant core game bolstered by years of updates, content, and support from its developers. That kind of passion hasn’t gone unnoticed by the Warhammer community, who eagerly await what may be coming next for the series. That said, those hoping to see Vermintide 3 in the near future may have a long wait ahead of them with Fatshark currently focusing its efforts on taking their four player co-op formula to the far future in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/15/warhammer-40000-darktide-delayed-until-2022/">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>. The team is no doubt hoping lightning will strike twice as they leave the fantasy world behind for this grimdark sci-fi setting.”</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-2-remake-coming-to-iphone-in-december/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-2-remake-is-coming-to-iphone-15-pro-entire-iphone-16-lineup-on-december-10-with-compatibility-for-select-ipads-and-macs.1035558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-2-remake-coming-to-iphone-in-december/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest models of the iPhone are pretty capable when it comes to handling high-end games, and developers are working to take full advantage of Apple's A17 Pro and A18 Pro chips. We are now hearing that Capcom is readying its Resident Evil 2 remake for the iPhone and iPad, with the release date set for December 10, possibly a day after the company releases iOS 18.2 to the public.</p>

<p>To be precise, it will be Capcom's fourth Resident Evil game for the iPhone and iPad and only one of the few AAA games you can play on your iOS or iPadOS device. When Apple announced on stage that it would bring PC games to the iPhone, people presumed that the company would port the titles to a more handheld version. However, the capability of the iPhone's latest chips has proved to be more significant than we previously expected.</p>
<p>The company released a full-fledged version of the PC game for the iPhone and not a stripped-down 'lite' version. The games were brought to the mobile experience without any cuts or edits, and they remained the same as they were on PCs or consoles. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-a17-pro-gpu-features-ray-tracing-metalfx-upscaling-resident-evil-iv-remake-village-assassins-creed-mirage-coming-to-iphones/">Assasin's Creed Mirage</a> was another title that made headlines when the company offered it on the iPhone with full controller support and stunning visuals.</p>
<p>Capcom has confirmed that the Resident Evil 2 remake will be released on iPhone on December 10. At this stage, the company did not mention how much the game would cost, but it did say that it would be just like other titles. You will be able to download the game free from the App Store and play the trial version absolutely free of charge. If you wish to continue playing and move out of the demo version, you must buy the full game.</p>
<p>If we presume that Capcom remains true to its words, we can expect the price of the Resident Evil 2 remake to be between $19.99 and 59.99, similar to its existing titles. If you are excited to play the popular title on your mobile device, it is worth noting that only the latest iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models will be compatible, along with last year's iPhone 15 Pro models with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ipad-mini-7-decent-gaming-tablet-for-running-resident-evil-4-remake/">A17 Pro chip</a>. If you have a compatible iPad or Mac, you will still be able to enjoy the game and make use of cross-progression to continue where you left off on another device.</p>
<p>You can register for Resident Evil 2 on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resident-evil-2/id1640632432">App Store</a> right now. We will let you guys know when the title hits the App Store. We will be covering the performance of the game on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, so be sure to keep an eye out.</p>

            <p>Epic Games has given the OK for their 1998 shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unreal">Unreal</a> to be hosted on the Internet Archive, essentially making the classic sci-fi alien blaster free, and preserving it for the future. They've also given the same permission for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> to be hosted there too, making free the multiplayer muckabout that spawned speedier and speedier sequels throughout the early 2000s (not to mention the origin of one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-making-of-facing-worlds-unreal-tournaments-most-popular-map">most memorable multiplayer FPS maps of all time</a>, Facing Worlds). </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Epic gave permission for this very recently, say fan group Old Unreal (as spotted by the folks on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-gives-the-thumbs-up-to-archive-org-copies-of-unreal-gold-and-unreal-tournament-goty-free-to-download-for-all.1035414/">ResetEra</a>). That fan site are leading the way in making the now-free games easier to download and install. Archive.org is great, but it's not always the most user friendly of libraries. So the gang of Skaarj custodians have created two installers that will do everything for you. Here's <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/unreal/full-game-installers/">one for Unreal Gold</a> and <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/unrealtournament/full-game-installers/">one for Unreal Tournament</a>. </p>
<p>These basically slurp the .iso files from the Internet Archive's server and run everything necessary to get the games installed on modern machines. I tested it for Unreal Tournament and, yup, everything looks lovely. You'll still need to do some extra steps to play online with others, though, say the Old Unreal gang. </p>
<p>Epic Games delisted the first Unreal from Steam a couple of years ago, along with all other Unreal games. The reasons for this are obvious, considering Epic has its own store that directly competes with Steam. It still annoyed some people though. Maybe now that two of these games are totally free, no questions asked, that move can be forgiven. We are recently seeing some moves here and there towards game preservation, such as GOG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">renewing their vows to making classic games playable on modern PCs</a>. And this isn't the first time Epic gave their original shootso <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unreal-free-for-20th-birthday">away for free</a> (although that was a temporary birthday celebration). But yes. All this is generally good. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">Free games</a> are good.</p><p>Unreal, for its part, was an important and impressive bit of blastin' at the time of release. It scared me to death. But that's okay, I confronted those fears years later by asking various members of the development team <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unreal-retrospective-from-the-people-who-made-it">what it was like to make back in 1998</a>. Short answer? People worked 70-80 hour work weeks, and made some nice alien cows. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-dont-sleep-on-the-fight-wisely-auto-battle-option/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since the original release of the fourth entry in the series, the Dragon Quest franchise has featured some auto-battle options that let the AI take control of party members and fight enemies in place of the player. While the AI programming has always been on the simple side, it has always worked surprisingly well, so much so that auto-battle options were later implemented in the remakes of the first three entries in the series, working as nicely as they did in the games that were developed with the feature in mind.</p>
<p>As such, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> unsurprisingly features some auto-battle options called Tactics that allow the player to focus on following the story and exploring the world and let the AI handle the fighting. While some players may scoff at the idea of using auto-battle options, you should definitely not sleep on them in the game, especially the Fight Wisely option, as using it can increase your enjoyment of the experience.</p>
<p>Unlike other remakes of older JRPGs, which tone down the encounter rate to offer a more welcoming experience, <a href="https://dragonquest.square-enix-games.com/games/en-us/dragon-quest-123-hd2d-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> doesn't do anything of the sort, only allowing players to manipulate the encounter rate by using items and abilities that are not immediately available at the start of the game. This means that most of the time, you will be fighting a lot of enemies as you go on about the Hero's journey to save the world.</p>
<p>After a while, fighting so many enemies just to get from one point to another of the map can get quite tiresome, even though the high encounter rate is a core part of the Dragon Quest experience design. However, this becomes less of an issue if you use the Tactics options appropriately in fights against mobs.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241113235733_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Fight Wisely option, in particular, is a great auto-battle option and the best to use against mobs in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake for a few reasons. In the vast majority of cases, this option truly picks the best possible combat options for both offense and defense, prioritizing taking down the most powerful enemies and groups while also handling healing and support surprisingly well. Few have been cases in my current playthrough where the AI hasn't made the same decisions I would have made, with only some small exceptions, such as making my Priest use an offensive spell when a single enemy was left that could have been taken down with weapons. This effectively saved me a lot of time in mob fights, improving combat pacing a lot and making the experience more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Saving time in battles isn't the only reason you should use the Fight Wisely auto-battle option in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake. Another very good reason is that the AI controlling your characters essentially cheats against the enemies. For example, it handles healing in a way the player never would, healing characters that get at low health unpredictably, something that a human player could never do, also using items when magic spells are not available. In addition, the AI always selects the element an enemy is weak against, and it is also capable of attacking the reinforcements that some enemies call during battle, which is something that is extremely useful against enemies that call healers as backups, such as Healslimes.</p>
<p>Everything considered, you really shouldn't sleep on the Fight Wisely auto-battle option in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake. While not the absolute best choice for bosses, where you want to have full control of your characters, it is a more than viable option to improve your experience and make the high encounter rate less of an issue.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is clamping down on what it calls "disruptive behaviour" - specifically, players going AFK to boost account levels without playing, or playing on alternative servers via VPNs.
</p>
<p>
The franchise's Ricochet Anti-Cheat technology has been tuned to better detect AFK players who load into matches simply to gather XP without any intention of playing, disrupting team balance and infuriating team mates. 
</p>
<p>
Anyone looking to unlock Ranked Play will now need to win 50 match-made multiplayer matches before doing so, in order to ensure Ranked players are at the correct skill level (presumably, to give less experienced players a chance to improve but also stop sweaty veterans making fresh accounts that get matched with newbies). 
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, this change is also designed to give Ricochet a cache of match history data to "examine", with top players further looked into via a Replay Investigation Tool to ensure everyone's playing by the rules. 
</p>
<p>
These updates will also apply to Ranked Play when it arrives in Call of Duty Warzone, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes">patch notes</a> state.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday we took a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-battle-pass-includes-a-parasite-skin-for-some-reason">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Season 1 battle pass</a>, which includes a parasite skin and what looks like a rip-off of Rocket Raccoon.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warzone-black-ops-6-season-1-release-date-time">Call of Duty Warzone and Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> launches today at 5pm UK time. </p>
<p>"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, its withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Marking the 30th anniversary of the Warcraft series, Blizzard has released remasters of the first two games – Warcraft and Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness – and a big update for the much maligned <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/05/warcraft-3-reforged-review-blizzard/">Warcraft 3: Reforged</a> as well.</p>
<p>Each game is available individually – Warcraft: Remastered is £9, Warcraft 2: Remastered for £12.59 – or all three within the Warcraft Battle Chest for £35.</p>

<p>The emphasis for Warcraft and Warcraft 2 has been to bring the games a little more up to date without affecting the original games. Both games have been given a fresh lick of paint with new graphics and widescreen output, but you’re able to switch between the original graphics and remastered ones in real time – I personally think that, however they did them, the new sprites lose a lot of the original charm and look quite mobile game-y.</p>
<p>Both games also have UI and UX improvements, such as tooltips and healthbars, a mission select screen, increased unit selection, redone mission intro screens, and more. Warcraft I in particular gains right-click move, band box selecting and a faster game speed to better match the sequels.</p>

<p>Warcraft 2 will still have multiplayer functionality, with all legacy custom maps remaining playable and compatible.</p>
<p>All of this sounds like Blizzard took on board the sweeping criticism of their last Warcraft remaster, Warcraft 3: Reforged, and they’ve also gone back to Reforged to bring a lot of community requested changes and improvements. Patch 2.0 is out now for Warcraft 3: Reforged, adding hotkey customisation, and updated ladder and more as quality of life improvements. They’ve also retouched the graphics,&nbsp;overhauling the environments, lighting and user interface… but most importantly adding uprezzed classic Warcraft 3 assets to HD and now letting you pick and choose between settings to get the classic vanilla experience or the updated one.</p>
<p>Long overdue, and what Reforged should have been in the first place, but good to see.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Warcraft universe, Blizzard has started a fresh lap of World of Warcraft, announcing the launch of new World of Warcraft: Classic realms that let you play the classic World of Warcraft: Classic without all the pesky expansions and updates that have been added to it in the last five years. Expect WoW Classic Classic Classic to launch in 2029.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> will add the ability to trade cards with other players at the start of 2025, the smash hit smartphone game's development team has confirmed. 
</p>
<p>
Before then, the game will also be refreshed with the launch of new booster packs due "by the end of the year".
</p>
<p>
In a development update posted to X, the Pokémon TCG Pocket team said it was "aiming to add a feature that allows certain cards to be traded starting in January 2025". It's unclear, however, which cards these might be limited to, and what other costs or limitations might be involved.

Pokémon TCG Pocket's plan to add fresh booster packs before the end of 2024 lines up with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-first-expansion-due-late-january-leak-suggests">recent datamine which suggested at least one additional pack would arrive in December</a>, before a fully-fledged new expansion due on 29th January next year. 
</p>
<p>
That datamine also highlighted in-progress work on a new card rarity and rare card picks being added to the Wonder Pick mechanic. As ever, however, datamined details are subject to change.
</p>
<p>
"We have other new features in development outside of the trade feature," the Pokémon TCG Pocket team wrote. "We plan to announce more details about the update as the dates for the addition of these features are finalised, so please look forward to it.
</p>
<p>
"We hope you continue to enjoy Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket. Don't forget to open your packs each day!"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/gog-preservation-program-launched-to-actively-support-golden-oldies-on-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The GOG Preservation Program has been revealed by CD Projekt’s DRM-free digital storefront, the company deciding to take a more active step of ensuring that classic games remain playable on modern systems.</p>
<p><iframe title="GOG Preservation Program - Make Games Live Forever" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IetvbdoeIhg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>At the launch of this program, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program">100 games have been handed a ticket into the Preservation Program</a>, with GOG running it through various quality tests to ensure that it runs well on modern systems. If it can pass those test, it’s stamped with a Good Old Game status on the store, and if it doesn’t, then GOG will provide active tech support to help ensure that the game will work again.</p>
<p>“We test and update the games so they work flawlessly on the most popular PC configurations – now and in the future,” they write in an FAQ. “The PC landscape is constantly evolving, with changes like new Windows updates or graphics card drivers occasionally affecting compatibility. If you encounter any issue with a game in the program, please contact our customer support so that we can verify and fix this issue for everyone. This helps us maintain the quality of those titles.”</p>
<p>GOG, which lest we forget already stands for Good Old Games, was first launched with a library of 90s and early 2000s classic, back when Windows XP was still in heavy use and Windows 7 was a new operating system on the block. Even then, with significant OS changes made in Windows Vista, such as with 64-bit CPUs, it was pretty common to need to run a game in a compatibility mode, but GOG ensured that games added would be playable on the latest OS.</p>

<p>GOG tracks what changes are made to each game in the program, even if it’s as simple as noting that they have validated stability and compatibility with Windows 10 and 11. Other changes can be more significant.</p>
<p>As GOG has grown, it’s morphed to be a more general purpose digital storefront, selling newer games, so long as they can be sold DRM-free. Those games are generally outside the purview of this programme, though that doesn’t mean there aren’t some more modern surprises that are featured.</p>
<p>So yes, there’s 90s classics like the original Fallout, Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri and Riven, but there’s also Alpha Protocol, Fallout: New Vegas, Dragon Age: Origins, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Mad Max.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: Origins is a key example of what GOG will do, with an update that has added Large Address Aware support for better memory usage, and limited the game to run on 2 CPU cores to boost performance.</p>
<p>However, they will not include community patches, beyond replicated well understood fixes –&nbsp;“The GOG Preservation Program aims to preserve the original game and make it playable on modern machines. This means being very careful with any modification that might alter the original experience. We also want to avoid passing the responsibility of maintaining the game’s quality on to the community, as it wouldn’t be fair to you.”</p>
<p>This is a great move by GOG, getting back to their roots, and highlighting game preservation and access once again. This very regularly ends up in the forefront of gaming discussion, as servers are switched off or companies seek to lock up their back catalogues,</p>

            <p>Well, that was quick.

They’re bundled together with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warcraft-iii-reforged">Warcraft III: Reforged</a> - itself with a new patch - in a 'Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest', which also includes the older versions of the first two games. The chest is available <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/warcraft-remastered-battle-chest?p=1863680">on Battle.net</a>, where it’ll set you back £34.99 / $39.99. If you’re just after the older titles, they’re £9 / $10 and £12.59 / $15 respectively.</p>

<p>As for changes to the remasters, there’s updated controls for Warcraft 1, bringing it more in line with the sequel, along with some customisable UI and UX elements. Warcraft 2’s multiplayer is apparently fully intact, with legacy custom maps compatible and playable. Both feature remastered assets. Warcraft 3: Reforged got a 2.0 patch, which Blizzard say "includes updated Classic HD assets and improved Reforged environment visuals. Customize your army to play with the visuals you prefer."</p>
<p>Personally? I think the remasters look like dogwater. I’d say they reminded me of a Newgrounds flash game but I’m positive I’ve played several that were much nicer. It looks a dentist waiting room pop-up book of itself run through several washing machine cycles then brightened up with an MS paint tool meant to emulate crayons made of the sun. It looks like it's going to try and offer me a discount on an energy bundle so I can run my farms for another hour, but I only if I send an invite to my aunt. If I’m blinded by nostalgia, then I choose to remain blind forever. Actually, I’ll have ten percent more blindness please. The colours are still too much.</p>
<p>Still, if nothing else, they are now a thing that exists and that Blizzard is selling, so there’s that. Enjoy, I guess.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Blizzard hosted the Warcraft 30th anniversary livestream a few hours ago, revealing a boatload of information on the franchise's portfolio. Let's start with the original real-time strategy trilogy because Warcraft III Reforged 2.0 is live now, bringing a wealth of visual improvement. To begin with, the developers introduced high-definition versions of the Classic Units, Buildings, VFX, Heroes, Environments, and Icons while allowing players complete freedom to customize between Reforged and Classic HD assets. Moreover, the environments have been improved, ambient lighting has been enhanced, the tone map has been updated, and the bloom removed.</p>
<p>The patch also introduces XP and leveling for Ranked Play multiplayer matches. The leaderboard is based on the amount of XP; if players have the same XP rank, the tiebreaker will be MMR. Level and XP will be reset with each season.</p>
<p>Blizzard also launched the remasters of Warcraft I and II. Players will have the option to switch in real time between the remastered and vanilla graphics. Warcraft I also received a few quality-of-life control improvements, such as faster game speed and right-click to move. Both titles got user interface improvements. Fans can now purchase the updated Warcraft Battle Chest <a href="https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/warcraft-remastered-battle-chest?p=1863680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Battle.net</a> featuring all three remastered games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct: Celebrations, Reflections, and a Look Ahead" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0rEfOTxr59o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Blizzard briefly touched upon <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-rumble-launches-november-3-pre-registration-is-open/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warcraft Rumble</a>, too. Since its launch in November 2023, the tower defense/action strategy game saw players beat over 900 million bosses. The development team also announced that the game is coming to PC, with a beta scheduled for December 10.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, there were a bunch of World of Warcraft announcements. The highlight was easily the news that player housing will, at long last, be added to the next expansion, World of Warcraft: Midnight. The game was the only big MMORPG to lack housing, so its many fans will undoubtedly be delighted.</p>
<p>As for the content updates scheduled for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-better-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The War Within</a>, Siren Isle, currently being tested on the PTR, will drop on December 17 on live servers. There will be a new outdoor environment to explore. The World of Warcraft team also shared a detailed roadmap for what's next, starting with the goblin city of Undermine.</p>

			<p>Aloft is developed by Astrolabe Interactive and will be published by Funcom. The game, set in a world of floating islands, will offer crafting and survival elements when it launches in a couple of months.</p>
<h2>Aloft, a co-op survival game, is set to launch in January 2025 in Early Access mode and currently offers a free demo on Steam</h2>
<p>Aloft, a co-op sandbox survival game developed by Astrolabe Interactive, will enter Early Access mode on January 15, 2025. The game will be published by Funcom and feature both single-player and online co-op modes.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Aloft-1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Aloft is an indie title that brings the elements such as building, crafting, and surviving together in a world of floating islands. By equipping the players with the ability to build an island into a skyship, the game takes a unique route toward the crafting and survival genre. With lots of side quests, which include stuff like finding lost knowledge, curing fungal corruption, and restoring the ecosystem, Aloft brings interesting gameplay and mechanics.</p>
<p>The game has been in development since 2021 by a dev team comprising 15+ members who have been active in various game projects. While all the content of Aloft will be available on 15th January, the Free Demo is currently available for the players. The demo was launched in 2022 and since then, the dev team has been working on the updates by taking user feedback into consideration.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Aloft-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Aloft will be in early access mode for about a year but will continue to receive updates throughout this period. After the game exits early access mode, the dev team will launch the full version and introduce a lot of new content. This will include newer mechanics, more explorable biomes, meteorological events, and much more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Aloft-3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In the early access mode, players will have access to crafting and building across three diverse explorable biomes. Aloft will have both single-player and multi-player modes with private and public lobbies as well. There will be a lot of things to do in the game apart from crafting and building, such as skyship sailing, gliding, farming, and cooking.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Aloft – Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aMpbOiQcW4M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-is-getting-a-new-matchmaking-system.1035483/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-matchmaking-changes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has revealed that it’s testing a new matchmaking system as a major quality-of-life improvement in Escape from Tarkov – and EFT: Arena. This testing is taking place on the ETS server, which is an early-access test environment restricted to a specific user base.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been made clear when these changes will hit the wider audience, but they sound solid at first blush.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-much-needed-changes">Much Needed Changes</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s matchmaking system has long been a thorn in the side of gamers worldwide. For instance, around an Escape from Tarkov wipe, which is the bi-annual global reset event, queues to get into a match can be dragged out monumentally, often hitting ten, fifteen, or more minutes to raid.</p>



<p>Many users have dealt with random disconnects and glitches during the matchmaking process over the years. One issue that surfaced this year was a problem with ‘Scav raids’, with players hitting never-ending loading screens during the matchmaking process.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1856691016960454986" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on social media</a>, Battlestate Games revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The main goal of the new system is to reduce the raid search time in Escape from Tarkov and matchmaking in EFT:Arena, as well as to reduce the number of errors and disconnects during matchmaking.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Beyond matchmaking, another concern for users is the amount of time it takes to load the map and loot pools and to connect with other players before finally entering a raid. This is one of the reasons why so many people moved to Escape from Tarkov’s PvE ecosystem, as loading into a PvE raid can take as little as 20 or 30 seconds all-in.</p>



<p>Do you welcome these matchmaking changes from Battlestate Games? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> or in the comments.</p>

<p>Since 2022, PlayStation fans have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of a Horizon multiplayer game – and LEGO Horizon isn’t about to fill that gap anytime soon. It was claimed in September that Horizon’s multiplayer project is the next Guerrilla Games deliverable, <strong>not </strong>a ‘Horizon 3’.</p>



<p>Per a recent job listing, it looks as though the team will be preparing to release this live-service Horizon title in at least some form next year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-the-wild">Into the Wild</h2>



<p>It has been at least two years since the first reports of ‘Horizon Online’ surfaced. Since then, almost nothing has been divulged by either Guerrilla Games or insiders close to the project. In March 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer-game-has-not-been-canceled-by-playstation/">Jason Schreier suggested</a> that the game hadn’t been shelved amid a restructuring effort at PlayStation, and in September, he outright claimed that Guerrilla’s next game is this multiplayer title.</p>



<p>In January, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-multiplayer-leak/">leaks revealed</a> alpha footage from a multiplayer-based Horizon title, along with a little key concept art. This content revealed a unique direction for the game, which many claimed ‘looked like Fortnite’.</p>



<p>Eagle-eyed users recently <a href="https://x.com/Jorraptor/status/1856757437006827810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dug up a job listing</a> for a ‘Release QA Intern’ at Guerrilla Games.</p>



<p>In this listing, it’s mentioned that the successful candidate will be working on an ‘online project’ and that they’ll need to be available in ‘the first half of 2025’. In the listing’s description, it’s stated that they’ll help ‘to ensure the game is prepared for launch’.</p>



<p>If we assume that the QA period takes a fair bit of time to complete, we could be looking at a release window – or at least an early access window – of H2 2025. We almost know that this is a live-service multiplayer title, and it’s not uncommon that they’re released in an ‘unfinished’ or beta state.</p>

<p>Embracer Group continues the restructuring efforts that have unravelled over the last year or two, divesting Easybrain to Miniclip for a consideration of $1.2 billion. Per a press release, the ‘transaction has a strong strategic and financial rationale’.</p>



<p>Easybrain has been developing mobile apps for almost a decade, and since 2016, the developer has seen more than 1.5 billion downloads across its portfolio. Miniclip, on the other hand, is a mobile publisher founded more than 20 years ago.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-changes">Making Changes</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-divests-easybrain-to-miniclip-for-a-consideration-of-usd-1-2-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a> published today by Embracer Group, it was revealed that the firm is divesting Easybrain to Miniclip for a tidy sum of £$1.2 billion.</p>



<p>In a statement, Lars Wingefors, the CEO of Embracer, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>This transaction transforms Embracer’s financial position and puts us in a stronger position to drive value. Easybrain has been an important part of the Embracer family for over three years, contributing to strong value creation during this time. As Easybrain’s market is transforming, Miniclip is the right strategic buyer to enable the company to stay at the forefront of the ad-driven mobile game industry.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Saad Choudri, the CEO of Miniclip, echoed that sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We are delighted to welcome Easybrain to Miniclip. We have long admired Easybrain’s ability to build loyal and engaged puzzle game communities. The addition of evergreen franchises like Sudoku.com further reinforces our vision to engage a broad audience of players.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Easybrain’s CEO spoke of the future of the brand and starting a new chapter that will allow them to ‘deliver even more enriching experiences for players’. It’s expected that the transaction will close in the early months of 2025, with Miniclip securing the Easybrain label on a cash and debt-free basis.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-best-personality-for-the-hero-and-all-classes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, much like the original NES release and every other remake released over the years, features some very unique gameplay mechanics that have a rather big impact on character progression for every playable character. Among these is the Personality system, which the game uses to assign a personality to a character that determines stat growth on top of a class's natural growth.</p>
<p>You will be acquainted with this Personality system right at the beginning of the adventure. A mysterious voice will ask for your real name and birth date first before submitting you to a personality quiz, which involves a few questions picked at random among 43 possible questions. Depending on how you answer, you will be brought into an imaginary scenario where you will have to deal with one between eight different choices that will end up determining the personality of the Hero.</p>
<p>Given the huge number of possibilities and how the questions are picked out at random, it is difficult to aim for a certain personality. Depending on the questions and the final scenario, the Hero can belong to one of the 32 starting personalities. 13 other personalities are reserved for the companions.&nbsp; 28 of the 45 personalities can be assigned to any character using special items to give players more control over this unique gameplay system.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241113123149_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As for how the best personality in the entirety of Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, the one that has the most benefits is the Vamp personality, formerly known as Sexy. This female-exclusive personality has a +70% stat bonus, allowing for great well-rounded characters that can be great at doing several different things and can take better advantage of the Vocation system that allows every character, with the exception of the Hero, to change classes once at Level 20 after having reached Alltrades Abbey a few hours into the adventure. Upon a class change, the level of the character is reset to 1 with all stats halved, but once a character that changed class levels up again, they will be more powerful than they were before the class change.</p>
<p>If you're looking for more specific builds that can take advantage of a class' unique abilities, there are some personalities that work better than others for all character types. For the Hero, who's made to be highly versatile, the Paragon personality works best for a physical attacker, Though Cookie for a tank with high physical defense, Wit for a spellcaster. Paragon and Tough Cookie work great for Warriors, while Lone Wolf, alongside Though Cookie, works great for the Martial Artist who wants to hit hard and fast. Mages, Priests, and Gadabouts that will turn into Sages benefit the most from Genius, although this personality could lead to a durability issue. Wit is a more balanced personality that provides good Wisdom growth without sacrificing durability too much. Thieves work well with Paragon for attack power and Tough Cookie for defense, depending on how you want to use them, although a physical attacker build works slightly better given their high agility growth that allows them to often attack before anyone else. Merchants leave a lot to be desired no matter their personality, so you could go with any and still have to deal with an average class that doesn't do anything particularly well. Learning a variety of different abilities, the new Monster Wrangler class is just as versatile as the Hero class, so the best personality depends on how you want to use the class. Paragon remains the best for a physically oriented build, and Wit for a spellcasting-oriented build.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241112185955_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While wrapping your head around the Personality system in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake can feel complicated at the start of the game, keep in mind that you can complete the adventure at any difficulty level using any party composition and with any personality. The system has been devised to give players almost complete control over their characters' growth and should be considered as a bonus mechanic rather than a fundamental one that has to be fully understood to complete the game. So, if you're not aiming to min-maxing, you can go with any personality or class and still have a great time.</p>

It’s a message that thanks fans for trying out Pokémon TCG Pocket since its launch a few weeks ago, and more importantly, it tells players what they can expect if they stick around. Update plans not only include new cards but even new, mysterious features that have yet to be announced.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone! Today, I'd like to share a brief statement by the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonTCGPocket?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#PokemonTCGPocket</a> Team about more immediate updates coming to the game in the next few months.</p><p>I look forward to sharing more details with everyone as they become available! <a href="https://t.co/eaN35vRpSw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/eaN35vRpSw</a></p></div>— Pokémon TCG Pocket (@PokemonTCGP) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1856819952713453683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket will receive at least one “major update” in the near future, with the team saying that the plans is to release new booster packs before the end of the year. Those who have picked up the Pokémon mobile game so far have been treated to three packs – Genetic Apex Mewtwo, Charizard, and Pikachu – with three pools of cards to choose from. It’s unclear exactly how many more packs will release in the next few months or which creatures they will feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How and when the card roster will grow remains a mystery, but one feature that has been on everyone’s minds is currently slated to arrive early next year: trading. The ability to trade cards with other players is a Social Hub menu option that’s been grayed out since launch, and in January, Pokémon TCG Pocket will finally make it available to use. It’s worth noting that today’s message clarifies that only “certain cards” will be available to trade at release, with the team promising to “expand the selection of cards that are able to be traded” over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the message keeps more than a few details hidden, rest assured that more features will come to Pokémon TCG Pocket down the line. “Also, we have other new features in development outside of the trade feature introduced here,” the message says. “We plan to announce more details about the update as the dates for the addition of these features are finalized, so please look forward to it.”</p><div id="best-pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Pokemon TCG Pocket Cards Tier List</h3><h3>Best Pokemon TCG Pocket Cards Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This mobile version of everyone’s favorite pocket monster trading card game has taken the world by storm since it launched late last month.
