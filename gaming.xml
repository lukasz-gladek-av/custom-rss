As of July 22, new guidelines state that the minimum age required to livestream will be raised to 16.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, YouTube allows teens aged 13 and above to stream solo, as is also the case with Twitch. However, the new rules (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/youtube-changes-live-streaming-policy/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a>) will mean that creators will need to be 16 years or older to livestream on the platform. Children between the ages of 13-15 will still be allowed to appear on a livestream but the policy states that they must be "visibly accompanied by an adult" or else their live chat will be disabled and their account "may temporarily lose access to live chat or other features."</p><p dir="ltr">These new measures may impact young creators trying to build an online following without the intrusion of parental supervision, but it's also a sign that YouTube is prioritising online safety for children.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Before we saw the official reveal of Resident Evil Requiem during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">Summer Game Fest</a> event, there were <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-delayed/">rumors that the next entry into the historically linear franchise would be an open-world game</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we know Resident Evil 9, officially called Resident Evil Requiem, is in fact not an open-world game, and closer to what players expect from the series, it's easy to dismiss those rumors as just that - rumors. Well, according to Capcom, those were not rumors and were indicative of how Requiem began its development journey.</p>
<p>In an extended version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-shows-off-brief-look-at-first-and-third-person-gameplay-as-resident-evil-requiem-takes-players-back-to-raccoon-city/">Resident Evil Requiem Creator's Message video</a> that's only available through the <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/video.html">Resident Evil Portal on Capcom's website</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-reveals-resident-evil-requiem-started-as-an-online-game-but-we-realised-fans-didnt-want-it/">VGC</a>), director Koshi Nakanishi confirmed the rumors were true, though Capcom pivoted from its open-world approach after concluding that this wasn't the direction players wanted the series to go in.</p>
<p>"<em>You might have heard some of the</em> <em>rumors</em>," Nakanishi began. "<em>Things like an online Resident Evil or an open-world Resident Evil, which we spent some time experimenting with. But in the end, although we had some interesting concepts, we realized that it wasn't what fans wanted to see or play. So we went back to the drawing board and created what led to Resident Evil Requiem.</em>"</p>
<p>Having the context that those rumors were true, and that Resident Evil 9 was almost an open-world, potentially online-focused game, makes the opening statement from producer Masachika Kawata make a lot of sense, as he begins his section of the Creator's Message video by clarifying that Resident Evil Requiem "<em>is an offline single-player game</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Creators' Message - Capcom Spotlight June 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-hiC3qpghP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a time when it feels like many of the bigger publishers and developers are trying to push an online focus onto historically offline single-player games, it's nice to hear a story where the team realized early enough that things needed to go in a different direction.</p>
<p>It makes you wonder how different things could have been for other games that we know went through a similar process, like how <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-details-dragon-age-the-veilguards-troubled-development-and-how-eas-attempt-to-turn-bioware-into-a-live-service-studio-plagued-the-game-all-the-way-to-launch/">EA's leadership kept pushing for Dragon Age to be a live service title</a> and realized far too late in the development of what became Dragon Age: The Veilguard that they had been barking up the wrong tree. And we all know<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/"> how that went</a>.</p>
<p>At least in the case of Resident Evil Requiem, we can look forward to its release next year with plenty of excitement, as Capcom is on a hot-streak of excellent releases. Perhaps that has something to do with their leaders having more than just hollow space and dollar signs in the six inches between their ears.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Riot Games are going to let their top <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League Of Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> esports teams receive sponsorship from gambling companies, in a bid to snaffle up some of the billion dollar unofficial sports betting scene that surrounds both games.</p>
<p>The publishers promise that they'll put appropriate "guardrails" in place to ensure that streams of tournaments aren't suddenly overrun by shady gambling ads, and to protect players and viewers from the psychological impacts of gambling. They even think it'll be beneficial to the community, in supposedly giving Riot more control of the existing esports gambling business. But the overriding rationale here is very much 'this is a big dirty pie and we'd rather like a slice'. </p>
<p>The change in policy will only apply to tier 1 League of Legends and Valorant teams in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. "We know sports betting isn't for everyone, and that some fans have strong feelings about it, and we respect that," Riot's head of publishing and esports John Needham <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/esports-betting-sponsorships">explains in a blog post</a>. "However, the reality is that betting activity already exists around our sports and will continue whether we engage with it or not. </p>
<p>"Historically, this has been a restricted sponsorship category, and Riot has not engaged with betting companies," he continues. "Teams have asked us to reconsider our stance, and after years of analysis to ensure we got it right, we agreed it was time to open up this category to create more revenue opportunities for teams."</p>
<p>Needham supports this with a few figures taken from a <a href="https://sportradar.com/">Sportsradar</a> analysis. Apparently, "the total betting turnover globally involving just LoL Esports and VCT reached $10.7 billion in 2024". However, "70% of bets across all sports are placed in unregulated markets with bookmakers who aren't licensed". Riot feels it's "better to engage in allowing betting sponsorships - thoughtfully, carefully, and with the right protections - than to sit on the sidelines while risks to fans and integrity go unchecked." In other words, Riot are of the opinion that the best way to protect people from the gambling companies is to team up with them.</p>
<p>As for the "guardrails" against predatory or anti-competitive behaviour on the part of either the bookies or their player partners: sports betting companies hoping to sign a deal with one of Riot's partner teams will need to be vetted by Riot. Those companies will also need to make use of GRID, a third-party esports data-gathering platform, who partnered with Riot in 2023. As Needham comments, "using clean, official data is critical to weakening black markets and stopping shady operators from taking advantage of fans and pros". The teams themselves will need to set up an "Internal Integrity Program", to ensure they don't do anything dodgy, though Needham doesn't specify what such a program might consist of.</p>
<p>While the sports betting sponsorship will only be available to Tier 1 League Of Legends or Valorant esports teams, "a portion of Riot's revenues earned from the sports betting program" will be spent on prize pools, new tournaments and training for the Tier 2 bracket.</p>
<p>The last reassurance in the blog post is aimed at viewers: Riot-owned broadcast and social channels will remain "betting-free, which means no ads, no sponsored segments from betting partners, and no betting partner logos on team jerseys", though this doesn't appear to apply to co-streams. Teams will get to decide how sports betting shows up on their own channels "within the guidelines of the sponsorship program, content platform ToS, and local regulations".</p>
<p>As Connor Makar unfolds over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-opens-the-door-to-betting-sponsorships-in-professional-league-of-legends-and-valorant">Eurogamer</a>, the context for these announcements is that the esports industry is in need of a cash injection, post-Covid-lockdowns and following the demise of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> League in particular. Riot and parent company Tencent are in the mood to boost their numbers, going by the language around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">recent layoffs</a>. Still, none of this is really in the interest of everyday players and viewers, especially the many children who watch esports tournaments and follow the top teams. Gambling is a <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/gambling">public health problem</a>, and now, League Of Legends and Valorant are part of it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-will-let-gambling-companies-sponsor-league-of-legends-and-valorant-esports-teams]]></content:encoded>

            <p>For a little while now, a group of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> modders have been working on adding a custom adventure to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">the RPG</a> that'll see you travel to Minthara's hometown via some locations you'll remember from previous Baldur’s Gate games. It's called Path to Menzoberranzan, and its devs have now gotten thir first build working, with demo-related news seemingly just around the corner.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.vg247.com/baldurs-gate-3-path-to-menzobarranzan-custom-campaign-mod-interview">interviewed Lotrich and Tomobamba</a>, the mod's project lead and lead writer, about their creation earlier this year, around the time they'd set their sights on releasing a demo in mid 2025, with a full release to follow at some point down the line depending on how that went. Since then they've been hard at work building and fleshing out the likes of custom locations, bosses, and a whole cast of new companions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1293115909166075915/1293115909166075918/1387740347387482203">latest monthly progress update</a> on Path to Menzoberranzan's Discord server, Lotrich lead off by announcing that the team had gotten their "first working build" up and running. "We’ve made big strides on the starting location," he wrote, "The build includes combat, dialogues, companions, and a slice of the story to dive into. We're not sharing it to public access, yet, but it will provide a solid foundation for our first demo in the future."</p>
<p>With the FAQ of the server still citing a January post about that mid 2025 demo release goal, and the calendar having now shuffled around to June, I reached out to Lotrich to see if he had any updates to offer demo-wise. The modder was keen to keep his cards close to his chest, but did tease that the team's keeping some demo-related news "under wraps just a little longer".</p>

<p>Moving back to the updates the PTM crew did share, Lotrich noted that they're "deep into research on implementing custom music". They've also been working on both new armour and 3D models for the mod's companions, who'll be a fresh cast of fully voice-acted faces, rather than the existing gang of Astarion, Shart, and the rest.</p>
<p>The modder added that "reorganizing the teams to streamline our workflow and make collaboration smoother for everyone" has been a focus, while PTM's PR team have been prepping "new types of videos to better showcase our progress, visuals, and behind-the-scenes efforts".</p>
<p>Up to this point, the looks that we've gotten at Path to Menzobarranzan's progress have come through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1k3pspn/custom_campaign_path_to_menzoberranzan_city/">screenshots</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lotrichexe4860">YouTube videos</a> Lotrich has been sharing every so often. There've been some interesting snippets of characters wandering around Athkatla, with the modders having told me in that chat earlier this year that their aim with the demo would be to deliver an explorable Waukeen's Promenade and Irenicus' Dungeon.</p>
<p>We'll have to see what the mod looks like once a playable version's out. The base version of Baldur's Gate 3's an incredibly tough act to follow for anyone, but it's been cool to see these modders and others trying complex stuff with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-will-add-official-mod-tools-this-september-making-it-even-easier-to-play-dungeon-master">modding tools Larian released last year</a>. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ambitious-baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-mods-first-build-is-up-and-running-and-its-devs-are-teasing-demo-news-soon]]></content:encoded>

Fulghor is one of the toughest Nightlords to beat thanks to his hard-hitting attacks combined with relentless speed. If you're trying to get all of the Remembrances, then you'll already have attempted to beat Fulghor on more than one occasion. To unlock and fight his Everdark Sovereign version, you'll need to have bested him at least once. Beyond that, here's the best way to beat the Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight, including his weaknesses and our recommended builds.</p><h2 id="Everdark_Sovereign_Darkdrift_Knight_recommended_setup">Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight recommended setup</h2><p>The Darkdrift Knight, and in turn his Everdark Sovereign version, is weak to Lightning damage, but has resistance against Holy damage, as this is the type of damage he deals. You'll want to equip lightning-based relics such as the Dark Knight of Baron, which is acquired by beating the Sovereign Gaping Jaw, last week's Sovereign boss. If you didn't get that relic, choose any that boost Lightning attack power, strength, or dexterity stats.</p><p>On your way to the Sovereign Darkdrift Knight, make sure to interact with the Scale-Bearing Merchant if you come across him. He gives the option to grant resistance to status ailments, enhanced armaments, an additional sacred flask, runes, or improved physique. We chose to take the enhanced armament to increase the chances of getting anything Lightning-based. The best weapon to take to face him is the <strong>Bolt of Granssax</strong>. If you don't come across it, try to find any Lightning weapon. The <strong>Sword of Milos</strong> is also valuable, since it decreases the physical damage output of all bosses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522091-everdark-sovereign-boss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522091" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522091-everdark-sovereign-boss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522091"></a><figcaption>Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522091-everdark-sovereign-boss.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_beat_the_Everdark_Sovereign_Darkdrift_Knight">How to beat the Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight</h2><p>After fighting this boss for several hours, it's safe to say he's not easy to take down. He's certainly harder than Gaping Jaw, but it does depend on your playstyle. As standard, he starts at phase two of his regular boss fight, and will already have his darkened arm that he uses for long-range attacks. He also uses it to slam down and create an area-of-effect (AoE) attack.

This is crucial to giving you and your teammates a window of opportunity to get some damage in. He will occasionally stampede through the arena using his lance. The golden light that he emits while doing this stampede will explode, so ensure you're not inside it when that happens.</p><p>Breaking the boss is easier with a Colossal weapon, so it's definitely recommended to hit him with heavy attacks as often as possible to enable you and your teammates to get damage in during those phases. This is most efficiently done as either the Raider or Wylder <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-nightreign-classes-and-tier-list/2900-6624/" data-ref-id="2900-6624">Nightreign classes</a>.

This is accompanied by a twinblade attack during which he will leap into the air and spin down to the ground with a slam. He also attacks with a regular bow with tracking arrows. The only way to avoid this is to run away--and fast. He will spin attack three times before concluding with the AoE slam.</p><p>If you see a wind effect on his blade, prepare for a wind attack. He will become faster and use a nuke attack. If he starts running and leaps high into the air, he's preparing to launch an explosive arrow with a massive AoE attack, which tracks. You'll either have to perfect dodge, perfect parry, or sprint away to give yourself more time to dodge it from a distance.</p><p>The most important strategy to beat the Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight is to remember to use your heavy attack. When he starts to aim, this is your crucial window to land heavy hits and break him. Then, your entire party can begin to hit him with as much damage as possible.</p><p>Repeat this process as many times as possible, remembering to prepare to perfect dodge three times when he begins his charge attacks. Though it is tricky timing, it is possible to perfect dodge those consecutive attacks. Eventually, he will be felled, and you can reap the rewards.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522099-everdark-sovereign-boss%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522099" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522099-everdark-sovereign-boss%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522099"></a><figcaption>You can purchase Fulghor's Enhanced Relic from the Collector Signboard after the fight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522099-everdark-sovereign-boss%283%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Everdark_Sovereign_Darkdrift_Knight_drops_and_rewards">Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight drops and rewards</h2><p>Upon defeat, the Sovereign Fulghor will drop <strong>25 Sovereign Sigils for the first defeat, and 10 for each subsequent defeat</strong>.

<p>The official PR release has got all the deets you need, fellow dino-hunters!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nightdive Studios’ remastered Turok trilogy is renowned for modernizing the iconic games and bringing an epic saga to current-generation platforms. When it was first released in 1997, Turok introduced gamers to a world teeming with cunning enemies, traps, puzzles, and deadly weapons, all within a vast 3D environment ready to explore. All three of these classic games feature upgraded gameplay, high-resolution textures, enhanced lighting and rendering, and support for console gamepads with platform-specific features to sink your teeth into!</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Turok</strong><br>
A world where time has no meaning and evil knows no bounds. Torn from a world long gone, the time-traveling warrior Turok has found himself thrust into an unknown land torn by conflict. An evil overlord known as 'The Campaigner' seeks to shred the fabric of time and rule the universe using an ancient artifact known as 'The Chronoscepter'. The Chronoscepter was shattered thousands of years ago in an effort to keep it from falling into evil hands. The Campaigner has constructed a massive focusing array which he plans to use to magnify and contain the power of the Chronoscepter to shatter the barriers between the ages and rule the universe. Turok has vowed to find the eight pieces of the Chronoscepter spread throughout the Lost Land and put an end to The Campaigner's evil plot...</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</strong><br>
Having defeated the Campaigner, Turok throws the Chronocepter into a waiting volcano to destroy it. Unfortunately, the blast awakens an even deadlier force — the Primagen. Once again, Turok is tasked with restoring peace to the land and stopping the Primagen from merging Earth with the nether world. The sequel to the hit game Turok features a host of enemies, weapons, missions, locations, and a new multiplayer mode.<br></em><em><strong><em><br>
Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</em></strong></em><em><br>
In the third game in the classic trilogy, players choose between dual protagonists Joseph and Danielle Fireseed, siblings of <em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em> protagonist Joshua Fireseed. Together, they must defeat the titular antagonist Oblivion and its followers, the Flesh Eaters, after the supposed demise of their brother at its hands.</em></p>

Between the battle system and overworld, he felt like he was almost making two games instead of one. Plus, he didn’t really have a story for the RPG and was worried battles felt monotonous compared to the strategizing of an<em> Into the Breach</em> or <em>Slay the Spire</em>. “I wanted to get it to a point where combat felt strategic and puzzly,” Robinson-Yu wrote. “But I got the sense that battles just felt like an annoying obstacle to players interested in exploring.”</p><p>The developer said that <em>A Short Hike</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-bittersweet-journey-of-a-short-hike-1841525700&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-bittersweet-journey-of-a-short-hike-1841525700">a chill, pretty, and occasionally bittersweet journey</a></span>, was unexpectedly lucrative for him, so he hasn’t been pinched for time. But a <em>Paper Mario</em>-like adventure wasn’t necessarily feeling like a fit for the type of games he’s interested in making. “I thought there was some dissonance between the cute and grounded world I was trying to make and the requirement for an RPG story to justify lots of fights and violence,” he wrote. “I’m not against video game violence, but it always felt at odds with the kinds of feelings I wanted to express at the time.”</p><p>Outside of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pumpkin Carving MMO</a></span>, Robinson-Yu hasn’t released anything since 2019, but he’s working on a bunch of things that might come out eventually, including an “action adventure game,” a different micro-RPG using Claymation, and an online platforming roguelike. Hopefully, one of those makes it to release, or at the very least we get a demos for them as well.</p><p>. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-untiled-rpg-short-hike-free-demo-1851785213]]></content:encoded>

Don’t get me wrong, it is a much harder thing to push us into progress, which we need.”</p><p>He also says that Trump’s “unanimous” victory (crucially, he did not win the 2024 election unanimously) happened because people were so mad about being told to be nice to people that they decided to send America spiraling into fascism. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/kashana.bsky.social/post/3ls6cey4cas2w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/kashana.bsky.social/post/3ls6cey4cas2w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It was either this or pronouns</a></span>, you know?</p><p>“I think that now that the pendulum has swung… we’re past wokeness,” Schulz said. “Wokeness is done.

This is distinctly inferior to most other weapon drops in<em> TWW </em>season two.</p><p><strong>To make more powerful weapons, you’ll need Sparks of Fortunes.</strong> This crafting reagent can be created by any character by combining two Fractured Sparks of Fortunes with 250 Valorstones. The former are an uncommon reward from many sources in 11.2, such as weekly quests or defeating raid bosses, while completing just about any activity in Khaz Algar awards you with at least a few Valorstones. Two-handed weapons require two Sparks to craft, while you only need 1 for a one-handed weapon.</p><figure id="" data-id="edf7acb499c52802c15050300bf935d7" data-recommend-id="image://edf7acb499c52802c15050300bf935d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="584" data-height="382" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an inventory screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows an inventory screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Thomas Wilde / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="edf7acb499c52802c15050300bf935d7" data-recommend-id="image://edf7acb499c52802c15050300bf935d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="584" data-height="382" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an inventory screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you use Sparks of Fortunes to create your weapon, it’s set to item level 634, and can go as high as 645.

However, they do cost Undermine Crests, which are given as a reward in delves, dungeons, and raids.</p><p><strong>You can get two Enchanted Runed Undermine (ERU) Crests for free in 11.1. </strong>One is given for hitting Renown level 20 with the Cartels of Undermine faction, which isn’t difficult. The other is one of the rewards for completing the raid quest “The House Loses,” which can be done by yourself in Story Mode.</p><figure id="" data-id="e7b2e583032c5b92739099d3c4cde6c4" data-recommend-id="image://e7b2e583032c5b92739099d3c4cde6c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1013" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters stand in an armor workshop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters stand in an armor workshop." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Thomas Wilde / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e7b2e583032c5b92739099d3c4cde6c4" data-recommend-id="image://e7b2e583032c5b92739099d3c4cde6c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1013" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters stand in an armor workshop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>An ERU Crest can be used in your crafting materials to upgrade your weapon to a maximum of item level 658. If you also buy a Runed Augmentation Matrix from Syenite, which costs 15 Runed Crests, you can kick your weapon up to 661.</p><p>To get the most powerful crafted weapon, you’ll need to craft it with an Enchanted Gilded Undermine Crest. These can be purchased from Syenite for 60 Gilded Crests, and the matching Augmentation Matrix goes for another 30. With these, you can take your weapon all the way up to a maximum of 681 item level. This is only three levels worse than gear from the mythic Liberation of Undermine.</p><figure id="" data-id="1e29cc396709989de3b20a13d3a9c37a" data-recommend-id="image://1e29cc396709989de3b20a13d3a9c37a" data-format="jpg" data-width="532" data-height="364" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows delve details." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows delve details." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Thomas Wilde / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e29cc396709989de3b20a13d3a9c37a" data-recommend-id="image://1e29cc396709989de3b20a13d3a9c37a" data-format="jpg" data-width="532" data-height="364" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows delve details." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Collecting that many Gilded Crests can take a while unless you’re already doing mythic dungeons and/or raids. The easiest way for a casual player to get Gilded Crests is to run Tier 11 bountiful delves. Make sure to get and use a Delver’s Bounty for one of them. You should walk away with 30-50 Gilded Crests in a week as long as you don’t run out of lives.</p><p>Alternatively, if you’ve got a friend or an easily bribed acquaintance who’s into mythic dungeons or raids, they’ve probably got more Gilded Crests at this point than they know what to do with. You can file a recrafting order for them in Dornegal so they can use their surplus Crests to enhance your weapon.</p><p>When you write it all down, the process of acquiring a high-quality crafted weapon in <em>The War Within </em>looks complicated, but it’s not that bad once you’ve done it for yourself. If you’re a casual<em> WoW </em>player looking for a power boost, however, you can’t do much better than making and gradually upgrading your own custom equipment.</p><hr><p><br>Season two of <em>World of Warcraft: The War Within </em>is currently live as of June, 2025.  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-wow-war-within-11-1-weapon-crafting-1851785210]]></content:encoded>

In their primes, Cena was the superhero company man who always won regardless of the odds stacked against him or whether fans actually wanted him to, and, by contrast, Punk was the rebellious, tattoo-covered indie darling whose real talk and wrestling chops changed the industry forever.</p><p>The yin and yang dynamic created an unparalleled chemistry that continues to this day and will be on display in the ring for perhaps one final time.</p><p>As we inch closer to their clash at Night of Champions, airing on Peacock at 12 PM ET this Saturday (their first one-on-one bout in over 10 years), we’re looking back at the Tommy guns, pipebombs, and five-star matches that have made John Cena and CM Punk’s rivalry so magical.</p></div></div><div><p>John Cena and CM Punk’s story didn’t begin in the ring. It started at WrestleMania 22 in Chicago. </p><p>Cena was set to defend his WWE Championship against Triple H. Before Big Match John’s music hit, the ramp lifted and a 1940s-style gangster car drove to the ring. Standing on its right rocker panel was a man outfitted in a blue suit and gray fedora, holding a Tommy gun.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1jspe5h/before_this_coming_wrestlemania_the_closest_cm/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1jspe5h/before_this_coming_wrestlemania_the_closest_cm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The man</a></span> was CM Punk.</p><p>Dressing in a Halloween costume to be a prop for the face of the company isn’t exactly a glamorous job. But hey, at least Punk did technically get his WrestleMania main event moment out of it.</p><p>The best part of Cena’s cartoonish entrance is the fact that the song the gangsters drove out to was once in a famous cartoon. David Farnon’s “Cape Crusader” played in the episode of SpongeBob that introduced us to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KPJ5KjdBZk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KPJ5KjdBZk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy</a></span>. It hypes up their return to crime-fighting to serve as Bikini Bottom’s geriatric superheroes.</p><p>Do with that information what you will.</p></div><div><p>The first time Cena and Punk locked horns was on SmackDown’s 10th anniversary show. An 8-man tag match featured the duo on opposing teams, along with a bunch of no-names – ya know, guys like Shawn Michaels, Triple H, The Undertaker, Randy Orton, and Cody Rhodes. </p><p>Later that year, the Cenation Leader and future Best In The World finally met in the squared circle 1-on-1. At the peak of his mightiest powers, Super Cena quickly disposed of his opponent on two separate occasions, with the second bout lasting a whopping one minute and 41 seconds.</p><p>There’s not a whole lot to write home about their earliest encounters. That said, Cena’s smooth reversal of the GTS into an STF was born and went on to become a signature sequence for the pair.</p></div><div><p>The debut of the Nexus will forever be burned into the brains of fans old enough to remember watching it live. </p><p>Midway through Raw’s main event, every member of NXT Season 1 appeared and surrounded the ring. They stalked their prey, standing on the apron Shield-style, and descended on John Cena like a bunch of clickers who located an infected.</p><p>He wasn’t the group’s only target. Daniel Bryan choked out ring announcer Justin Roberts with his own tie. Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel mauled commentator Jerry “The King” Lawler. Wade Barrett ripped the canvas padding and foam cover off the ring mat to expose its wood planks.</p><p>They made ruining wrestling cool a decade-and-a-half before Cena did.</p><p>A forgotten figure in the melee? CM Punk, who fought John Boy prior to the interference. Needless to say, their match was completely overshadowed by the chaotic spectacle.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>In 2011, CM Punk posted an impressive 6-1 singles record against John Cena, with most of the damage (including four straight victories) coming before their Money in the Bank classic.</p><p>Sure, shenanigans were involved, but against Cena, a win is a win.</p><p>Their January 17 match on Raw in particular exhibited signs of a special chemistry. A frosted-tipped Punk had just formed the New Nexus (remember them?), while Cena was on his never-lose shit.</p><p>Both stars accentuated each other’s strengths, with the Chicago native locking in an unusual leg choke hold and Cena catching Punk in mid-air off a top-rope, springboard crossbody attempt to the outside.</p><p>The back-and-forth affair concluded when Punk weaseled his way to a DQ win, thanks to interference from former New Nexus member (and current <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIcs49yPG2G/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIcs49yPG2G/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cirque du Soleil star</a></span>) Mason Ryan.</p><p>It’s remarkable to think that the landscape-shifting Cena-Punk summer rivalry was just a few months down the road.</p></div><div><p>For years, Mr. Hustle, Loyalty, and Respect ruled the WWE kingdom. He was perpetually in the title picture, either holding the world championship or chasing it. He never, ever lost cleanly. He was the Thanos of sports entertainment: inevitable.</p><p>Then, there was Punk. A former indie wrestler, he had quietly built a formidable resume with multiple title wins and a series of show-stealing feuds (his rivalry with Jeff Hardy fed families). By mid-2011, his WWE contract was coming to an end, making it the perfect time to air out his grievances with the company. And he did. Loudly.</p><p>On a June episode of Raw, the Second City Saint casually dropped the best promo of the 21st Century. Punk’s pipebomb blurred the lines between truth and fiction with surgical precision.</p><p>He seamlessly played the role of disgruntled employee, claiming he wasn’t afforded the opportunities he deserved. Relatable. Punk hated the idea that John Cena was considered the best when, really, <em>he</em> was the best wrestler in the world. No arguments there.</p><p>It felt like Punk was speaking for the WWE Universe, fed up with the status quo. He vowed to defeat Cena for the WWE Championship in his hometown of Chicago at Money in the Bank and ride off into the sunset.</p><p>The Voice of the Voiceless would make good on his promise, and then some. He beat Cena at MITB to win the title, left, returned with a new theme song, and knocked off Cena again at SummerSlam, all while injecting a heavy dose of meta-realism into a stale product and becoming the greatest anti-hero since Steve Austin.</p><p>Punk was the undisputed star of the summer, but his impact was made possible by the sovereignty of Cena, who, as it turns out, was “evitable” after all.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>The next chapter of the John Cena-CM Punk saga took place the following summer. </p><p>Punk was the reigning WWE champion, the brass ring he spent years reaching for finally in his possession. Cena held the Money in the Bank briefcase and decided to cash in “honorably,” announcing his challenge on the special “Raw 1,000” episode ahead of time.</p><p>Mayhem ensued.</p><p>As the duo slugged it out, the Big Show interfered and attacked Cena, triggering a disqualification. The DQ finish meant not only that Punk retained, but that Big Match John was the first man to unsuccessfully cash in.</p><p>After the bell rang, a conflicted Punk turned his back to Show as he continued to dismantle the Cenation Leader. The Rock’s music hit, and he sprinted to the ring to make the save. As Rock was about to nail Show with the People’s Elbow, Punk delivered an unexpected clothesline to The Great One, followed up by a devastating GTS.</p><p>Punk’s heel turn stunned the WWE Universe, and it proved that he would stop at nothing to defend his title—even if it meant compromising his morals. Cena, as we know, was built different, and their contrasting principles would deepen their rivalry even more.</p></div><div><p>If you’re jonesing to watch a stellar wrestling match, revisit John Cena and CM Punk’s bout at Night of Champions in Boston.</p><p>A villainous Punk was going on 302 consecutive days as champ, and Cena looked to avenge his failed MITB cash-in attempt a few months prior. The stage was set for another legendary battle, and the rivals put on an absolute clinic.</p><p>Counter after counter, reversal after reversal, neither was able to gain the upper hand. So, they reached DEEP into their arsenals. Punk unleashed a flurry of submission holds, including a crossface and a muta lock. He even attempted a moonsault and landed a Rock Bottom! Cena hit a suicide dive to the outside and a massive top-rope leg drop.</p><p>In the best way possible, the match felt like it was never going to end. Both men kicked out of each other’s finisher…twice. Finally, Cena nailed a German Suplex from the second rope and bridged for a cover and pinfall.</p><p>It appeared that Cena got the victory; however, the ref handed Punk the title since both of their shoulders were down, signaling a draw.</p><p>The storytelling was perfect. The psychology was perfect. The ending was perfect. Punk and Cena showed why no one could touch them in the ring.</p></div><div><p>John Cena and CM Punk set the bar so high for their matches that each time they competed, you’d think it was their last. Like it was game 7, like their lives were on the line. </p><p>Little did they know, their bout on a February episode of Raw would indeed be their swan song—for the next 12 years, at least.</p><p>The contest determined who would go on to face The Rock in the main event of WrestleMania 29: Cena, the Royal Rumble winner, or Punk, who just lost his title.</p><p>The two dynamos followed the blueprint they created at Night of Champions for pulling off a five-star level match to perfection.</p><p>The Straight Edge Superstar reversed each of Cena’s five moves of doom, while John countered Punk’s various submission holds and GTS attempts. Cena landed a sit-down powerbomb, and Punk executed a piledriver (a legitimately banned move in the WWE).</p><p>In the end, it was a surprising hurricanrana and Attitude Adjustment combination that gave Cena the win.</p><p>The long-time rivals delivered another classic because, well, don’t they always?</p></div><div><p>Watching John Cena and CM Punk share the ring at the Royal Rumble felt like a dream. Witnessing them hug and then fight in the Elimination Chamber was like seeing a band reunite to perform the hits after decades apart.</p><p>Sure, Cena has less hair, Punk’s got a bit of grey in his beard, and they don’t move quite as well as they used to, but the magic remained. In the chamber, Cena’s reversal of the GTS into an STF harkened back to their first one-on-one match on that 2009 episode of Raw.</p><p>Ultimately, the West Newbury native capitalized on a wicked curb stomp from Seth Rollins to Punk on the steel, locking him in the STF and causing him to lose consciousness to pick up the W.</p><p>Minutes later, the most do-gooding superhero in WWE history did the unthinkable. He turned heel, laying the groundwork for him and Punk to potentially clash again.</p></div><div><p>How can John Cena and CM Punk top what they’ve done in the past? They couldn’t possibly have any more cards to play, right? Wrong. Lo and behold, the “never-seen,” 17-time champ pulled the ultimate Uno-reversal out of his jort pockets in the form of a reverse pipebomb. </p><p>Last week, Cena stole his long-time adversary’s material—the material that elevated Punk to superstardom—and co-opted it to troll him. Without John, the Voice of the Voiceless would have never gotten his stage to speak, reigned as WWE Champion for 434 days straight, or gone off to UFC and AEW.</p><p>When all is said and done, John Cena will always be CM Punk’s daddy.</p><p>With the former Cenation Leader a heel and the Best in the World a babyface (another reversal), this Saturday, the forever foes will meet in the ring at Night of Champions—the same PLE where they wrestled their best match 13 years ago.</p><p>Soon, we’ll find out if they can rise to the occasion once more.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/john-cena-cm-punk-rivalry-feud-timeline-1851785211]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Sonic and friends will get three Secret Lair drops, and we've got the first look at one of them.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering has had plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-lair-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Secret Lair crossovers this year,</a> from SpongeBob to Deadpool, and one more is speeding onto the scene next month. Sonic the Hedgehog is getting three individual Secret Lair drops, and we've got the exclusive first look at one that's all about artifacts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the gallery below to see all 7 cards in the Turbo Gear Secret Lair drop:</strong></p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering – Secret Lair x Sonic: Turbo Gear</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-best-sellers">Final Fantasy crossover</a>, which is an entire draftable Magic set alongside four pre-constructed Commander decks, this Sonic crossover follows the blueprint of similar tie-ins by being limited to three Secret Lair drops. Secret Lair is what Magic calls its series of timed releases that contain just a handful of specific cards with special art, and they are all sold direct by Wizards of the Coast rather than in randomized packs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In this case, the Turbo Gear drop has six exisiting Magic cards redone with new Sonic-themed art and names, as well as one token card. That includes a few fitting staples of Magic's most popular format, Commander, like Swiftfoot Boots and Lighting Greaves – because of course Sonic's shoes deserve their own cards. Also of note, a legendary vehicle called the Weatherlight is here as Tornado, Sonic's Biplane, and thanks to a recent rules change, you could actually have that be your Commander if you are so inclined.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">WOTC says this drop is designed to complement the cards in another one of the drops that focuses on Sonic's characters themselves. While we don't have those to reveal, an example given in Turbo Gear's store description is equipping The Reaver Cleaver, reimagined here as Knuckles's Gloves, to Knuckles himself. This idea goes hand-in-hand with other crossover drops, like 2023's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-magic-the-gathering-crossover-secret-lair-spoilers">Tomb Raider</a>, where the reprinted cards are meant to fit nicely with the new Legendary creatures, almost like a little "build your own Commander deck" starter kit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Turbo Gear Secret Lair drop (as well as the other two) will go on sale on July 14 at 9am PT on <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official Secret Lair website</a>, and will cost $29.99 for the non-foil version or $39.99 for foil. You better get there on time, too, because they will only be available in a limited quantity – and if other recent crossovers are any indication, they will likely sell out fast. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

<p dir="ltr">In an interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692648/microsoft-bsod-black-screen-of-death-color-change-official" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a>, Microsoft's vice president of enterprise and OS security David Weston said, “This is really an attempt on clarity and providing better information and allowing us and customers to really get to what the core of the issue is so we can fix it faster. Part of it is just cleaner information on what exactly went wrong, where it’s Windows versus a component.”</p><p dir="ltr">The new design is expected to roll out "later this summer" in a Windows 11 update. This will also include a new Quick Machine Recovery feature, designed to quickly restore machines that can’t boot. These new changes can be seen as Microsoft bolstering Windows following last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/finally-deleting-part-of-system32-can-actually-fix-your-computer/1100-6525156/">CrowdStrike incident</a> when the BSOD affected millions of Windows machines, leading to one of the biggest server outages in history.</p><p dir="ltr">Windows is also taking a more headlining role in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/">next generation of Xbox consoles</a>, as Sarah Bond said the vision is to create a platform where games are "always with you" across devices, while games are not "locked to a single store." This can also be seen with the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/">Xbox ROG Ally Windows handhelds</a> it's releasing in partnership with Asus.</p><p dir="ltr"><i>Image Credit: Getty Images/MirageC</i></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons is a new entry in the long-running series, which started with an arcade co-op title in the 1980s. This time, the franchise is going in a fresh direction that shares roguelike roots with Dead Cells and The Rogue Prince of Persia. Bub, the green dragon, is the star of the show in the single-player, side-scrolling platformer, searching for treasures and doughnut exits to each area.</p><p dir="ltr">The dungeons will change with each playthrough for Bub, but the green dragon will have the iconic bubbles to bounce on for navigation as well as trapping foes. In addition, Bub can utilize special bubbles--like fire and water--to take out enemies. Treasures found in Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons then can be utilized to upgrade Bub's bubble skills and traded for items.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsuoLXelpv8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AsuoLXelpv8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Like other roguelikes, Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons wants players to "grow stronger and go deeper into the dungeon," per the game's showcase trailer (seen above). It's a notable departure from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remember-bubble-bobble-its-back-in-nintendo-switch/1100-6469085/">the last game in the franchise, Bubble Bobble 4 Friends</a>. That title stayed true to the arcade roots of the series but offered up four-player co-op.</p><p dir="ltr">Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons is set to launch in Winter 2025 for PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

                <p>Double Dragon has been one of the marquee names for almost 40 years in the beat-'em-up genre. 2023's Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons was the last installment, acting as a prequel to the entire Double Dragon story. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/double-dragon-revive/">Double Dragon Revive</a> is more or less a fresh take on the first game, with Billy's girlfriend Marian being kidnapped. Revive is set for release in late October, but if you preorder now, you'll be able to get a second game: Double Dragon Dodgeball.</p><p>In this pixelated retro-style minigame, Team Sou-Setsu-Ken (consisting of Billy, Jimmy, and their friends) fight their way through a dodgeball tournament to once again rescue Marian. You can check out a quick snippet of the game in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyhbM6DtET8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JyhbM6DtET8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This isn't the first time the Lee boys have crossed over into the world of sports. Diehard Double Dragon fans might remember Super Spike V'ball for the NES, which includes Billy and Jimmy as playable characters. There was also the WWF Superstars arcade that included Billy as a member of the crowd, though he unfortunately couldn't take on Hogan for the championship.</p><p>You can preorder Double Dragon Revive for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam <a href="https://www.arcsystemworks.com/game/double-dragon-revive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.

			<p>It will be a very long time before Borderlands 4 gets a deep discount and hits subscription services like Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus, Randy Pitchford recently said.</p>
<p>Commenting on <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1938309648320500181" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2025-is-officially-here-with-deals-on-indiana-jones-monster-hunter-wilds-oblivion-remastered-and-more/">Steam Summer Sale 2025</a> deep discount of the third entry in the series, which is now available for 95% off its full price, the Gearbox CEO highlighted how it took five years for the game to get such a deep discount and become available on gaming subscription services, suggesting players to take advantage of the deal. To set expectations for the future, Randy Pitchford added that it will take much longer for the same to happen for Borderlands 4. Though the Gearbox CEO later clarified his statement, suggesting that it may not be up to him for this to happen, reiterating that he is not <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1938408120415621234">involved in pricing and sales,</a> it will be very interesting to see how much this statement will hold in the future.</p>
<p>The longer time it will take for Borderlands 4 to get a deep discount over its predecessor isn't the only thing that will set the two games apart. According to Executive Producer Chris Brock, the new entry in the series will be more of <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-is-a-bigger-evolution-than-borderlands-3-says-gearbox/">an evolution</a> for the franchise than its predecessor was, which was designed to be as familiar as possible due to the franchise not having received a new entry in seven years. Traversal abilities and exploration, in particular, will set the new game apart from the rest of the franchise.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. A Nintendo Switch 2 version will be released later.</p>

Could the tides be turning?

On Twitter, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford chimed in on how the 95% discount on Borderlands 3--dropping the price from $60 to $3--has happened over five years after the game was first released. However, don't expect to see Borderlands 4 retail for the price of a cup of coffee--or land on subscription services like Xbox Game Pass--for a long time after launch, as Pitchford wanted to temper expectations.</p><p>"Sales like this and Borderlands 3 showing up on console subscription programs took over five years from the game's launch to happen. Take advantage when it's here! And to set expectations, it will be even longer before this kind of thing happens in the next cycle with Borderlands 4," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1938309648320500181" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pitchford tweeted</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>At a time when the average price of a AAA video game has jumped from $70 to $80--following decades of it being set at $60--the news that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-is-happy-the-game-is-not-80-and-has-no-paid-early-access/1100-6532526/" data-ref-id="1100-6532526">Borderlands 4 would be priced at $70</a> was welcomed by many fans. Of course, that's for the standard edition of the game, as the more deluxe versions of the looter-shooter will retail at a higher price. Discounts also come and go, and typically, the price on a new release drops around 10-15% several months after launch.</p><p>Of course, with enough incentive, plans can change. Borderlands 3 was given away as an Epic Games Store freebie back in May 2022, just a few years after it first launched, and it was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-free-games-for-july-2024/1100-6524517/" data-ref-id="1100-6524517">given away through PS Plus in July 2024</a>.</p><p>Pitchford's comment also comes at an interesting time for subscription services, as there have been discussions by developers and publishers regarding programs like Xbox Game Pass. Former PlayStation Studios boss Shuhei Yoshida <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-approach-to-video-game-subscriptions-is-healthier-than-xbox-former-exec-says/1100-6531904/">recently expressed concern about these services</a>, but he also added that Sony's approach is "healthier" as the company only adds first-party releases years after launch.</p><p>Meanwhile, developer Rebellion's newest game, Atomfall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-release-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-report/1100-6531671/">was "immediately profitable"</a> and the studio spoke about<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/"> why it was a good business decision</a> to release it through Game Pass. On the other hand, other developers have spoken <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-hurts-sales-says-dev-behind-xbox-game-pass-title/1100-6514084/">about the risks of Game Pass</a>, and Microsoft has also had to address statements about how the service can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-clarifies-its-own-admission-that-game-pass-cannibalizes-some-game-sales/1100-6511503/">potentially cannibalize game sales</a>.</p>

Kennedy may play a role in the game, possibly as another playable character. Director Koshi Nakanishi seemingly silenced these rumors during last night’s Capcom Spotlight, where he revealed that Leon was initially considered for Requiem's starring role but was ultimately considered a bad fit for the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Nakanishi states that while they considered including the popular hero of Resident Evil 2 and 4, Requiem’s core concept of “addictive fear,” an experience so oppressively terrifying that players enjoy overcoming their fear, didn’t fit with Leon’s generally fearless and capable characterization.</p><p>“We always thought about making Leon the protagonist, but making a horror game based around him is difficult,” says Nakanishi. “He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he’s actually a bad match for horror.”</p>

<p>While this doesn't necessarily rule out that Leon could appear in a non-playable capacity, it seems like fans won't be getting their wish of controlling the former cop-turned-government agent in the new game. Capcom Spotlight also shared more about Resident Evil Requiem's story premise, themes, and the decision behind making Grace Ashcroft the lead.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last night’s Capcom Spotlight provided new information and snippets of gameplay for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/resident-evil-requiem-is-arriving-february-2026">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, the ninth mainline entry in the series. We learned the game's central theme and story setup, why Capcom chose Grace Ashcroft as its protagonist, and more.</p><p>Director Koshi Nakanishi and producer Masachika Kawata explain that Requiem is a single-player offline adventure, and they dive into how the protagonist, Grace Ashcroft, represents a new type of lead for the franchise. Unlike previous stars like Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, the FBI analyst is shy, timid, and not adept at fighting; she instead relies on her wits to gradually overcome her fears. This approach is designed to make players better identify with Grace since she’s essentially a normal person thrown into an extraordinarily horrifying situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Grace's relative helplessness also feeds into the game's core concept of "addictive horror", &nbsp;which Nakanishi explains is an experience so overwhelmingly scary that players become addicted to the challenge of conquering their fears. He also unexpectedly drops that Leon S. Kennedy was considered for the starring role but was ultimately <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/27/capcom-considered-leon-s-kennedy-a-bad-match-for-resident-evil-requiem">declared a bad fit</a>. &nbsp;You can watch Requiem's Spotlight segment starting at the 19:06 mark.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omnl-EMxfYE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omnl-EMxfYE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to showing off new gameplay footage from the upcoming game, the presentation lays out the premise: Requiem unfolds 30 years after the destruction of Raccoon City. The designers discuss how the city spawned so many stories, characters, and hardships for everyone connected to it, and that the new game is “a requiem, a eulogy to those who came before,”, hence the choice of the title. This theme of reflection is fitting, given that Requiem launches one month shy of the series’ 30th anniversary in March 2026.</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about its gameplay by reading our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/11/back-to-raccoon-city">hands-on preview from Summer Game Fest</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/27/capcom-reveals-new-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-footage-and-discuss-its-narrative]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wreckfest-2-content-update-2-now-lets-you-race-motorhomes-in-a-live-scrapyard.1230108/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a> Content Update 2 is here, bringing another batch of tracks, vehicles and general improvements to the smash-happy racer. Of particular highlights are the eminently crushable motorhomes, and a working scrap yard!</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Content Update #2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8srHD006lIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>An addition that will be a joy to fans of peak Top Gear – a TV show that famously loved destroying caravans in particular, if not motorhomes specifically – thoroughly crashable RVs are joined by the large American sedan, the Cardinal.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to take these racing around the Banger Racing dirt track in both oval and figure 8 layouts, but the showstopper is the Scrapyard demolition derby arena, which features large armed crane grabbers, and car crushers to deal damage. You can get grabbed and dragged along to your inevitable doom, which looks quite hilarious.</p>
<p>Aside from that, Bugbear has sought to bring more polish to the game. Certain kinds of collision and vehicle damage have improved, the Last Man Standing demolition derby mode has returned, and there’s a bunch of other quality of life improvements and general tweaks.</p>

<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Wreckfest 2 Content Update 2:</p>

<p>Playing the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/19/wreckfest-2-early-access-preview/">Wreckfest 2 Early Access</a> at its initial release, with its very limited content, I said, “At this point in time, fans of the original are probably best served by actually continuing to play the original, but if you know that Wreckfest 2 will be a part of your racing game future and want to get in at the earliest possible point to see it develop, then the Steam Early Access release might just be for you. It is distinctly limited right now, little more than a demo or technical test, but there’s plenty for fans to look forward to in the months ahead.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-unveils-hexe-marie-boss-fight-in-crimson-desert/">Pearl Abyss</a> is bringing <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main">Crimson Desert</a> back to Gamescom with another demo available for those in attendance at Gamescom 2025 to try out for themselves ahead of the game's launch sometime this fall.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert was playable at <a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/">Gamescom 2024</a>, and before the event, there were rumblings that we'd see the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-rumored-to-launch-early-next-year-following-gamescom-demo/">launch sometime in early 2025</a>. That didn't happen, of course, with Pearl Abyss announcing a fall 2025 release date at <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/">The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p>
<p>We nearly had a release date revealed last week, with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-on-november-2-says-korean-website/">Korean website reporting that Crimson Desert would arrive on November 2, 2025</a>. Pearl Abyss released a statement following the report, simply saying, "<em>When the company is ready to announce a release date, it will come from official channels</em>."</p>
<p>That statement doesn't exactly deny the November 2 date, though, of course, it doesn't confirm it either. We'll have to wait for Pearl Abyss to properly announce the date, which could potentially come at Gamescom 2025.</p>
<p>If you do check out Crimson Desert at Gamescom 2025, then you'll be playing it on an AMD-powered PC with Samsung G6 and G8 monitors on display. You'll also walk away with a bag of Crimson Desert merchandise, according to a press release from Pearl Abyss.</p>
<p>"<em>We're thrilled to debut Crimson Desert's latest public demo for the very first time here at Gamescom 2025</em>," said chief executive officer of Pearl Abyss Europe, Lybee Park.</p>
<p>"<em>We can't wait for fans to get hands-on with the experience we've crafted. From the immersive booth to the gameplay itself, we hope every visitor walks away feeling part of Crimson Desert - and excited for what's to come at launch</em>."</p>
<p>If you want to run right to the Pearl Abyss booth once you break through the Gamescom doors, you'll be able to find them in the Entertainment Area in Hall 06.1, Stand B041-A040.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-short-hike-dev-releases-demo-for-sort-of-canceled-rpg.1230102/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>A Short Hike&nbsp;</em>developer Adam Robinson-Yu has announced that he's ceased work on his project&nbsp;<em>Untitled Paper RPG</em>, but he's released a free demo if you want to know how the game would have turned out.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game/devlog/971220/i-might-never-finish-this-game-so-im-releasing-the-demo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on his Itch.io page, Robinson-Yu says that after taking a break from <i>Untitled Paper RPG&nbsp;</i>to work on&nbsp;<em>A Short Hike</em>, as well as its various ports and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/short-hike-99-is-multiplayer-mod-for-up-to-99-players" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, he found he "didn't really want to go back to [<em>Untitled Paper RPG</em>]".</p>

<p>He says development on the project "had become difficult", which was the reason for taking a break from it in order to work on&nbsp;<em>A Short Hike</em>. The game technically isn't completely canceled; Robinson-Yu says he "might return" to it someday, but that he "[doesn't] see [himself] making time for this RPG in near future".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-short-hike-dev-untitled-paper-rpg-dialogue.jpg?itok=kUUB0vD2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-short-hike-dev-untitled-paper-rpg-dialogue.jpg?itok=6LChqLSU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Untitled Paper RPG&nbsp;</em>is no more, at least for now.</figcaption></figure><p>Robinson-Yu gives various reasons for&nbsp;<em>Untitled Paper RPG</em>'s development becoming difficult, including overscoping, a lack of narrative focus, and "doubts" about the game's turn-based combat, which he says ended up feeling like "an annoying obstacle".</p>

<p>In the end, Robinson-Yu says he simply "started to lose the joy that [he] felt working on [<em>Untitled Paper RPG</em>]", which is usually a pretty good sign that it's time to stop and look for something new, if you ask me.</p>

<p>However, if you do want to know how&nbsp;<em>Untitled Paper RPG&nbsp;</em>might have turned out, then there's a free demo available from <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Robinson-Yu's Itch.io page</a> right now. It constitutes around an hour or two of gameplay, but don't expect it to feel like a finished product.</p>

It's not clear whether any of these games will see the light of day, of course.</p>

<p>If you want to check out what Robinson-Yu was doing during his&nbsp;<em>Untitled Paper RPG&nbsp;</em>sabbatical,&nbsp;<em>A Short Hike&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055540/A_Short_Hike/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/a-short-hike/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/a-short-hike/9nk78df207sd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/a-short-hike-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can play it on all of those consoles' successors through backwards compatibility as well.</p>

            <p>It's here. No, not the end of the world as we know it, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s long-awaited review bomb cape.</p>
<p>Arrowhead had been teasing adding said cape, dubbed "Pillars of Freedom", to the game as an inside joke since that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">whole PSN controversy last year</a>, when HD2 got so many negative reviews from folks angry at account linking being made mandatory that its Steam graph's red lines were long enough inspire amateur fashion designers. The developers and Sony have since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-spider-man-2-and-more-playstation-titles-have-been-freed-from-their-region-lock-prison-on-pc">restored access</a> to the game in a bunch of countries the PSN change rendered it unpurchasable in, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-nerfs-leviathans-and-might-have-snuck-that-review-bomb-cape-in-behind-the-scenes">paving the way</a> for this gear gag.</p>

<p>"In honor of their unquestioning commitment to the defense of Managed Democracy, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> have been awarded a commemorative cape," Arrowhead tweeted upon deploying this back-covering cloth that resembles the Steam review graph at the time of the review bombing, "The new uniform piece will be available in all Super Destroyer Armories as soon as the rollout is complete.</p>
<p>"This cape will be awarded to all existing players. As with our previous item rollouts, please allow some time for the item to arrive in your inbox."</p> <div>

<p>Cue raucous celebrations in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1llsfy9/review_bomb_cape_is_here/">Redditosphere</a> and on Discord. "I can’t believe they actually did it," wrote one joyous player, "And good on them for waiting until Sony actually opened the game back up to all those countries, instead of last year when everyone was celebrating the half-victory."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another declared: "I'm not taking it off. I waited a long year for my country to be removed from [the] region block." Yep, this really has been a long time in the making.</p>
<p>Sony walked back their plans to make the account mandatory on May 6, 2024. It's now June 27, 2025. 13 months. 60 weeks. 417 days. Something in the region of 9,998 hours. Something in the region of 599,910 minutes. Something in the region of 35,994,615 seconds.</p>
<p>Babies have been born. People have died. Countless hells have been dived.</p>
<p>And now, cape.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/417-days-on-from-helldivers-2s-big-psn-backlash-players-have-finally-gotten-their-review-bomb-cape]]></content:encoded>

While that might be disappointing to some fans, diehard Strikers will rejoice that there’s finally a good one of those playable on modern hardware. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196452" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="149" data-playlist="196452,197567,197531" data-current="196452"><div><p>Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22004.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>See, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-strikers-battle-league-review-nintendo-switch-mul-1849047762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-strikers-battle-league-review-nintendo-switch-mul-1849047762">before<em> Mario Strikers: Battle League</em> came out in 2022</a></span>, long-time fans were cautiously optimistic. The GameCube original didn’t sell great, but won a loyal following thanks to its simple-but-fun spin on the beautiful game. <em>Mario Strikers</em> <em>Charged</em> for the Wii was decent as well, and depending on who you ask was a clear upgrade over the original, especially thanks to its online multiplayer. <em>Battle League</em>, on the other hand, just didn’t feel like it had the juice. It was light on content and the more strategic gameplay could be a bit soulless compared to the more arcade-y fun of the earlier games. </p><p>So it’s nice to see that <em>Super Mario Strikers</em> will now be playable on Switch 2 as well, improved by the Switch Online app’s multiplayer options with others on your friends list. We’ll see how the GameCube emulation holds up for it, but if <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-online-gamecube-games-wind-waker-fzero-classic-1851774234&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-online-gamecube-games-wind-waker-fzero-classic-1851774234">it’s anything like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</em></a></span>, <em>Mario Strikers</em> should also look and run better on the Switch 2 even though it’s not getting the full-blown remaster treatment. It’s also another reason to pick up Nintendo’s modern GameCube controller replica that released alongside the new console. </p><p>That accessory will come in handy once<em> Smash Bros. Melee </em>arrives. I mean, Nintendo has to be getting ready to bring that over too, right? (<em>Oh, Ethan...—Anti-Naivety Ed</em>) While <em>Super Mario Strikers</em> isn’t my personal pick for the fourth GameCube game to join the Switch 2's retro library, there are plenty of excellent games we should be getting now that Nintendo has a solution for porting them beyond individual remasters. That includes a bunch of other sports spin-offs. <em>Mario Superstar Baseball </em>when? And don’t forget about<em> Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix</em>. Maybe Nintendo will ship a new dance pad just in time for the holidays. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-mario-strikers-gamecube-smash-bros-melee-1851785199]]></content:encoded>

Here’s how to unlock all the <em>Street Fighter 6</em> armor and skins in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Akuma Armor</strong>: This full hunter armor set is unlocked for forging by completing the Ultimate Strength Side Mission.

I can confirm that the gestures do inflict damage when they hit a monster, but it’s a pretty negligible amount. They also all require real money to unlock. Here are the remaining items and how much they cost:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>SF6 Hadoken Gesture:</strong> $3.99</li><li><strong>SF6 Shoryuken Gesture:</strong> $3.99</li><li><strong>SF6 Tatsumaki Senpu-Kyaku Gesture:</strong> $3.99</li><li><strong>Street Fighter 6 Sticker Set:</strong> $1.99</li><li><strong>Blanka-Chan Doll Pendant:</strong> $1.49</li></ul><h2 id="h340187"><a id=""></a>How to Get SF6 Tickets</h2><figure id="" data-id="c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-recommend-id="image://c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rewards screen for the Demonic Strength quest, highlighting the SF6 Ticket material." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The rewards screen for the Demonic Strength quest, highlighting the SF6 Ticket material." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-recommend-id="image://c4b0fbb1e6e5e500fcd30e94dcebd5a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rewards screen for the Demonic Strength quest, highlighting the SF6 Ticket material." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Just like with the Blossomdance Festival event and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a></span> equipment, the new forgeable items from this collaboration require a new material. Appropriately, that material is called <em>SF6 </em>Ticket. <strong>The only way to get </strong><em><strong>SF6 </strong></em><strong>Tickets are as rewards from the Demonic Strength and True Strength Arena Quests.</strong> Both of these are unlocked as you complete the Ultimate Strength side mission in the Oilwell Basin. Akuma will give you the first of these after you find him in the small cave near the Area 14 Mining Cave Tent pop-up camp. You’ll unlock True Strength after finishing the side mission.</p><p>These Arena Quests are pretty similar. You’ll face off against a Tempered Ajarakan while wearing Akuma armor. Demonic Strength is a solo run against a three-star Ajarakan, while True Strength allows for two hunters to take on a five-star Ajarakan. Farming the easier Demonic Strength quest is the best way to get <em>SF6 </em>Tickets fast. I was able to breeze through it with A-rank speed and almost solely using the Akuma armor attacks.</p><p><strong>You need ten total <em>SF6 </em>Tickets to forge all the related items.</strong> The Akuma armor set requires five; the Blanka-Chan palico armor set requires two; and the new Mighty Charm III requires three. Keep in mind that any other required materials will have to be gathered from other hunts.</p><h2 id="h340188"><a id=""></a>How to play as Akuma</h2><figure id="" data-id="4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-recommend-id="image://4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new Akuma tab in the Basic Controls menu lists out the benefits of wearing his full armor set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The new Akuma tab in the Basic Controls menu lists out the benefits of wearing his full armor set." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-recommend-id="image://4831320cf7ef266a1ca21940d7c10052" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new Akuma tab in the Basic Controls menu lists out the benefits of wearing his full armor set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Breaking the head of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466">Mizutsune</a></span> with an uppercut is a satisfying experience, and you can live that dream too by wearing the Akuma armor. However, this unique mechanic sadly isn’t without some key downsides. You’ll be given the following three Item Bar options when you wear the Akuma armor set or use the Layered Armor version:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Assisted Combo: Akuma</strong>: Leaving your Item Bar centered over this option is how you gain access to most of the fighter’s moves. You always have to press Square/X to begin Assisted Combo 1, but you can then switch over to Triangle/Y or Circle/B for Assisted Combos 2 and 3. Pressing X/A during a combo will change your roll into an Ashura Senku teleport</li><li><strong>Gou Hadoken</strong>: Equipping this provides you with a special Hadoken projectile that functions like Slinger ammo</li><li><strong>Drive Impact</strong>: This action only works if the green six-bar Drive Gauge above the Item Bar is full. Landing a Drive Impact against a monster’s wound will destroy it with a Shun Goku Satsu. Drive Impact can also gain <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743">Offset Attack</a></span> priorities if the full Akuma armor is equipped</li></ul><p>Additionally, Akuma armor allows the use of the Gou Shoryuken gesture that’s awarded after completing the Ultimate Strength side mission. This gesture inflicts a bit more damage than the paid ones, but more importantly, it enhances into an OD Gou Shoryuken when performed after a combo.</p><p>I can’t deny that this sounds awkward and overly complicated. The trick is to make use of the various button shortcuts. Although assigning these actions to a Radial Menu is great for quicker access, relying on the following button shortcuts will allow you to fight with only the Assisted Combo option equipped:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Drive Impact Shortcut:</strong> Activated with a Focus Strike input (L2+R1/LT+RB) during an Assisted Combo</li><li><strong>Raging Demon Shortcut:</strong> An offshoot of his Drive Impact that you can cancel animations into and begins with an Ashura Senku teleport. Activated by <em>very quickly</em> pressing Square, Square, Triangle+Circle or X, X, Y+B</li><li><strong>OD Gou Shoryuken:</strong> Activated during or after combos by inputting right, down, right, and then any of the attack buttons. Those directional inputs have to be done with the stick and not a Directional pad.</li></ul><p>Many of Akuma’s attacks are short-range with limited movement. His iconic hurricane kick is ideal for repositioning, which is performed by pressing Circle/B three times for a full Assisted Combo 3 string. <strong>Akuma’s best combo connects the entire strings from all three of his Assisted Combos.</strong> That means pressing Square/X three times, Triangle/Y three times, and then Circle/B three times. Throwing out an OD Gou Shoryuken is a nice way to round it out. This should be the go-to when monsters are knocked down, since they won’t be able to interrupt you.</p><p>All of the above covers Akuma’s actions, but it means nothing without a good base. All of his techniques scale with your primary weapon’s raw damage and affinity. Equipping something with significant base damage will result in stronger Akuma attacks. Armor selection also makes a difference. <strong>Compared to Layered armor, having the full Akuma armor equipped provides a big attack boost, stun properties, and the Offset Effect for Drive Impact.</strong> You should use the full armor if you want all of his tools at your disposal.</p><p>Even though Akuma was also featured in the previous game, his inclusion in <em>Wilds</em> is a lot more fleshed out. Here’s hoping the next collaborations are just as deep and feature crossovers with some fun franchises.</p><p>Or Capcom could just make me happier and throw in some love for <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-street-fighter-6-sf6-ticket-akuma-1851785172]]></content:encoded>
