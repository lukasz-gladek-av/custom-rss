			<p>Of all the depressing studio closures of the past few years (and there have been far too many) one that hit me particularly hard was that of Piranha Bytes, the legendary pioneers of the Eurojank RPG. Famous for creating the hugely influential <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gothic">Gothic</a> series, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/risen">Risen</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/elex">Elex</a>, all of their games shared a unique feel that garnered a loyal fanbase. While the settings were different, each title featured unforgiving combat and a sense of openness that made many other RPGs feel claustrophobically restrained. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/is-the-gothic-1-remake-a-gothic-revival-or-a-gothic-ruin/">A remake of the first Gothic game</a> is still in the works but there is clearly a gap in the market for RPGs that share the DNA of Piranha Bytes’ canon. Of Ash and Steel is one of the first games to aim at filling this niche, and it certainly succeeds in that aim, although this isn’t always a good thing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - Official Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Fzzd6JmXBU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In traditional RPG fashion, you begin the game in a safe tutorial zone. You are Tristan, a cartographer charged with mapping the mysterious island of Greyhaft. There is no character customisation or specific class choices to be made here but early conversations can level up different attributes such as strength or dexterity and begin to define your character. The lack of any player contribution to the character at the start is another approach borrowed from Piranha Bytes games but does feel a little dated. This isn’t helped by a common sentiment from players that Tristan has a very punchable face – although this perhaps helps to explain why he gets into so many scrapes.</p>


<p>Graphically, Of Ash and Steel is solid but isn’t exactly cutting edge. The environment is relatively detailed and character models are mostly good (Tristan’s face aside). Enemies are varied, especially as the game progresses and you get past the initial wolves and bugs. The UI is clear and menus intuitive so interacting with the game never feels awkward – that awkwardness instead exhibits itself in the controls and combat.</p>


<p>Early on Tristan is clearly not a trained fighter. Most enemies can – and will – kill you very quickly. You don’t even have access to proper combat controls until you find a way to train your skills, which requires both levelling up and gold to pay a relevant teacher. This means that the beginning of your adventure is supposed to be very linear as you follow the path and avoid straying from it. This enables the onboarding to be controlled for new players, which is welcome given the high difficulty level.</p>
<p>As you gain experience through combat and fetch quests you can develop Tristan’s abilities in usual RPG style whilst also making choices about how you want to learn new skills. Specialising is possible but it’s definitely worth spending skill points in the early ranks of all three trees – war, survival, and crafting. These different trees will allow you to make consumables and equipment from the things you forage, loot, and steal in your journey, as well as letting you swing a sword correctly.</p>

<p>The dangers of Greyhaft are soon revealed as your entire crew are slaughtered in front of you and then you are kidnapped by a gang of bandits. You then wake up in a strange bed and have to begin from scratch to complete your mission and/or take vengeance on your assailants. In true RPG fashion your first quests involve clearing all the empty bottles from your rescuer’s cabin, pulling out the weeds from his garden, and (in a touch of very Teutonic humour) finding out who has been throwing fouled trousers into his yard. These banal tasks teach you a range of basic controls before you can venture out and begin your adventure in earnest.</p>
<p>It’s also typical of the games that inspire Of Ash and Steel that the first hours of the game are potentially very frustrating. Death is rapid, combat is incredibly janky (deliberately so until you learn how to fight), and even early NPCs focus on tricking and betraying you. The usual freedom you might expect from a seemingly open-world adventure is not present here. You need to follow the narrative and take the game on its own terms for the first few hours. This is especially the case if you play on the default difficulty setting when all of the aforementioned challenges are exacerbated by hunger, thirst, and tiredness scales. While I’m not usually a fan of these kinds of survival mechanics it does mean that there is more of a reason to use the things that you are constantly foraging.</p>

<p>Obviously a core part of the Eurojank heritage is the ‘jank’. I started playing Of Ash and Steel with a pre-release build and was enjoying myself despite a litany of bugs and occasional crashes. When an update was released at launch I switched to the full build and frustratingly found my save deleted. This isn’t all that unusual, but it did push me away from the game for a few weeks. Starting fresh to complete this review, and as we approach two months since launch, the game has undergone a series of patches and improvements which make it somewhat more polished.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		It’s a bit of a cop out to say that this is a game for fans of the genre, but it is entirely appropriate with Eurojank. If you’ve ever played and enjoyed a Piranha Bytes game, then Of Ash and Steel is easy to recommend, especially given the patches and improvements since release. It's also a good entry point for newcomers to the subgenre, though you will still need to tolerate some &nbsp;teething problems. If the game gets its teeth into you then it’ll become your new obsession. For others, however, they’ll bounce off the game and go back to more polished and forgiving titles.	</p></div>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Valve have reportedly rewritten Steam’s AI disclosure form, essentially a declaration of a game’s generative AI usage that developers and publishers must complete to sell on the platform. The new form, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simoncarless_interestingly-pc-video-game-platform-steam-activity-7417944215675908096-OGNg/">shared by consultant Simon Carless</a>, now specifies that while the presence of in-game GenAI content must still be divulged, including on the game’s store page, the usage of AI-based production tools for "efficiency gains" does not require disclosure.</p>
<p>"We are aware that many modern game development environments have AI powered tools built into them," the update form reads. "Efficiency gains through the use of these tools is not focus of this section. Instead, it is concerned with the use of AI in creating content that ships with your game, and is consumed by players."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The changed wording makes it explicit that developers don’t need to disclose time-saving tactics like using generative AI for concept art (or, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">as Divinity developers Larian put it</a>, "concept art exploration"), nor the practice known as vibe coding: describing the intended purpose of code to an AI helper that then generates it, instead of writing that code oneself. If it's not something that players see, hear, read, or otherwise interact with during the course of the game, it's all gravy as far as Valve are concerned.</p>
<p>The rewrite makes a kind of sense, if you’re a stressed producer trying to figure out whether you should list every time a level designer used Gemini to write an email for them. Even game engines like Unreal now come with built-in AI chatbots, and it’s no secret that game development is often under top-down managerial pressure to use these tools, regardless of whether they produce tangible game assets. Or, indeed, any meaningful benefit whatsoever.</p><p>That said, I’m not sure it’s much of an overall change, let alone a positive one. Valve’s previous disclosure form never actually asked outright for information on so-called "efficiency" tool usage – just as the current form does, it only ever requested info on GenAI assets that might be found within the game.</p>
<p>In this sense, the new form also fails to address the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">biggest problem with Steam’s disclosure rules</a>: that devs and publishers can describe their game’s GenAI content in broad, vague terms, leaving ambiguity over whether what you see while playing has been crafted by a human or farted out by a bot. And while Valve evidently see a distinction between 'helping hand' AI dev tools and the more insidious fake-art stuff, the reality is that machine slop – which may well have been intended to act as a temporary production shortcut – has a nasty habit of enduring into the finished product. 2025 critical darlings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner">The Alters</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> both launched with GenAI assets left in, allegedly by accident.</p>
<p>Unintentional or otherwise, Valve permitting developers to think less about their tools sounds like a good way to let even more undisclosed GenAI slip through the cracks. It may not be a full surrender to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-ceo-wants-valve-and-steam-to-stop-requiring-devs-to-disclose-generative-ai-usage">mad CEOs</a> who want Steam’s disclosures gone entirely, but this rewrite hardly better serves the intended purpose of keeping players informed.</p>

              <p>We’re already more than halfway through January. What kind of changes have you been implementing to actually hit some of your 2026 goals? Perhaps you have high hopes of getting into better shape, eating healthier, maybe you’re aiming to learn a new skill. If your big plans are just to be more productive than ever before, you might want to take a look at your work setup. most of us are happy just working off a laptop, but you’re really limiting your potential by sticking with such little screen real estate. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">A portable monitor can go a long way, and this one from MNN happens to be seeing a major discount right now. Normally priced at $59, it’s come down to an even $50 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="588">Remote work has allowed many of us the flexibility to step outside our homes and get work done from anywhere we please, be it a coffee shops, library, or even a hotel room. Although, a change of environment can introduces a drawback. You’re now stuck working off just you’re laptop, instead of your elaborate multi-screen desktop home setup I’m assuming you must have. Managing emails, documents, spreadsheets, and video calls on a single laptop screen means all those windows are fighting for the same bit of space. A portable monitor addresses this issue by providing an additional display, closely mimicking the comfort and efficiency of your home setup wherever you happen to be working.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="590" data-end="1026">The MNN 15.6-inch portable monitor is built with mobile professionals in mind. Its large display makes it easier to view and manage multiple apps at once. It has an HD resolution of 1080p and render color brightly and accurately.</p>
<p data-start="1028" data-end="1318">Getting started is simple and straightforward. The monitor connects through either of its two USB-C ports, ensuring compatibility with a wide variety of devices. In addition to laptops, it can be used with smartphones, desktop PCs, PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and even a Nintendo Switch.</p>


<h2 data-start="1028" data-end="1318">Built for Travel</h2>
<p data-start="1320" data-end="1883" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With an ultra-slim profile measuring just 0.3 inches thin and 1.52 lbs., the monitor fits easily into a backpack or laptop bag without adding extra weight or bulk. It also comes with a scratch-resistant smart cover made from durable PU leather, providing extra protection while traveling. The cover doubles as a stand using a frameless magnetic design, allowing the monitor to be positioned in either landscape or portrait mode. Choose the orientation that best matches your workflow, whether you’re writing, coding, or scrolling through lengthy documents. Sometimes it’s nice to just have your Slack chats positioned vertically on the second display, while you’re getting your actual work done in front of you on your laptop screen.</p>

<p>Rockstar North, a developer of GTA 6, has been hit by reports of an explosion, with police and fire services on the scene in Edinburgh responding.</p>



<p>The offices, located in Scotland, are currently cordoned off by police following reports of an explosion at around 5 AM GMT, with early suggestions, yet to be confirmed, stating a boiler was the cause.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/police-have-cordoned-off-rockstar-north-after-explosion-reportedly-caused-by-malfunctioning-boiler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, <a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-fire-crews-rush-ongoing-33257244.amp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EdinburghLive stated</a> that Scottish Fire &amp; Rescue have been on the scene for over two hours since reports of the incident came in, with a statement provided to the outlet that said the team “mobilised three pumps and four of our specialist appliances.”</p>



<p>A spokesperson told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0lx7x5d81lo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC</a> that firefighters were called out to deal with structural damage at the building and crews were stood down at 9:21 AM GMT.</p>



<p>No deaths or injuries have been reported, and, while the cause is yet to be publicly confirmed, local outlets have stated it was a suspected boiler explosion.</p>



<p>Rockstar North is, of course, one of the developers working on the highly-anticipated sixth instalment of the Grand Theft Auto series, and the company has not commented on the incident.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> is currently enjoying a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#1m">boost in its player numbers</a> following the long-awaited debut of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deadpool-is-joining-marvel-rivals-later-this-week-and-he-can-pretty-much-do-anything-he-wants">Deadpool</a>, but some players continue to ruin the fun for everyone. Thankfully, the developers of the game are on the case and planning to ult them into oblivion soon enough.</p>
<p>On 19th January, the <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/2013176993383133552?s=20">official Marvel Rivals account</a> on X/Twitter acknowledged the annoying situation players are often running into, with some matches being disrupted by farmers who just stand still and farm the required stats to progress through the <a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Proficiency">hero proficiency</a> track fast.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hey Rivals,</p><p>Recently, we’ve noticed that some players are exploiting matches by remaining stationary and repeatedly farming stats to gain hero proficiency points. This behavior disrupts normal gameplay and seriously affects the match experience of other players.</p><p>To address…</p></div>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/2013176993383133552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>The answer will be to introduce a "combat behaviour detection system" which will punish the players engaging in such activities with warnings, short-term suspensions, and even longer time-offs. The worst offenders will face "permanent account bans" which may not amount to much since the game is free-to-play, but will surely enrage anyone fully committed to maxing out heroes.</p>
<p>Though this wave of farming has been partially enabled by Marvel Rivals' slightly convoluted hero proficiency system and its approach to challenges tied to cosmetic rewards, the online shooter isn't the only one that's been affected by exploiters who'd rather mindlessly farm for hours than play the game normally. Sadly, it's the kind of negative stuff that comes with the territory, but NetEase developers have, so far, done well at acting fast on negative feedback pertaining to the game's health and game environment, so we're hoping to see this system live in the game soon.</p><p>For now, players on the game's community subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1qgze5x/marvel_rivals_starting_to_take_action_against_afk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">are celebrating the news</a>, with the most upvoted comment saying the banhammer "might actually help some of these lord farmers touch grass." If you're wondering what "lord farmers" are, some users are describing them as the people that engage in farming on dead regional servers in the night hours; when they queue at the same time, they face each other and just AFK as DPS, tanks, and healers do their thing taking turns. Proficiency is tied to excelling in those roles, so you can see where the boosts are coming from.</p>
<p>"Great, now do something about throwers," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1qgze5x/comment/o0g90ch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">another user says</a> in the same thread. This is more of a widespread competitive online game issue, but anyone who's spent enough time playing ranked Marvel Rivals matches knows it's easy to run into folks who jump ship as soon as they see things going south. That's an entirely different problem NetEase hasn't properly addressed yet, so don't get your hopes up.</p>

            <p>After almost three months of scavenging and fighting, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> players have become quite good at dealing with the extraction shooter's PvE foes. Diehards might be worried about that side of the game becoming stale soon, but don't worry: Embark could be about to unleash hell on us.</p>
<p>During a chat with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/will-this-blow-up-the-server-arc-raiders-players-are-so-good-at-killing-arc-that-embark-is-considering-how-to-escalate-pve-dev-teases-a-shredder-escape-and-the-giant-walking-ones-in-the-background/">GamesRadar</a>, Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins stated the team is "pretty happy" with the end-game loop of taking down the imposing Queens and Matriarchs.</p>
<p>The problem is that killing the same behemoths over and over again to get materials to craft better guns that excel at killing the same enemies can get pretty old, pretty quick. Of course, most players have yet to experience what Arc Raiders' later progression stages and threat levels have to offer, but online shooters typically thrive or die based on how well-fed the hardcore crowd that lives in the end-game is.</p>
<p>Instead of coming up with new "giant spidery" robots, Watkins suggests Embark Studios could look at ways to put them to good use in different scenarios and/or events: "I think it's looking toward where we take those types of experiences in the future to something else or something additional, seeing how we can escalate the experience for the player on the PvE side."</p><p>A potential buff to the Arcs or shaken-up world state wouldn't be limited to the boss robots, as drones are also becoming "much less of a threat to them" (that is, in regards to players deeper into the game). Nonetheless, some the smaller Arcs are simply meant to be annoyances we have to deal with as we rush through our favourite loot spots and (if we're feeling naughty) go after unsuspecting raiders.</p>
<p>About the titanic Arc bosses that can often be seen in the background, Embark isn't making promises due to the tech involved, but everything seems to be on the table: "We want to go wherever's practical for us, or wherever feels fun, but then you start running into the practical side of, will this blow up the server? … Our ambitions are definitely large, and I'm not going to say that you're going to meet one anytime soon, but obviously you see the giant walking ones in the background and stuff."</p>
<p>For now, I'd say <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-now-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-so-youre-all-getting-a-golden-pickaxe-as-a-reward">more than 12m copies sold</a> and the glowing player sentiment are giving the studio plenty of space and time for experimentation.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449">Dusk Golem</a>, who has had a history of accurately reporting Capcom's plans for Resident Evil, the company will be announcing a remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_code_veronica_x">Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a> in 2026 (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcoms-next-big-resident-evil-remake-will-reportedly-be-revealed-this-year/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>Code Veronica, largely regarded as a mainline entry in all but name, has been long rumoured to receive the remake treatment, and Dusk Golem seems particularly confident that this is real, stating plainly "I promise you".</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2FTBspZymlg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0gyoznp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>"No, there is NOT a Resident Evil 5 Remake that's going to be announced this year. Instead, later this year a RE Remake that starts with "(C)" &amp; ends "(ode Veronica)" is going to be announced, I promise you."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Questions arose around a potential remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_5">Resident Evil 5</a> after Eva La Dare, the voice actor behind Sheva Alomar in the 2009 original, stated that she's "Got a few fun things lined up for March" in relation to Resident Evil's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>Capcom <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/zombies-return-in-resident-evil-requiem-but-now-theyre-more-terrifying-than-ever">recently showcased</a> more gameplay for Resident Evil Requiem ahead of its release, highlighting the differences between protagonists Grace Ashcroft and Leon Kennedy. It's also been confirmed that those after a challenge can set the difficulty higher and thus necessitate the use of Ink Ribbons during Grace's sections.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/code-veronica-reveal-up-next-not-resident-evil-5-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>1409806</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A notable Resident Evil insider has stated that the RE5 Remake will not be announced in 2026; instead, Code Veronica Remake will be revealed.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Resident Evil 5’s voice actor made a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-5-voice-actor-hints-at-possible-30th-anniversary-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptic post</a> last week, leading the community to speculate that Resident Evil 5 Remake will be revealed on the franchise’s 30th Anniversary. However, it seems this won’t be the case, and a remake of an older title could be shown instead. The insider has also discussed reasons why this might be the case. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-code-veronica-reveal-reportedly-coming-in-2026">Resident Evil Code Veronica Reveal Reportedly Coming in 2026</h2>



<p>The latest bit of information comes from DuskGolem, who accurately leaked Resident Evil Requiem’s reveal and that Leon Kennedy would be part of the game. In the insider’s latest <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter), they debunk the community’s theories that Resident Evil 5 Remake will be announced this year and reaffirm their claim that Code Veronica Remake will be revealed. </p>



<p>Late last year, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-remakes-scheduled-for-2027-2028-respectively-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that Code Veronica and Zero Remakes were scheduled to release in 2027 and 2028, respectively, with the former being revealed in 2026.</p>



<p>Another <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012675455250235692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> by the insider also discusses the probable reasons Code Veronica and Zero Remakes took priority over others. The first reason is surveys, where fans have apparently voted for these two titles to be remade. The second reason is that several devs at Capcom worked on the original RE Zero and have ideas to improve it. The third reason is seemingly scope and scale, where RE5 and RE6 are considerably bigger titles. </p>



<p>As always, readers should take this information with a grain of salt, as the information doesn’t come from an official source. </p>







<p>In other news, check out the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-showcase-reveals-new-leon-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon gameplay</a> that was revealed during the Resident Evil showcase.

<p>"I can confirm that we got a call at 5.02am this morning. We mobilised three pumps and four of our specialist appliances. It's an ongoing incident and we're still in attendance at the moment with other agencies."</p><p>

The Scottish Herald were told, again by a spokesperson from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, that firefighters worked to secure "structural damage" to the building. These crews left after three hours after the area was deemed safe.

</p><p>This piece will be updated as more information on the explosion have been confirmed.</p>

<p>A risqué <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> island aimed at 'adults only' has been deleted by Nintendo after more than five years.</p>
<p>This comes courtesy of creator <a href="https://x.com/churip_ccc/status/2011099062666477894">@churip_ccc</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-bans-infamous-japanese-adult-only-animal-crossing-island-creator-says-thanks-for-turning-a-blind-eye-all-these-years/">Automaton</a>), who posted on social media to confirm the deletion, stating "To Nintendo, I apologize from the bottom of my heart. Or rather, thank you for turning a blind eye for more than five years."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Actually, just a day before the update,<br></em><em>The Dream Address for the Adult Island was deleted by Nintendo.<br></em><em>To Nintendo, I apologize from the bottom of my heart.<br></em><em>Or rather, thank you for turning a blind eye for more than five years.<br></em><em>To everyone who visited the island,<br></em><em>And to all the streamers who showcased it in their videos,<br></em><em>Thank you so much."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The island in question contains its own Edo-inspired 'Red Light District', while certain shops sell nothing but schoolgirl-inspired cosplay and toys. <em>Yikes</em>. Looking at the video above, more subtle hints towards the island's 'adult only' theme include magazine and posters littering the floor, some labelled 'DVD' in pink font.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Blathers' museum-inspired room has an entire corner dedicated to pictures of Isabelle, with seemingly used tissues strewn about the place. Must have a runny nose, huh?</p>
<p>It's interesting that Nintendo took so long to get rid of it in this case, but alas, it's gone. No doubt we'll see similar attempts in the future, but we reckon Nintendo will be pretty vigilant if it happens again.</p>

<p>Bungie’s release date trailer for Marathon has leaked online, revealing a March 5, 2026, release. </p>



<p>After delays, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-artist-satisfied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism controversy</a>, and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">art director leaving</a> just months before the release window, it seems Bungie is finally set on the Marathon release date. As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-march-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> by Sony back in November 2025, Marathon will release this year in March, as a new leaked trailer confirms. </p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-releases-on-march-5-leaked-trailer-confirms">Marathon Releases on March 5, Leaked Trailer Confirms</h2>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qgvybm/marathon_release_date_trailer_leaked_5th_march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, Marathon’s release date trailer has leaked online, revealing new details. The trailer starts like most of their newer videos, blending gameplay and cinematics. Towards the end of the video, we finally get a release date revealed: “Coming March 5, 2026.” Pre-orders will begin when the trailer is officially dropped, and the Deluxe Edition will feature a ‘Midnight Decay Bundle’, two weapon skins, and additional content. </p>



<p>Leading up to the release, Marathon developers have provided extensive details about the upcoming Extraction Shooter. We already know about the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-devs-reveal-pricing-battle-pass-details-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pricing, battle pass details, improvements</a> across the board, and more. Additionally, just last week, we received details on the archetypes, abilities, and customisations you can do with Marathon’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-devs-reveal-details-on-runner-shells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Runner Shells</a>. There is no confirmation yet on when the trailer for the release date will officially drop. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Marathon is an upcoming FPS, PvPvE survival extraction title from Bungie, which takes players to the world of Tau Ceti IV, where you get to play as bio-cybernetic Runners. The goals are to scavenge zones for valuable items while indulging in fast-paced PvPvE combat. The game also focuses heavily on customisation, allowing players to craft unique playstyles using existing runner shells. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-million-damages/</link>
            <guid>1409779</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Former Assassin’s Creed boss Marc-Alexis Côté has filed a claim with the Superior Court of Quebec for $1.3 million in damages against Ubisoft.</p>



<p>The file comes months after Ubisoft announced that Marc-Alexis Côté <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/head-of-assassins-creed-has-left-ubisoft-after-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left the company voluntarily</a>, a claim which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-confirms-ubisoft-asked-him/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Côté later denied</a>, stating that he was “asked to step aside” from the company. </p>







<p>In a lengthy LinkedIn post, Côté said, “Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it. The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.”</p>



<p>He later continued, “But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.”</p>



<p>The new report from <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CBC Radio Canada</a> states that Côté is now taking Ubisoft to court, claiming $1.3 million in severance pay and moral damages.</p>



<p>According to the report, Côté was told during a management meeting in late summer 2025 that Ubisoft’s new subsidiary with Tencent was looking to find a “Head of Franchise”, which was a position not offered to Côté. Instead, Côté was offered the position of “Dead of Production”, which would have seen him reporting to someone else.</p>



<p>The lawsuit states that in September, the position to lead a “Creative House” with abstract outlines was offered. After lengthy negotiations, Ubisoft reportedly asked him to make a decision on the changes, to which Côté formally demanded that the company pay him severance.</p>







<p>In response, Ubisoft reportedly told him not to show up for work as planned on October 13, and to continue his reflection period until the company responds to its formal notice. The next day, Ubisoft announced via a press release and internal emails that Côté was leaving his position voluntarily to&nbsp;<q>explore new opportunities</q>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment, but did not receive one prior to publication. Should one be received, we will update the article.</p>

            <p>We've been greatly enjoying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout Season 2</a> so far, and it seems that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-new-vegas-player-numbers-skyrocket-thanks-to-the-unavoidable-impact-of-fallout-season-2">most fans are</a> too, but the change from binge-based season drop to a weekly release schedule has had an impact on the show's ratings. Don't worry, though: this stumble isn't in danger of disappointing the powers that be.</p>
<p>On 15th January, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/streaming-ratings-dec-15-21-2025-1236475572/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> shared the latest report from Nielsen, a leader in media valuation and data analytics. As expected, the debut of Fallout's second season was a sizable one, with the show accumulating 794 million viewing minutes through the week of December 15th through 21st. At the same time, it was well below Season 1's appeal, which earned 2.9 billion for its opening week in April 2024. That one was Amazon's best-ever premiere on the platform.</p>
<p>Those keeping track of what goes down on the TV front might've already noticed what's going on here. Since Nielsen traditionally tracks viewership in minutes watched across devices that send the needed data, the company's numbers never give us the complete picture. It only tracks TV sets, but it's always been a good way to measure the temperature and streaming habits of the populace. The more important bit of info here is that 794 million minutes for a single episode versus 2.9 billion for an entire season that could be binged on Day One is very impressive all the same.</p>
<p>Moreover, we must take into account many viewers who have grown accustomed to Netflix's binge release strategy are just waiting for the entire thing to be available. All in all, Fallout is doing remarkably well still, and nabbed the 7th spot on <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/data-center/top-ten/">Nielsen's ranking</a> for the December 15th through 21st period. During that week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stranger-things-final-battle-was-directly-influenced-by-baldurs-gate-3">Stranger Things</a> reigned supreme in the lead-up to its series finale with a massive 2.37 billion minutes watched.</p><p>As it stands, Fallout Season 3 is a go and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">already targeting a production start date for 1st May, 2026</a>. The Prime Video series is among the very few big-IP shows that are sticking to tight pre-production and filming schedules, with S2 arriving only a year and a half after S1. For comparison, we're still waiting for <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-ahsoka">Star Wars: Ahsoka</a>'s second season on Disney Plus; the first set of episodes came out during summer 2023.</p>
<p>Are you watching each episode of Fallout Season 2 weekly, or are you waiting to make your trip to New Vegas until it's all loaded up?</p>

            <guid>1409764</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's apparently leak day in the games industry: after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-launch-date-is-march-5-xbox-store-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon launch date leak</a>, there's also the first in-game look at <strong>ZeniMax</strong>'s canceled <strong>Project Blackbird</strong>. Insider eXtas1s <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/2012971422679765352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared it on X</a>, and Tom Henderson later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blackbrird-footage-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> it was real, adding that it was used internally to show off the <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>-powered lighting. It is unclear whether the game was still running on Unreal Engine 4 when it was canceled, had already updated to Unreal Engine 5, or was planned to.</p>



<p>To be honest, that footage isn't very impressive. I'm not crazy on the character designs, for example. That said, it could be old, and of course, it doesn't tell us anything about how the game actually played. I've played a ton of <strong>The Elder Scrolls Online</strong> and was definitely looking forward to ZeniMax Online's new project, so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt on that count, especially given the reports.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="es" dir="ltr"><p>👀🔥 LEAK ⚡️</p><p>Nuevo metraje de "Project Blackbird", el MMO de Zenimax Online cancelado hace meses por Xbox.</p><p>Qué ganas le tenía 🥺. <a href="https://t.co/4Nz1G22l2F">pic.twitter.com/4Nz1G22l2F</a></p></div>— eXtas1s 🎮 Noticias &amp; Rumores (@eXtas1stv) <a href="https://twitter.com/eXtas1stv/status/2012971422679765352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In November 2022, the game, based on a new intellectual property, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-game-has-been-in-development-for-4-5-years-now-with-200-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already been in development for <strong>over four and a half years</strong></a> and boasted a manpower of <strong>more than 200 employees</strong>. We didn't really hear anything further about Project Blackbird until <strong>Microsoft</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suddenly announced its cancellation in July 2025</a>, as part of a major round of layoffs that also affected <strong>Rare</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Everwild</strong> was canceled</a>) and <strong>The Initiative</strong> (the whole studio was shut down, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Perfect Dark</strong> was canceled as well</a>).</p>



<p>A couple of days later, Bloomberg's <strong>Jason Schreier</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Microsoft Gaming CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> had loved his hands-on time with the game just a few months ahead of the cancellation. The journalist also viewed some gameplay footage of Project Blackbird and confirmed it looked impressive. This backs up the public-facing statement of ZOS Lead Graphics Programmer Alex Tardif, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the new engine had found its footing and the game was heading in a 'great direction'.</p>



<p>Another report by TrueAchievements <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a few more details on the game itself</a>: it <span>would be a third-person online shooter in which players would become&nbsp;<strong>Revenants</strong>, bio‑enhanced operatives employed by alien syndicates to navigate the underworld of <strong>Soteria</strong>, a tidally-locked planet with</span> extreme biomes. Throughout Project Blackbird, players would rise through criminal/corporate ranks and uncover a murder conspiracy.</p>



<p>Former ZeniMax Online founder and studio head <strong>Matt Firor</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-blackbird-was-the-game-i-had-waited-my-entire-career-to-create-says-ex-zos-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> earlier this month that the cancellation of Project Blackbird led to his resignation, adding that this was the game he had waited his entire career to make. Following the cancellation, at least two different studios have been formed by the fired employees: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-zenimax-online-devs-form-sackbird-studios-working-original-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sackbird Studios</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ironroot-games-established-former-zenimax-online-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ironroot Games</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Nowadays, ZeniMax Online has returned to focus solely on <strong>The Elder Scrolls Online</strong>, recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-interview-free-content-battle-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> revealing a major shift to a seasonal model and free content updates</a>.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Factory production lines in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/satisfactory/" data-ref-id="5000-483395">Satisfactory</a> will grow to immense sizes the longer you play, and it can be hard to manage. A good friend, though, will cut that work in half. Satisfactory offers both peer-to-peer multiplayer and server-based multiplayer, and each of them has their disadvantages. We'll talk about how to get each of them going here.</p><p dir="ltr">There are three ways to host games in Satisfactory: Peer-to-peer games, self-hosted servers and rented servers. Peer-to-peer and self-hosted server options are both free, while a rented server option will have a monthly cost associated with it. Meanwhile, peer-to-peer is the easiest to set up, followed by rented servers, and finally self-hosted servers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4627915-satisfactory-multiplayer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4627915" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4627915-satisfactory-multiplayer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4627915"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4627915-satisfactory-multiplayer.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Peer-to-peer</h3><p dir="ltr">A peer-to-peer session has to be initiated by whoever has the save game you're playing in. Sessions can be private, meaning that you'll need an in-game invite to join, or set to Friends Only, meaning that anyone on your friend list can hop in via Satisfactory's Join Game menu. Each game has a Session ID. If you share this with someone, they can join a Friends Only game regardless of whether they're on your friends list. Each time you initiate a session, though, the Session ID will be reset.</p><p dir="ltr">This is, by far, the simplest option, and will be sufficient for most players, but it assumes your schedules will line up enough that the host can always be on when you feel like playing.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Self-Hosted Dedicated Server</h3><p dir="ltr">A self-hosted dedicated server is something you set up on a computer you have access to, and leave it to run indefinitely, allowing multiple users to join it whenever they wish. The software itself is free, and comes with the game. This is the most complex option in terms of setup and maintenance, and you'll want to refer to the <a href="https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Dedicated_servers" rel="nofollow ">Satisfactory wiki on Dedicated Servers</a> for the details--it's more than we can reasonably go into here. Your ability to do this can also depend on hosting rules set by your internet service provider, meaning that depending on who supplies your internet connection, this may not even be an option at all.</p><p dir="ltr">If you have the know-how or the patience, this option will give you the most freedom at the lowest price.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Rented Dedicated Server</h3><p dir="ltr">A rented dedicated server gives you all the freedom of a self-hosted server, but on someone else's hardware. Most people don't just have a computer that sits around left on and unused all the time that they can set a server up on, so this is going to be a better option for most than the self-hosted option. You have a lot of set-up options, so it will take some patience to set up, but if you have a few friends with different schedules who want to play together, this is a great option. Hosting starts at around $10 a month, though reliable and performant hosting will likely be closer to $15. The more people you intend to have playing, the more important that will be. We're not going to call out any specific providers here, but there are many, many options out there through your favorite search engine.</p><p dir="ltr">This option is expensive, but is ideal for a group with multiple players who don't mind pitching in a few dollars to keep things going.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Early indicators that advertisements are coming to the Xbox Cloud Gaming service have been spotted by users, with messages stating that "ad-supported playtime" popping up for users when launching games.</p>
<p>One such user, The Verge's Tom Warren, <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/2012346097465782273">posted their own experience seeing this message firsthand</a>. Ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming has not been confirmed by Microsoft as of writing, nor its scope across the service. However, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">last year an Xbox official confirmed </a>that the company would be experimenting with free ad-supported cloud gaming.</p>
<p>This hint at advertisement rollout across Xbox Cloud Gaming comes at an interesting time too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-showcase-january-2026">with an Xbox Showcase set to take place on the 22nd January</a>. While it's been stated that the show will focus primarily on a handful of games including Fable and Forza, rumours have been circulating that such a shift with the company's cloud gaming service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version">could be rolled out this year</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>It's also coming at an interesting time for cloud gaming in general. With the AI boom ongoing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">hardware prices have skyrocketed for consumers</a>. This will, or perhaps already has, curbed the ability of gaming enthusiasts to buy their own machines, potentially leading a new wave to Cloud Gaming services such as what Xbox is offering. While not especially great news for the consumer, there's no doubt that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-can-now-stream-select-games-from-their-own-library-via-cloud-gaming">Microsoft has positioned itself into a leading position as far as cloud gaming is concerned</a>.</p><p>Microsoft too has faced heavy criticism when it comes to its gaming output, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">laying off significant portions of its workforce last year</a> and cancelling several projects as a result. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-suffers-worst-year-on-record-for-console-sales-in-the-uk">2025 was also the worst year on record for Xbox console sales in the UK</a>, though competitors like the PS5 also saw a drop during the same period.</p>

            <p>Happy new week of PC game releases, all! First, the customary paragraph of Maw musings. What we refer to as the Maw goes by many other names in different regions, as different cultures react to its cosmic incursions. Across the channel in Normandy, generations of monks have addressed the creature as La Bête des Trous. The Finnish know the Maw as Tuleva Syöjä. In the United States, meanwhile, they call it Friday Night at Applebee’s. 
</p>
<p>The Maw reacts to every naming with delight, for each name is a fresh morsel of News. By all means add your own invention to its plate, once you’re done reading about some of those forthcoming PC games.</p>
<h2>Monday 19th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1972450/Earth_of_Oryn/">Earth Of Oryn</a> is a pretty medieval kingdom builder, out this day in early access, with some real-time military elements and changing seasons.</li>
<li>Also coming to early access, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1031080/Lunars/">Lunars</a> is one of those multiplayer family boardgames where every board node is a minigame. In this case, it’s zodiac-themed, and the minigames seem relatively chaotic and Fall Guys-ish. </li>
<li>In autobattler roguelike <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3907920/CARNEDGE/">Carnedge</a>, you are that one dude who has to carry the eternal flame to the lighthouse and save the world. The visuals remind me of North American dark fantasy animated films like The Secret of NIMH.</li>
<li>Only you and the Sylvester Stallone of hamsters can fight back the apocalypse in kawaii doomsday sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596670/MOCHIO/">MOCHI-O</a>.</li>
<li>Point-and-click survival horror <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4249940/Bad_Eye_Deer/">Bad Eye Deer</a> is about surviving for three nights in the Arctic. There are deer and their eyes are indeed bad. Wield your laser barrier with discretion and try not to freeze.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 20th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mio-memories-in-orbit">Mio: Memories In Orbit</a> is a lucent, painterly metroidvania in which you explore a huge colony spaceship.</li>
<li>Protect the Earthglass Crystal! Deliver it to the Infernal Rift! Destroy the demon overlord Korghul! Shatter the Blightstone! In the turn-based strategy roguelike called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2832280/Blightstone/">Blightstone</a>!</li>
<li>Hark, the vaguely Latinate bellowing of male choirs! It can only be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3064810/Strategos/">Strategos</a> (pictured), the historical RTS in which 120 factions clang their shieldwalls together. There’s no world map functionality as such – I wonder if MicroProse will get mad at me for calling this Partial War.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3597060/Hack_And_Climb/">Hack And Climb</a> is a physics-based platformer in which you play a bunch of self-throwing weapons.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3104600/Observa/">Observa</a>, you are trapped on an island observatory floating in outer space. Point your telescope, print your findings, and monitor the darkness for an approaching... Something.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 21st January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3838370/TR49/">TR-49</a> is the archive-diving World War investigation sim with the spooky computer from Inkle, creators of Heaven's Vault and A Highland Song.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1804470/Duel_Corp/">Duel Corp</a> is a Souls-inspired action-RPG in which cursed immortals wander an MMO-lite open world. I like the grainy chibi characters and chunky little towns.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 22nd January</h2>
<ul>
<li>Come see the big city through an 18-year-old’s eyes while nurturing their personality in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2088810/Perfect_Tides_Station_to_Station/">Perfect Tides: Station to Station</a>, a thoughtful point-and-click adventure. If you are an actual 18-year-old living in the big city, watch out, playing this might trigger some kind of Being John Malkovich scenario.</li>
<li>Escape a very fancy magical boardgame by fitting inventory tiles into your board to defeat another player in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3802470/Turnbound/">Turnbound</a>. “Like if Inventory Tetris and Hearthstone Battlegrounds had a baby”, apparently.</li>
<li>Maketh swords and experienceth the story of the last human citadel in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305640/Bladesong/">Bladesong</a>.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3155570/Decollate_Decoration/">Decollate Decoration</a> you are a dead girl haunting her resolutely skeptical beloved. Make him believe.</li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1996390/Escape_from_Ever_After/">Escape from Ever After</a> is a Paper Mario-like RPG about a real-world corporation colonising the realm of fairytales. What, are you just going to sit back and let them turn the dragon’s castle into a godforsaken <em>touchdown space</em>? Quest forth, foe of human resources!</li>
</ul>
<p>As for what we in the Treehouse are doing this week: there is a complicated calamity unfolding that involves office keycards and toxic ramen. Could be Maw-related - I will leave you to speculate. On the brighter side, Jeremy is back from holiday. Hello Jeremy! Please, do something. As for the rest of you, let us know if there’s a new PC game we’ve ignored in our zealous pursuit of yet another dang roguelike or pre-industrial wargame.</p>

                <p>The Forge has one of the deepest crafting experiences you will find in any of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">most popular games in Roblox</a>. You are able to not only find ore throughout the world, but you are then able to take it and create gear to use for battles against zombies and more. There are so many different armor recipes you are able to craft in The Forge.</p><p>The general idea for how to craft in The Forge is pretty simple. You mine the ore using your pickaxe and then take it to the titular forge to create gear using a couple of enjoyable minigames. Depending on how many pieces of ore you use and what types they are, you will get various gear. If you want to know how to make all of the armor recipes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-forge-quest-guide-how-to-complete-all-main-quests/1100-6537007/" data-ref-id="1100-6537007">The Forge</a> Roblox, check below.</p><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Light_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Light Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629286-img_5322.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629286" data-ratio="0.57233626588465" data-width="2046" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629286-img_5322.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629286"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629286-img_5322.jpeg"></figure><p>Light armor is the most basic type of armor you can make in The Forge. It is also the easiest, but you won’t get nearly any of the protection that the other armor types offer. That said, for beginners, light armor is what you want to start with.</p><p>In general, unless you are using a specific type of armor recipe, the ore type doesn’t matter all that much. Instead, it is all about how many pieces of ore you use. Fortunately, you don’t need many at all to make light armor.</p><p>Here are all of the light armor recipes that are available in The Forge and how to make them:</p><ul><li>Light Helmet: 1 in 1 chance of crafting with 3 ores of any kind</li><li>Light Leggings: 1 in 2 chance of crafting with 7 or more pieces of ore</li><li>Light Chestplate: 1 in 3 chance of crafting using roughly 10 pieces of ore</li></ul><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Medium_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Medium Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629287-img_5325.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629287" data-ratio="0.56591796875" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629287-img_5325.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629287"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629287-img_5325.jpeg"></figure><p>Medium armor is where the boosts to your stats and the money you can make from selling starts to really kick off. This is the intermediate type of armor that you should focus on once you get past the tutorial of The Forge.</p><p>Here are all of the medium armor recipes that are available currently in The Forge:</p><ul><li>Medium Helmet: 1 in 1 chance of crafting when using more than 10 pieces of ore but less than 17</li><li>Medium Leggings: 1 in 2 chance of crafting when using more than 17 pieces of ore</li><li>Medium Chestplate: 1 in 3 chance of crafting when using 17 or more pieces of ore</li></ul><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Heavy_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Heavy Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629288-img_5324.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629288" data-ratio="0.59228515625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629288-img_5324.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629288"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629288-img_5324.jpeg"></figure><p>Heavy armor, also known as knight armor, is for the players who are trying to get the most out of their ore. As you might expect, this has some of the highest stats in the game and sell price, but it has harsh requirements at the same time.</p><p>Here is how to make all of the heavy armor recipes in this Roblox experience:</p><ul><li>Knight Helmet: 1 in 1 chance when crafting with roughly 30-35 pieces of ore</li><li>Knight Leggings: 1 in 2 chance when crafting with 35 or more pieces of ore</li><li>Knight Chestplate: 1 in 3 chance when crafting with roughly 35 or more pieces of ore</li></ul><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Special_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Special Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629307-img_5321.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629307" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629307-img_5321.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629307"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629307-img_5321.jpeg"></figure><p>There are special versions of the medium and heavy armor sets that you are able to make.

			<p>A few hours ago, the <strong>New York Videogame Critics Circle</strong> (NYVGCC) unveiled the winners of the <strong>2026 New York Game Awards</strong>, starting with Sandfall Interactive's <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>, which won the top prize of best game of the year.</p>



<p>It's yet another meaningful award for the highly acclaimed single player JRPG, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the win at <strong>The Game Awards</strong> last month</a>. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already surpassed Baldur's Gate 3</a> as the third game to earn the most GOTY wins, and the award season is far from over, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 well-positioned to win other prizes, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/"><strong>D.I.C.E. Awards</strong></a>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-awards-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dominates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDC Awards</a></strong>, and our own Wccftech Awards, which will be announced imminently. It only lost to <strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-2025-goty-award-goes-to-hollow-knight-silksong-beating-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the <strong>Steam Awards</strong></a>, although those were voted on by the public.</p>



<p>Anyway, the so-called '<strong>Big Apple Award</strong>' wasn't the only one that the French developer brought home, so to speak. Jennifer English was once again recognized for her work as Maelle with the <strong>Great White Way Award</strong>, which rewards the Best Acting in a Game. Here's the rest of the prizes that were given during the 2026 New York Game Awards:</p>



<p><strong><em>Off Broadway Award for Best Indie Game<br></em></strong><em>Blue Prince</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Herman Melville Award for Best Writing in a Game<br></em></strong><em>Blippo+</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Statue of Liberty Award for Best World<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades II</a></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Tin Pan Alley Award for Best Music in a Game<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight</a></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Excelsior Award for Best NY Game<br></em></strong><em>Ball x Pit</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Coney Island Dreamland Award for Best AR/VR Game<br></em></strong><em>Lumines Arise</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Central Park Children’s Zoo Award for Best Kids Game<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em></p>



<p><strong><em>A-Train Award for Best Mobile Game<br></em></strong><em>Is This Seat Taken?</em></p>



<p><strong><em>High Line Award for Best Remake<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Chumley’s Speakeasy Award for Best Hidden Gem<br></em></strong><em>News Tower</em></p>



<p><strong><em>NYC GWB Award for Best DLC<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lies of P: Overture</a></em></p>



<p>This year's edition of the <strong>Andrew Yoon Legend Award</strong> went to a company rather than a person (last year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was the recipient): <strong>The Pokémon Company</strong>.</p>

            <p>Young Alfie Williams reckons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> should introduce his character from 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple into the multiplayer slasher-fest.</p>
<p>Williams was chatting with IGN's lovely social producer Mat Jones about the 28 Years Later sequel, when conversation turned to video games and Dead by Daylight. Now, when I say young Alfie Williams, I really do mean young. Williams is, at the time of writing, only 15.</p>

<p>However, the actor - who plays Spike in both 28 Years Later and the newly-released sequel The Bone Temple - says that the previous inclusion of Stranger Things' characters by in Dead by Daylight proves that minors can be part of the bloody fray, so, really, why shouldn't the team include him?</p>
<p>"I know they bring Stranger Things in, so they can have minors in the game," Williams reasoned. He added he believes Dr. Ian Kelson, played by Ralph Fiennes in both films, would probably be quite a good fit for a Dead by Daylight survivor.</p>
<p>You can check out the full exchange with Williams and Mat below.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>28 Years Later: The Bone Temple star Alfie Williams wants to get a collab with Dead by Daylight:</p><p>"I know they're bringing Stranger Things in, so they CAN have minors in the game." <a href="https://t.co/DCdKMGWujc">pic.twitter.com/DCdKMGWujc</a></p></div>— IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/2012351328685556026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>As well as Stranger Things, other Dead by Daylight collaborations have included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-details-its-walking-dead-collaboration-as-public-test-build-go-live">The Walking Dead</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-celebrates-ninth-anniversary-with-five-nights-at-freddys-and-the-witcher-collaborations">Five Nights at Freddy's, The Witcher</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nicolas-cage-is-now-available-in-dead-by-daylight">Nicolas Cage</a> (who was able to fake his own death).</p>
<p>Given all that, a 28 Years Later collaboration is hardly out of the question, though I do think I would feel a little uneasy hunting down a child. What do you think of Williams' idea to feature Spike in Dead by Daylight?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marathon-launch-date-is-march-5-xbox-store-leak/</link>
            <guid>1409722</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Bungie</strong> has so far <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that <strong>Marathon</strong> would launch in March, but not exactly when. An <strong>Xbox Store</strong> leak may have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qgsa0y/marathon_release_date_discovered_on_xbox_store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed it to be <strong>March 5</strong></a>, so at the very beginning of the month.</p>



<p>Later, an Xbox user even <strong>captured the pre-order trailer</strong> and posted it on Streamable. You can find it embedded below - hurry up, though, as parent company <strong>Sony</strong> is likely to issue a DMCA takedown soon. Anyway, there's a <strong>Deluxe Edition</strong> that includes the so-called <strong>Midnight Decay bundle</strong> (two weapon skins) and more. No doubt, Bungie will share additional details when pre-orders open. It could be in just a few hours, as companies tend to follow up quickly on leaks to definitively confirm or refute the information.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Marathon returns almost exactly thirty years after the previous franchise entry, Marathon Infinity. This new game is very different from the old ones, though. It's modeled after the growing trend of <strong>PvPvE </strong><span><strong>survival-extraction</strong>&nbsp;<strong>games</strong>, played in first-person</span> only. </p>



<p>In each session, you'll infiltrate the derelict colony of <strong>Tau Ceti IV</strong>, a world whose inhabitants mysteriously vanished and is now contested by rival Runner crews and corporate security forces. Runners are <strong>bio‑cybernetic mercenaries</strong> who use a synthetic body built to survive extreme environments, hunting for weapons, upgrades, and valuable resources across repeated runs. </p>



<p>As with other extraction games, treats come from both NPCs (PvE) and other human players (PvP), <strong>making each session unpredictable</strong>. Additionally, Bungie has included <strong>dynamic events</strong> and <strong>environmental hazards</strong> that should keep players constantly on their toes.</p>



<p><strong>Successful exfiltration advances your character's seasonal power</strong>, earns cosmetics for your achievements, and lets you assemble stronger builds with the stolen loot. In Marathon, players customize their Runner's playstyle using weapons, implants, and equipment they collect.</p>



<p>The most recent official Deep Dive from last week <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-deep-dive-runner-shells-gameplay/">showed off the game's <strong>Runner Shells</strong></a>, or classes if you prefer:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Destroyer </strong></li>



<li><strong>Assassin </strong></li>



<li><strong>Recon </strong></li>



<li><strong>Vandal </strong></li>



<li><strong>Thief </strong></li>



<li><strong>Triage</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>There is a seventh Shell, the <strong>Rook</strong>, which can only be used in solo queues and has the advantage of coming with a free standard loadout, allowing newcomers to play without much fear of losing their own items.</p>



<p>The base game will be available at <strong>$39.99 / €39.99 / £34.99</strong>. The Deluxe Edition will certainly be more expensive, although we'll have to wait for the full pre-order announcement to know exactly how much. Marathon will be released on <strong>PC</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> and <strong>X </strong>with full <strong>cross-play</strong>.</p>

The primary goal of the test is to verify server stability and identify critical bugs. While some content will be limited, the test aims to provide a gameplay experience that closely resembles the live service. The Server Slam Test will run for 72 hours, from February 19, 2026, 18:00 p.m. to February 22, 2026, 18:00 p.m. (PDT).</p><p>The test build will feature a variety of new content previously introduced in developer notes. This includes the new boss mutant “Yacha,” along with newly added normal and elite mutants, and the implementation of an elite / boss-exclusive equipment system. In addition, players can experience enhanced anti-cheat measures, user interface / user experience improvements based on player feedback gathered during Steam Next Fest, overall optimization updates and new cosmetic content.</p><p><em>THE CUBE, SAVE US</em> previously gained significant attention during Steam Next Fest, achieving 3rd place in peak concurrent players and “Top 8” in the global popular demo rankings. Taking these results into account, XLGAMES plans to further refine the game’s overall quality through the Server Slam Test.</p><p>Meanwhile, XLGAMES has scheduled Steam Early Access for Q1 2026. The upcoming Server Slam Test will serve as a final comprehensive evaluation of both service stability and gameplay quality ahead of Early Access.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
