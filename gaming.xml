Fancy a jaunt back into The Zone? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> released the long awaited <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> last November, steadling improving it after an (understandably) rocky launch. There's been several hefty updates for the sequel released along the way, and it turns out the developer has been even busier than expected. GSC Game World announced Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy Enhanced Edition today, a revamp of the original three games, Shadow of Chornobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Prypiat, that mostly brings in some visual upgrades.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Over on an <a href="https://www.stalker-game.com/en/faq">FAQ</a> about the update, GSC explained that these improvements include things like enhancements to GodRays and the overall lighting system, refined surface reflections, improved 3D models for NPCs and guns, and even things like updated skyboxes. Textures have seen some upscaling too, and some aspects of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> UI has been updated to "improve usability" on both PC and console.

<p>
While they didn't specify what, there have been some tweaks to the controls to make them "more in line with current game practices" and there's some new quality of life features too, whatever they are. Full controller support is being added, and Steam Deck users will probably be happy to hear all three games have been optimised for the handheld. And there'll be cloud saves now too!
</p>
<p>
At the very least, it certainly all looks newer. I never feel particularly passionate about lighting "upgrades" like this, the vibes often feel just a little bit too different. Mostly I miss the days when games didn't have real-time lighting, a lot of games just kind of look the same now. Ah well, at least the base of it is unchanged.
</p>
<p>
This new update is coming May 20th, just a few days away, and for some added good news, this'll be a free update. The revamped version of the individual games will be listed separately in your library, so if you're averse to the modern world, you'll still be able to play as normal. Happy zoning!

                <p>If you ever wondered what the Kentucky Derby would look like if attendees traded big hats for medieval garb, Bohemia Interactive has you covered. Today, the developer released Patch 1.3 for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, which, among other big changes, brings horse racing to the game--along with a few new quests to boot.</p><p dir="ltr">The horse racing activity can be found in the Nomads' camp in the province of Trosky, and players can participate in either cross-country races or mounted archery competitions. Three new quests related to horse racing will also be added: Horses for Courses, Racing Horseshoes, and The Executioner's Edge.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH9pzsEsC4k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AH9pzsEsC4k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The patch also includes dozens of fixes across the entire game, including improved fast travel speed while riding a horse, a fix for a bug where Henry's trusty dog Mutt would at times randomly attack him, and more. The full patch notes for the 1.3 update can be found on the <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-1-3" rel="nofollow ">official KCD2 website</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Patch 1.3 launches alongside Kingdom Come: Deliverance II's first paid DLC story expansion, Brushes With Death.

Blizzard additionally used the update to introduce a major quality-of-life change, one that it initially forgot to include in the official patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 2.2.1, released on May 14, added the ability to turn in Tree of Whisper bounties from any major city, with Ravens of the Tree now located in Cerrigar, Gea Kul, Ked Bardu, Kyovashad, Kurast, and Zarbinzet. It's actually a feature originally part of Season 7 that has now been added to the game permanently.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"This is a commonly requested feature from Season 7 that has been brought back into the game to help players save time on Whisper events," Diablo community manager Adam Fletcher said in a post on the Diablo 4 <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/patch-221-raven-of-the-trees-now-found-in-each-major-town/222502" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forums</a>. "This was originally missing from the patch notes, but we will be updating the notes to include this feature."</p><p dir="ltr">It might not sound like much, but being able to turn in Whisper bounties in major cities where players likely are already spending their time significantly speeds up the entire bounty running process. Instead of completing 10 bounties, having to navigate to the map, travel to the Tree of Whispers, turn in, and then teleport back to their previous location, players can simply travel to a nearby town and turn it in immediately, or wait for when they are already in town doing various other activities to do it then.</p><p dir="ltr">The feature has since been added to the official <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24196854/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> with a comment from the development team.</p><p dir="ltr">"We recognized that backtracking to the tree to turn in Whispers made for a bloated gameplay loop," the patch notes read. "A Raven of the Tree was added to each capital city to cut down on turn in time."</p><p dir="ltr">As for other changes in the update, numerous Spiritborn skills and passives have received buffs, along with buffs for multiple Druid passives and some significant damage increases for Barbarian items like Ghor's Devastating Grips and Twin Strikes.</p><p dir="ltr">There have been a few season-specific improvements as well. The boss power Sinerat's Flame received a 25% damage buff, and Apparition Incursions are now both easier to find on the map and spawn Betraying Eyes, needed for some seasonal journey objectives, more consistently.

With its disturbing claymation art style, unique and compelling mechanics, and utterly beautiful soundtrack, it’s one of 2025's must-play indie titles. From beginning to end, this intriguing horror-themed expedition subverts expectations by pulling at your heartstrings just as much, if not more, than it tries to make you jump. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197564,197562" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>But despite my high praise, you should be aware that <em>The Midnight Walk</em> is a fairly brief title with limited replayability, so you’ll want to be sure that it’s the kind of game that speaks to you. If you’re curious just <em>how</em> long <em>The Midnight Walk</em> takes to beat, let’s dive into it.</p><h2 id="h397464"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to finish <em>The Midnight Walk</em>?</h2><p><strong><em>The Midnight Walk</em> is a short game that should take most folks</strong> <strong>around 4-5 hours to finish</strong>. This makes it an excellent choice for a single long evening where you can connect fully to the game’s unsettling but affecting story. While its short campaign and straightforward level design leave few reasons to see it through more than once, rest assured that great pacing and inventive gameplay ensure that not a single moment of those few hours is wasted.</p><p>Additionally, though <em>The Midnight Walk</em> is linear with only minimal unused space, it manages to do a fantastic job of hiding collectibles just out of sight in ways that require you to thoroughly explore your surroundings. With this in mind, completionists should have a good time rounding up every clay figure, gramophone disc, and shellphone (audio log) in the game. </p><p>To make things easier, there’s also a chapter select feature, which allows you to replay the sections of the game housing any collectibles you missed. And you can always visit Housy, a walking house that acts as a hub throughout your journey, to check and see which ones you’re missing so that you’re not wasting time retracing your steps through chapters unnecessarily. </p><p>Whether you’re looking to just absorb the emotional tale in <em>The Midnight Walk</em> or want to search for every collectible so you can earn all the game’s trophies or achievements, you can jump in now on PS5, PSVR2, and Windows PCs. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It’s been three years since Sony launched its popular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM5 Headphones</a>, and today it’s officially launched its successor--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM6</a>.

Early reviews are incredibly positive, with critics pointing out the headphones impeccable noise-canceling skills and ultra-comfortable design.</p><div title="6503414 - Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Headphones" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3524" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6503414 - Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Headphones" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Sony WH-1000XM6 - Noise-Canceling Wireless Headphones</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$448 at Amazon | $450 at Best Buy</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Sony made two big upgrades with these new headphones. First and foremost is the new noise-cancelling processor. The QN3 is said to be seven times faster than the processor found in the XM5, resulting in enhanced active noise cancellation. Using 12 microphones, it can sense and react to noises in your environment, quickly adapting its performance to reduce ambient sound.</p><p>The other big addition is a folding design. Sony abandoned this with the XM5, and while the folding system isn’t identical to the older XM4, the end result is the same. Thanks to metal joints, you can swivel and fold the earcups, making them easy to transport in the included carrying case.</p></div>                      </div><p>You’ll get up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, a wider headband for added support and comfort, and a six-microphone system that picks up and transmits crisp audio for phone calls. Of course, it also benefits from enhanced drivers, which should provide clearer audio for all your content. The headphones are available in black, midnight blue, and silver.</p><p>If you’re looking to upgrade your audio but don’t want to drop $450, both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XM5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XM4</a> headphones are currently on sale. The XM5 are $348 (was $400) and the XM4 are $298 (was $348). The XM5 offer superior noise-canceling chops compared to the XM4--but they lack the ability to fold, making them a bit more cumbersome for travel or storage. The XM4 are also on sale for $50 off, though audio quality and ANC aren’t quite up to par with the newer XM5.</p><p>The XM6 essentially combines the best aspects of both headphones while also improving overall performance. Be sure to give all three a look before deciding which is best for your needs. There are plenty of other great headphones available in 2025, and you’ll find a few of our favorites below. </p><h2>More Noise-Canceling Headphones</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM4</a> -- $298 (<del>$348</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM5</a> -- $348 (<del>$400</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJC52FP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods Max</a> -- $500 (<del>$549</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0CCZ26B5V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bose QuietComfort</a> -- $349</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a> -- $429</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ2TBSPV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sennheiser Momentum 4</a> -- $316 (<del>$380</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Solo-Wireless-Headphones-Matte/dp/B0CZPLV566?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats Solo 4</a> -- $130 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8PR4W22?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats Studio Pro</a> -- $170 (<del>$350</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-mario-kart-mario-standard-kart-review-where-to-buy/1100-6530000/">Lego's Awesome New Mario Kart Display Set Is Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joe-abercrombie-the-devils-new-fantasy-book-series-2025-amazon/1100-6531472/">First Book In Joe Abercrombie's New Fantasy Series Is Finally Here</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-optimus-prime-lego-set-restocked-and-20-off-at-amazon/1100-6509331/">Amazon Restocks Lego Transformers Optimus Prime, Offers Big Discount</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-super-mario-bowser-muscle-car-amazon-deal-retiring-lego-set/1100-6531375/">PSA: Lego Bowser's Muscle Car Is Retiring - Save Big On 3 Mario Sets Before They're Gone</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomtoc-releases-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-its-popular-form-fitting-travel-case/1100-6531332/">Tomtoc Releases Nintendo Switch 2 Version Of Its Popular Form-Fitting Travel Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-store-star-wars-day-sale-2025-jango-fett-ucs-starship-free-lego-sets/1100-6530872/">Lego Star Wars Day Sale Is Live - Get Two Free Sets With Jango Fett's UCS Starship</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-all-launch-games-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target/1100-6531115/">All The Nintendo Switch 2 Games You Can Preorder Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/studio-ghibli-movies-limited-edition-steelbook-blu-ray-best-deals-amazon-walmart/1100-6530746/">Studio Ghibli Movies With Collectible Steelbooks Are Available For Cheap</a></li>   </ul> </div>

			<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that the first of three story expansions for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is out now on all platforms, alongside the game's latest 1.3 update patch, which brings a few quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and a new horse racing feature.</p>
<p>Brushes with Death is the first of three story DLCs that players can jump into if they're looking for more Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and if you bought the Gold Edition of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, or just bought the Expansion Pass separately, then when you update Kingdom Come: Deliverance II on whatever platform you own it on, the Brushes with Death DLC will be a part of that update.</p>
<p>If you just bought the base game, then you'll be able to pick up Brushes with Death individually for $5.99 USD.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II | Brushes with Death Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KfkJHBSNPD8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Brushes with Death story sees Henry enlisted to help "<em>a mysterious artist uncover his enigmatic past.</em>" You'll travel across both maps in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's world, speaking to and occasionally fighting several new and some familiar characters throughout a number of quests to help this artist figure out his past.</p>
<p>Just last week, Warhorse Studios announced that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-breaks-3-million-sold-previous-game-surpassed-10-million-sales/">Kingdom Come series had surpassed 13 million copies sold</a>, with the first game breaking 10 million, and its recently released sequel surpassing 3 million copies sold.&nbsp;It's a massive milestone for Warhorse, who can easily be regarded as one of the best makers of open-world games.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Wccftech's review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2,</a> our reviewer, Chris Wray, didn't have enough nice things to say about the game, saying that it is "<em>a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em>"</p>

                <p>Playing video games is getting more expensive these days, with companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">Nintendo and Microsoft announcing plans to charge $80 for games</a>, and consumers are ready and willing to embrace the higher price points. That's according to analyst Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raised-xbox-console-and-game-prices-analysts-say-playstation-and-everyone-else-could-be-next" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that with Nintendo and Xbox announcing price hikes on games, "the floodgates are now open." He expects every publisher in video games that can raise prices to do so.</p><p>"The market will bear it. Plenty of gamers are willing to pay price points above $70, as shown by the high numbers of those willing to pay $100 for a few days' early access," Elliott said.</p><p>He added that, even in challenging economic times, people will spend money on what they want the most, including video games. "The rising prices won’t necessarily reduce spending. The market will bear it. Early adopters will always be early adopters," he said.</p><p>Before this, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said entertainment is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-is-not-worried-about-global-economic-turmoil-impacting-its-games/1100-6531397/" data-ref-id="1100-6531397">"fundamental human need,"</a> and as such, he's not worried about the global economic climate negatively impacting video games.</p><p>Newzoo's Manu Rosier, meanwhile, said rising game prices may lead to shifts in how money is spent, with consumers becoming potentially "more selective" with what they buy. A consumer may respond to rising individual game prices by "spending less on individual full-priced titles and more on subscriptions, discounted bundles, or long-tail live-service games," he said.</p><p>"The total spend may remain steady or even grow modestly, but the distribution across formats and platforms will likely continue to evolve. Xbox's pricing changes, and similar moves by others, could accelerate this transition toward services and ecosystems over standalone product purchases," Rosier said.</p><p>Game prices are not going up universally, as 2K Games just announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531409/" data-ref-id="1100-6531409">Mafia: The Old Country will go for $50</a> when it launches in August. But history shows that there have always been lower-priced games in the market at the same time as higher-priced ones. Daniel Ahmad of Niko Partners <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1921280736901882167" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "$50 games in 2025 is just the new $40 games from the PS4 gen and $30 games from the PS2 gen. They've always existed and usually been the price point for titles that aren't quite AAA in nature."</p><p>Mat Piscatella of Circana added that he believes consumers may shift towards free-to-play games and other "more easily accessible forms of games."</p><p>"Games like Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, etc. will likely see even more players and hours spent in their ecosystems. Players will also rely on and continue to play devices they already own a bit more rather than buy new hardware," he said. "And, as prices rise in everyday spending categories like food, gas, shelter, automotive, etc, there will be fewer and fewer dollars available for categories like gaming in the U.S."</p><p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">first $80 game is Mario Kart World</a>, which is a launch title for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>--so far, it's the only game that Nintendo has confirmed will carry that price point. As for Microsoft, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">will start charging $80 for some games later this year</a>, but the company has not said which ones.</p><p>Beyond game prices going up, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">Microsoft is raising Xbox prices</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-could-get-more-expensive-as-sony-considers-plans-to-deal-with-tariff-impact/1100-6531526/" data-ref-id="1100-6531526">Sony might do the same</a>, in part due to the impact of tariffs. The Switch 2's $450 price point, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">is $50 more expensive than the original Switch was in 2017</a> with inflation factored in. The higher price point <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-price-could-affect-early-adoption-nintendo-says/1100-6531493/" data-ref-id="1100-6531493">may negatively impact sales</a>, Nintendo has said.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-officially-announces-stellar-blade-pc-release-date-pc-specs-revealed/">Stellar Blade</a> will be out on PC in a little less than a month at this time of writing, and after it was officially announced today, pre-orders went live on Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>However, players who were eager to pre-order it were met with <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-pc-blocked-in-130-countries-devs-apparently-werent-aware.1190337/">disappointment</a> and the message that the game was unavailable in their countries. An issue that no one expected, not even the game's developer, Shift Up, <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1923052833101709517">who confirmed in a post on X,</a> responding to an upset fan, that the game does not require a PSN account to play it on PC.</p>
<p>And yet, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1294088/info/">SteamDB</a>, Stellar Blade is marked as unavailable in <strong>130 countries</strong>, just like every other PlayStation-published game on Steam.</p>
<p>Requiring a PSN account to play PlayStation games on Steam is an issue that blew up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-no-longer-purchasable-steam-refunds/">Helldivers 2</a>, and while <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-cancels-mandatory-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-update/">Sony did end up relenting in that case</a>, how it handled that whole saga, and every other PC release for PlayStation games, made it clear that PSN account sign-in is something PlayStation and Sony want in all of its PC releases.</p>
<p>Which is what makes this case all the more upsetting, because PlayStation is seemingly punishing players who live in countries where PSN isn't officially available.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there's been no official word from PlayStation on the issue, and based on the few replies the official Stellar Blade X account has given players bringing the issue to them, it seems like Shift Up has been blindsided by this. Hopefully, we'll learn more soon and will update this article as more on this comes to light.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/persona5-the-phantom-x-brings-the-phantom-thieves-to-pc-and-mobile-devices-next-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Atlus has revealed its free-to-play spinoff, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona5: The Phantom X</a>, is coming to PC and mobile devices June 26, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Persona series developer announced a release date for its latest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-5">Persona 5</a> spinoff with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQsdIWTGn_Y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an hour-long breakdown video</a> today. It’s being developed as part of a collaboration between Atlus, Sega, and Perfect World and reintroduces players to the Phantom Thieves along with new faces, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese and English versions of Persona5: The Phantom X will launch simultaneously next month, but this scaled-down story from the Persona 5 universe isn’t completely new. It was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-the-phantom-x-announced-for-ios-and-android">announced in 2023</a> and originally launched in China in 2024. The live-service title's developers have continued to iron out the kinks since then, and now, it’s finally ready to reach new audiences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Encompassed in the unique turn-based RPG gameplay and setting of <em>Persona 5</em>, players will lead a double life as a student and a Phantom Thief with a brand-new protagonist and band of Phantom Thieves,” an official description from Atlus says. “During the day, players will build up life experience as a student and engage in various activities such as hanging out with your friends and part time jobs, while at night, they will sneak into the cognitive dungeons to steal Treasures and change the twisted desires of corrupt adults!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re a Persona 5 fan, you’ll be happy to know The Phantom X still features that game’s stylish turn-based gameplay. Players can also look forward to exploring jobs and extracurricular activities while enjoying new mini-games unique to this specific entry. Atlus wants you to know this is a tried-and-true Persona experience, as it confirms its involvement in writing and supervising some of the original side stories the game offers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona5: The Phantom X will be viewed through the eyes of an entirely new protagonist as well as a new collection of Phantom Thieves, but Joker and other original Phantom Thieves members will show up via special contracts, too. Players will also be free to take advantage of new modes, including a PvE mode called The Velvet Trials as well as new Mementos and a new Guild feature.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Persona5: The Phantom X Steam Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“However, one regret we have is that we had to take this long to be able to announce a Western release,” Sega's Jun Matsunaga said during the video presentation, “and we’re very sorry to our Western fans for keeping them in the dark for so long. As we know, this game was originally developed by Perfect World in China. When we first started to plan for a global release, for a series like Persona that is very popular in the West, we wanted to make sure that for a Western release, everything in the game from the setting to the tone of story matched the standard Western fans had for a Persona game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 5 launched all the way back in 2016 and has received a plethora of spinoffs since. These include crossovers with other titles such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/07/persona-5s-joker-is-coming-to-super-smash-bros-ultimate-as-dlc">Super Smash Bros.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i%E2%80%99m-actually-getting-car-sick-on-the-internet-road-trip.1190388/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/internet-roadtrip-take-me-to-canada<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m going to Canada! I’m in a car with more than 1,000 other strangers. There’s a cat in the backseat, and a bear following the car. There’s a baby crying in the back. A fly is stuck in the car. And — uh oh! — I’m car sick.</p><p>Neal Agarwal’s <a href="https://neal.fun/internet-roadtrip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Internet Roadtrip</a> takes the idea of Twitch Plays Pokémon and puts it in Google Maps. To navigate, the collective group votes every few seconds by clicking a direction on the steering wheel. We’re listening to a local music station, and a chat on the side of my browser is essentially parents arguing in the front seat. (That’s how I know there’s a cat, fly, and baby in the car; they’re popping into the chat to meow, buzz, or cry.) I hopped in the car a few hours ago, and we’ve been crawling down one long Maine backroad. There’s not a lot to see, aside from trees and power lines. Don’t get me wrong, though, they’re lovely trees.</p><p>The Internet Roadtrip started in Boston on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.404media.co/900-people-are-collectively-driving-an-internet-roadtrip-on-google-street-view/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to 404 Media</a>. There’s a map on the bottom of the screen that’s logging the journey thus far. It headed south from Boston, navigating toward Providence, Rhode Island, before cutting back up into Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and now Maine. We’re been on this one long road for quite a while, but we’re coming up to a crucial juncture: Do we turn right or left onto U.S. Route 202? Thankfully, left won, and we’re still heading north to Canada. But now, somehow, we’re driving on the wrong side of the road.</p><p>I’m taking this drive as a passenger, abstaining from voting and just enjoying the tunes and the drive while I write. We’re listening to a local college radio station, WBOR, which broadcasts from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. (The theme of the music right now is cocaine and pills. I’ve listened to several songs about the cocaine blues.) Hours ago, the car passed through Brunswick and successfully navigated into the Bowdoin campus and past the building the radio station operates out from. The radio station DJs, following along, shouted out the road trip as it passed by. It <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sorenspicknall.bsky.social/post/3lp5azsatik2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was a very wholesome moment</a>.</p><p>Every so often, the WBOR broadcaster will make a reference to all the new listeners. “Death to the interstate,” the morning DJ said, addressing a message from the Internet Roadtrippers. “Safe travels if you’re on a road trip.”</p><p>Unfortunately, I think I’m getting car sick. I can’t tell if this is a real phenomena or if it’s all in my head. I’m used to getting nauseous while playing video games — a lot of people do. But getting car sick while watching Google Maps refresh is a new one for me.&nbsp;</p><p>Motion sickness happens when your brain gets mixed signals from your eyes, ears, and muscles. <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12782-motion-sickness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cleveland Clinic puts it like this</a>: You see the movement of trees and signs passing by, signaling to your brain that you’re moving. But your muscles and joints know you’re sitting stationary. The mixed signals make your brain confused, then you feel sick. So yeah, it does feel like it’s possible I’m actually car sick from sitting in a make-believe car.</p><p>Despite the nausea, I don’t plan on getting off this ride. We almost got stuck in a ditch. Again, we’re driving on the wrong side of the road. Mom and Dad are fighting about whether we should drive by the lake or not. I’m not sure if we’re going to make it to Canada. What happens at the border crossing? These are questions I’m excited to see answered.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-staff-goodbye"><h3>A Fond Farewell To Polygon, From The People Who Worked There</h3></a><p>"It was a good website.

Nintendo will likely be the "primary partner for third-party game publishers" on console in five years, an analyst firm has forecast, by which time <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> will have hit 100m units sold.
</p>
<p>
A fresh report on the coming year in video games - and beyond - from veteran firm DFC Intelligence states that Nintendo is likely to beat its own forecast for Switch 2 sales this year, albeit slightly. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">expects to shift 15m Switch 2 consoles before 31st March 2026</a>, though DFC forecasts Nintendo will in reality likely sell 16m - enough to say it has beat expectations. With supply chain improvements, sales could be even higher still - as many as 20m, DFC believes.
</p>
<p>
"Reflecting its historically conservative approach to new product forecasting, Nintendo is estimating sales of 15m Switch 2 units through the end of its fiscal year in March 2026," DFC wrote in its report, shared with Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p>
"When the original Switch launched in March 2017, Nintendo initially projected 10m units for the fiscal year but ultimately sold 15m units in that period. Based on that track record, the fact that Nintendo is forecasting a 15m unit number gives us confidence that they will be able to ramp up supply and navigate tariff challenges."
</p>
<p>
With the delay of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> to 2026, the launch of Switch 2 will be this year's biggest driver of video game spending - particularly so in Japan, DFC expects, where Nintendo has a competitively-priced local model for that market. 
</p>
<p>
Looking to the future, DFC says Switch 2 will hit 100m sales by 2029 and be the leading console system at that time. 
</p>
<p>
Both Sony and Microsoft have expressed interest in launching their own handheld devices, and both companies are also widely expected to be prepping their own next home consoles to arrive from 2027 onwards. But Nintendo launching Switch 2 now means it will have several years of headstart on PS6 and the next Xbox.
</p>
<p>
"DFC forecasts that by the end of 2029 the Switch 2 will have sold over 100m units making it the leading console system by a wide margin," the firm wrote. "The next few years could see Nintendo for the first time becoming the primary partner for third-party game publishers."
</p>
<p>
For context, Switch is currently on 152m sales after eight years. PlayStation 5 is on 74.9m after four and a half years. Xbox Series X/S is believed to be at around 30m units after the same time period, though Microsoft does not release official hardware figures.
</p>
<p>
Only seven console platforms have passed 100m over the years, with more than half from Nintendo: Game Boy/Color, Nintendo DS, Wii, Switch, PS1, PS2 and PS4. 
</p>
<p>
PS2 remains the best-selling console of all time at around 160m units sold - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-expects-switch-1-to-become-its-best-selling-hardware-ever-this-year-but-fall-just-short-of-ps2-record">though Switch 1 is giving it a run for its money, and now sits less than 8m consoles away</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's a new Epic Games Store MEGA sale <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/mega-sale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live now</a>, featuring discounts for lots of fun PC games. First things first, though: alongside the discounts, Epic is also bringing back the sale's trademark freebies, starting with the psychedelic indie horror game <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/happy-game-35a105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Happy Game</a> and with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dead-island-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Island 2</a>, both of which can be added to your libraries for free until Thursday, May 22 at 5 PM.</p>
<p>Dead Island 2 is, of course, the bigger of the two offerings, having sold 4 million units to date. The project started with Yager Development and then moved to Sumo Digital, but it was Deep Silver Dambuster that eventually brought it over the end of the line in a rather successful fashion. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-cool-zombie-slaying-and-little-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned a 7.5/10 score from Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>Games that go through development hell hardly turn out great, but Dambuster Studio proved with Dead Island 2 that this is not always the case, although the game is far from a masterpiece. While the gameplay works and feels quite fun at the start of the game, things become repetitive very quickly due to the linearity of the experience and the shallowness of the combat system. Offering nothing more than some mindless fun, the game would have been more than fine if launched at a lower price, but at full price, Dead Island 2 doesn't offer that much to justify it.</em></p>
<p>If you don't fancy these games, there's plenty of engaging titles that you can grab at discounts in the Epic Games Store 2025 MEGA sale, and you can even take advantage of boosted Epic Rewards (from 5% to 20%) for all purchases made in the store using Epic's payment system until 31 August. Additionally, when using Epic's payment system, you can get 20% back permanently on Fortnite, Rocket League, and Fall Guys purchases.</p>

            <p>
There's a newish Persona game on the way next month, and it is, of course, yet another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5</a> spinoff. I'm not sure if another cow in existence has been so thoroughly milked before, but here we are. I call <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a>: The Phantom X (that's its name, by the way) newish because it's actually been available in China through an ongoing open beta for the last year. Earlier today, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/atlus">Atlus</a> held a pre-recorded livestream confirming that the mobile game is finally coming westward, and that it'll be getting a PC release as well.
</p>
<p>
Now, despite being Persona 5 by name and aesthetic, it'll be offering up some fresh characters for once. You're still the Phantom Thieves, just a different bunch - the protagonist in this one is called Wonder, and the animal companion is an owl-looking critter. 
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="P5X News -First announcement! We’re the Phantom Thieves, and we’re here to steal your heart!-" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQsdIWTGn_Y?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Much like in the original, during the day you'll hang out with friends and study, and at night you'll venture out into dungeons. Apparently you will be able to meet Joker and other characters from the almost decade-old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-japanese-games-to-play-on-pc">JRPG</a> (see what I mean about milking that cow) as part of special contracts. You'll apparently also find PvE elements called Velvet trials, alongside mini-games and the ability to make and join guilds.
</p>
<p>
It's definitely worth mentioning that this very much does seem to be Atlus' (very late) response to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>, as it is a free-to-play gacha game. Not ideal, particularly for those that find it difficult to play gacha games, but I'm sure Atlus will figure out how they can make yet another spinoff at some point.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and that release date! It's June 26th, a little over a month away, meaning you could probably fit in a Persona 5 replay as long as you just don't eat or sleep at all until then.

<section><p>Even just a few hours was enough to show the power of WoW's upcoming housing-decoration systems, which Blizzard plans on expanding for years to come.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>There's a reason Blizzard used <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft's</a> 20th-anniversary livestream in November 2024 as the stage to finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/">announce player housing</a>. It's likely to be the biggest feature in the game's two-decade history: a huge undertaking that players have wanted Blizzard to commit to since WoW first launched back in 2004. The news that Blizzard was finally rolling up its sleeves and tackling it was a huge deal that had players buzzing with ideas, possibilities, and more than a few concerns.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard is buzzing with ideas and possibilities, too. That much is clear after spending several hours going hands-on with an early version of WoW's player housing and talking to the developers behind it. There's no shortage of "what if this was possible?" or "that's a great idea!" conversations during my day at Blizzard's Boston office. It's the first time a group of players outside Blizzard have been able to take the game's player-housing decoration tools for a spin, and the team seems eager to learn what members of the press and various WoW content creators in attendance think, both good and bad. Blizzard employees are constantly jotting down ideas or making notes about player feedback. It's almost as if you can see light bulbs going off in real time about what might be possible.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fQXHFrLX6A4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The basics of player housing seem set in stone--the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/">actual mechanics of decorating a home</a>, the philosophy behind all players being homeowners, and the social-driven nature of the entire endeavor--and have already been officially detailed by Blizzard in a series of blog posts dedicated to the subject. Every <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/">player who wants a house will be able to get one</a>, and homes will be located in neighborhoods (one for each faction) where players will have persistent neighbors. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-system-will-reward-decor-based-on-past-achievements/1100-6531163/">Home decor will be doled out as quest rewards</a>, from professions, and other areas of the game. Those are the major facts we already knew, but the finer details, as well as the big ideas for what the housing system could be potentially capable of in the future, all still feel a bit ethereal.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard seems well aware it hasn't thought of everything when it comes to housing. It's both a little concerning but also, in a strange way, refreshing. There is an air of possibility that comes with seeing such a game-changing feature still in its infancy. Blizzard has made clear that the version of housing that will launch as part of the Midnight expansion (or, as has been heavily implied, ahead of it) will just be a starting point. It won't launch with 20 years of assets at the beginning, nor will all the tools and functions players might like to see be there on day one.</p><p dir="ltr">Lead game designer Toby Ragaini says the first version of housing Blizzard is shipping will be "an initial step." The team is already planning multiple years ahead for a feature that hasn't even launched yet, he said, and the size and scope of the endeavor is definitely a little intimidating.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a huge responsibility," Ragaini tells GameSpot. "Players have been asking for player housing for decades now. The belief has always been we will release it when we feel like we can do it justice. We were determined not to just simply meet players' expectations; we needed to exceed them…It's something that's going to be with the game for as long as there is WoW. We really couldn't do a half measure."</p><p dir="ltr">At least on the housing-decoration front, Blizzard already seems poised to exceed expectations. While much of what we experienced as part of the hands-on housing demo has already been "revealed," actually using the systems for myself, and seeing them used in the hands of a pro like Jay Hwang--a principal artist on WoW and the player housing system's lead decoration designer--completely changed my preconceived opinion on what the housing tools could be capable of.</p><p dir="ltr">On its surface, WoW's house-decoration system is simple. Players will have a collection of decor earned from quests, bought from vendors, or gained through other sources, that can be placed within a home. A house is capable of holding thousands and thousands of decor objects. Decor can be placed simply using the game's Basic placement mode, in which decor will attempt to snap to walls, ceilings, or floors without fuss. For finer placement, players can turn on Advanced mode, which disables decor collision and can be used for more granular positioning. Players can additionally rotate and resize decor. As Blizzard has previously revealed, a player's home on the inside can be as big or small as they want, ranging from just one room to a mansion of dozens. There are a variety of different room layouts to choose from, including pre-built staircase rooms that can be used to create a multi-story home. A top-down room layout mode makes it simple to add or delete rooms.</p><p dir="ltr">For the demo, Blizzard starts each player with a few pre-decorated rooms made by Hwang to help players to get an idea for what might be possible, and from there it's on each participant to explore their creativity and push the decorating tools to their limit in whatever way they see fit. As someone who is not typically into home building or decorating (both in-game or in real-life), it's a little nerve-wracking trying to be creative and cook up a cool room while curious Blizzard employees look over my shoulder, eager to see how I interact with the systems they've long been working on.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite not being a survival-crafting player accustomed to placing walls and adjusting objects, it isn't long before I'm putting together a magical study or a Forsaken-themed dungeon, all with relative ease. I found WoW's housing tools extremely simple to use, albeit with a few minor frustrations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1647/16470614/4495662-wowhousingpreviewstudy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495662" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1647/16470614/4495662-wowhousingpreviewstudy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495662"></a><figcaption>A room I built using WoW's interior-decoration tools.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1647/16470614/4495662-wowhousingpreviewstudy.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The basics are easy. Clicking and dragging decor, resizing them, and placing them in the 3D space works like you would expect it to, which is a bigger compliment than it might seem. A hotbar of housing tools at the bottom of the screen lets players easily swap between modes, whether it's decor placement or changing the color of decor with various dyes. Some basic functionality you might expect, like the ability to place an object multiple times or copy and paste it in some way, isn't currently present, resulting in a bit of menu fatigue as you need to open the menu, click an object, place it, and then rinse and repeat every single time. Despite that and my lack of virtual-home-building skills, slapping together a room still felt relatively quick, and I came away happy with the handful of rooms I was able to create in the span of a few hours.</p><p dir="ltr">While actually assembling rooms felt straightforward in a positive way, I did fairly quickly begin to find the list of decor I could use lacking. All of the basics are there: various chairs, rugs, lamps, beds, and tables. Many of the decor items are themed around various WoW races like Humans, Blood Elves, Night Elves, Tauren, and others. Hwang says it's a priority for the team to let players decorate their homes according to various race and class fantasies, and so Blizzard focused on providing those kinds of decorating assets first, though there are a few oddball items, like two different guillotines, as well. Overall, the number of decor items on offer is serviceable, but still feels like there are too few objects to satisfy those truly looking to create their Azerothian dream hom54e.</p><p dir="ltr">That was, until I started paying more attention to the Advanced mode, thanks in part to a live demo Hwang gives that shows off the decorating tool's full power. Because using Advanced mode eliminates object collision and ignores the standard object-snapping rules, it can be used to essentially make entirely new objects out of existing ones. Suddenly, a bookshelf floating in the middle of a wall can become a kitchen cabinet. A fence angled in mid-air in a particular way can become a stair railing. A container, moved halfway under the floor and combined with a small pillow, can become a cat bed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495664-wowhousingpreviewadvancedmode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495664" data-ratio="0.56262626262626" data-width="1980" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495664-wowhousingpreviewadvancedmode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495664"></a><figcaption>An example of what's possible using the decoration system's Advanced mode.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495664-wowhousingpreviewadvancedmode.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's in the Advanced decoration mode where the true genius of WoW's player-housing system is hidden. Suddenly, the possibilities seem nearly endless, even more so when combined with the ability to resize objects and to use additional walls, pillars, and other objects to transform cookie-cutter room layouts into unique ones or even turn a single room into an entire multi-room home in and of itself.</p><p dir="ltr">Once I started to look at objects not exactly as they were, but in terms of their individual pieces and components, it was as if an entire new realm of possibility had been unlocked. There aren't just hundreds of decor items to use--there are thousands, all of which can be used in all manner of creative ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Hwang says he is a fan of games where building houses is a key component, like Valheim and Minecraft, and wanted to create a decoration system with both simple and more-complex tools. As he continued to work on the decorating system and bumped into various limitations, he began to ask if it would be possible to incorporate more and more features, like Advanced mode.</p><p dir="ltr">"We got to where it is because we are the kind of player we are making the feature for," Hwang says.</p><p dir="ltr">By the end of our hands-on demo time, it's difficult not to be impressed by what everyone in attendance has accomplished. One player crafted a 3D-platforming maze. Another made an elaborate wrestling arena. Others combined decor or used the Advanced mode to craft items and rooms that I couldn't even comprehend how'd they'd done it, much less try to replicate it myself. If this is what a handful of people can create in the span of just a few hours, what will the game's playerbase of millions come up with once it's fully in their hands? With the tools Blizzard is providing, it's easy to see players creating dance clubs, taverns, casinos, sprawling apartment complexes, and everything in between. Add in the fact that the decor available at launch will be just a fraction of the total possible decor assets in the game, all of which can be manipulated in all kinds of unforeseen ways, and it's easy to be overwhelmed at the possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">"Those two decades of content for WoW [are] enormously valuable right now," Ragaini says. "Suddenly, all these assets, every piece of furniture you've ever seen in the game, for example, is something that could potentially, and fairly easily, be turned into decor for the player. We're not going to hit every single one--there [are] tens of thousands of items at that scale--but we'll get there eventually. It's just a matter of prioritization."</p><p dir="ltr">It's clear that Blizzard has built a powerful tool--one that hands players the keys to the proverbial castle and says, "Go wild." In a game that has become increasingly on rails over the last two decades, and where many expansion-specific systems in the past have often felt restrictive and intended to be engaged with in a very specific way, the feeling of freedom found in the housing-decorating system caught me off guard. That this is the tool in what is essentially its first form, before UI improvements, added features, and thousands upon thousands more decor objects, is even more astounding.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when those improvements and additional decor rewards will be coming, Blizzard won't say. After all, it's not even ready to disclose when housing is officially arriving. But like many other more recent WoW features like skyriding, hero talents, or delves, Blizzard is treating housing as an ongoing evergreen feature and not a one-off expansion bullet point for Midnight. Ragaini says Blizzard already has a multi-year content roadmap for housing, but it's leaving ample room for player feedback and suggestions.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're going to be listening," Ragaini says. "We're going to be iterating and improving from day one. It would be premature to have this perfectly laid-out plan, because that would assume we know perfectly well how players will respond."</p><p dir="ltr">It's easy to imagine players spending dozens upon dozens of hours building fantastical rooms and elaborate homes once housing launches: an entire game within an already massive one. Blizzard's hope is that by giving a home to essentially every player who wants one, it will become a core pillar of the game moving forward, with housing rewards sprinkled throughout the game's various activities serving as a feedback loop for players to return to their home and see what new items they unlocked after completing dungeons or unlocking an achievement.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495666-wowhousingpreviewneighborhoods.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495666" data-ratio="0.56262626262626" data-width="1980" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495666-wowhousingpreviewneighborhoods.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495666"></a><figcaption>Neighborhoods will be an important part of WoW player housing, but details are still light.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495666-wowhousingpreviewneighborhoods.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If, however, a player has no real interest in spending much time in their home, Blizzard says that's fine too. There will be "prefab" rooms designed to already look like specific parts of a house, such as a foyer, that players will be able to place down and quickly decorate for those who don't want to get into the nitty-gritty details of building themselves. Ultimately, Blizzard says that if a player doesn't want to engage with housing at all, they don't have to. There will be no player power associated with housing, and Blizzard seems very keen to not repeat the mistakes of Warlords of Draenor's Garrisons, where players could gather crafting materials and essentially access everything they ever needed without having to leave their own personal base. As one of the core design goals behind housing is for it to be a social experience, Blizzard wants to avoid the pitfall of having homes be a place for things like a mission table or an herb garden that would eliminate reasons to venture out into Azeroth.</p><p dir="ltr">If there was one landmine Blizzard seems primed to step on during the demo, it's a prominent "shop" icon located directly in the housing decoration interface. Though it isn't functioning during the hands-on, Blizzard confirms that it will, in theory, take players to WoW's in-game cash shop, where certain housing items will be available for purchase.</p><p dir="ltr">That raises a few alarm bells, to say the least, if for no other reason than it would be the first time a button to the in-game shop was displayed so prominently, as it's normally relegated to WoW's main menu or a small button in the right corner of the game's UI. Blizzard emphasizes that it plans to treat player-housing items for sale just as it does mounts and other cosmetics currently, and that the majority of items for housing will be earnable through gameplay. That being said, Blizzard seems open to the idea of removing the shop tab from the decorating interface, though whether or not that will actually happen by launch remains to be seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard, at the end of the day, seems open to a lot of things when it comes to housing, as it hones in on what the feature will look like initially but banks ideas for the future. It's poised to be the biggest evergreen addition to WoW in the game's 21-year life, but it's also one that may not reach its full potential for many years to come: a fact that Blizzard isn't shying away from. There are still plenty of unknowns, like additional details about player neighborhoods, the ability to decorate the outside of homes, and the cadence and scarcity of decor rewards. Those are all things Blizzard isn't ready to talk about just yet, and any one of them, if not done correctly, could potentially derail one of the most important features in WoW history. Even still, this early version of the housing-decoration system, and the creativity it is likely to unleash, feels special. It may have taken over two decades to become a reality, but if Blizzard can stick the landing, WoW's player housing system could be worth the wait.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-protocol/" data-ref-id="5000-499449">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</a> is the anime MMORPG Blue Protocol brought back from the dead, only it's from a completely different development team and, unlike the original Blue Protocol, will actually be receiving a Western release later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">You may remember Blue Protocol as a long-in-development MMO from Bandai Namco. The game was released in Japan in 2023, with a planned Western release in conjunction with Amazon Games planned for 2024. Unfortunately, the game struggled to find an audience, and Bandai Namco announced last year it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-and-bandai-namco-cancel-western-release-for-mmo-as-service-ends-in-japan/1100-6526156/" data-ref-id="1100-6526156">end service for Blue Protocol in January 2025, with its Western release also canceled</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI_qVWHiHnQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aI_qVWHiHnQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Flash forward to now, and Chinese gaming giant Tencent has struck a deal with Bandai Namco to use Blue Protocol's assets, and under a new studio called Shanghai Bokura Network Technology, has essentially rebuilt and will be rereleasing Blue Protocol with a new subtitle: Star Resonance. It's slated to release this year on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and on mobile devices, with cross-play and cross-progression between platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Blue Protocol: Star Resonance is now confirmed for a Western release, it still doesn't have an exact release date. The original Blue Protocol was originally slated to release on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 as well as PC, but at least for now, Star Resonance appears to be on PC and mobile only.</p><p dir="ltr">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance has actually been playable in beta form in China, and playtesters have already reported quite a number of changes from Bandai Namco's version. The game still features an anime-aesthetic, but its visuals are now closer to the look of something like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/genshin-impact/" data-ref-id="5000-500614">Genshin Impact</a>. Players have also reported significant combat changes and updates to Blue Protocol's various progression systems, as well as new classes. While it will feature some of the gacha mechanics games like Genshin Impact are known for, they will be relegated to cosmetic items like costumes and weapon skins.</p>
