			<p>Build a Rocket Boy is launching its first game, MindsEye, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-gets-june-10-release-date-pre-orders-and-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in around two and a half weeks</a>. The development studio founded by former Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies has finally shared the PC system requirements that users must meet to play the game on the platform.</p>
<p>MindsEye is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5, so its requirements are fairly in line with what we've seen in the genre.</p>
<div><p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em></p><ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10/11 64 Bit with latest updates</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel Core i5-12400F / AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT 6GB VRAM</em></li>
<li><em><strong>DirectX:</strong>&nbsp;Version 12</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Network:</strong>&nbsp;Broadband Internet connection</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;70 GB available space</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><p><em><strong>Recommended:</strong></em></p><ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10/11 64 Bit with latest updates</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel Core i7-13700K / AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT 8GB VRAM</em></li>
<li><em><strong>DirectX:</strong>&nbsp;Version 12</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Network:</strong>&nbsp;Broadband Internet connection</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;70 GB available space</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On PC, the game will feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-125-games-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-june-more-dlss-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a>, guaranteeing accelerated frame rates for owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs. GeForce RTX 40 users can still enable Frame Generation, while RTX 30 and 20 users can activate Super Resolution. The integration of AMD and/or Intel upscalers hasn't been confirmed yet, though it is likely.</p>
<p>Despite MindsEye Game Director Leslie Benzies's previous work on GTA, this game won't be an open-world extravaganza with tons of activities and content. Instead, it is a narrative-driven action/adventure thriller that aims to deliver thrilling cinematics, car chases, combat, and the like.</p>
<p>MindsEye also ties into <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-everywhere-gta-producer-leslie-benzies-teaser-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everywhere</a>, Build a Rocket Boy's user-generated content platform. In the future, players will be able to create UGC for this game in a way that Associate Game director Adam Whiting has compared to customer Minecraft servers. Users will also get to exploit MindsEye assets elsewhere in Everywhere's creations.</p>
<p>Everywhere doesn't have a release date yet.</p>

The bundle comes with two operator skins, the first of which, "Eve Macarro," shows Eve in a red sequin dress. The second, "Ruska Rogue," depicts Eve in a black fit. The bundle also includes three weapons, including the "Releve" AK-74, the "Plie" Saug SMG, and the "Arabesque" 9MM pistol.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4498838-screenshot2025-05-21at2.53.27pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498838" data-ratio="0.56545961002786" data-width="718" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4498838-screenshot2025-05-21at2.53.27pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498838"></a><figcaption>Ballerina comes to Call of Duty.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4498838-screenshot2025-05-21at2.53.27pm.png"></figure><p>What's more, the DLC includes a "Dance With Death" finishing move, as well as the "Pirouette" emote, the "Keepsake" weapon charm, the "Caged Grace" emblem, the "Pas de Duex" calling card, and the "Take a Bow" loading screen.</p><p>This bundle will be available in Call of Duty at some point in Season 4, but not at launch.

The rewards include the Essex Model 07 rifle and a Ballerina-themed Nunchuck for people who own the new BlackCell DLC. The rest of the rewards, or what it takes to unlock them, were not disclosed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4498839-screenshot2025-05-21at2.53.35pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498839" data-ratio="0.55817174515235" data-width="722" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4498839-screenshot2025-05-21at2.53.35pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498839"></a><figcaption>The two Ballerina skins coming to Call of Duty.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4498839-screenshot2025-05-21at2.53.35pm.png"></figure><p>In addition to the Ballerina DLC, Call of Duty Season 4 is adding new guns, maps, modes, and more.

But I wanted to see if there’s other ways that we can have people engage and get to know Pikmin that’s outside of the population that plays video games, for example.” </p><p>Miyamoto continued, apparently having waited years to unleash all his <em>Pikmin </em>thoughts on the first person lucky enough to ask him about the strange franchise featuring a tiny alien man controlling an army of small, cute critters. </p><p>“And it really stems back to 20 years ago when we did a presentation where it starts off with, there’s a Pikmin next to you,” said Miyamoto. “And so in Nintendo there’s sort of like an unwritten rule. Mario needs to stay in the <em>Mario </em>universe, or <em>Splatoon </em>needs to stay in <em>Splatoon</em>, and we don’t use different characters in the same place. But <em>Pikmin </em>has this kind of unwritten rule where they’re okay to appear with other characters.”</p><p>When asked if <em>Pikmin </em>could ever appear in movies or TV shows, Miyamoto couldn’t say yes or no, of course, but explained that he would love for that to happen one day. </p><p>“I really see Nintendo as sort of like a talent agency and we have within our roster a lot of talented characters,” said Miyamoto. “So we create a game with a certain gameplay concept, gameplay experience, and then we look at the roster and see who would best fit this gameplay concept or experience.”</p><p>“So looking at things from that perspective, I think <em>Pikmin </em>has a lot of potential to be used in many different occasions. When you’re looking at small kids, they have a certain appeal for things that are cute and when they grow older, maybe in their twenties, they start to lose appeal for that. But I think <em>Pikmin </em>has this unique ability to have appeal across a broad range in that it’s still appealing for both younger audiences and older audiences and in Japan. And so I’m hoping that we can expand that globally. So whether it’s some kind of a movie or show, things like that would be really fun.”</p><p>Look, Nintendo, Miyamoto has done so much for you and your company. I say you give the man a few million dollars and a team and let him make all the weird <em>Pikmin </em>crap he wants to make while he’s still able to do so. It’s the least you can do. And the world would be a better place if we had more <em>Pikmin </em>stuff in it. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-elden-ring-nightreigns-combat-designer-aimed-to-speed-up-the-action-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As our exclusive IGN First coverage of Elden Ring Nightreign continues, we bring you our interview with game and combat designer Takuya Miyazawa. Enjoy!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>To start, can you describe what it's like working at FromSoftware and getting to work on such highly acclaimed titles like Elden Ring and Nightreign?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takuya Miyazawa - Game and Combat Designer on Nightreign:
</strong>I, myself, previously a huge Souls fan. I'm a big fan of these games and what the company's made, so it's a huge honor to get to work on such titles and as well as the fun of creating these games. I do feel a little bit of pressure and responsibility from the fans who enjoy these games as well, so thank you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Going into Nightreign, there are a lot of really subtle differences between the combat mechanics of base Elden Ring and Nightreign. Can you talk a little bit about why you felt like you should change up some of those mechanics for a multiplayer game like Nightreign and how the resulting gameplay fits Nightreign's fast-paced multiplayer style a little bit better?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, the changes for the design of Nightreign… Well first, let me give a little introduction to the general design of Nightreign itself. So, as you know, it uses Elden Ring as a base for the design, so the world and a lot of the assets and the base combat flow comes from Elden Ring. But while it does use it as a base for enemies and such, one area that we wanted to focus on with Nightreign was how we encounter these enemies, the flow of the battle, and the abilities you can use. And so having Elden Ring as a base allowed us to branch out and experiment in these other areas, making it into something that stood out from Elden Ring and becoming its own new thing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"While the game base sits with Elden Ring at its core, we wanted to create a gameplay experience that was ultimately very different."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So while the game base sits with Elden Ring at its core, we wanted to create a gameplay experience that was ultimately very different. Elden Ring is a much more slow-paced, a lot more open-ended. You take your time and carefully go through the world, but Nightreign is what we're calling a short RPG. So there are some constraints here. For example, the three-day, three-night time aspect, and the limitations on the player; but at the same time while we’re putting these limitations on the player in terms of structure, we wanted to allow them some freedom points that they didn't otherwise have with Elden Ring. So the way they traverse the map, they can sprint and they can clamber up walls quickly. Let's see… there's no fall damage compared to Elden Ring. So while we put these constraints on the players from a structural point of view, we wanted to open up and allow them this freedom from a gameplay point of view as well. So it was about creating that balance and that contrast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of status leveling and how the players build their character: With Elden Ring, of course, you had a character creation and building from the very start, but with Nightreign, you select from a preset character as a sort of archetype to start with and then you're free to change your weapons, change your equipment, and change your play style a little bit on the fly. So while you could start as a tank, you don't necessarily have to fulfill that tank role from a gameplay perspective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We wanted players to enjoy the role play of each character more from their sort of character traits and their abilities than a sort of preconceived notion of approach. We also wanted to reduce the amount of time players spend in the menu, actually, within the game. So instead of carefully checking their stats and going through the leveling process, it's a lot more on the fly, it's a lot more ad hoc, and we wanted to reduce and condense these elements that we found in our previous games but in a tighter, more compact experience, this short-form RPG experience for Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So those are just a few of the aspects that we've tried to consider when approaching this from a multiplayer co-op standpoint.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The boss that we got to check out today as we were playing was Libra: Creature of Night</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for this particular boss battle… Obviously for each boss battle in the game, we're trying to give them their own idiosyncrasies and their own unique touches to make them stand apart and feel original. We wanted each of them to feel like their own experience. So with Libra in particular, we kind of added this trade-off feature that takes place before the battle. And of course, this can allow the players to acquire a new special weapon or a significant level-up or something that benefits them. But of course, being the nature of Libra and the nature of the game, it's not always going to be exactly in their favor, so we wanted to create this interesting risk-reward sort of feature for this particular boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the actual experience during combat itself, we wanted this sort of nature of Libra to be reflected in the gameplay as well. So this sort of duality aspect of the character, both in terms of its appearance and its behavior. So we wanted to give it a two-type move set. So first, it has the sorceries and traps that can kind of confuse and trick the player and then also the sort of more power and damage-focused attacks that come as well. So we wanted this duality to reflect both in its appearance and the pre-battle and the gameplay experience as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the things that really struck me about the boss battle was that it almost reminded me of an MMO raid kind of boss with how you had to work together and coordinate with your squad to avoid the full effect of some of its attacks. Was MMO boss design any kind of inspiration in creating this boss fight and if not, what really inspired you in those aspects of the boss design?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, we paid attention to other genres such as MMOs and the boss fights within them and we did take some notes and some inspiration from these. But one thing we wanted to be careful of was the fact that seeing as Nightreign is a co-op, multiplayer focused game, we still wanted to take care during these boss fights that when another player is drawing aggro, the boss still feels like a significant threat to other players in the group. So even if another player is drawing the aggro, the attacks that the boss is going to do and the way it's behaving is still going to keep other players on their toes even if they're sort of flanking it or taking a more solo-oriented approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I definitely felt that, by the way. Feeling threatened even while I didn’t hold the aggro of the boss. Shifting gears to classes, what goes into designing a character class for Nightreign? Are you looking to fill specific archetypes? Do you come up with a cool idea for a skill and then design a class based around that, or what does that process really look like?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's quite an unorthodox approach we took to character design in Nightreign, similar to what we started with in Elden Ring. So for instance, we start with these kind of general roles or role titles for each of the characters, such as the tank we mentioned earlier or a mage type. So we start with these very general and loose kind of bases for the character archetype. And then from the director, we get an idea of the characters and their individuality and the sorts of abilities that they're going to use and things like this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to give one example of that. You might have used her in the network test or in your play session, the Recluse. Her archetype actually started as a mage, a magic user, plain and simple. But from there, we started to think about and discuss what's fun and what's interesting about playing as a mage from a player's perspective. And that is, of course, using magic, using your intellect to kind of suss out the enemy and its weaknesses and sort of piece the puzzles of the battle together as you go. Of course, just blasting magic is fun in itself, but we wanted there to be an extra layer to that such as how you use your resources, the timing of your spells, using multiple spells in conjunction. And so we started to design a system around that new kind of concept of a mage and how players would interact with that. So that's the kind of approach we took to the character design.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"One area we did concentrate on is the feeling of a role or responsibility within each character."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another aspect of our approach to the class designs was how you engage with them in a multiplayer environment. So of course, Nightreign is a three-player co-op game at its core and we wanted these skills and characters to be interesting both from a solo and multiplayer perspective. So one example of this could be the restage skill of the Duchess. So obviously, this is a very powerful skill when you're playing in solo play, but if you're going to take it to the next level and master it, a nice idea might be to watch what your allies are doing, watch for when they're doing some big damage and then restage their attack patterns and get some extra damage that way. So it really encourages this sort of teamwork and thinking as a group and thinking in terms of co-op play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This is really the first from Soft Souls with fully developed, pre-made classes that each have their own unique skills and abilities. Does that have any effect, or rather, does it raise any challenges with regards to how you design bosses or enemy encounters, knowing the powerful tools that a squad will be able to take into a fight?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of each character's individual abilities and their ultimates and skills, we didn't want to have that dictate how we approach the enemy design or encounter design and vice versa as well. We didn't want the player action level to infringe too much on the enemy action level. We wanted to concentrate on these characters and making them feel unique and fun to players in and of themselves, first and foremost, rather than having these encounters and these boss battles sort of affect that negatively and impact the fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One area we did concentrate on is the feeling of a role or responsibility within each character. So you might have somebody who feels it's their duty to try and protect the others during a difficult boss fight or try and distract the enemies, the adds (enemies) during a certain boss fight. Something like this was a feature of the pre-made designs that we could include in Nightreign that maybe we didn't experiment with too much in previous titles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, another aspect is because this is a co-op game that focuses on having a three-person team, we did want to make the bosses feel particularly hardcore from that standpoint as well. So they will use very large-scale attacks. They will use certain abilities that will inhibit or restrict the player or kind of put a sort of urgency to their moves like the timer that's inflicted on them in the Gladius Boss fight. Things like this, we really wanted to make them feel unique and imposing in each their own way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You mentioned the Duchess ability and comboing that with a very strong ability that one of your allies will use. Do you have any other favorite ability combos or synergies from the available character classes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another example I could give is the Raider character who raises a giant totem from the earth. This itself does damage to the enemies and bosses, but at the same time, the different characters can clamber up atop it. So you could, for example, have the Ironeye character raining down arrows from the safety of the tombstone or reviving a character by shooting them with long-range attacks. Something like this, we feel that there's a nice breadth and synergy that you can experiment with each of these characters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another example might be a more general example is the Recluse who you could also use in the network test. Her ultimate art actually marks enemies, puts this sort of seal on them which grants you HP and your teammates HP as you attack. So this, used in conjunction with high damage output or fast subsequent attacks from your teammates, could be very effective at healing the team, keeping them alive. Things like this, we hope players will really have fun experimenting and playing around with these different combinations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Was the Libra Boss battle inspired by any specific characters or mythos?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, he can't speak to any specific titles or names. One of the main inspirations for the Libra Boss battle was this sort of massively multiplayer raid battle sort of focus, so with this idea of having a lot of players coming together to fight this boss battle together. This involves not only the kind of exciting and dangerous elements of that fight, but also the puzzle elements as well, sort of figuring out the right time to attack, figuring out the time to retreat, figuring out the different elements to this boss fight. So we wanted it to feel like an intelligent boss design rather than just an all in, every man for himself kind of appeal.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Personally, what Nightreign character is your favorite to play and what is a build that you really hope players will dig into and enjoy?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">A personal favorite of mine is the Guardian, the avian-type knight character with the shield. He favors a more defensive-y and tank-y kind of build that this character archetype provides. I enjoy being able to both attack and defend at the same time or provide that kind of bulwark and that area of safety for his team. If players are more not so keen on the fast dodge rolling and sort of the perfect timing of the parries and things like that, this is a nice character for them to feel like they're really contributing to the team aspect and able to enjoy the battle in that sense as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generally, we designed the game for the players to be able to beat it as any character. So we wanted them to feel like they could choose a character they liked, either from an ability standpoint or from an appearance or backstory standpoint, and beat the game just in their own play style and with a character they enjoy. That said, balance is still important and the team synergy we talked to, finding a good balance of, say, a tank type character, a mage type character, and a damage deal type character. This is often important as is the boss selection that you make as well. So sometimes, a different Nightlord Boss fight will encourage a different synergy or a different sort of group of roles, a different team composition. So we want players to enjoy figuring out these aspects and experiment with various characters and while they're doing that, find some that really resonate with them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We really wanted both the boss characters, these encounters, and the player characters themselves to feel unique each in their own way. And we wanted it to feel unique enough that players can go back to the game and approach with another character entirely. So even if they have beaten a boss with the Guardian, they might want to go back and try it as the Recluse and see what other tricks they can come up with. Players also might enjoy doing a three-Recluse team, so tripling up on a certain character and seeing what kind of crazy stunts they can come up with, so I'm really looking forward to that aspect of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Final question, and this might be the hardest one, but just what are some of your favorite video games?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I mentioned earlier, I really like From’s games, these action RPGs that we make. I'm also a big long-time fan of Final Fantasy 14 and other multiplayer online games as well.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">"We were thinking about what to do for the next Mario Kart game even during the development of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and we began prototyping in March 2017," Yabuki said. "It was at the end of that year when we officially started work on it as a project."</p><p dir="ltr">Many of Mario Kart World's defining features, like its open world and support for 24 players, were there almost from the start of development, as was the game's name. Even in early development the team used the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-isnt-titled-mario-kart-9-because-nintendo-wants-to-take-the-series-to-the-next-level/1100-6531709/" data-ref-id="1100-6531709">Mario Kart World name instead of calling it Mario Kart 9</a>, as the team wanted to move away from the strictly track-based gameplay the series had been known for.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the increased player count led to technical challenges when developing for the original Nintendo Switch, according to Mario Kart World's programming director Kenta Sato. He said it was "difficult to incorporate everything we wanted" when developing on Switch 1, and that the team was "always conscious" of what sacrifices were being made.</p><p dir="ltr">"We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the frame rate to 30fps in some cases," Sato said. "It was a tough situation."</p><p dir="ltr">The team kept "kicking the can down the road" in terms of what to scale back on, before the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-8-deluxe-all-dlc-tracks-released-so-far/2900-4261/" data-ref-id="2900-4261">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pack</a> gave the team more development time, Yabuki said.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's when the conversation of moving it to the Nintendo Switch 2 system came up, and this suddenly opened up a bunch of possibilities on what we could do," Yabuki said. "It was truly a ray of hope."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">Mario Kart World will release alongside the Switch 2 on June 5</a>. Nintendo has previously detailed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-free-roam-mode-features-missions-hidden-collectibles-and-more/1100-6530931/" data-ref-id="1100-6530931">Mario Kart World's Free Roam mode</a> as well as its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/" data-ref-id="2900-6141">playable characters</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-world-items/2900-6483/" data-ref-id="2900-6483">confirmed items</a>, and more recently put to bed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-issues-statement-on-mario-kart-world-ai-image-speculation/1100-6531436/" data-ref-id="1100-6531436">speculation that it had used AI to generate certain billboards in Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shutting-down-playstation-stars<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that it's bringing an end to its PlayStation Stars loyalty program, but you'll be able to spend your points for quite a while after the program ends.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/21/playstation-stars-coming-to-a-close-as-sie-evaluates-new-ways-to-evolve-future-loyalty-program-efforts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, loyalty VP Grace Chen says that as a result of "evaluating the types of activities [PlayStation] players respond best to" over the course of the Stars program, Sony will be "winding down" the program's current incarnation in July.</p>

<p>Chen says Sony intends to "continue to evaluate [its] key findings from this program", and that the company is "looking into ways to build upon these learnings", although she doesn't specify what those learnings are.</p>

Additionally, if you cancel your Stars membership, you won't be able to rejoin and you'll lose all your points.</p>

<p>If you are a current Stars member, you'll be able to continue earning points and rewards until July 23rd at 11am Eastern, at which point no new campaigns will be made available and no new rewards or benefits will be added.</p>

<p>The PlayStation Stars program will fully come to an end in November next year, and you'll be able to spend any points you still have lying around until then, so make sure to grab your store credit or other benefits while you can.</p>

<p>If you've managed to accrue any Digital Collectible items with PlayStation Stars, those will still remain accessible to you, even after the program comes to an end.</p>




<p>PlayStation Stars was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-stars-is-new-playstation-loyalty-program-launching-this-year" rel="nofollow">originally announced back in 2022</a>&nbsp;(then released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-stars-us-release-date-is-suddenly-today" rel="nofollow">later that year</a>)&nbsp;as a way for PlayStation users to earn loyalty points for playing games, earning trophies, or winning tournament-style events.</p>

<p>It sounds like Sony is considering implementing other loyalty-style programs, although we'll probably have to wait quite some time before the company reveals more about its ideas on this front. Stay tuned for more.</p>

It has been updated as part of Kotaku’s</em> <em>Mission: Impossible Week. </em></p><p>The <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise technically started as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_(1966_TV_series)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_(1966_TV_series)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a spy-themed television series from the 1960s</a></span>, which got a sequel series in the ‘80s. But when most people talk about the <em>Mission Impossible</em> franchise in 2025, they are likely referring to the long-running action film franchise starring Tom Cruise that has grown into something much larger and over-the-top than the old TV shows. These films, which began in 1996, typically showcase Cruise risking his life in at least three or four large stunts and also, bizarrely, have only gotten better with each release. A globe-trotting action-adventure franchise that makes tons of money, is loved by critics, and has a massive fanbase seems like ideal material for a video game adaptation. Oddly, that’s not been the case.<br></p><p>Since the beginning of the franchise, only <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mission:_Impossible_video_games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mission:_Impossible_video_games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">five <em>Mission: Impossible</em> video games have been released</a></span>. (Confusingly, four of them are just named <em>Mission: Impossible</em>.) The first game launched in 1990 for the NES. The second game was released the following year for DOS. These two were based on the 1980s sequel series that aired on ABC.<br></p><p>Then in 1998, two years after the first Tom Cruise film, another <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game launched on the Nintendo 64. This one has some fans, and played a lot like a third-person spin on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/goldeneye-007-n64-xbox-switch-port-bugs-60-fps-patch-1850041167&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/goldeneye-007-n64-xbox-switch-port-bugs-60-fps-patch-1850041167">Rare’s popular<em> GoldenEye 007</em> game</a></span>. Two years after that, right before the second film hit theaters, a very short and not-good <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game landed on Game Boy Color. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/C9qqtcDVHw8?t=294&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/C9qqtcDVHw8?t=294" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this game did include a neat feature</a></span> that let players use the Game Boy as a remote control.</p><p>Finally, in 2003, <em>Mission: Impossible — Operation Surma</em> launched on PlayStation 2 and later GameCube. This third-person action-adventure spy-thriller takes place between the events of <em>Mission: Impossible II</em> and the third film, but is also never directly referenced in the films and doesn’t even feature the likeness of Tom Cruise. It was essentially a <em>Metal Gear Solid/Splinter Cell </em>clone and in 2025 has been mostly forgotten, like the rest of the<em> M:I</em> video games.<br></p><h2 id="h69"><a id=""></a><strong>It’s time for a new <em>Mission: Impossible</em> video game</strong></h2><p>And…that’s it! After 2003, we stopped getting new<em> Mission: Impossible</em> games. I understand that the film series hit a six-year lull between the second and third, but after<em>&nbsp;</em>2011’s <em>Ghost Protocol</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/mission-impossible-movies-ranked-tom-cruise-mcquarrrie-1850610860?_gl=1*1vdevzg*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc4NDY2NjIkbzg0JGcxJHQxNzQ3ODQ2NzEyJGoxMCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/mission-impossible-movies-ranked-tom-cruise-mcquarrrie-1850610860?_gl=1*1vdevzg*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc4NDY2NjIkbzg0JGcxJHQxNzQ3ODQ2NzEyJGoxMCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw..">the franchise kept getting bigger and better</a></span> with each entry. 2018’s <em>Mission: Impossible Fallout</em> is probably the best film in the series. (<em>Dead Reckoning</em>, sadly, couldn’t keep the trend going.)</p><p>And yet, even as the franchise grows bigger and bigger, no new video games are on the horizon. What a shame! So many moments in recent <em>MI </em>films feel almost like setpieces from AAA video games of the last decade. It makes sense to me that this series would translate well into a modern video game.<br></p><p>I understand that over the last decade or so, we’ve stopped getting crappy games based on popular films. And I’ve been mostly fine with that, as the vast majority of games based on films were awful and not worth playing. Then again, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hitman-studio-s-project-007-will-feature-a-new-james-bo-1846137133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-studio-s-project-007-will-feature-a-new-james-bo-1846137133">we <em>are</em> getting a new <em>007</em> game</a></span> from the <em>Hitman </em>devs, and a new <em>Avatar</em> one from Ubisoft, so it’s not like games based on movies are impossible to make these days.<br></p><p>And I think a <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game—if done right and given enough time and resources—could be amazing. Honestly, a game where you just recreate all the famous and dangerous stunts from the films would be great, like a new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuntman:_Ignition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuntman:_Ignition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Stuntman</em></a></span> but based entirely on <em>Mission: Impossible</em> scenes. Actually, it’s been a long time since we got a good <em>Stuntman </em>game, too.<br></p><p>Okay, new plan: Someone convince the right people to fund the development of a new <em>Stuntman</em>-like game based on Tom Cruise’s wildest <em>Mission: Impossible</em> stunts. That’s the game I want. Thank you. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, we learned that Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, the harrowingly beautiful action game from Ninja Theory, will be joining their ranks, making its way onto Sony's platform sometime this summer. You can hear it announced by the team itself in a new trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sh4QQyM1KP0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sh4QQyM1KP0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>On the same day it comes to PS5, Hellblade II will get some "exciting new features" across all platforms as a free update. This new iteration is known as the "Enhanced" version, though it's unclear how exactly the game will be improved.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur%E2%80%99s-real-heroes-came-before-expedition-33.1195467/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-journals<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Before <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, which has been the talk of the town since launching on April 25, creative director Guillaume Broche was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/598739/clair-obscur-svedberg-yen-interview-victorian-steampunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working</a> on a precursor known as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kk6pbg/early_draft_trailer_for_the_game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>We Lost</em></a>. While technically different projects, this title is still fitting of <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s overall mood. As its protagonists set out from Lumière to try to prevent the godlike Paintress from wiping humanity from existence, the palpable fear among Expedition 33 is that their hard work will, like the voyages before them, simply be a suicidal stepping stone on the path of future generations’ success.</p><p><strong>(This piece contains spoilers for <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s journal entries, and some vague late-game spoilers for the end of Act II.)</strong></p><p>Not only is this sense of impending failure baked into the mission’s motto, “We lay the trail for those who come after,” but it’s also part of why expeditions keep a journal to leave behind for subsequent expeditions. The average player will stumble upon several of these journals while playing <em>Clair Obscur</em>, each one full of stories describing the actions taken by previous expeditions and, sometimes, the dangers that ultimately defeated them. Not every journal provides useful information: Expedition 36’s entry, for instance, is a beautiful albeit strategically useless poem, while Expedition 47’s merely describes the self-styled “Drunken Brigade’s” theories on maintaining inebriation during battle. But the majority drive home the fact that Expedition 33’s success is predicated not only on their own skills but also the progress made by their predecessors.</p><figure></figure><p><em>Clair Obscur</em> heightens this sense of asynchronous cooperation by plopping its heroes down in hostile, unfamiliar territory and giving them no other choice than to rely on what previous expeditions left behind. Many areas would be impossible to traverse without various handholds and grapple points; the player eventually learns these aren’t natural, but rather manmade features built into the environment by Expeditions 69 and 70. Similarly, a fleshy overpass in a late-game area is revealed as the grisly work of Expedition 35, who used their final moments after falling to a powerful monster to build the walkway over an otherwise unnavigable crevasse with their own corpses.</p><p>“So that’s what it means to lay the trail,” Expedition 35’s journal reads, its long-dead author combining gallows humor with numerous passages from the overall mission statement. “They used their bodies to create a bridge for those who come after. Expedition 35 is over but tomorrow comes.”</p><p>Even when previous expeditions haven’t left tangible help, their journals function like military intel for the challenges Expedition 33 faces. Expedition 59's journal cautions against eating defeated monsters, while a member of Expedition 66 left behind similar warnings for poisonous mushrooms they were given by Esquie, a lovable traveling companion you meet halfway into the game who functions like a <em>Final Fantasy</em> airship. The player might glean insight into how to allocate character stats from, say, Expedition 49, who focused entirely on healing and defensive skills, only to realize this turtle-like strategy only prolonged their suffering without offensive abilities to quickly dispatch enemies. This journal can remind the player that it's useful to spread points around rather than focus too heavily on a single aspect of a character's build.</p><p>Sometimes Expedition 33 must literally stand on the shoulders of their ancestors to forge ahead, but other journal entries aren’t quite as gruesome or on-the-nose. Expedition 40 discovered the forcefield surrounding the Paintress’ monolith after two explorers flew into it on hang gliders and were vaporized. Expedition 44 attempted to disguise themselves as monsters, but the real monsters weren’t fooled and cut them down. </p><figure></figure><p>None of these journal entries hold a candle to Expedition 60. While much of Expedition 33’s success comes from its use of the Lumina Converter, the in-universe tool that powers <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s Picto trait customization system, Expedition 60 was able to make it all the way to the Paintress without such frivolity. They even managed to break through the barrier surrounding her monolith through pure strength alone, and did it all while entirely naked to boot. I’ve included the entire text of the journal below because there’s no way a mere summary could do it justice.</p><blockquote><p>They mocked us when we said the human body is the strongest of them all. We trained relentlessly and now our bodies have achieved the pinnacle of human performance, with which we are able to crush our enemies!</p><p>We are SO much more agile and aerodynamic without the heavy uniforms constraining our glorious muscles. With Leslie’s unstoppable training regime, WE ARE IMPERVIOUS.</p><p>That’s how we were able to charge through that ghostly gommage barrier and reach the Paintress. But it seems we’ve been wrong about what she is. The Paintress is just as trapped as we. The real terror lies beneath the Monolith.</p><p>The rest of Expedition 60 marched on to confront him, while I was tasked to warn Lumière. But it seems I might have run out of time. One last swim separates me from Lumière, but even with my mighty muscles, I don’t know if I can outswim the Gommage.</p><p>So here I write my final message. Bare naked muscles will save the world! And don’t waste time on the Paintress, aim for the bottom of the Monolith!</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Despite a push for more diversity in games, they can often lean libertarian or even conservative in their worldviews. Some, in pursuit of gratifying player power fantasies, fall into subscribing to a version of Thomas Carlyle’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great man</a>” theory, which argues history belongs to individuals born with superior traits. <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s treatment of its protagonists not as special heroes but as merely the next link in a chain of successes and failures makes for a far richer story than we often see from the medium.&nbsp;</p><p>Expedition 33, though perhaps better equipped than those who came before them, are only able to accomplish what they do thanks to the hundreds of reinforcements who paved the way before them. The ability to defeat a boss in seconds with an overpowered build means nothing if you can’t physically reach the enemy in the first place. Knowledge accrued over decades and shared between generations will always trump what one person can do on their own.</p><p>In his 1935 poem “Questions From a Worker Who Reads,” writer Bertolt Brecht <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/brecht/works/1935/questions.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asks</a>, “Caesar defeated the Gauls. / Did he not even have a cook with him? / Philip of Spain wept when his armada went down. / Was he the only one to weep?” <em>Clair Obscur</em> may not be as overtly political a text as Brecht's Marxist leanings, but it certainly interrogates the view of history – and video game narratives – that singular heroes succeed through their own strength. And much like "Questions," it comes to the same conclusion: None of us, from the wealthy entrepreneur to the struggling freelancer, accomplish anything on our own.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/midea-u-shape-ac-gone"><h3>The Most Popular Window Air Conditioner Has Disappeared From Store Shelves</h3></a><p>The Midea U-Shaped air conditioner is universally beloved.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/raidou-remastered-preview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Between your Shin Megami Tenseis and your Personas, Atlus has grown in renown over the last decade for its demon-summoning JRPGs. But while Persona is the biggest of the SMT spin-offs, it’s far from the only one, and now RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army&nbsp;is on the way to revive the Demon Summoner branch of this RPG franchise.</p>
<p>Atlus is no stranger to refurnishing its prior works for new systems, whether with a classic expanded release like Persona 4 Golden or with a more typical remake/remaster like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/30/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona 3 Reloaded</a>. Closing in on two decades since its original PS2 release as Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army, Raidou Remastered is very much in the latter camp, as a full overhaul of the game for modern systems. “Remastered” is really underselling it.</p>
<p><iframe title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army — Opening Movie" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PrurRsh64yQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We played Raidou Remastered on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but this game is coming to pretty much every platform that matters – PS4 and PS5, Switch and Switch 2, PC and Xbox Series X|S, with only Xbox One being left out in the cold.</p>
<p>Alas, we didn’t get to spend too much time playing at the preview event, being dropped in partway through Chapter 1 to just get a taste of the world, the characters and the action RPG battling.</p>

<p>The first thing that stands out about the presentation is that you don’t have control over the game camera, which moves and pans through set paths as you run around, and cutting to new angles as you move between different streets and side passages. It’s distinctly retro and in keeping with the original game in style, but the pre-rendered backgrounds make way for 3D environments, so that the camera can shift into a pseudo chase cam view at times and more actively follow you through the scene, instead of having that classic Resident Evil vibe.</p>

<p>The camera is much, much more dynamic in combat as well, actually following Raidou around, instead of being a fixed point view of the battle arena. That helps a huge amount to give the combat a more modern tone and feel.</p>
<p>Coming from Persona and Shin Megami Tensei, the expectation might be for turn-based battles with summoned demons, but these are much closer to the arena battles of the Final Fantasy 7 Remakes or (a bit more tangentially) Ni no Kuni. You fight as Raidou, dishing out melee attacks with his sword, taking aim to blast away from range with his pistol, and unleashing abilities that build up to your Spirit Slash. Your two summoned demon allies, meanwhile do a bit of their own thing, but can also be commanded to attack or heal and buff.</p>
<p>It’s quick and easy to figure out the basics, but I’m sure more depths will be revealed with a longer play session, and complexities revealed through bigger boss battles.</p>

<p>It’s not just in battle that your demons come out to play, as they also have a role when simply exploring the world and talking to people. It can be reading someone’s mind to reveal a new opening in conversation, using them to retrieve a dog from a roof, lighting a figurative fire under someone to get them to do what you want, and on and on. More demons will be added to Raidou’s collection of allies over time, giving you new abilities in the world, but also boosting combat options.</p>
<p>What’s sure to shine about Raidou Remastered is the setting. This is a fantastical take on 1930s Tokyo, infused with the Dark Realm and all the demons that spring forth from it. Raidou himself has a flash cape and a more Western police style outfit, and there’s a great juxtaposition between this and the more traditional elements of Japanese architecture, dress and culture from the time. There’s cats everywhere, as well, and while most of them will run away when you get close (probably cos of all the demons in your pocket), the black cat Gouto is your companion and guide.</p>
<p>For fans of Atlus’ work, Raidou Remastered is sure to be one of the most anticipated games of 2025, reviving a decades old game for a new audience and giving it myriad modern touches along the way.</p>

			<p>Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/21/playstation-stars-coming-to-a-close-as-sie-evaluates-new-ways-to-evolve-future-loyalty-program-efforts/">announced</a> that it will officially end its PlayStation Stars loyalty program. As of today, the program will not be accepting new members, and those already part of the program will see no new campaigns or rewards added and will no longer be able to earn points after July 23, 2025. Players who choose to leave at any point after today will not be able to rejoin the program and will lose all their points.</p>
<p>"<em>At Sony Interactive, we’re always experimenting with new and exciting ways to bring our community of players together to share the joys of gaming and create lasting memories,</em>" Grace Chen, vice president of network advertising, loyalty, and licensed merchandise at Sony, began on a PlayStation Blog post.</p>
<p>"<em>That’s why three years ago, we created PlayStation Stars, a loyalty program to celebrate our players. The unique program includes playing games to earn rewards – including our unique Digital Collectibles that pay homage to incredible games and our PlayStation legacy. The program has helped foster a deeper connection with fans around the world.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Since launching the program, we’ve learned a lot from evaluating the types of activities our players respond best to, and as a company, we are always evolving with player and industry trends. Through this evaluation, we have decided to refocus our efforts and will be winding down the current version of PlayStation Stars. We will continue to evaluate our key findings from this program, and are looking into ways to build upon these learnings.</em>"</p>
<p>The loyalty program was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-introduces-playstation-stars-loyalty-program-brings-digital-collectible-rewards-and-loyalty-points/">announced and launched in 2022</a>, and the first reaction from players was that PlayStation Stars potentially began its life as an NFT program, but was pivoted into what we ended up with when PlayStation caught wind of how incredibly unpopular NFTs had become.</p>
<p>What ended up being the best part of the program was the fact that, for a while, it was possible to earn enough points to collect $25 and $5 worth of credit on the PlayStation Store. Players did everything they could to 'game' the system, and Sony took steps to rebalance how points were dolled out to curb those efforts.</p>
<p>Players who still have points they'd like to redeem will be able to do so until November 2, 2026.</p>
