<p>You want to know what's better than 30fps?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>GameMill Entertainment has today announced that the family-friendly co-op RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nicktoons_and_the_dice_of_destiny">Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny</a> will be landing a free Switch 2 upgrade on <strong>5th December</strong>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version will run at 60fps, with a crisp 1240p resolution. There's a bunch of other visual good stuff to look out for too, including improved anti-aliasing, particle effects, lighting and more.</p>
<p>All those with the Switch 1 version of the game (which launched back in September), can upgrade to the Switch 2 version completely free. Alternatively, the full Switch 2 edition will be available on the Switch eShop for <strong>£39.99 / €49.99</strong>, or physically via a Game-Key Card.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of the Switch 2 version in action:</p>

<p>If this one hasn't entered your sphere yet, the Dice of Destiny is an ARPG inspired by fantasy tabletop adventures. You'll put together a band of familiar Nickelodeon faces like SpongeBob, Danny Phantom, Jimmy Neutron, Susie Carmichael or Katara, and use each character's special skills to take out enemies in a magical land.</p>
<p>There's every chance that this one slipped under the radar for you back in a busy September period, and the new early-December release date falls in an equally jam-packed week, but hey, at least it gives everyone another chance to check it out.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/golden-joysticks-ultimate-game-of-the-year-2025-nominees-stacked-with-major-indie-titles.1342324/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At the beginning of last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-leads-the-golden-joystick-awards-2025-nominations/">GamesRadar revealed the nominees for its 2025 Golden Joysticks Awards</a>, though one category, the Ultimate Game of the Year Award, was left out of the list. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/">As of today, the shortlist</a> for the most significant Golden Joysticks Award has been revealed, and it is stacked with games from independent developers making up most of the list, including Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, and Peak.</p>



<p>It's the first major awards event to reveal a Game of the Year list, and while it has 12 games listed in total, which is more than you'd see for other major awards events, it really shows how despite 2025 having more than its fair share of big triple-A releases from major developers and publishers, the games that had the most impact came from independent studios.</p>



<p>In some cases, those independents did have major publisher support, but out of the seven games nominated made by independent studios, five of those games were made by smaller indie teams without a major publisher's support.</p>



<p>Here are the nominees for the Golden Joysticks 2025 Ultimate Game of the Year Award: </p>



<ul>
<li>Blue Prince</li>



<li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li>



<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li>



<li>Peak</li>



<li>Hades II</li>



<li>Split Fiction</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li>



<li>Silent Hill f</li>



<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</li>



<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li>



<li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li>
</ul>



<p>While you might not agree with every game on this list, it's undeniable that this is a list of 12 of some of the best games released in 2025 (even though technically one of them was released at the end of 2024 and just didn't make it out in time for awards season).</p>



<p>Blue Prince, Hades II, Peak, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Hollow Knight: Silksong were all major indie titles from this year without a major publisher's support, and they are each, for their own reasons, more than fair candidates for 2025's game of the year. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Split Fiction were both made by independent teams but published by major triple-A studios, but the point that independent teams are making the biggest impact in 2025 still stands.</p>



<p>Major titles from triple-A developers and publishers, including DOOM: The Dark Ages, Borderlands 4, Assassin's Creed: Shadows, Monster Hunter Wilds, Avowed, The Outer Worlds 2, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and Battlefield 6, are all absent from this list. </p>



<p>You might disagree with some of those absences, but the impact of indies in 2025 cannot be denied. As always, the Golden Joysticks Awards are decided entirely by public vote following a jury selecting the nominees. Voting on the Ultimate Game of the Year<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/"> is now live,</a> if you want to add your voice to the conversation of which games deserve a big spotlight in 2025.</p>

            <p>
I'm sure I don't need to tell you that a majority of the data that various AI models train themselves on do so without getting any sort of permission to do so. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, as they say, though in the case of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, they probably shouldn't have taken that lesson to heart. That's because Japan's Content Overseas Distribution Association (CODA) has requested that the AI developer stops using Japanese media to train its text-to-video model Sora.
</p>
<p>
A touch of context: CODA is a Japanese trade association that represents some of the biggest media businesses in the country. It has a big focus on anti-piracy measures, particularly to do with anime and manga, but in general is about protecting the copyright of Japanese media. You'll be no stranger to some of the names on the list, as it includes the likes of Bandai Namco and Square Enix, as well as for anime companies like Toei Animation and Studio Ghibli.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, that request! In a <a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/817/">post shared last week</a> (thanks for the spot, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japanese-publishers-like-bandai-namco-and-square-enix-are-requesting-sora-2-is-no-longer-trained-on-their-creative-works">Eurogamer</a>), CODA wrote that they have "confirmed that a large portion of content produced by Sora 2 closely resembles Japanese content or images. CODA has determined that this is the result of using Japanese content as machine learning data."
</p>
<p>
It goes on to note that Sora 2 operates on an opt-out system, meaning a company has to put in a request if it wants its intellectual property removed from the dataset. The issue is that Japan's copyright system doesn't work like that, as you need to get consent before you use any copyrighted works.
</p><p>
CODA's requests are twofold. First, "In the operation of Sora 2, CODA requests that its members’ content is not used for machine learning without their permission," and second, "OpenAI responds sincerely to claims and inquiries from CODA member companies regarding copyright infringement related to Sora 2’s outputs."
</p>
<p>
I feel it's important to note that this isn't saying CODA or any of the companies they represent are anti-AI, and that this is more a concern over the use of their respective bits of copyright. Even before AI, you've likely seen fan games and the like receive takedown notices because of their potential to misrepresent a particular work. But something like Sora 2 allows this to be done at scale, so even if you and I know that copyright just exists to protect the interests of big businesses, you can at least see why this is being done.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Since <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s beta, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-season-one-small-map-battle-royale-reactions-negative-review-ea-2000639948">fans have complained</a> that EA’s online FPS has smaller maps than those found in previous entries. And when the game finally launched last month, these complaints only grew as it became clear that <em>BF6</em> still lacked truly giant battlegrounds. Now, a fan has crunched the numbers and done the hard work to accurately compare the maps here to past maps from the main series and confirmed that, yeah, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">Battlefield 6′</a>s</em> collection of maps is the smallest.</p> <p>On November 2, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/updated_battlefield_maps_from_bf3_bf4_bfhl_bfmaps-in-the-series/">Reddit user ClaratheRed posted an image</a> showing a visual size comparison of some of the many maps from <em>Battlefield 3, 4, BF1, Hardline, 2042</em>, and the recently released <em>BF6</em>. (<a href="https://imgur.com/bV0bq9m">Higher res version here</a>.) And a quick glance confirms what many fans have complained about since launch: <em>Battlefield’s</em> largest maps are pretty small when compared to some of the truly giant warzones found in past games.</p>

   <p>In fact, according to ClaratheRed’s data, <em>BF6</em>‘s largest map is Operation Firestorm, which is ironically a remake of a <em>Battlefield 3</em> map. And even <em>BF6</em>‘s largest map doesn’t crack the top 30 biggest maps in <em>Battlefield</em> history. Meanwhile, most of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-is-very-bad-2000639647"><em>BF6</em>‘s other maps</a> are actually some of the smallest according to ClaratheRed’s data. Keep in mind, though, that this comparison post doesn’t seem to include games released before <em>BF3</em>, and doesn’t include <em>BFV</em>, so, it’s not a perfect, all-encompassing data set. Still, even with that caveat, ClaratheRed’s data is interesting and revealing. (They also showed their work, which leads me to believe this data is, if not 100 percent accurate, close enough.)</p> <p>The reality is that, yeah, <em>Battlefield 6′</em>s maps are, generally speaking, some of the smallest maps in the game’s history.<a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1985317825490153604"> One of <em>BF6</em>‘s maps, Saints’ Quarters, is actually the second-smallest map according to this data</a>. So if you wanted proof that <em>BF6</em>‘s maps are small, here you go. You can share this link and the Reddit post with friends to settle debates or win some internet arguments. And while the game’s smaller maps aren’t stopping me from enjoying it, I do miss the truly giant locations found in past games and hope they return in a future season.</p>

<p>Five games, including Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, are leaving Xbox Game Pass in November 2025. </p>



<p>All of the games, which you can see below, will be removed on November 16. That means not only will they not be available for subscribers, but the ability to save money on a purchase will be gone, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-games-leaving-xbox-game-pass-in-november">Games Leaving Xbox Game Pass In November</h2>



<p>As mentioned, five games are set to leave the Xbox Game Pass catalog later this month. In addition to Stalker 2, other games leaving the service include Football Manager 24, Football Manager 24 Console, Blacksmith Master (Game Preview), Frostpunk, and Spirittea.</p>



<p>Football Manager 24 is leaving as the latest installment, Football Manager 26, releases on November 4. The original Frostpunk also makes sense, as Frostpunk 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/frostpunt-2-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined the catalog</a> on September 18.  Lastly, Stalker 2’s departure comes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-new-game-releases-for-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just days before its launch</a> on PlayStation 5 on November 20. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As mentioned, the games are set to leave on November 16. Game Pass Subscribers can save up to 20% on the games, should they want to buy them. </p>

Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith has revealed that the sequel will feature a brand-new city that he described as "like Chicago gone wrong."</p><p>Appearing in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REDstreams broadcast</a>, Pondsmith said he recently visited the developers and said he spoke with the environment team to see how the new city was coming together. Whatever this place is, it will be on top of the next iteration of Night City from Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p>"There's another city we visit--I'm not telling you any more than that but there's another city we visit. And Night City is still there. But I remember looking at it and going, yeah I understand the feel you’re going for this, and this really does work. And it doesn't feel like Blade Runner, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong. I said, 'Yeah, I can see this working,'" he said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/contact-me-cyberpunk-creator-mike-pondsmith-tells-keanu-reeves-he-has-ways-to-bring-johnny-silverhand-back-from-the-dead-for-cyberpunk-2?utm_source=instagram,threads,twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN</a>.</p><h2><strong>Could Keanu Reeves come back?</strong></h2><p>Also during the interview, Pondsmith broached the subject of whether or not Keanu Reeves (Johnny Silverhand) could return in Cyberpunk 2. Pondsmith said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-would-come-back-for-cyberpunk-2/1100-6534536/" data-ref-id="1100-6534536">saw the headlines</a> where Reeves himself said he would be keen to come back and called on Reeves to pick up the phone.</p><p>"I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again. I have ways to do that, Keanu. Contact me," Pondsmith said.</p><p>Silverhand is a former rockstar who appears in the game in the form of a digital engram long after his physical body dies. The character's fate at the end of Cyberpunk 2077 can depend on the ending that players receive. Given that, it appears possible that he could return in Cyberpunk 2, but that's far from a guarantee that it would happen, as that would depend on a countless combination of factors.</p><p>As for CD Projekt's other upcoming games, the company is making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a> and is co-producing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">remake of the original Witcher game</a> with developer Fool's Theory.</p>

                <p>Without the Witcher novels by Andrezj Sapkowski, there wold be no hit series on Netlflix or even the video games that revitalized the property a decade ago. According to Sapkowski, he's happy with his arrangements with CD Projekt Red, even though the devs don't ask him many questions anymore.</p><p>While promoting his latest novel (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-author-has-an-excellent-deal-with-the-witcher-4-devs-but-its-rare-for-cd-projekt-to-ask-him-for-advice-anymore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>), Sapkowski noted that CD Projekt Red used to approach him about additional info about the characters and the world he created. Now, he says it's "so rare" for CD Projekt Red to ask him any advice.</p><p>When Sapkowski originally signed withe CD Projekt Red to let them adapt his novels, he took an upfront payment instead of royalties. Sapkowski subsequently sued the developer to get a better deal after the blockbuster success of The Witcher 3. Terms weren't disclosed, but the case was settled. Now, Sapokowski describes his relationship with the devs in more glowing terms.</p><p>"The contracts between me and the game people are excellent right now," said Sapokowski. "Let's hope it stays that way."</p><p>Netflix recently debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-liam-hemsworth-as-geralt-in-new-witcher-season-4-trailer/1100-6535277/" data-ref-id="1100-6535277">The Witcher Season 4</a>, which will have a fifth and final season to wrap up the show. Meanwhile CD Projekt Red put <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-4/" data-ref-id="5000-561041">The Witcher 4</a> into active development last year. The game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-to-state-of-unreal-event-tomorrow-heres-how-to-watch/1100-6531983/">featured at Epic's State of Unreal event</a>, and it looked impressive. However, the developers subsequently described the demo as a technical demonstration, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">rather than a preview of the game itself</a>, which doesn't currently have a release date. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is also expected to get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-3s-last-patch-is-delayed/1100-6535045/" data-ref-id="1100-6535045">one final patch in 2026</a> that will enable mod access on consoles.</p>

                <p>Video game remakes and remasters have attracted impressive player numbers and generated substantial consumer spending, research shows, although full-on remakes may have a slight edge.</p><p>Research firm Ampere Analysis tracked data from January 2024 to September 2025, looking at 42 re-releases (specifically, 15 remakes and 27 remasters). These releases accumulated 72.4 million players across Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam, with consumers spending $1.4 billion from purchasing these games and related in-game monetisation.</p><p>Overall, the average remake produced 2.2 times the amount of consumer spending as remasters did during that time frame. For instance, while the Gears of War: Reloaded remaster had a similar peak monthly active user count as the Silent Hill 2 remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the latter two titles far surpassed Gears of War in consumer spending.</p><p>The one outlier is The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which peaked at $180 million in consumer spending and pulled in 7 million monthly active users, far and above every other remaster and remake included in the study.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4595155-image%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4595155" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4595155-image%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4595155"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4595155-image%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>The data goes to show the power of a popular IP like The Elder Scrolls, even though overall, remakes resulted in higher consumer spending and player engagement. This research also highlights the differences between remasters and remakes, both of which are prevalent strategies employed by major game publishers.</p><p>While remakes might yield greater returns and player counts, they are more costly and take longer to develop, as they are built from the ground up. A benefit of remakes is that core gameplay can be completely refigured to be up-to-date with modern sensibilities. Remasters, on the other hand, are typically fresh coats of paint on existing assets and systems, requiring less time and fewer resources; however, outdated gameplay design may still be evident.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/report-finds-nearly-all-gamers-have-played-a-remaster-or-remake-in-last-year/1100-6534807/" data-ref-id="1100-6534807">separate report in September</a> showed that the vast majority of people who play video games have engaged with remakes or remasters, with most of them not even playing the original version of the game.</p><p>It's hard to throw a dart at a release schedule and not hit a re-release, with just this year's schedule including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/" data-ref-id="1900-6418396">remakes of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-remake-review/1900-6418433/" data-ref-id="1900-6418433">first two Dragon Quest games</a>, along with remasters of Donkey Kong Country Returns and several Tomb Raider games.</p><p>This study from Ampere Analytics has some interesting data to chew on--it'll be interesting to see where the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-1-remake-saw-every-asset-get-attention-to-bring-it-up-to-modern-standards/1100-6535744/" data-ref-id="1100-6535744">remakes of the Halo: Combat Evolved campaign</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-launch-by-march-2026-ubisoft-says/1100-6531547/" data-ref-id="1100-6531547">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> would fall on that graphic.</p>

After a successful run of the Persona Live Tour across Asia, a modified version of the concert is coming to Los Angeles, California, next year on January 24, with just two shows that day.&nbsp;</p><p>Persona Live 2026: Awakenings is the first U.S. show of the Persona Music Experience series, according to Sega, and it will include the "full cast from Japan" when it debuts at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood. As someone who lives in Florida, I'm hoping the word "debut" implies that this two-concert series is a test run for a wider U.S. tour. If you live in Hollywood or are willing to travel there for this concert, the first concert will begin at 3 p.m. PT on January 24, followed by a second concert at 8 p.m. PT.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>All of the notable Grand Theft Auto games have been set in fictional versions of American cities, but there was once an expansion pack that showed us a glimpse of somewhere else. Somewhere, if you're me, very close to home: London.</p>
<p>In 1997, an expansion pack was released for the original Grand Theft Auto game that remade its world to look like London in the Swinging Sixties - specifically, in 1969. Cue lots of colourful Minis and mini-skirts and mods and bob haircuts and garish pastel colours. It was fun, and it was enough of a glimpse to keep the question of whether Rockstar might ever return to London, for a full-fat GTA instalment, alive for many years after.</p>
<p>But that dream-balloon has popped now, with <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=tLh2Pqo2iIIJZ4as">Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser telling Lex Fridman</a> that the Grand Theft Auto series has become too characterised by Americana to be set anywhere else.</p>
<p>"There's a reason why GTA kept coming back to Miami, New York, Los Angeles," Houser said. "They're all very good for what you laid out..." Houser was referring to Fridman's description of Miami being a place where huge wealth exists next to extreme poverty, of it being a place of everything: glitz, glamour, immigration, drugs and organised crime - the whole lot. A melting pot.</p>

<p>London arguably has that but it doesn't have other important ingredients. One of those ingredients Houser described as larger-than-life characters, because GTA games, he said, are exaggerated slices of life. A GTA experience would be like "a psychotic version of a Dickens book", he said, smiling. But a bigger problem is a lack of available guns here - a weapon Grand Theft Auto games depend upon.</p><p>"For a full GTA game: we always decided there was so much Americana inherent in the IP it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else," Houser said. "You needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective, but that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't have really worked in the same way elsewhere."</p>
<p>Dan Houser left Rockstar in 2020 to create a new studio called Absurd Ventures, which is making a couple of open-world video games - one set in a science-fiction world called A Better Paradise, and the other within a comedy satire setting. A Better Paradise book has been released but other than that, we don't know anything about these games.</p>
<p>Given how long ago Houser left, he has had nothing to do with the making of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which will be a notable change for the GTA series. Houser was usually the person who'd come up with the story the games would be based on, then hold the team to that creative vision as the game went forward.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I find it fascinating to hear Houser reflect on past GTA projects, particularly on the pressure the studio felt making them, because Rockstar often projects an aura of invincibility at the time.</p>
<p>"GTA 4 was very pressured because there had been all this pressure on the company - the company nearly imploded several times due to Hot Coffee," Houser said, referring to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/who-spilled-hot-coffee">the infamous reinstated-by-modders sex mini-game that people found in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a>. "It was extremely tough. So I think that felt very stressful. GTA 3, the company was basically broke, but I was young and I didn't really care. I wasn't living in the grown-up world yet. All of them had their own pressure."</p><p>But even years later in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, the company's most recent major work, there was enormous pressure on Houser and the studio. "With Red Dead 2, we were behind schedule, we were over budget so much I didn't want to think about it, and you're making a game about a cowboy dying of TB, and the game's not coming together," he said. "Turns out a lot of people doubt you at that moment; it's not a lot of fun. That was a lot of pressure."</p>
<p>I suspect that therein lies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">the reason he ultimately left Rockstar</a>, after taking an extended break following completion of the Red Dead Redemption 2 project. His brother Sam Houser, however, remains there, as president of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Original Saints Row design director Chris Stockman has revealed he wants to revive the open-world crime series following the poorly recieved 2022 reboot, and claims publisher Embracer Group has reached out to hear more.
</p>
<p>
Stockman departed developer Volition (which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">closed in 2023</a> as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-has-reduced-its-workforce-by-over-1800-people-in-the-past-year">devastating layoffs across Embracer</a>) in 2007, shortly after Saints Row 1's release. Following stints at Human Head Studios and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/zynga">Zynga</a>, he founded VR-focused studio Bit Planet Games, known for the likes of Ultrawings and The Battle of Sol. But nearly 20 years after Saints Row 1's release, Stockman reckons he still knows what makes the series work - and it wasn't in the recent reboot.
</p>
<p>
"There's a level of expectations for a Saints Row game, and [developer Volition's reboot] missed the mark on all of them", Stockman <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi">recently told Esports Insider</a>. "When I found out that they were rebooting Saints Row, I spoke to an old friend of mine who was my old boss for Saints Row 1. He was the producer, and I was learning about what they were doing, and I thought, 'Man, this is a terrible idea.' What is it trying to be? You're rebooting it, but why are you rebooting it? There's a lot of characters in the series that people love. It wasn't Saints Row at all. Just call it something else at that point."
</p>
<p>
In the same interview, Stockman encouraged Saints Row owner Embracer to reach out, saying, "If you're listening to this, contact me. Let's go. I can bring much of the old band back together who worked on Saints Row 1. I could turn that IP around with a decent budget. They don't even have to fund it. I could get other outside people to fund it. I could turn the franchise around. I know I could." And it seems Embracer is curious to learn more.
</p><p>
"Guys and Gals, I have hopeful news!," Stockman <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsRow/comments/1ok2dh3/ive_been_asked_to_a_create_a_pitch_for_a_saints/">wrote on the Saints Row subreddit</a>. "I've been asked to create a pitch for a Saints Row reboot! I can't say anything more than that but my dreams for this game just became a little more than just dreams!" Stockman <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/saints-row/prequel-pitch-original-director">later told PCGamesN</a>, he'd contacted Embracer himself after the original interview "created a bit of a fervour", and discovered "there is interest" within the company. "A pitch has been requested."
</p>
<p>
As for what Stockman has in mind for a potential revival, he "won't say much" at this point as he want to "keep my cards close to my chest, for now." However, he's keen to "bring the Saints Row franchise back to its roots", believing it has "strayed way too far away from that." He's also confirmed he's not envisaging it as a VR game and that he won't be bringing back the series' (at this point pretty iconic) giant dildos if Embracer bites. "I would've never put that abomination of a weapon in", he added on Reddit.
</p>
<p>
And despite Stockman's current caginess, his earlier Esports Insider interview might reveal a little of what he's got in mind. "What I would have done [for the reboot] was to take the franchise back to the 70s and do a period piece," he explained, "a prequel of how the gangs from the first one started. You're running around with a crew of teens that ended up as the main characters for the first game. You could really go all in on the 70s theme with big Afros, bell-bottoms, and the music of that whole period. I'd have taken it into a different direction so you’re not competing with the modern-day GTA games."

<figure data-uuid="2c81f39347cf8"><a title="Bandai Namco And Square Enix Join Other Japanese Publishers In Uproar Over OpenAI's Sora 2 Video Generation Tool 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2c81f39347cf8/bandai-namco-and-square-enix-join-other-japanese-publishers-in-uproar-over-openais-sora-2-video-generation-tool-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>Japanese video game giants Bandai Namco and Square Enix have joined other companies such as the Sony-owned Aniplex, Studio Ghibli, Square Enix, Kadokawa and Shueisha in requesting that OpenAI refrain from training its Sora 2 Generative AI model on their content.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/817/">announcement</a> was made via Japan’s Content Overseas Distribution Association (CODA), which represents anime, game and manga publishers from the country (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sonys-aniplex-bandai-namco-and-other-japanese-publishers-demand-end-to-unauthorized-training-of-openais-sora2-through-coda/">Automaton Media</a>).</p>
<p>CODA's statement insists that Sora 2 has been trained on copyrighted works from Japanese publishers, and that this “may constitute copyright infringement."</p>
<p>OpenAI has an opt-out system in place and has already had to change the way Sora 2 works in order to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y0g79xevxo">avoid certain content from being created</a>. However, CODA claims this approach is incompatible with Japan’s copyright laws and that prior permission is required.</p>

<p>CODA is now asking OpenAI to immediately stop using copyrighted content, and urges the American company to “respond sincerely to claims and inquiries from CODA member companies regarding copyright infringement related to Sora 2’s outputs."</p>
<p>Sora 2 launched at the end of October and immediately came under fire for allowing users to create videos containing a wide range of copyrighted material and characters, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">including those of Nintendo</a>.</p>
<p>Established in order to build "safe and beneficial" AI systems, OpenAI has increasingly become embroiled in controversies over its use of Generative AI technology.</p>
<p>In 2024, Hollywood megastar <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm559l5g529o">Scarlett Johansson</a> accused the company of using her voice without permission.</p>
<p>Beyond copyright infringement, OpenAI has openly admitted that some of its users <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yd90g0q43o">exhibit psychosis or suicidal thoughts</a>, and is currently being sued by the parents of 16-year-old <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgerwp7rdlvo">Adam Raine</a>, who allege that its chatbot, ChatGPT, encouraged him to commit suicide.</p>

			<p>Wicked: For Good, the highly anticipated part two of the film adaptation of the Broadway musical Wicked, is arriving in theatres on November 21, 2025, and there is reportedly a very good Mario-themed reason to go see it. According to <a href="https://x.com/MyTimeToShineH/status/1985029599063843018">X (formerly Twitter) user My Time to Shine</a>, which has a reputation for publishing scoops within the movie world, the first proper trailer for the Super Mario Galaxy Movie will be shown at screenings of Wicked: For Good.</p>



<p>"<em>The Mario Galaxy trailer will be attached to Wicked For Good meaning it will release online before November 21st</em>," My Time to Shine writes on their X (formerly Twitter) post.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">This past September</a>, we learned that the sequel to the Super Mario Bros. The Movie would be called 'The Super Mario Galaxy Movie,' and it would be arriving in theatres on April 3, 2026. With a release date set for next Spring, it makes a lot of sense that it would have a new major trailer debut with one of the last major box office debuts left in 2025.</p>



<p>And as My Time to Shine points out, with the trailer making its way to theatres before the end of this month, that means it'll likely appear online within the coming weeks.</p>



<p>When the title and release date were revealed for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, we got a very short teaser trailer that briefly showed the Mushroom Kingdom, following a golden yellow butterfly through the kingdom and into the sky for the title reveal.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Whatever trailer we get next will likely provide our first insights into the basic plot that this sequel will follow and reveal a little more about which characters will be involved, both returning and new.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Ever since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>players found out the rare, alternate-colored monsters known as “shiny” Pokémon </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142"><span>don’t despawn in this game</span></a><span>, the shiny hunting meta has been rapidly evolving to take advantage of this new change. Some players devised ways early on to farm these rare spawns </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-shiny-despawn-afk-exploit-wild-zone-2000636610"><span>without touching their controller</span></a><span>, and now that many players have reached the post-game, some have concocted a method to hunt not only shiny Pokémon, but also the large, powerful, aggressive Alpha Pokémon that are also rare spawns in the game’s world.</span></p> <p><span>This method seems so busted, I wouldn’t be surprised if Game Freak patched it out in a future update, but for the moment, players have a really elaborate way of hunting up to six shiny Alpha Pokémon at a time if they’ve seen the credits (the real credits, not </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>the fake ones</span></a><span>). YouTuber Austin John Plays demonstrates the elaborate but effective strategy, which requires you to mess around with and essentially break the Alpha Pokemon in Wild Zone 20’s spawn area so you can trick the game into bringing out more monsters in the area than it’s supposed to. The full method requires you to aggro the Alphas in Wild Zone 20 until they’re near the edge of the fenced-off area. By leaving the zone while these Pokémon are near the edge of it, you’ll make their spawn area essentially reset to the position they were in when you left, meaning the game will trigger </span><i><span>new </span></i><span>Alpha spawns in the center of the zone. If you do this successfully enough times without dying, you can get several Alphas spawning in the zone, and because shiny Pokémon won’t despawn, you can enter, exit, or reset the area by resting on a bench until all six spawned Alphas are shiny.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The whole thing is pretty complicated and requires some precise positioning and saving, but it seems to work. Check out Austin John Plays’ tutorial below:</span></p>  <p><span>I’m always amazed by the commitment shiny hunters bring to breaking the game to find these guys. So far, I’ve stumbled upon two shinies during my playthrough without looking for them, which is more than I typically find in these games. Both the </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> games have made spotting shinies easier by adding a visual and audio indicator when one is in the overworld, so I’ve gotten two in both </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span> without even trying.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are two major knocks against Game Pass these days. The first is the new $30 price point for access to day-one releases. The second is the fact that you’re basically just renting and don’t actually own any of the games you play. The surprise departure of <a href="https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-review-buggy-janky-impressions-xbox-pc-fps-1851705232"><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em></a> in November really drives that home.</p> <p>Subscribers noticed a new notification this month that the post-apocalyptic immersive sim will be part of the batch of games leaving the Netflix-like service in the weeks ahead. The others include <em>Football Manager 2024</em>, <em>Blacksmith Master</em>, and <em>Frostpunk</em>. What caught some players by surprise is just how brief <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>‘s tour on Game Pass has been. The game only released a year ago and has still been receiving <a href="https://support.stalker2.com/hc/en-us/articles/39316885098257-Update-1-6-Night-of-the-Hunter-is-live">substantial updates</a> to improve performance and fix bugs. Some people no doubt expected they had more time to go back and finish the grueling but rewarding shooter.</p>

 <p>“I think it’s a really bad precedent that a game stays shorter in Game Pass than we had to wait for it to launch, beyond waiting MONTHS to become properly playable patch after patch,” one player wrote in <a href="https://x.com/ZakkenKloot/status/1984925333204689052">a thread on X</a> that gained traction over the weekend. “The game hits PS5 before it even leaves Game Pass.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">STALKER 2 got announced in 2020 at the Xbox Showcase in August.</p> <p>STALKER 2 took 4 years to develop beyond announcement and officially dropped in November 2024.</p> <p>STALKER 2 will leave Xbox Game Pass in November 2025.</p> <p>I think it’s a really bad precedent that a game stays shorter in… <a href="https://t.co/TZg486uoeg">https://t.co/TZg486uoeg</a></p> <p>— Kloot (@ZakkenKloot) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZakkenKloot/status/1984925333204689052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The sentiment was echoed on the Game Pass subreddit. “It’s really frustrating seeing Stalker 2 leave Gamepass,” a player there <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1omcjg9/stalker_2_leaving_game_pass/">wrote</a>. “Game is still a buggy mess, so for those who were waiting on this game to be patched, I guess we’re screwed. lol.” Others argued that no one is “screwed” because you can still go and buy the game at any time, but it does cut against some of the perceived value of Game Pass.</p>

 <p><em>Payday 3</em> was a more <a href="https://kotaku.com/payday-3-starbreeze-flop-ceo-removed-fired-low-sales-1851329780">egregious example of this day-one issue</a>. The launch was a mess, lots of things were broken, and lots of fans went back to playing <em>Payday 2</em> until the sequel improved. But the day-one Game Pass release only stayed on the service for a year. Anyone who bounced off during that early window only to come back closer to its departure might have felt like they were getting a raw deal.</p>

 <p>This is the double-edged sword of the value proposition at the center of Game Pass. One the one hand it’s a massive buffet where power-users can super-sample tons of great games to their heart’s content, from blockbusters like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> to small indie games like <em>Minami Lane</em>. If you spend a lot of time playing lots of different games each week, you can actually get&nbsp;<em>more</em> than your money’s worth out of Game Pass.</p>

 <h2>Game Pass’ airline economy problem</h2> <p>But if you actually want to finish a lot of games, or play certain ones more deeply, it doesn’t always make a lot of sense. <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em> is a good example. It can take 40 hours just to beat, or around 70 hours if you finish all of the side content. There’s a lot of trial and error and un-directed exploration. It’s great for getting lost in, but not for trying to breeze through on your way to other parts of the Game Pass library. It’s a perfect candidate for that backlog game you forget about until it’s not longer on Game Pass. If you’re only playing a couple of games a month, you’re better off buying them outright than renting them for a limited time.</p>

 <p>NYU business professor Joost van Dreunen recently called this Game Pass’ “<a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/game-pass-or-fail">airline economics in reverse</a>” problem. “On Game Pass, every user effectively flies business class while paying economy prices, creating an inherently margin-thin model in which heavy users consume disproportionate resources without proportional revenue,” he wrote. Basically, anyone who&nbsp;<em>did</em> spend months finishing <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&nbsp;</em>via Game Pass is just subsidizing the cost of the service for everyone who samples dozens of new games each year. The recent price hike is one way of rebalancing that math, Dreuen argues.</p> <p>Put another way, Game Pass gets way too many <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1ljaff3/day_one_gamepass_additions_for_2025/">day-one releases every year</a> for any regular person to actually finish most of them. It’s a service for people who like to graze and keep trying new things, not people actually intent on clearing stuff from their backlogs. Anyone who leans closer to the completionist camp should be buying their games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has offered the best explanation yet for why the developer's open-world spy thriller <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/agent">Agent</a> fell by the wayside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Agent is the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption developer's long lost spy game, which was announced as a PlayStation 3 exclusive in 2009 but has since disappeared. Rockstar has never officially canceled the project, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-images-of-rockstars-spy-game-agent-appear" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>images leaked in 2015</u></a> showed some of its levels, and while some hope remained due to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/23/take-two-extends-agent-trademark-again"><u>renewed trademarks</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/26/rockstar-abandons-its-agent-trademark"><u>this was eventually scrapped in 2018</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-agent-website-disappears-no-trademark"><u>its website was shut down in 2021</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what happened to Agent? Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption writer Dan Houser, now of Absurd Ventures, has finally offered fans a detailed explanation in <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=VGcoI-t_nP8M1L65" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview on the Lex Fridman podcast</a>. According to Houser, despite multiple versions of Agent being attempted at Rockstar, the game never came together, and that’s because, fundamentally, an open-world spy game simply doesn’t work.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We worked a lot on multiple iterations of an open-world spy game, and it never came together,” Houser began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It had about five different iterations. I don’t think it works. I concluded — and I keep thinking about it sometimes, I sometimes lie in bed thinking about it — and I’ve concluded that what makes them really good as film stories makes them not work as video games. Or we need to think through how to do it in a different way as a video game”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The version of Agent Rockstar announced was set in during the Cold War in the 1970s, but Houser revealed this was just one version of many Rockstar tried and failed to turn into a fun video game. Indeed, there was a version set in the modern day that also failed to go anywhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That was one of the versions,” he said. “There was another one that was set in the current… we had so many different versions of this game, we worked with so many different teams.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Espionage, assassinations… I don't know what it would've been because it never really… We never got it enough to even doing a proper story on it. We were doing the early work as you get the world up and running. It never really found its feet in either of them. And I sort of think I know why.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because in one of those films, they're very, very frenetic and they beat to beat to beat — you gotta go here and save the world, you gotta go there and stop that person being killed and then save the world. An open-world game does have moments like that when the story comes together. But for large portions, it's a lot looser, and you're just hanging out and you’re just doing what you want. And I want freedom. I wanna go over here and do what I want, and I wanna go over and do what you want. That's why it works well being a criminal, because you fundamentally don't have anyone telling you what to do. We try and create external agency through these people kind of forcing you into the story at times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But as a spy, that doesn't really work because you have to be against the clock. So I think for me, I question if you can even make a good open-world spy game. So lots of things would work as open-world games, but I don't know if a spy does.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/03/agent-1762181214091.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A screenshot from the cancelled Agent.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, former Rockstar Games technical director Obbe Vermeij said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-sheds-light-on-long-lost-game-agents-development-troubles">pressure from Grand Theft Auto 5's development contributed to Agent eventually switching studios before being scrapped altogether</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We really got going on this one and worked on it for over a year. I remember working on a downhill skiing chase scene with guns for instance," Vermeij said of Agent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game wasn't progressing as well as we'd hoped. It was inevitable that eventually the whole company would have to get behind the next Grand Theft Auto. We tried to cut the game down in an attempt to get the bulk of it done before the inevitable call from New York would come. We cut out an entire level (I think Cairo) and maybe even the space section.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It became clear that [Agent] was going to be too much of a distraction for us and we ditched it. I think it was handed over to another company within Rockstar but never got completed." Half of the Rockstar North team was working on Grand Theft Auto 4 DLC and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/16/grand-theft-auto-v-review"><u>Grand Theft Auto 5</u></a>, while half was set to work on Agent before the importance of its premiere franchise took over.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/03/gettyimages-2237849657-1762181394170.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dan Houser at 2025 Los Angeles Comic Con.

"There was a French Mediterranean city, a Swiss ski resort, Cairo, and at the end there would be a big shootout with lasers in space. Classic James Bond. The vibe was very cool."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar was kept busy otherwise with smash hits GTA 5 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review"><u>Red Dead Redemption 2</u></a>, releasing in 2013 and 2018 respectively. GTA 6 is set to follow next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Houser went on to say that rockstar also “played around with the knights concept,” following Agent’s demise, “trying to do a version of a mythological game that could have been fun.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Still love that idea, but never went very far with it,” he explained. “It never got to writing any of it. Just did some backstory and played around with a few ideas. But it was always something I thought I would never do, and then kind of fell in love with it a little bit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Agent is dead, IO Interactive’s promising 007: First Light is due out next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Netflix's The Witcher is heading into its final seasons, and not all fans are happy. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witchers-liam-hemsworth-says-he-was-reluctant-to-take-over-for-henry-cavill/1100-6535733/" data-ref-id="1100-6535733">With Liam Hemsworth taking over as Geralt from Henry Cavill in Season 4</a>, some viewers have criticized the show for straying from Andrzej Sapkowski's beloved books. But showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich wants fans to remember that there’s more than one way to enjoy The Witcher.</p><p>"One of the things that I've talked a lot to the author about and a lot to fans about is that the books still exist. No one is taking the books away. No one is taking the video games away," she said, talking to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/why-the-witcher-wont-make-game-of-thrones-ending-mistake-netflix-3276622/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>. </p><p>Hissrich also stressed that the Netflix series will not make the same mistakes as the Game of Thrones adaptation. "We lucked out because I said very early on, 'We're not going to go past the books,'" she explained. Seasons 4 and 5, filmed back-to-back, will adapt the final three novels: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. Geralt's origin story was explored in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-book-series-crossroads-of-ravens-novel-box-sets-reading-order/1100-6532972/" data-ref-id="1100-6532972">Crossroads of Ravens</a>, which was released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crossroads-Ravens-Witcher-Andrzej-Sapkowski/dp/0316597732?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">back in late September</a>. </p><p>"We lean so hardcore into fantasy at the end in wonderful ways that Sapkowski introduced us to. So we knew the stories that we needed to end with," she added. </p><p>The showrunner acknowledged the challenges of balancing fans of the books, the video games, and new viewers who discovered the world through the Netflix show. "You have book fans, you have video game fans, and then you have fans that knew nothing about this world until the show existed. The truth is, we can't choose one audience," she said.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher/">The Witcher video games</a>, developed by CD Projekt Red, have been hugely influential, offering players a richly detailed world and an alternate take on Geralt’s adventures that differ from both the books and the show.</p><p>Hissrich framed the Netflix series as one version of a larger universe. "I think everyone can have their version of The Witcher, and this is this version," she said. Season 4 premiered on October 30, while fans can continue to explore Geralt’s story in Sapkowski’s novels or through the critically acclaimed Witcher games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-review-winds-howlin/1900-6416135/" data-ref-id="1900-6416135">including The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, which many consider a modern gaming masterpiece.</p><p>While we're still a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">few years away from The Witcher 4</a>, the footage that has been released so far <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-the-witcher-4-footage-looks-ridiculously-good-on-ps5-but-theres-a-caveat/1100-6532024/" data-ref-id="1100-6532024">looked really impressive</a>.  </p>

As much as I liked what I played, it just <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-beginner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t get its hooks in my brain</a> the way it did with others, and it’s the kind of game that needs passion to see it through. But I have finally found my sicko mode, “can’t stop thinking about it and need to talk to everyone about it” puzzle game: <em>The Seance of Blake Manor</em>.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1395520/The_Sance_of_Blake_Manor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Seance of Blake Manor</em></a> casts you as Declan Ward, a detective in 1890s Ireland who’s been called to a mysterious manor hotel to investigate the disappearance of a woman named Evelyn Deane. A diverse crew of guests has gathered at the manor to attend a seance, and it quickly becomes clear that they all have their reasons to wish Deane harm. You have the weekend to figure out what happened to Deane and who’s responsible before the seance occurs on Sunday night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Séance of Blake Manor | Release Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QF8sknUZUW4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The time limit can feel pressuring, but time only passes when you undertake certain clearly-marked actions, such as examining objects, questioning guests, and attending events like meals and lectures. An important first step in solving the mystery is filling your timetable with the weekend’s activities and guests’ schedules, so you’ll know who will or won’t be where every hour. The latter is particularly helpful; one fruitful avenue of investigation is to break into everyone’s rooms and go through their stuff, and you definitely don’t want to get caught. Ask me how I know.</p><figure><figcaption>Analyzing a character tells you more about them and gives you topics to discuss (Spooky Door)</figcaption></figure><p>Every guest and staff of the hotel has a backstory, motive, and relationships with other characters. And they’re not just cursory stuff for atmosphere; I almost immediately forgot about the game’s central mystery as I dug into secret love affairs, thwarted career ambitions, cryptic plots, mystical societies, class and race tensions, failed romances, and people struggling to square their faiths with a changing Ireland and with the popularity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritualism_(movement)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spiritualism</a>, a 19th and early 20th century movement to communicate with the dead that threatened much of society’s <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/419656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">status quo</a>. (Spiritualism is one of my top <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171025072830/https://kotaku.com/the-real-fakery-of-the-ouija-board-1819805308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">niche interests</a>, and I’m also currently learning the <a href="https://aftermath.site/irish-now-youre-talking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Irish language</a>; the fact that there’s a game about both is <em>very</em> exciting for me specifically.) To add to the plot stuff, the game is also full of things to learn about the history of the manor, Chrisitian gnosticism, and Irish folklore, politics, and history–a lot of this information is kept in the manor’s library, where you can research plot-essential stuff, but also browse the shelves for more detail on a topic. I’ve spent way more time doing this than I have actually trying to figure out what happened to Deane; I’m currently just before Saturday dinner and feel like I have no hope of solving her mystery <em>and</em> preventing whatever horrors it’s hinted will happen at Sunday night’s seance. With over 20 characters to learn about and whose problems to solve, I’m constantly panicking about the time limit, though players who’ve beaten the game tell me not to worry and that they ended things with time to spare.</p><figure><figcaption>The library (Spooky Door)</figcaption></figure><p>The game has a robust set of menus to help you keep track of all this and figure out what to do next. When you talk to characters, available topics are represented by icons to choose from, and while characters will only talk about certain topics so you don’t fritter away your time too badly, not all of them are essential for your investigations. Discovering more about the topics that <em>are</em> important places those topics on a mind map/ conspiracy board that shows how they’re connected and paints an overall picture of a character and their story. (I’d show you images, but they would be full of spoilers; you can see a glimpse of this in the trailer above.) When you’ve connected enough bits of information, you’re given a Mad Libs-style screen in which to create a hypothesis by filling in words from your conspiracy board, and then you can confront that particular character about it. I found these Mad Libs a little fiddly on occasion to express my hypothesis exactly how the game wanted me to, but it’s a fun mechanic with a lot of guardrails to make sure you know what’s going on. So far, some of my confrontations have wrapped up a character’s story, while others have introduced actions I need to take to fully resolve things, which means more investigating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The game menus do their best to keep everything organized for you and to nudge you about where to go next, but I haven’t always found it to be quite enough, so I also keep a notebook beside me while I play. Occasionally I’ve been frustrated when I feel like I know enough to confront a character but haven’t discovered all the things to let the <em>game</em> know I know them, but those instances have been pretty rare. My main problem is that everything is so interesting that I’m constantly getting off track, suddenly remembering that time is ticking down and I’m no closer to putting my top priorities to bed.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Story cutscenes are told through dialogue and static images (Spooky Door)</figcaption></figure><p>For me, <em>The Seance of Blake Manor</em> echoes <em>Blue Prince</em>’s interlocking mysteries and sense of place without having to contend with its life-eating RNG and open-endedness (I’ve also seen some players compare the two game’s art styles.). There’s some <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> vibes too (a game I actually <em>did</em> <a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-end" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finish</a>!), and I’ve wrestled with wanting to start again to introduce the game to the <a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-laser-eyes-tips-steam-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">friend</a> I played <em>Lorelei </em>with, and not wanting anything to come between me and seeing its end. But at the same time, I’m tempted to start again just so there’ll be more game to play, even though I have a full in-game day and evening left; like a good book, I both want to know what happens in the end and to never be done with it.</p><p>It sucks to be writing about <em>Blake Manor</em> on a Monday morning because now I want to be playing it but a whole work day stands in the way. There is just <em>so much</em> in this game, all of it given so much detail and attention that I’m thoroughly lost in it, while still providing enough guidance to keep me from getting totally washed away. It’s captured the obsession and passion of all those puzzle games I couldn’t get into this year, while still being a constrained experience I can actually tackle, with that time limit bringing a tension that feels essential to the game’s story and atmosphere. There’s a free demo on Steam if you want to get a feel for it first; you should do this not just because the game is good, but because then I’ll have more people playing alongside me to talk about it with.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-halo-white-house-trump-vance"><h3>And Also, Who Even Cares About Halo And Lord Of The Rings These Days</h3></a><p>"All of these things do have a feeling of dragging and resuscitating a corpse"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-tactics-grind-jp-mandalia-plains"><h3>I Will Grind In Final Fantasy Tactics Every Single Time And You Cannot Stop Me</h3></a><p>Final Fantasy Tactics without grinding Mandalia Plains is like a day without sunshine.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-halo-dhs-ice-trump-flood"><h3>Not Commenting Is Commenting</h3></a><p>'Microsoft does not have anything to share on this matter'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/seance-of-blake-manor]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ahead of 'Wicked: For Good'</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="706d691edd75b"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/706d691edd75b/super-mario-bros-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Universal Pictures</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you're itching to see what <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> will actually look like, then you might not have much longer to wait.</p>
<p>According to movie scoops outlet <a href="https://x.com/MyTimeToShineH/status/1985029599063843018">My Time to Shine</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-next-mario-galaxy-movie-reveal-is-reportedly-coming-very-soon/">VGC</a>), the next trailer for the upcoming flick will be presented before showings for <strong>Wicked: For Good</strong>. If accurate, this presumably means that the trailer will get its debut either on <strong>21st November</strong>, which is when Wicked: For Good releases, or at some point beforehand.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn't sound like a very Nintendo move to just let the trailer play in theatres without any kind of build-up, so we'd imagine that there would be some sort of Direct showcase in which Miyamoto reveals the trailer himself, followed by Chris Pratt reiterating how much he just loves to stomp those darn Koopas.</p>

<p>Whether this claim is accurate or not, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is releasing on <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>, so Nintendo and Illumination will likely want to kick off the marketing campaign pretty soon.</p>
<p>The upcoming movie is a direct sequel to <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>, which released back in 2023. Actors Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jack Black, Charlie Day, Keegan-Michael Key, and Kevin Michael Richardson are all set to reprise their roles.</p>
<p>The movie's title was revealed during the most recent Nintendo Direct, during which the 40th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> was recognised with several key announcements.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-maps-proven-to-be-smaller-than-most-series%E2%80%99-maps-in-new-community-effort.1342237/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Many fans of the series feel that Battlefield 6's maps are smaller than the rest of the series, and it seems like they were right, judging from a comparison put together by a member of the community.</p>



<p>Over on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/updated_battlefield_maps_from_bf3_bf4_bfhl_bf1/">Battlefield subreddit</a>, user ClaraTheRed shared a couple of comparison images that show all of the series' 87 maps, their total and playable area, their shapes and how they rank in terms of size.</p>



<p>The findings are not in the Battlefield 6 maps' favor at all. The game's largest map, Operation Firestorm, a remade version of Battlefield 3's map, ranks 32nd in terms of playable space. It is also considerably smaller than the original, which ranks at 7th in terms of playable area.</p>



<p>Every other Battlefield 6 map ranks relatively low in the total ranking for playable space. Mirak Valley is the largest of the game's original maps, ranking 35th, while the smallest, Saints Quarter, is also the 2nd smallest map in the entire series. As such, those who felt that the game's maps were small were clearly onto something, even without doing an accurate comparison as the user ClaraTheRed did.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While many of the largest maps in the series were DLC maps released long after each respective game, there's no denying that Battlefield 6's maps do leave something to be desired in terms of playable space, even compared to the launch maps of previous entries in the series. With the community being rather vocal about this matter, it will be interesting to see if the developer will take this feedback into account for future maps, as they have been doing for some other aspects of the game, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://mp1st.com/news/after-community-backlash-devs-remove-battlefield-6s-neon-blue-skin">including the removal of a skin that the community felt didn't fit the setting at all.</a></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. Learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">David Carcasole's review.</a></p>

            <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 lie ahead.</p>
<p>Tabletop wizard and cool glasses-wearer <a href="https://www.vg247.com/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-mike-pondsmith">Mike Pondsmith</a> has teased having "ways" to bring Johnny Silverhand back in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s sequel. Actor and serial whoa merchant Keanu Reeves hasn't been shy about being open to reprising the role were the opportunity to crash through his door waving some mantis blades about, but reconciling such a thing with the events of the first game could prove a bit complex.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Pondsmith's let loose potential details about Cyberpunk 2, which developers CD Projekt have otherwise remained pretty tight-lipped about while they work away at it. <a href="https://www.vg247.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-city-like-chicago-gone-wrong-michael-jordans-legacy">Back in May</a>, he alluded to having chatted to a dev at the studio about a city which "feels more like Chicago gone wrong" that's visited during the course of the game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Pondsmith said more words during a recent interview on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc">CD Projekt livestream</a>. "You know, not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again," he mentioned, alluding to Reeves' <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">declariation of being down to return</a> to the role. "I have ways to do that, Keanu. Contact me."</p><p>The tabletop man refused to elaborate any further, as people who mention having mysterious ways to accomplish things often do. I assume the obvious way would be to have a Punch and Judy-style Silverhand puppet narrate the main menu, as the moon man of fellow RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> does. Think about it, every time there's a plot twist, he can have a sarcastic moan about you, a gonk, having gonkishly erred in trusting certain chooms, gonkishly. He'd have seen it coming years before you did, gonkchoom.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, the only answers that'd make much sense would be if the sequel turns out to be a prequel to the events of the first game, or leans into flashback at certain points as that first Cyberpunk does. Either that, or some nonsense about there being extra hard drives knocking about somewhere in the real or net bits of the Cyberpunk universe with even more copies of the Silversonality on them.</p>
<p>Personally, I think I'd prefer it if Silverhand's story concluded in the first game, and the sequel moves on to fresh ground with minimal retreading. A brief cameo via flashback might be cool, but isn't worth doing just for the sake of it. In this interview, Pondsmith mentioned how blown away he was by CD Projekt getting Idris Elba for Phantom Liberty, and half jokes that he'd like to see Scarlett Johansson next. Sure, why not, but I reckon Cyberpunk's better off not being totally stuffed to the gills with every celeb possible, like a cyberware-heavy Christmas pantomime. That's what keeps the odd cameo in a role which fits the actor being cast feeling special.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Surely by now you’ve heard it all: <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-alarmo-nintendo-alarm-clock-hack-modder-usb-id-pc-1851690005"><i>Doom</i> running on an alarm clock</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-running-inside-fortnite-uefn-how-epic-twitter-fps-1851585177">inside <i>Fortnite</i></a>, on <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-running-on-pdf-weird-port-id-software-fps-pc-mod-1851739634">a simple PDF</a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-runs-doom-cells-bacteria-1851212417">even on human bacteria</a>. It seems like <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-weirdest-ports-keyboard-atm-calculator-tractor-pc-1850726374"><i>Doom</i> can run on anything</a>. But what about running <i>Doom</i> on a satellite orbiting the planet while also using images of the Earth taken by the very satellite running the game for the game’s backdrops? Well, some very clever folks managed to pull off that very thing.</p> <p>Ubuntu Summit is a yearly gathering of Linux professionals and enthusiasts where folks show off cool stuff they’re doing with one of the most popular Linux desktop distributions out there. This year, programmer Ólafur Waage dove into how a bunch of clever folks not only got <i>Doom</i> running on an orbital satellite last year, but also how they were able to replace the game’s background image of the terrain and skies of Hell with photos of Earth taken by the satellite (<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/doom-can-run-just-about-anywhere-including-space-hacker-recounts-tale-of-running-the-game-on-an-orbiting-satellite">h/t <i>Tom’s Hardware</i></a>). It was no easy feat, but it resulted in a new frontier for <i>Doom</i> ports. Check out Waage’s presentation of <i>Doom</i> in space during the summit <a href="https://youtu.be/bEEamxJ60aI?t=2746">here (starting at 46:00 or so)</a>.</p>

 <p><iframe title="Ubuntu Summit 25.10 | Day One" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bEEamxJ60aI?start=2746&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p> <p>While he was working on a project to get <i>Doom</i> running in C++ as opposed to its original programming language, C, Waage was contacted by Georges Labrèche, a spacecraft operations engineer at the European Space Agency, about the prospect of running <i>Doom</i> on the ESA’s OP-SAT satellite.</p>

 <p>OP-SAT presented an excellent opportunity for the ESA, as an experimental platform for unique tests on a device orbiting the Earth made out of (mostly) off-the-shelf computer parts and housed in a device not much larger than a suitcase.</p> <p>After getting <i>Doom</i> to run without graphical output, as proof it could be done, the team was not only able to get actual graphics running with the game in software rendering mode, but it was also able to swap out <i>Doom</i>’s fictional skybox with real images of the Earth, processed by a machine learning algorithm to adapt to <i>Doom</i>’s strict palette limit of 256 colors. The team had to tweak the color palette a bit to allow for more than <i>Doom</i> usually does, but the results worked. Not only did <i>Doom</i> run in space, but it ran in space while using a skybox featuring images taken by the very satellite it was running on.</p> <p>So yes, <i>Doom</i> has run on everything and everywhere, including a satellite in space.</p>

                <p>With The Simpsons taking over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> battle royale, we've been duking it out on a new, cel-shaded island based on Springfield, the home of the long-running sitcom's titular family. Naturally, the island is full of references to the show, both big and small, and you can earn a healthy chunk of XP toward the new Simpsons-themed battle pass by finding some of them. On top of that, we've got a set of story quests to start us off, as well as some found quests that literally pop out of treasure chests occasionally.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a little less hand-holding than usual with these quests, since Fortnite doesn't even tell you what a lot of them are--sometimes you find out a quest exists only after you finish it. But we got you covered. Read on for explanations for all of Fortnite's new Simpsons quests.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_complete_the_Fortnite_x_Simpsons_nuclear_power_plant_event">How to complete the Fortnite x Simpsons nuclear power plant event</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_x_Simpsons_Hidden_Gags_quests">Fortnite x Simpsons Hidden Gags quests</a><ul><li><a href="#Knock_the_Jebediah_Springfield_statue_s_head_off">Knock the Jebediah Springfield statue's head off</a></li><li><a href="#Spray_Springfield_with_El_Barto_tags">Spray Springfield with El Barto tags</a></li><li><a href="#Step_on_a_rake">Step on a rake</a></li><li><a href="#Release_the_hounds">Release the hounds</a></li><li><a href="#Dislodge_the_Lard_Lad_donut">Dislodge the Lard Lad donut</a></li><li><a href="#Prank_call_Moe">Prank call Moe</a></li><li><a href="#Bring_the_Haw_Haw_humiliation">Bring the Haw Haw humiliation</a></li><li><a href="#Find_Mr__Sparkle">Find Mr. Sparkle</a></li><li><a href="#Jump_the_Springfield_Gorge">Jump the Springfield Gorge</a></li><li><a href="#Sit_on_the_Simpsons__couch">Sit on the Simpsons' couch</a></li><li><a href="#Eat_a_Steamed_Ham">Eat a Steamed Ham</a></li><li><a href="#Catch_Blinky">Catch Blinky</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_X_Simpsons_story_quests___Apocalypse_D_oh">Fortnite X Simpsons story quests - Apocalypse D'oh</a><ul><li><a href="#Visit_three_named_locations">Visit three named locations</a></li><li><a href="#Destroy_five_of_Homer_s_signs">Destroy five of Homer's signs</a></li><li><a href="#Emote_near_a_boss_NPC">Emote near a boss NPC</a></li><li><a href="#Do_250_damage_to_bosses">Do 250 damage to bosses</a></li><li><a href="#Convince_Homer_to_give_up_the_power">Convince Homer to give up the power</a></li><li><a href="#Visit_Town_Hall_to_voice_your_concerns">Visit Town Hall to voice your concerns</a></li><li><a href="#Find_a_Squishee">Find a Squishee</a></li><li><a href="#Deliver_it_to_Homer">Deliver it to Homer</a></li><li><a href="#Enter_the_Simpsons_house_and_inspect_different_remotes">Enter the Simpsons house and inspect different remotes</a></li><li><a href="#Confront_Homer">Confront Homer</a></li><li><a href="#Return_to_Hope">Return to Hope</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_x_Simpsons_Lost_and_Found_quests">Fortnite x Simpsons Lost and Found quests</a><ul><li><a href="#Marge_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Marge's Lost and Found quests</a></li><li><a href="#Homer_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Homer's Lost and Found quests</a></li><li><a href="#Lisa_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Lisa's Lost and Found quests</a></li><li><a href="#Bart_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Bart's Lost and Found quests</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Kickstart_quests">Kickstart quests</a><ul><li><a href="#Visit_the_Simpsons_house">Visit the Simpsons house</a></li><li><a href="#Defeat_two_bosses_or_elite_guards">Defeat two bosses or elite guards</a></li><li><a href="#Raise_the_flag_at_Kamp_Krusty">Raise the flag at Kamp Krusty</a></li><li><a href="#Secure_KBBL_Radio_Towers_two_times">Secure KBBL Radio Towers two times</a></li><li><a href="#Damage_opponents_with_Mr__Blasty__1_000_points_of_damage_">Damage opponents with Mr. Blasty (1,000 points of damage)</a></li><li><a href="#Damage_Dober_Men__300_points_of_damage_">Damage Dober Men (300 points of damage)</a></li><li><a href="#Search_Mr__Burns_Mystery_Boxes">Search Mr. Burns Mystery Boxes</a></li><li><a href="#Travel_distance_while_sprinting_under_the_effects_of_Super_Squishee">Travel distance while sprinting under the effects of Super Squishee</a></li><li><a href="#Use_the_Zero_Point_dash_four_times_after_consuming_a_Blinky_Fish">Use the Zero Point dash four times after consuming a Blinky Fish</a></li><li><a href="#Complete_a_Lost_and_Found_quest">Complete a Lost and Found quest</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_complete_the_Fortnite_x_Simpsons_nuclear_power_plant_event">How to complete the Fortnite x Simpsons nuclear power plant event</h2><p dir="ltr">Whenever the circle is going to close in and leave the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in the storm, the plant goes into meltdown. If you're there when this happens, you'll see an icon directing you to the plant's control room, where you'll need to enter a sequence using the three buttons--Eenie, Meenie, and Minie--to avert disaster and receive some sick loot.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the sequence is random each match, but you can find out what the code is by looking for these posters around the plant. Using the sequence from the poster should complete the event.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594997-vlcsnap-2025-11-02-16h18m26s769.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594997" data-ratio="0.56227239621267" data-width="1373" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594997-vlcsnap-2025-11-02-16h18m26s769.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594997"></a><figcaption>These randomized posters will tell you the code sequence for each match.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594997-vlcsnap-2025-11-02-16h18m26s769.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">A new type of milestone this season simply tells you to find 12 "hidden gags" around the island, with no further details. All 12 tasks are listed below, with instructions for how to complete them. Each of these is worth 5k XP the first time you do them, and completing all 12 is another 20k. Some of these quests also grant stashes of loot and/or gold.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Knock_the_Jebediah_Springfield_statue_s_head_off">Knock the Jebediah Springfield statue's head off</h3><p dir="ltr">In the Springfield Town Square is a statue of the town's founder, Jebediah Springfield. You can knock the head off this statue by shooting it or hitting it with your pickaxe to complete the quest. And then you can wear the head, which will protect you from all damage the next time an enemy shoots you in the head.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Spray_Springfield_with_El_Barto_tags">Spray Springfield with El Barto tags</h3><p dir="ltr">In every named location, you'll find walls with a little spraycan icon on them. Opening the emote wheel while next to one of these will let you tag the wall with the El Barto spray to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Step_on_a_rake">Step on a rake</h3><p dir="ltr">Leaf rakes are lying on the ground in grassy areas all over the map. Stepping on one will make the handle fly up and hit you in the face.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Release_the_hounds">Release the hounds</h3><p dir="ltr">In Mayor Burns' office in Burns Manor, you'll find a big red button on the large wooden desk at the center of the room. Pressing this button will release a bunch of Dober Man NPCs who will fight any hostile players who enter the area.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Dislodge_the_Lard_Lad_donut">Dislodge the Lard Lad donut</h3><p dir="ltr">In the Donut District, you can damage the Lard Lad statue to knock the giant donut off of it--turning the donut into a large physics object that can destroy buildings and cause other havoc.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Prank_call_Moe">Prank call Moe</h3><p dir="ltr">Most of the major locations have several ringing payphones you can interact with. Doing so will have Bart prank call Moe, which will grant you some gold.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bring_the_Haw_Haw_humiliation">Bring the Haw Haw humiliation</h3><p dir="ltr">Defeating a boss NPC--Witch Marge, Evil Homer, or Krusty the Clown--prompts Nelson to pop up and laugh at the dead baddie. Meaning defeating any boss completes this quest. Unfortunately, the bosses don't have consistent spawn locations, so it's tough to predict where to find them. But they always begin in or near one of the named locations.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Find_Mr__Sparkle">Find Mr. Sparkle</h3><p dir="ltr">You can find this cleaning solution under some dirt in the corner of the Tire Fire, just south of Evergreen Terrace.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Jump_the_Springfield_Gorge">Jump the Springfield Gorge</h3><p dir="ltr">Just east of Evergreen Terrace is a large gorge with a dirt ramp next to it. Simply jump the gorge while hitting the hoop hovering above it to complete the quest. Using a car is the most obvious way to do this, but using Shockwave Grenades, Super Squishees, or Blinky fish to jump through the hoop on foot is also valid.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594995-19a470d1177100-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594995" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594995-19a470d1177100-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594995"></a><figcaption>You can your squad can watch TV on the Simpsons' couch.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594995-19a470d1177100-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Sit_on_the_Simpsons__couch">Sit on the Simpsons' couch</h3><p dir="ltr">The iconic Simpsons home is located in the center of Evergreen Terrace--you'll know you're in the right place because the Marge NPC will be hanging out there. Interact with the couch in the living room to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Eat_a_Steamed_Ham">Eat a Steamed Ham</h3><p dir="ltr">While you're at the Simpsons' house for the previous quest, pop into the dining room where you should find a platter of steamed ham sandwiches. Platters like this also pop up in restaurants and other homes. So if the Simpsons' house doesn't have any, try Ned Flanders' house next door.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Catch_Blinky">Catch Blinky</h3><p dir="ltr">This quest is telling you to catch a fish with a fishing rod. While there are rivers flowing all over the island, none of them is suitable for fishing. Instead, you'll need to look for swirling fishing spots in the lake next to Kamp Krusty, and in the ocean surrounding the island. Catching one Blinky fish will complete the quest.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_X_Simpsons_story_quests___Apocalypse_D_oh">Fortnite X Simpsons story quests - Apocalypse D'oh</h2><p dir="ltr">The first stage of the season's story quests, Apocalypse D'oh, is live now. These quests don't give any XP on their own, but you'll receive 30k XP for every three story or found quests you complete, until you've completed 30 of them. You'll have to do these quests in order, and you can find step-by-step instructions below.</p><p dir="ltr">This set of story quests will only be available until November 10, at which time they'll be replaced with the next set of story quests.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Visit_three_named_locations">Visit three named locations</h3><p dir="ltr">This one is as simple as it sounds. Simply visit any three different named locations, over the course of however many matches you want.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Destroy_five_of_Homer_s_signs">Destroy five of Homer's signs</h3><p dir="ltr">Many of the named locations around the map are filled with goofy signs that Homer has put up--like "go" signs instead of "stop" signs, or the sign that indicates it's illegal to be Ned Flanders. Destroy five of these signs, which will be marked on your UI with an exclamation point, to move on to the next quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Emote_near_a_boss_NPC">Emote near a boss NPC</h3><p dir="ltr">You'll need to find one of the boss NPCs--Witch Marge, Evil Homer, and Krusty the Clown--that spawn randomly in any of the named locations, and then emote when you're close to them. Just don't emote for too long, since they'll probably start shooting at you.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Do_250_damage_to_bosses">Do 250 damage to bosses</h3><p dir="ltr">Once you've danced with the boss, shoot it. Once you've caused 250 damage, you'll move on to the next stage.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Convince_Homer_to_give_up_the_power">Convince Homer to give up the power</h3><p dir="ltr">The Homer NPC lives at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Just interact with Homer and choose the marked quest dialogue about the Zero Point shard he found.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Visit_Town_Hall_to_voice_your_concerns">Visit Town Hall to voice your concerns</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer wants you to do some lobbying on his behalf before he'll give up on whatever he's trying to do with the shard. So head to Springfield Town Hall in Corruption Corners, where you'll be prompted to destroy 25 objects before the cops show up and arrest you--you'll have 90 seconds, which is plenty of time.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Find_a_Squishee">Find a Squishee</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer also wants a Super Squishee drink, so you'll need to find one from any source, like treasure chests and Squishee machines that are found in every Qwik-E-Mart around the island--you can buy three Squishees for 300 gold from these machines.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Deliver_it_to_Homer">Deliver it to Homer</h3><p dir="ltr">You'll need to bring Homer the Super Squishee, but you'll need to take a specific route marked by checkpoint hoops--going directly to him by any other path won't count. You'll have four minutes from the moment you enter a Kwik-E-Mart or pick up a Squishee to complete the quest, or else you'll have to start this stage again.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Enter_the_Simpsons_house_and_inspect_different_remotes">Enter the Simpsons house and inspect different remotes</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer is being stubborn, so you'll need to visit the Simpsons' home in Evergreen Terrace to investigate what he's planning. Once you're there, you'll need to inspect five remote controls, which are scattered around the house and marked with exclamation points.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Confront_Homer">Confront Homer</h3><p dir="ltr">All that's left from here is talking. Return once again to Homer at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and click through the quest dialogue to complete this stage.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Return_to_Hope">Return to Hope</h3><p dir="ltr">Then, visit the NPC Hope at the donut shop in Donut District, and click through her quest dialogue to complete the first wave of story quests for Fortnite's Simpsons season.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_x_Simpsons_Lost_and_Found_quests">Fortnite x Simpsons Lost and Found quests</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594996-19a470ce2cc58-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594996" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594996-19a470ce2cc58-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594996"></a><figcaption>Lost and Found quests come from these objects that sometimes pop out of chests.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594996-19a470ce2cc58-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>You won't find these quests in your menu, because they drop from treasure chests and ammo boxes, and you can also pick one up from the NPCs who offer them, which are Homer, Marge, Lisa, and Bart. These repeatable quests award high-quality loot for each one that you complete, as well as 1k XP. Plus, there's the 30k XP you receive for every three found or story quests you do, until you've done 30 of them.</p><p dir="ltr">There are four types of these quests right now, one for each member of the Simpson clan.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Marge_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Marge's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Marge wants you to collect some items, either several of the same thing, or different items of a certain rarity--like three uncommon items, which are green rarity.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Homer_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Homer's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer's quests involve driving a distance in a vehicle. Just find a car, and do some driving.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Lisa_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Lisa's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Lisa will task you with finding her lost textbooks, which are scattered around whichever named location is nearest. You'll need to look for exclamation points on your mini-map to see where the books are, since they spawn randomly around each location.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bart_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Bart's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Bart's quests require you to be destructive, either by damaging enemies or breaking stuff.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4594994-screenshot1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594994" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4594994-screenshot1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594994"></a><figcaption>The home of the Simpsons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4594994-screenshot1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Kickstart_quests">Kickstart quests</h2><p dir="ltr">Finally, we have the season-long Kickstart quests that exist to encourage you to get acquainted with the new mechanics in Fortnite's Simpsons season. These are fairly simple and uncomplicated, and we'll explain them all below. Each of these quests is worth 30k XP.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Visit_the_Simpsons_house">Visit the Simpsons house</h3><p dir="ltr">In the center of Evergreen Terrace, on the east side of the central square, is the iconic Simpsons house, pictured above for reference. Entering it will complete this quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Defeat_two_bosses_or_elite_guards">Defeat two bosses or elite guards</h3><p dir="ltr">The three boss NPCs--Evil Homer, Witch Marge, and Krusty the Clown--spawn randomly in named locations each match, but you can also find Dober Man guards near the KBBL Radio Towers. You can also spawn Dober Man guards by pressing the big red button on the desk in Burns Manor. Defeat two of them to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Raise_the_flag_at_Kamp_Krusty">Raise the flag at Kamp Krusty</h3><p dir="ltr">There's a control point at Kamp Krusty that's been graced with a Camp Bart flag. Capture it to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Secure_KBBL_Radio_Towers_two_times">Secure KBBL Radio Towers two times</h3><p dir="ltr">These radio towers are serving at the storm forecast towers this season. Defeat the Dober Man guards and deliver the keycard they dropped to the radio tower for a weather forecast. Do this twice to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Damage_opponents_with_Mr__Blasty__1_000_points_of_damage_">Damage opponents with Mr. Blasty (1,000 points of damage)</h3><p dir="ltr">Mr. Blasty is a new revolver in the loot pool this season, which drops from all normal sources of loot. You just need to shoot your enemies with it--bosses and other NPC enemies count for this.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Damage_Dober_Men__300_points_of_damage_">Damage Dober Men (300 points of damage)</h3><p dir="ltr">The Dober Man guards can be found at KBBL Radio Towers, and in Burns Manor if you press the red button on the desk in Burns' office.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Search_Mr__Burns_Mystery_Boxes">Search Mr. Burns Mystery Boxes</h3><p dir="ltr">Instead of normal blue chests, Simpsons season has added these question mark-covered boxes with enhanced loot. Search two of them to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Travel_distance_while_sprinting_under_the_effects_of_Super_Squishee">Travel distance while sprinting under the effects of Super Squishee</h3><p dir="ltr">Drinking a Super Squishee drink, which can be purchased from any Qwik-E-Mart, gives you unlimited sprint, low gravity, and fast sprint for a limited time. Sprint for 250 meters while under that effect to complete the quest. You'll need to stay on the ground for this one, though, as distance traveled in the air doesn't count.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Use_the_Zero_Point_dash_four_times_after_consuming_a_Blinky_Fish">Use the Zero Point dash four times after consuming a Blinky Fish</h3><p dir="ltr">Eating a Blinky fish will give you a dash ability for a short time. Just hit the jump button while you're in the air to dash in any direction--the quest will complete after you've dashed four times.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Complete_a_Lost_and_Found_quest">Complete a Lost and Found quest</h3><p dir="ltr">Complete any of the quests in the Lost and Found section above for this one.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A weird invincibility exploit has apparently led to Epic Games disabling The Simpsons couch in Fortnite. That means players can't take a seat on the iconic piece of animated furniture currently. The timing is also unfortunate, since last night's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-just-had-a-bananas-fortnite-couch-gag-and-poor-peely-didnt-fare-well/1100-6535878/">Simpsons episode featured an opening couch gag with Fortnite characters</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1985151319716376789" rel="nofollow ">official Fortnite Status account on X</a> posted about the couch issue at 8:05 PM ET on November 2, which is literally five minutes after The Simpsons started last night. The couch gag saw poor Peely meet an unfortunate fate and brought an unsettling new meaning to Fortnite skin. Meanwhile, an account named <a href="https://x.com/Relishh_/status/1985160615044767790" rel="nofollow ">Relishh on X</a> believes the couch was disabled in-game because the interaction could lead to invincibility for players.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1985151319716376789" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🛋️ We’ve temporarily disabled the Simpsons Couch in Fortnite to fix an issue. <br>We’ll fix this and get you and the squad back on the couch to clip your own Simpsons intros as soon as we can.</p>  — Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1985151319716376789?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The odd glitch reportedly required bringing Homer's car to the furniture, pickaxing the vehicle to zero health, then sitting on the couch.

            <p>A collection of Japanese publishers including Bandai Namco, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, and others have come together as part of CODA (Content Overseas Distribution Association) to request Open AI cease training AI video generation tool Sora 2 on their collective creative works.</p>
<p>The statement to Open AI, <a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/817/">made public via a statement published on the CODA website</a>, state that CODA, requests that CODA members works are not used for machine learning without prior permission, and that Open AI responds sincerely to claims and inquires from CODA members regarding copyright infringement related to Sora 2's output.</p>
<p>The statement also mentions Sora 2's opt out policy, that being that copyrighted works will be used by Sora 2 unless copyright owners specifically opt out themselves. Coda emphasises that this goes against Japanese copyright infringement laws in which permission is required beforehand. Coda also noted that: "there is no system allowing one to avoid liability for infringement through subsequent objections."</p>

            <p>It's been a long-running mystery why Rockstar's PlayStation-exclusive spy game Agent never materialised. It was announced with much fanfare in 2007, then proceeded to never show up again. But Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has finally provided an adequate answer. Simply put, he and Rockstar couldn't find a way to make an open-world spy game work.</p>
<p>"We worked a lot on multiple iterations of an open-world spy game and it never came together," <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=Sd4dXzJqaE1DVzWD">Houser told Lex Fridman in a rare and revealing podcast</a> interview. Houser said there were roughly five different iterations of Agent, including one set in the 1970s Cold War era and another set in the modern day.</p>
<p>But wherever and whenever Rockstar tried setting Agent, it couldn't make the idea of an open-world spy game work. "I don't think it works," Houser said. "I concluded - and I keep thinking about it; sometimes I lie in bed thinking about it - that what makes them really good as film stories makes them not work as video games.</p>

"You've got to go here to save the world, you've got to go there and stop that person being killed <em>and then </em>save the world... And an open-world game does have moments like that when the story comes together, but for large portions it's a lot looser and you're just hanging out and doing what you want."</p><p>What makes the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption games work so well as open worlds is their in-between time - the time you have to cruise around, either on a horseback or in a car, listening to the radio or watching the world go by. In those games, you do your own thing. "That's why it works well being a criminal: because you fundamentally don't have anyone telling you what to do," Houser said.</p>
<p>The minute you put that into a spy game, however, you slacken the line of tension you need running through the spy framework to give missions jeopardy. "As a spy that doesn't really work because you have to be against the clock," Houser said. It's a fundamental issue - one Rockstar couldn't overcome. "For me, I question whether you can make a good open-world spy game," he said.</p>
<p>It's a question I'm sure Hitman developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has had to reckon with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">while plotting blockbuster James Bond game 007: First Light</a>, though IOI's expertise is not in open worlds but sandbox mission approaches. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-rockstar-north-dev-talks-agent-abandoned-zombie-game-in-fascinating-new-blog">Agent apparently began life as a demo for the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine</a>, a Rockstar developer revealed a couple of years ago, and it showcased a hang glider and a car that turned into a submarine. A fuller, more linear game was then apparently green-lit, which would take us to classic spy movie locations such as the French Riviera, a Swiss ski resort, and Cairo. And the story would culminate with a big shootout with lasers in space. That idea was apparently in development for a year and a downhill skiing section was developed, but the game didn't get much further. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-has-abandoned-its-agent-trademark">Rockstar eventually abandoned its trademark for Agent in 2018</a>.</p>

			<p>Four years after the last Hyrule Warriors release, Omega Force, the studio behind Age of Calamity within Koei Tecmo, is set to release Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 later this week on November 6, 2025.</p>



<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment sets players in the Imprisoning War, the events of which would lead to the story that unfolds in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Princess Zelda fights alongside King Rauru and the legendary Sages, each with unique fighting styles that players can utilize in this musou-style game.</p>



<p>The latest trailer showcases a bit more gameplay ahead of launch, like the kinds of combination attacks you can perform with other characters to decimate waves of enemies. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment – Unite Against the Demon King – Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WYpLBmy7xMw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity came out in 2020 on the Nintendo Switch, Wccftech's reviewer noted that one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-not-exactly-next-gen/">key drawbacks to the game was its poor framerate and performance</a>, writing, "<em>I genuinely had a minute where I was positive that the game's framerate had dropped into the single digits for a lengthy period of time. Playing co-op with two characters which both have heavy effects on their attacks is a recipe for a low framerate, and a low number of enemies being drawn on screen. It's a shame as co-op is still the best way to play any Warriors game, but the framerate sacrifice and loss of screen real-estate can make it feel more like a hassle than a fun way to play with friends.</em>"</p>



<p>Even though the game was able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-3-million-copies/">sell over 3 million copies before the end of the year</a>, setting a new record for the Warriors series, its performance issues continued to be a refrain that harmed players' perception of the game.</p>



<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, has the chance to shirk the bad performance narrative if it's able to launch mostly issue-free thanks to the power of the Switch 2 hardware. Of course, it's naive to think any major game will launch completely without bugs, but hopefully we won't see the kinds of major performance issues that held back Age of Calamity.</p>

<p>In addition to its theatrical showing, the outlet adds that it should appear online beforehand.</p>



<p>“The trailer will drop online before November 21st, and then make its theatrical debut with Wicked For Good,” they said. “That releases a week before Zootopia 2. It could still play before Zootopia 2, but that won’t be its official cinema debut.”</p>

                <p>It remains to be seen what price Rockstar Games will charge for the eagerly awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but some are speculating that it could be $80, $90, or even $100. Nothing is confirmed right now, but GTA 5 actor Jay Klaitz--who played Lester--has now said he believes GTA 6 warrants a $100 price tag due to the content it's expected to offer.</p><p>"These games take so long to make. Years and years and years. It's not like they’ve just been hanging out, chilling and then just started doing the work last year. They finished GTA V and then started on GTA VI more or less immediately thereafter," <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/jay-klaitz-exclusive-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he told The Escapist</a>. "This sh** takes forever and as we saw with GTA V the game will come out and there will be other versions, there will be downloadable content, it will be online. You're almost buying multiple games when you buy the one."</p>

<p>Klaitz said there is also a case to be made for making GTA 6 priced at a level where it can be "more accessible," but if it is $100, that would make sense to him.</p><p>"I would also like to see it made more accessible to more fans so I get that side of the argument too to make it affordable for folks. That's cool too. Maybe there's like a way to split the difference, but I share the sentiment that this game warrants that price tag. Yeah, I get that," he said.</p><p>Sales data for video games shows that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">people are ready and willing to pay $80 or more for new games</a>, but it's still anyone's guess as to the price for GTA 6. Other experts believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-one-wants-a-100-gta-6-analysts-say/1100-6535494/" data-ref-id="1100-6535494">$70 is the right price. </a>At least one developer maintains that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/at-least-one-dev-hopes-gta-6-is-100/1100-6535457/" data-ref-id="1100-6535457">GTA 6 "deserves" to be $100</a> due to the size and scope of the project. Some have said the game does not need to be $100 because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">the game's expected online mode could be the real money-maker</a>.</p><p>The discussion around a possible $100 price for GTA 6 stems back to researcher Matthew Ball, who said in a memo in January 2025 that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">"there is hope"</a> from people in gaming that GTA 6 could be priced between $80 and $100. He pointed out that, adjusted for inflation, GTA 4 was priced at $90 and GTA 5 was $83. Things like movie tickets, rent, subscription services like Spotify and Netflix, gas, groceries, and numerous other items have gone up in price while video games have remained at "record lows," Ball said. His own personal prediction is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">GTA 6 will be priced at $70.</a></p><p>Also in the interview, Klaitz said he would like to see a future GTA game take place outside America and possibly go somewhere like Dubai. "You could be in like a big city with huge skyscrapers but then you’re out in the desert one minute later. GTA: Dubai would give you a lot of fun environments and scenarios to play with and build a game on," he said, adding that other options could be the North Pole or Greenland.</p><p>Klaitz also talked about the possibility of a GTA TV series, saying it would be "really cool to try to pull off," adding that he would personally like to see it be a live-action show as opposed to animation.</p><p>"It would be tough to translate because it's that sandbox-type game and people can do whatever they want, wherever they want, whenever they want. It's hard to sort of refocus that into a straight narrative.
