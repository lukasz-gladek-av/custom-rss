			<p>An ambitious The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind RTX Remix path tracing mod is in the works, and its first version is now available for download.</p>



<p>The Morro RTX mod, whose 0.1 version is now available for download from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/morro-rtx">Mod DB</a>, aims to update the entire game with new light sources, PBR materials based on the original textures, enhance model geometry, and more. The first version of the mod updates the light sources in the Imperial Prison Ship, Seyda Neen, Balmora and Vivec areas, features over 300 individual model updates and some placement adjustments. While it's clear from the video outlining the project below that there's still a lot of work to be done, it shows great promise and hopefully will provide fans of the series with a new way to enjoy the classic game.</p>

<p>While there's no indication The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind will ever be remastered or remade entirely, there's still the chance Bethesda could decide to bring back the classic game at some point.  The <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-registered-9-million-players/">amazing success</a> of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered clearly showed that fans are more than willing to re-experience the classic entries in the series with some choice improvements, so hopefully, the third entry in the series will receive the same treatment its successor got at some point, although Morrowind may need a gameplay update more than Oblivion did. You can learn more about how Virtuos updated the fourth entry in the series while leaving gameplay almost intact in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review</a>.</p>

            <p>The showrunner behind Amazon's live-action God of War TV series has shared some new details about what we can expect from Kratos and co on the show's release.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://collider.com/god-of-war-series-adaptation-prime-video-update-ron-moore/">Collider</a> at San Diego Comic-Con, series showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore confirmed Amazon's God of War adaptation will remain largely faithful to Sony Santa Monica's 2018 game, though it won't be a frame-by-frame remake.</p>
<p>"This world and this universe are really rich, and it's interesting, and it's really been fun to adapt," Moore explained. "It's an adaptation, so it's an adaptation-slash-interpretation as you go into live-action, and it's been really fun to sort of go, 'Wow, there's a lot here we can play with. Okay, we want to keep the story. We want to keep the characters and the spirit of it'. There's all this stuff that you can keep turning to for inspiration. </p>
<p>"It's really been interesting."</p>

<p>The showrunner also added that game director Cory Barlog is actively involved with the project, with Moore calling Barlog - who also helmed 2022's God of War sequel Ragnarök - a "genius".</p>
<p>"I've had several meetings with Cory, and you ask Cory, 'Well, tell me about the backstory of this or how this works', and he just can talk because he holds it all in his head," Moore said. "And I usually pride myself about, as a showrunner, I can hold the season in my head. I know what the 10 episodes are, and I can tell you about them. Cory can tell you the whole thing in every possible way - all the mythology, how it connects one to the other, what the puzzles were, why they did this, and what that artifact did. It's really impressive.</p>
<p>"I mean, it is like a gigantic novel, even bigger than the Outlander novels, which is a lot to digest."</p>
<p>
In a separate interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjRM2TFvekQ">IGN</a>, Moore hinted that some of Kratos' previous escapades prior to Santa Monica's God of War reboot may also make an appearance. "You'll have to wait and see," Moore teased. </p>
<p>At the present time, those 10 episodes of Moore's God of War adaptation are still in the "scripts" phase. Filming may begin in 2026 at the earliest, Moore said.</p>

<p>Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of last year</a> following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>. Despite the shakeup, PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, Sony's Hermen Hulst, Vertigo's Roy Lee and of course Barlog remain involved with the project. Santa Monica's Jeff Ketcham is also a co-executive producer on Amazon's God of War adaptation.</p>

We mean that in a figurative sense, of course — it's the game that has dominated most of our time of late — but some arty fans have taken it much more literally.</p>
<p>Take Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/freakintoddles/">freakintoddles</a>, for example, who recently took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/">r/NintendoSwitch</a> forum to share their latest creation: a Switch 2 dock cover modelled on DK's iconic barrels. It looks bananas in the best possible way and, what's more, its creator has even shared how you can make one yourself... if you have a 3D printer to hand.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4rnumkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The cover is designed to clip around your Switch 2 dock, with the barrel design only encasing the front of the stand to let those fancy cooling fans do their job on the back. You can get a closer look at the print in the following snaps from its <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1632494-switch-2-donkey-kong-dock-cover#profileId-1724371">Maker World</a> listing:</p>

<p>In the absence of any Switch 2 special edition models, we'd be lying if we said that the funky DK design didn't look a little bit nice — and is there really any better way to show your Bananza love than a dock cover that <em>might</em> send your Switch 2 blasting through brambles at any moment?</p>
<p>We called DK's latest "an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK, and arguably the Switch 2's first absolute must-play" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">our review</a>, which you can check out in full below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the fantastic <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em> back for season three, the potential for the franchise feels so strong. As opposed to back in January when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-trek-section-31-cameo-big-name-jamie-lee-curtis-1851747475&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-trek-section-31-cameo-big-name-jamie-lee-curtis-1851747475"><em>Section 31</em> came out</a></span>, and the potential for the franchise felt desperately weak. That’s <em>Star Trek</em>: as good as its last outing. So where will the forthcoming <em>Starfleet Academy</em> series leave us? Hints arrive with the first teaser trailer for the show. But can something this po-faced and “uplifting” offer anything compelling?</p><p>You know what? I’m left with no idea at all. What a strange trailer, telling us absolutely nothing substantive whatsoever. Lots of things to say, “Ooh look, he’s back!” but if someone asked you what it’s <em>about</em>, you’d be pretty stumped.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Set in the 32nd century, a thousand years after the original <em>Star Trek</em>, this is very much a spin-off from the dismal final seasons of <em>Discovery. </em>In that show, once a lovely story about a ship equipped with a unique means of instantly transporting itself anywhere in the galaxy, things got so out of control that it ended up sending itself 900 years into the future and then not knowing what to do when it got there. However, on arrival it <em>did</em> discover that Starfleet still existed, albeit in a much reduced and fragile form, with its Academy still up and running. Thus, <em>Starfleet Academy</em> as a series.</p><figure id="" data-id="d0bf29339b62f5f5c13f98ac4d891d12" data-recommend-id="image://d0bf29339b62f5f5c13f98ac4d891d12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Holly Hunter as the captain of the academy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Holly Hunter as the captain of the academy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d0bf29339b62f5f5c13f98ac4d891d12" data-recommend-id="image://d0bf29339b62f5f5c13f98ac4d891d12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Holly Hunter as the captain of the academy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, in the trailer, we see a few familiar faces. There’s the fantastic Tig Notaro reprising engineer Jett Reno—one of the few characters you were always pleased to see in <em>Discovery</em>. Oded Fehr will also guest as Admiral Charles Vance, a character with the personality of a plank of wood in the previous show. And there’s Robert Picardo as the Doctor, the holographic medic from <em>Star Trek: Voyager</em>, now over 900 years old and still teaching nearly a millennium later after he began the role in kids’ cartoon&nbsp;<em>Star Trek: Prodigy</em>.</p><p>Then there are some even more well-known faces from outside of <em>Trek</em>. Holly Hunter is in charge, playing Captain Nahla Ake, who is half-Lanthanite (a long-lived race of aliens who were apparently living on Earth long before first contact with the Vulcans), <em>Bob Hearts Abishola</em> creator Gina Yashere as an as-yet unnamed first officer who is apparently a Klingon/Jem’Hadar hybrid (?), and right at the end, Hollywood A lister Paul Giamatti looking like the series’ cartoon villain. And joining the hybrid gang, he’s Klingon crossed with Tellarite.</p><figure id="" data-id="9d5037c3aa518457ef44e6f7ca285ebf" data-recommend-id="image://9d5037c3aa518457ef44e6f7ca285ebf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1643" data-height="924" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Paul Giamatti as a baddie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Paul Giamatti as a baddie." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d5037c3aa518457ef44e6f7ca285ebf" data-recommend-id="image://9d5037c3aa518457ef44e6f7ca285ebf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1643" data-height="924" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Paul Giamatti as a baddie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Notably absent, however, was Mary Wiseman, who played Sylvia Tilly in <em>Discovery</em>. Her character was endlessly away at the Academy during the final seasons of the show, making it incredibly odd that she’s not a main character here. She is, instead, lined up as a guest star, and didn’t even make the cut for the trailer.</p><p>And the rest look like a sickeningly pretty bunch of starry-eyed hopefuls, all smiling and dancing and I already hate all of them equally. Especially the mopey Klingon Jay-Den Kraag. Gosh, what fun we’ll have learning about how hard it is for him to control his Klingon aggression in Starfleet by having him endlessly fucking mope about it.</p><figure id="" data-id="7bbc7672c2e86471838b40f2fbd5e65b" data-recommend-id="image://7bbc7672c2e86471838b40f2fbd5e65b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1422" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Klingon moping on a windowsill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Klingon moping on a windowsill." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7bbc7672c2e86471838b40f2fbd5e65b" data-recommend-id="image://7bbc7672c2e86471838b40f2fbd5e65b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1422" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Klingon moping on a windowsill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Honestly, I don’t have high hopes, but I would sure be glad to be proven a big, stupid wrong-face. Alex Kurtzman’s so-called “expanded <em>Star Trek </em>universe” is so wildly variable, and there’s no pattern to it. Kurtzman is showrunner on <em>Academy</em>, and it was his taking over <em>Discovery</em> in its third season that began that show’s descent into dreadfulness. It’s tempting to therefore credit <em>Strange New Worlds</em>’ showrunner Akiva Goldsman with delivering better <em>Trek</em>, and his name <em>isn’t</em> attached to <em>Academy</em>. But then he was also a showrunner on <em>Picard</em>, a series so abysmal people should probably have gone to prison. So who knows! Holly Hunter is always compelling, so that bodes well. Paul Giamatti as a possible villain is also a fantastic thought! But there are so many factors that could be a problem.</p><p>First and foremost is the setting. <em>Discovery</em>’s 32nd century was a very silly place, with a bizarrely claustrophobic galaxy across which it tried to portray both impossibly futuristic god-like tech <em>and</em> ancient, cobwebby mysteries. Starfleet by this point has technology so advanced as to be inseparable from magic. They now have “programmable matter,” nano-molecules that can be altered into <em>anything</em>, to the idiotic degree that it’s used for things as mundane as having platforms and bridges extend out in front of people as they walk, while spaceships can reconfigure themselves on a molecular level  while in flight. So, er, anything is possible. Every single storyline is going to have to not only be about why transporter technology can’t be used because, um, it’s a bit windy, but also why they can’t just reprogram any old coffee cup to be whatever MacGuffin is needed.</p><p>“We need a recoupling manifold upgrade-integrator or the whole station will blow up?”</p><p>“Why did this have to happen on a No-Reprogrammable Matter Tuesday?”</p><p>But more than anything else, it’s Starfleet itself. It’s just so insufferable. It’s Life Lessons University, where everyone strives to be the lovely-best they can be, and that’s going to be tripled down on by its newfound underdog position in the galaxy. I’m finding it so hard, following that teaser of wide-eyed gleeful positivity, to imagine anything other than the modern equivalent of a <em>He-Man</em> cartoon, where everyone learns an important message by the end of the episode.</p><p>Please let me be wrong. Please let the completely superb lessons of <em>Strange New Worlds</em> have been learned. Those being: episodic stories are where <em>Star Trek</em> shines, not long, meandering arcs, and that it’s possible to have a lot of fun if you’ve got a ground cast with believable relationships. I want a <em>Starfleet Academy</em> that’s capable of sustaining its own equivalent to <em>SNW</em>’s musical episode, or a <em>Lower Decks</em> crossover, or whatever this puppet-based episode set for season four is going to be!</p><p>Or, and again the trailer doesn’t betray anything close to this, a new <em>Deep Space Nine</em> situation, with deep intrigue taking place in a fixed location, allowing huge, spiraling stories set in new sectors to take place. Anything other than watching a bunch of adorable cadets learn to not think for themselves, like <em>Star Trek</em>’s true Borg mind, Starfleet.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/starfleet-academy-trailer-comic-con-strange-new-worlds-1851787096]]></content:encoded>

                <p>EA's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-everything-we-know-about-the-skate-reboot/1100-6505591/" data-ref-id="1100-6505591">Skate</a> reboot was announced just over five years ago, but the long wait apparently hasn't diminished interest in the game. Over 1 million players have signed up for the latest Skate playtest, and that's a milestone for EA.</p><p>According to EA, the eye-popping represents the biggest playtest sign-up in the history of the company. Although sign-ups are currently closed, EA indicated that everyone who registered for the current playtest will get their invitation by the end of July.</p><p>The original Skate was released in 2007, but the series had been on ice since Skate 3 in 2010. In 2020, EA announced that a Skate reboot was in development. The new title isn't following the same single-player path as the original trilogy. Instead, Skate will be a free-to-play game with live-service elements. Developer Full Circle recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-new-skate-game-is-always-online-reconfirmed-for-2025-launch/1100-6531121/" data-ref-id="1100-6531121">Skate will require a constant internet connection</a> because it was developed as a multiplayer sandbox title.</p><p>Last year, I Think You Should Leave's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tim-robinson-basically-did-an-i-think-you-should-leave-sketch-to-reveal-skates-story/1100-6524066/" data-ref-id="1100-6524066">Tim Robinson appeared in a promo for Skate</a> that explained the game's backstory. Robinson played a desperate M-Corp executive who attempted to downplay his company's decision to abandon the city of San Vansterdam. In M-Corps' absence, players can turn the entire city into a giant skate park.</p><p>EA's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-skate-is-getting-a-big-update-ahead-of-next-playtest/1100-6532519/" data-ref-id="1100-6532519">most recent update for Skate</a> gave the game a visual upgrade ahead of the current playtest. Skate will be released later this year on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuchang-fallen-feathers-dev-outlines-performance-and-balance-improvements-coming-with-future-patches.1254840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is getting performance and game balance improvements in the future, the game's developer confirmed in a new message shared today.</p>



<p>Today, developer Lenzee Games provided an&nbsp;overview&nbsp;of the improvements that are coming to the Soulslike released last week, including improved framerates, optimized default settings for some graphics cards, better stability, enhanced texture quality, asset detail, and precision in low-resolution areas. The development studio is also taking a good look at the game's balance, and is aiming to correct the character's raising speed after getting knocked down, reduce damage and number of certain tramps, lower impact resustance of some low level enemies, reduce <em>"exploration pressure"</em> in some areas, improve AI logic for regular enemies and bosses. Unfortunately, no timeframe has been provided as for when these improvements will be implemented, but still, it's good to know the developer is looking to fix some of the game's critical issues.</p>



<p>It's a shame WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers launched with its performance issues on PC and consoles, as I have found the game to be entertaining enough, despite all of its issues. Hopefully, the improvements will give the game's combat system the chance to shine, as I have found it to be the best feature of the game, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">review.</a></p>



<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

We already know that the age-gating checks are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/713773/uk-online-safety-act-age-verification-bypass-vpn">easy to bypass with a VPN</a>, but what we didn’t know is that the face scanning tools used by platforms like Reddit and Discord can also be easily bypassed with <em>Death Stranding</em>’s photo mode.</p><p>Dany Sterkhov <a href="https://x.com/DanySterkhov/status/1948665431633404170">alerted</a> the world to the Death Stranding bypass on Friday morning, and gamers have been using the photo mode and Sam Bridges to trick face scanning tools into accepting them as an adult all weekend. All you have to do is point your phone at your monitor with <em>Death Stranding</em> open, activate the in-game photo mode, and then get Sam to look at the camera.</p><p>I used this technique on Discord and the face scanning verification (k-ID) asked me to open and close Sam’s mouth, so I obliged using the facial expressions in the photo mode. I did the same thing on Reddit, but this time the face scanning tool (Persona) asked me to move Sam’s face around, so I panned the camera around until it was accepted. Both were completed within seconds, and it was unbelievably easy to bypass these age checks.</p><p>Discord uses the <a href="https://www.k-id.com/">k-ID</a> face verification service, while Reddit uses the <a href="https://withpersona.com/">Persona</a> service. Both services were fooled by the virtual Sam Bridges. I tried to bypass Bluesky’s age verification, which uses the Yoti service, and it failed with the virtual Sam Bridges. Yoti says Instagram <a href="https://www.yoti.com/blog/helping-instagram-create-safer-online-experiences-teen-accounts/">will also use</a> its facial age estimation technology as an option “for people who need to prove they are over 18.”</p><p>This bypass not only lets adults verify as an adult on multiple services, but it also lets you avoid sharing your face or credit card details with yet another third-party company. It also means you don’t have to pay for a VPN service to continuously bypass these age checks, as long as the service you want to access offers a face scanning option that falls victim to the virtual Sam Bridges.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dusty extract-o-shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">The Forever Winter</a> got an update over the weekend that added another mech to the growing list of horrifying war machines that roam its post-apocalyptic world looking for fleshy idiots to squash and eat. "The StiltWalker is a multi-legged destruction machine: equipped with multiple missile and machinegun weapon systems," say the developers in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/547867519580373226">an update post on Steam</a>. Pfft. What's so scary about that? Just shoot some rockets at it.</p>
<p>"It is also equipped with a point defense system that can detonate explosive munitions that are fired at it from a distance."</p>
<p>Ah. Well. Nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Its peripheral missile systems are direct-fire," the update continues, "but its core missile systems are ATGM guided munitions that will sail into the sky before raining down on Europa’s foes with deadly homing accuracy." Big talk from someone with skinny little legs. You can see what it looks like in the trailer above. Developers Fun Dog do love recording doomy panning shots of their ashen wastelands peppered with tracer fire and the odd explosion. I suppose when it looks this atmospheric who can blame them?</p>
<p>The update also adds a new region to explore - a rubble-strewn city called "Lost Angels" with its own quests to complete. Although the devs say that this region, like much of the game, is a "work in progress". Alongside all this there are a bunch of performance improvements and other tweaks, like a change to the weight and speed of player characters, and some alterations to weapon reload rates. You can also now spam a button to get up more quickly after being knocked down. Stuff like that.</p>
<p>It's been interesting to track this third-person shooter as it's scavenged its way through the early access wastes. It was in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winter-struggles-into-early-access-with-poor-performance-and-a-deadly-thirst-for-your-time">shonky state</a> when it first broke cover, with hostile troops spawning right on top of players and enemy tanks flipping out and flying across the sky. The game's water resource system was divisive too. It was designed so that precious water drained away even while you weren't playing, which could once theoretically result in losing all your gear. </p>
<p>But it looks more and more like many of the early pains have been somewhat soothed. The water system was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winters-water-will-no-longer-drain-away-while-youre-offline">completely overhauled</a>, for one thing, and recent monthly updates have seen <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/547864982714319391">changes to the way stealth works</a> and a way to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/547862446583317590">hack radar mechs</a> to reveal a better picture of the enigmatic and eternal three-way war that rages around you. As for other buggy war machines, they continue to get fine-tuned in this month's patch: "Tanks now move much more reliably," it says. No more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U-ktTg7ACeI">trips to the moon</a>, lieutenant. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-spidery-new-mech-crawls-onto-the-eternal-battlefield-of-the-forever-winter]]></content:encoded>

<p>The top spot on the podium has, <em>of course</em>, returned to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, which shows no signs of slowing down after almost two months on store shelves. That has pushed DK into second and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> into third. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> has rolled back into the upper reaches of the charts, landing in fourth this week thanks to a boost from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Jamboree TV</a> Switch 2 expansion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It’s a scary time to launch a new multiplayer video game. The live service bubble has well and truly burst, with publishers collectively sinking hundreds of millions into promising online titles, only to pull the plug just months later. As we’ve seen with games like <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a>, and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>, quality isn’t the issue, yet there’s a real struggle to capture and hold the attention of transient multiplayer gamers. <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/wildgate">Wildgate</a> doesn’t have the same pull as a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> or <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, but it has enough fun ideas working in tandem to make for one of the most interesting live service hits of 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wildgate | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lDcX7Kf_gTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s a lot going on in Wildgate and the tutorial doesn’t do a particularly great job of explaining what the various moving parts are, or their strategic importance. At its most basic, Wildgate can be described as a sci-fi extraction shooter where five spaceship crews (of up to four players) attempt to locate precious artefacts, surviving long enough for a warpgate to appear so they can escape with their hard-earned booty.</p>
<p>Players must divide their attention between chasing loot, gathering resources, and manning their ship, which is essentially a mobile base of operations. Equipped with turrets, probes, shields, and upgrade slots, those opening minutes of a match are usually spent plumbing nearby ruins and stations for gear to outfit your ship.</p>
<p>These map landmarks each have objectives to complete before you can access their loot, typically requiring the solving of an environmental puzzle or gunning down AI patrols. They’re basically mini-dungeons with higher difficulty zones holding Wildgate’s rarest gear that can then be ferried back to your ship, whether that’s a Sniper Cannon turret upgrade or a module that passively replenishes ammunition.</p>


<p>The biggest threat is other player-controlled ships with almost all of the matches we played ending in head-to-head dogfights. Getting ambushed while your shields are down can result in a swift elimination though there are other ways of bringing down enemy crews. Boarding other ships is risky, but if you catch rival players unaware you can gun them down (forcing a respawn), plant bombs, set fires, and become an all-round nuisance. Clever pilots can also outrun and outmanoeuvre other ships, potentially drawing them into hazards such as firestorms and cosmic rifts.</p>
<p>As you can tell, there are a lot of plates that need to be kept spinning: this isn’t your straightforward Team Deathmatch or Capture the Flag. Learning the ropes will take at least a dozen or so rounds before you turn your attention to loadout optimisation and mastering the game’s different heroes with more options becoming available as you progress via a quasi battle pass system.</p>
<p>As you earn experience points in Wildgate, they’ll be funneled into whatever “Adventure” you currently have active, filling its progress bar and unlocking rewards such as new characters, ships, guns, and equipment. Making your way along this track can feel like a slog at first, though it’s clearly developer Dreamhaven’s intention not to give players all of Wildgate’s tools from the get go while steering them towards completing daily objectives.</p>

<p>Speaking of Dreamhaven – whose employees consist of ex-<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/blizzard">Blizzard</a> staff – there’s definitely some continuity when it comes to vibrant, comic-style visuals, some of Wildgate’s Prospectors passing for upcoming Overwatch heroes. There’s a slickness to the game’s UI too, giving crews a quick oversight of how their ship is holding up while presenting unobtrusive tooltips exactly where needed. While there isn’t a great deal of worldbuilding or storytelling happening front and centre, this actually works in the game’s favour, allowing players to grow a natural attachment to the setting and its characters through gameplay, those moments of emergent gameplay weaving its own narrative tapestry.</p>
<p>From our experience, that narrative rarely involves one of Wildgate’s main focuses: Artefacts. Matches will begin to repeat in terms of flow as crews clear a handful of PvE zones before hunting rival ships, preferring quick and decisive battles rather than slowly scouring the stars for a chance to loot an Artefact, then waiting for a Wildgate to finally open before escaping. Making Artefacts easier to find or opening extraction points earlier into a match may help, though it’s a delicate balancing act.</p>

			<p>The first thing to hit you about Once Upon a Puppet is that it is a visually striking game, taking the 2.5D stylings of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/09/little-nightmares-2-review/">Little Nightmares</a> and adding a gorgeous wooden aesthetic on top. What truly surprised me, though, was the emotionally touching story that it told. Issues of grief, regret, and reconciliation are played out through a metaphorical narrative of puppets and adventure.</p>
<p><iframe title="Once Upon A Puppet | Available now on Switch!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMh8OAz5TwQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The world of Once Upon a Puppet is strictly divided into two areas, the regular areas and the Understage to which those out of favour with the King are banished. As the game begins we discover that the current King is throwing everything that annoys him into the Understage, and while he initially appears to be a tyrant abusing his power, we come to discover the tragic reason for this as the story progresses. We immediately face this through Nieve, a Stagehand (literally just a sentient glove) who has disappointed the King with their latest design. Once thrown into the Understage, Nieve becomes magically entwined with the puppet Drev, and they have to set out on an adventure to uncover the mystery that has brought them together.</p>


<p>The dual character protagonist is an interesting approach and enables some effective mechanical complexities. You control Drev with the left stick, whilst Nieve is mapped to the right. Most of the time you can just navigate the world as Drev, but there are interactions and puzzles that involved both characters to be controlled. At first you have only very basic controls and must find magical spools to expand your abilities so that by the end you’ll be double jumping, gliding, wielding a bow, and more. All of these abilities are tested through complex environmental puzzles which form the main body of the gameplay.</p>


<p>The theatrical setting for the game is not just a backdrop. Drev is an actor puppet and can be dressed as different characters to access new areas – although Nieve needs to sew them up first. While some of these are purely cosmetic, others link into specific performance memories and affect dialogue with NPCs. The effect is more linear than this sounds, though, as there are no dialogue choices to uncover. Instead there is a well-written and crafted narrative that provides the emotional drive for the game.</p>
<p>Once Upon a Puppet features no real combat, but isn’t a game without peril or danger. Some intricate platforming challenges abound as well as avoiding the evil creatures and lethal pools of black goo (identified as stage-fright) that litter the corrupted Understage. The former must be avoided through stealth for the most part (although late in the game you obtain a power that is effective against them) whilst stage-fright is destroyed by light.</p>

<p>Some of the most memorable setpieces in the game involve rearranging stage sets to recover one of the King’s lost memories. These environmental puzzles generally involve all of the various skills and are particularly rewarding. Successfully completing one of these leads to Drev taking the spotlight and revealing a key aspect of the game’s deeper narrative. There is a mystery running through the game that is fundamental to the narrative that I won’t spoil here but I did guess it fairly early on. That being said, the eventual reveal was emotionally effective still and led to a satisfying conclusion.</p>
<p>I played through on a Switch 2 and it suited the handheld really well, but there was an annoying bug late on where dying to a particularly tight timing puzzle broke the camera and necessitated a restart. This solved the checkpointing but I reloaded the level more than once before realising that closing the game and reloading it was the solution. This was the only real moment of frustration though.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I very much enjoyed the majority of my time with Once Upon a Puppet, and while it was not entirely without issues, it's a nice fusion of search adventuring and the linearity of Little Nightmares. This one is well worth a look for platforming fans.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly three and a half years since we first <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-amazon-prime-tv-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard</a> about Amazon developing a God of War TV series. Back then, it was still just a rumor, albeit one reported by Deadline, one of the most reputable sources in that industry. Indeed, an official confirmation <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came later in 2022</a>. </p>



<p>However, last year we learned that the TV series had been rebooted from scratch. Amazon originally planned to employ Rafe Judkins (The Wheel of Time) as its showrunner and Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby as the producers, but they left the project and were replaced by Ronald D. Moore (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Battlestar Galactica, Outlander, For All Mankind), who will wear multiple hats: showrunner, writer, and producer.</p>



<p>At San Diego Comic-Con 2025, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ronald-d-moore-discusses-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-the-tone-of-the-show-is-trying-to-emulate-the-tone-of-the-game-sdcc-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN cornered Moore</a> to get the first few details on the new God of War TV project, starting with how Moore became interested in the first place. </p>



<p><em>I started looking at the cutscenes together, and there's so much material there, and I really responded to the characters. I responded to the story of Kratos and his son, and then they set out on this epic journey in this world that was finely detailed and really interesting, and there's a lot of combat and interesting monsters along the way. But I kept coming back to this story of father and son, and it was just emotional and it was different, and I hadn't seen anything like that before, and I had no expectations because like you said, I'm not a gamer. I knew the title, but I didn't really know what the story was, so I didn't really know what I was going to be looking at, and I was just taken with it. And so I said, yeah, I'd love to do it. I think it's really interesting.</em></p>



<p>When asked whether he played any of the God of War games, Moore replied that he tried, but he just doesn't have the muscle memory for it. Even so, Moore assured fans that the tone of the show will be very similar:</p>



<p><em>The tone of the show is trying to emulate the tone of the game, which is there's this epic journey, this heartfelt story of these two men setting out on this thing to honor the memory of his wife, Atreus’ mother. So it has this emotional heart, but there's this sense of history of who Kratos is, this mystery about his past, what he represents, the emotions that he's going through. So there's a weight to it, but not so much weight that there's not enjoyment along the way and there's spectacle and there's lots of things going on in this world.</em></p>



<p>Of course, it's still way too early to ask about any release for the God of War TV show. The casting will have to come next, with fans already banging the drums of their favorite actors. Who would you like to see as Kratos, Atreus, Laufey, Baldur, Freya, Thor, Mímir, and the others? Let us know below.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lost Soul Aside Shown in Brand New Gameplay]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-shown-new-gameplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-soul-aside-shown-in-brand-new-gameplay.1254798/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The action game Lost Soul Aside is finally just a month away from its release, and there's no better way to sustain the hype than by checking out a brand new gameplay video. Luckily, one was posted by Chinese YouTuber A9VG, who recently went hands-on with the game.</p>



<p>According to the YouTuber, the game's combat system is based on skills, which can be varied by holding light or heavy attacks rather than complex movesets. With simplified stamina management, accessibility is a clear goal, but there's also space for more skilled players to shine through precise counterattacks and even high-damage follow-ups of combos.</p>



<p>There won't be any difficulty options to select from in Lost Soul Aside. However, the game does offer 'powerful buffs' and even gear to players who die repeatedly, in an effort to help them out.</p>



<p>Exploration is said to be very linear, as you would expect in such a game. Some platforming elements are reportedly integrated in the levels, though. Character progression is available for both weapons and skills, which can be upgraded through a talent tree. There are four types of weapons: one-handed swords, greatswords, scythes, and a 'gun-sword', each providing a different playstyle.</p>



<p>Players can also reportedly craft various potions with different effects, including healing and combat buffs. Moreover, Lost Soul Aside includes an arena and boss challenges to help players improve and obtain enhancement materials.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Lost Soul Aside started development from a single man, Yang Bing, in 2014. For a long time, it was just him, until the project started getting noticed after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-amazing-ps4-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first few stunning trailers</a>. Yang Bing was then invited by Sony to join the so-called China Hero Project, getting the chance to expand the team and improve the game.</p>



<p>The game will be published by Sony Interactive Entertainment simultaneously on PlayStation 5 and PC (a first for a single player game) on August 29, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-gets-delayed-to-august-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following a small delay</a>. On PC, Lost Soul Aside, which is powered by Unreal Engine 4 (owing to its long development), <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-off-trio-of-upcoming-action-games-running-at-up-to-500-fps/">will support NVIDIA DLSS 4</a> Multi Frame Generation and ray tracing effects. You can find the full system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-pc-system-requirements-rtx-5070-ti-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

After all, the Amazon-owned discount shop's catalog of Nintendo games expanded significantly throughout 2024. Amazon itself, meanwhile, didn't have any Nintendo games for most of 2024. That remained true in 2025 until late June, a few weeks after the Switch 2 launch. But Amazon selling these Switch 2 games for full price (or $1 below) seemingly doesn't impact Woot's ability to offer deals like this--at least not at the moment.</p><p>In fact, the trio of Switch 2 game deals at Woot might indicate the offers will be even more noteworthy. All three Switch 2 games at Woot are North American editions with ESRB ratings. None of the store pages feature a disclaimer about region-free imports. This is interesting because Woot added that disclaimer to Switch game pages last year. Sometimes Woot sells imported editions from other regions. The games are always playable in English, and Nintendo Switch consoles can play games from any region. The Switch 2 is the same way--it isn't region-locked, so you can import a game from Japan and it'll work just fine.</p><p>At this time, Woot's game deals for the original Switch still contain the disclaimer, but many of the store pages were created before Amazon started selling US editions of Nintendo games, accessories, and hardware. It's possible original Switch games from Woot will always be US versions before long. For reference, when you buy a Switch game from Woot, it is shipped from an Amazon warehouse and often arrives in Amazon-branded packaging. Purchases can be made using your Amazon account.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-book-series-andrzej-sapkowski-box-set-deals-novel-reading-order/1100-6532972/">The Witcher 5-Novel Box Set On Sale For Just $33 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rds-game-traveler-deluxe-nintendo-switch-2-carrying-cases/1100-6532022/">Amazon Restocks The $40 Licensed Alternative To Switch 2 All-In-One Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Switch 2 At Amazon - Console Restocks, Every Accessory You Can Buy, And More</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-retrospective-box-set-gets-nice-discount/1100-6530148/">God Of War 20th Anniversary Retrospective Box Set Gets Nice Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-illustrated-book-is-only-30-at-amazon-right-now/1100-6533080/">Lord Of The Rings Tolkien Illustrated Book Is Only $30 At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-anime-blu-ray-best-amazon-deals/1100-6524954/">Berserk's Best Anime Adaptation Gets Limited-Time Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/adam-sandler-happy-gilmore-billy-madison-4k-blu-ray-editions-preorder-amazon/1100-6531820/">Happy Gilmore And Billy Madison 4K Blu-Ray Preorders Steeply Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdos-new-50-iphone-controller-is-officially-licensed-by-xbox/1100-6533127/">8BitDo's New $50 iPhone Controller Is Officially Licensed By Xbox</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Nintendo opted to release the game at a price point of $79.99, but you can pick it up for $71.99 at Woot. Mario Kart World features a brand-new open world design that interconnects each of the 30 tracks. A battle royale-like mode called Knockout Tour is hugely popular among players, as it offers a racing experience unlike anything we've seen in Mario Kart before.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch 2 Available at Walmart &amp; Target</h2></div><div catalogid="b6924989-d312-445b-871c-20c712a50785" id="225854"><div id="225854" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 Console + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has been quite challenging to find if you didn't secure one at launch, both Target and Walmart have the highly popular console in stock. This is the Mario Kart World bundle, too, which packs in a digital copy of Mario Kart World for $50.

If you haven't had the chance to check this one out yet, Amazon has copies available for only $34.99. This is by far the definitive way to experience this classic, and now is the perfect time to catch up before Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake this Fall.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kirby and the Forgotten Land for $44.99</h2></div><div catalogid="b6924989-d312-445b-871c-20c712a50785" id="225877"><div id="225877" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby and the Forgotten Land was a brilliant release on Nintendo Switch, and an expanded Nintendo Switch 2 release is set to be released next month.

            <p>Surprise! A new Friday the 13th-themed video game is on the way.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3890048/new-friday-the-13th-film-and-video-game-in-early-development/">BloodyDisgusting</a>, Horror Inc.'s Robbie Barsamian revealed that not only was a new movie on the cards, but a game - this one a prequel - was also in development.</p>
<p>When I say Barsamian gave us nothing else, I do mean exactly that: <em>nothing</em>. But it should be great news nonetheless for fans of Illfonic's game that died with a whimper after a licensing snarfu shut the 2017 game down at the end of last year.</p>

<p>"I can tell you that a new sequel movie and new sequel game are at the top of our list. It's where most of our energy's going right now. And I can tell you finally we're in a position to deliver on that," said Barsamian.</p>
<p>"While we're not officially announcing with our partners today, both are coming. They're both in the works and they’re both coming."</p>
<p>Illfonic's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/friday-the-13th-the-game">Friday the 13th: The Game</a> launched back in 2017, and, despite a rocky start, proved to be a solidly entertaining - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/friday-the-13th-has-sold-over-1-8m-copies">commercially successful</a> - horror experience. Unfortunately, its development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lawsuit-will-block-friday-13th-getting-any-new-content-ever-it-sounds-like">ended prematurely</a> in 2018 as a result of a lawsuit relating to the ownership of the Friday the 13th licence. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/friday-the-13th-the-game-dev-bestows-max-power-on-all-players-ahead-of-shutdown">It eventually shut down on 31st December 2024</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/friday-the-13th-the-game-studio-illfonic-lays-off-staff-as-it-realigns-to-a-refined-strategy">an unspecified number of layoffs as Illfonic "realign[ed] to a refined strategy"</a>.</p>
<p>Gun Interactive, which published the asymmetrical horror, later went on to publish the Texas Chain Saw Massacre game.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/another-friday-the-13th-game-is-on-the-way-and-this-ones-a-prequel]]></content:encoded>

<p>All cosmetic and taunt cases will grant summer 2025 Unusual effects instead of the normal ones until the event ends on 15th September.</p>

<p>Perhaps more surprisingly still, there's a modest number of bug fixes and general tweaks included in the patch, too. This includes some outdated in-game tips, balance changes - including a 30 percent boost to the damage done by mini-sentries - and a fix for dead players being flagged as AFK for "idling during long rounds". Hale, in particular, has had a number of bugs addressed.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that Temporyal has labelled some points of interest for context themselves, so the final map may look a bit different. However, the dataminer claims this mode is "currently labelled as Battlefield Royale in-game".</p>
<p>There's also 20+ smaller points of interest that include a military base, a water treatment plant, and a new housing development, as well as "hints of a metro system".</p> <div>
