			<p>Ninja Theory has announced that Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 will arrive on PlayStation 5 sometime this summer.</p>
<p>The news was announced with a<a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1925174749317185829"> video posted to the studio's official X account</a>, with studio head Dom Matthews delivering the good news. Matthews doesn't provide a specific release date, only saying that it will arrive sometime this summer, though he did reveal that there will be some new features added to the game with the PS5 release that will also be available on the Xbox and PC versions of the game the same day the PS5 version launches.</p>
<p>"<em>We're so happy to tell you, our fans, that Hellblade 2 will be coming to PlayStation 5 this summer,</em>" Matthews said. "<em>This version of the game will include some new features, which will also be coming to Xbox and PC at the same time as an update</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II Comes to PlayStation 5 This Summer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sh4QQyM1KP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ninja Theory might be an Xbox Game Studios developer now, but as Matthews points out in the video, the studio has a rich history with PlayStation. The first Hellblade game launched on PlayStation 4 before coming to Xbox a little less than a year later, and PlayStation veterans will remember that Ninja Theory was the team behind the PlayStation 3 launch title, Heavenly Sword.</p>
<p>"<em>We have such incredible fans of Ninja Theory on PlayStation, going all the way back to the days of Heavenly Sword, and we're so pleased that we can welcome PlayStation fans, back to Senua's story,</em>" Matthews continued. "<em>And so the team have been working hard to optimize Hellblade 2 for both PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro to give you the very best experience we can, and we look forward to sharing more details with you soon.</em>"</p>
<p>It'll launch on PlayStation under a slightly new title, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Enhanced, and is already available to wishlist on PS5 consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ninja Theory has announced that its narrative-led action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>will be making its way to the PlayStation 5 sometime this summer.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1925174749317185829" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X, Ninja Theory celebrates the one-year anniversary of the game's release by freeing it of its Xbox exclusivity (on console, at least). We don't have a release date for the game yet; the studio simply says it's coming in "summer".</p>

<p>Alongside the PS5 version, Ninja Theory also says that&nbsp;<em>Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>will be getting some extra features, and that these features will also be coming to the Xbox and PC versions of the game, presumably when the PS5 version launches.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-running.jpg?itok=523wL_XT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-running.jpg?itok=KTrLfUKS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5 this summer.</figcaption></figure><p>The PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>will also sport some PS5 Pro improvements, with Ninja Theory "working hard to optimize [the game] for both PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro" in order to provide the "very best experience".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</em>, it's the sequel to 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</em>, and it picks up the story of the titular character as she travels to Iceland in order to save her people from slavery.</p>

<p>Like the first game, <i>Hellblade II&nbsp;</i>is a linear journey that marries action-adventure gameplay and combat, exploration, and psychological horror elements. The titular character, Senua, suffers from psychosis, a condition that manifests itself in the form of voices that both guide and hinder her.</p>




<p>Ninja Theory's game is just one of several Xbox titles to come to PS5 in the last year or two. Others include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a>, Obsidian adventures&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow"><em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Pentiment</em></a>, and open-world racer&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5</em>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>remaster&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>&nbsp;</em>will bring the influential third-person shooter franchise to PlayStation for the first time when it launches later this year.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-II" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2461850/Senuas_Saga_Hellblade_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>.

But he has been shown the scripts and he's been kept in the loop about some fresh additions to the game's universe, including a new city.</p><p>"I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place… because there's another city that we visit," said Pondsmith. "And I'm not telling you anymore than that. But there's another city that we visit. Night City is still there."</p><p>"I remember looking at it and going, 'I understand the feel that you’re going for, and this really does work,'" added Pondsmith. "'It doesn't feel like Blade Runner, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong.'

            <p>A Skibidi Toilet adaptation from Michael Bay is officially in production.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skibidi-toilet-made-using-half-life-2-assets-reportedly-in-talks-for-michael-bay-movie">project was first floated last year</a>, when it was reported there had been talks to launch a Skibidi Toilet film and TV franchise, with The Rock and Armageddon director attached. It left me scratching my head a bit, to be honest.</p>
<figure>
<p>

<p>But fast forward to today, and those talks are now firmed up, with the news that yes, we are indeed going to be getting a Skibidi Toilet adaptation from Michael Bay.</p>
<p>Media Company Invisible Narratives - of which Bay serves as a chief creative advisor - will be producing, developing, and financing the project. You can see an image of its Skibidi Toilet project on the <a href="https://www.invisiblenarratives.com/">company's website</a> (or you can look at the screenshot I took below).</p>
<p>Bay along with partner Jeffrey Beecroft have reportedly been working on their Skibidi Toilet project since last summer, with a <a href="https://filmstories.co.uk/news/michael-bay-skibidi-toilet-film/">press release stating</a> it is "an early creative take on the franchise", which will bring "Bay's signature visual intensity to one of the internet's most unlikely breakout IPs".</p>

<p>Skibidi Toilet, for those still mercifully unaware, is an enormously-popular online animation series made using Valve's Source Filmmaker software and featuring assets from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> and Counter-Strike. It features a race of evil toilets with human heads, and has clocked up a whopping 65bn views on YouTube, another 15bn on Tiktok, and is ubiquitous on Roblox, where countless spin-off games lie.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in adaptation news, yesterday <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clash-of-clans-latest-video-game-to-get-the-netflix-animated-treatment">Netflix announced it was gearing up to release a Clash of Clans animated series</a>, which will feature a "determined but in-over-his-head Barbarian who must rally a band of misfits to defend their village and navigate the comically absurd politics of war".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/yakuza-0-directors-cut-red-light-raiding-in-switch-2s-exclusive-multiplayer-mode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the biggest success stories of the past decade has been the breakout popularity of the Yakuza franchise. The success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a> in the West spurred Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio to redouble their efforts on more timely localised releases, and eventually to also bring the series to PC and Xbox alongside PlayStation. Up until now Nintendo has been left out of the party, but with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut, they’re finally getting an invite.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yakuza 0 Director's Cut –&nbsp;Red Light Raid in the Switch 2's exclusive multiplayer mode" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPQeyZg2fhU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Yakuza 0 is, as you can infer, a prequel. Set 17 years before the events of the original game –&nbsp;remade in Yakuza Kiwami – we get to see the origins of up-and-coming yakuza Kazuma Kiryu and his fledgeling rivalry with cabaret club manager Goro Majima in the tail end of the 1980s.</p>


<p>We got to play a chunk of the early story mode, starting in Chapter 3 just as Majima is on the search for a new headliner for his club, running around town, getting into scraps with both local thugs and an old man that’s insistent on training him in multiple styles of combat. Oh, and checking out the local arcades, of course.</p>
<p>RGG has sprinkled some new incidents and character backstories into the game to justify this Director’s Cut label, though we don’t really know how extensive they’ll be.</p>


<p>Much more important is that the game looks and plays great on Nintendo Switch 2. This is an old game that honestly shouldn’t trouble the Switch 2 hardware, especially when docked, as we were capturing it, and it runs flawlessly from what we can see.</p>
<p>In fact, there’s the headroom here for RGG Studio to get a little bit silly, a bit whacky with their decade-old game, and chuck multiplayer into the mix.</p>
<p>The Red Light Raid mode is just about mad enough that it could actually be a brilliant little time sink. Teams of up to four players get to rampage through cramped close quarters combat against wave after wave of enemies. Each wave you face bounces you to another small arena in the streets, alleys and buildings of Kamarucho, and you’re fighting against the clock to defeat them all and make it to the next stage, building up to a boss fight.</p>

<p>It is rambunctious chaos, bordering on Musou levels of screen-filling action as you often find yourself battling against a dozen enemies or more within tight confines. Button mashing your way through is more than acceptable here, and you’re often pretty likely to at least hit someone most of the time. Some characters are more versatile than others, though. I unlocked and switched to the clown Red Lip Yamamoto and his slow, static sweeping scythe attacks make staying with the fast-pace of battle more of a challenge than sticking with Kiryu.</p>
<p>There’s some good twists here, such as how Kiryu and Majima have both been split out into their three separate fighting styles, meaning that they don’t have any advantages over the dozens of other unlockable characters. We’re in the meaningless money zone for unlocking those characters, with prices starting at ¥10 million, which you can easily earn from just a few successful wave clearances. You get the big bucks if you’re able to fully clear a mission, but the grind will probably start to set in as you upgrade characters to improve their stats.</p>

<p>Still, this could be a fun added diversion for people picking the game up on Nintendo Switch 2, and it’s great to see the Yakuza and Like a Dragon franchise start to make its way to Nintendo’s hybrid console. Yes, the games run great on Steam Deck and other PC handhelds, but those are still a very niche market when compared to the mass appeal of the Switch.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve played this game elsewhere already, there’s probably little incentive to pick this up again on Switch 2, but this is opening up a new audience for the franchise, and that’s always good to see.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-mobile-store-is-delayed-because-of-apple-says-microsoft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft is blaming Apple for the delay of its Xbox mobile store launch. The report comes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/671409/microsoft-xbox-mobile-store-delay-apple-epic-court-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from The Verge</a>, which found out that the Windows and Xbox company filed an amicus brief supporting Epic Games' fight against Apple.</p>
<p>While the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-claims-victory-as-apple-appointed-to-accept-no-tax-ruling-on-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent ruling</a> cracked the door wide open for the Epic Games Store and for the Xbox mobile store on iOS, Microsoft is wary of Apple's inevitable appeal and, as such, has filed a detailed argument in favor of the current ruling.&nbsp;Here's an excerpt from the filing:</p>
<p><em>The district court’s injunction allows Apple to maintain its in-app exclusivity but at least should have enabled Microsoft to offer consumers a workable solution by launching its own online store — accessible via link-out — for in-app items to be purchased off-app and used in games or other apps. And that is what Microsoft wants to do. But even this solution has been stymied by Apple. Prior to the district court’s most recent order, Microsoft had been unable to implement linked-out payments (or even inform customers that alternative purchase methods exist) because of Apple’s new anti-steering policies that restrict Microsoft’s communication to users and impose an even higher economic cost to Microsoft than before the injunction.</em></p>
<p><em>Similarly, Microsoft has long sought to enable Xbox app users on iOS to both buy and stream games in the app from the cloud or their other devices. Apple’s policies have restricted Microsoft’s ability to offer these functionalities together; the injunction allows Microsoft to explore this possibility. Microsoft’s own experience managing app stores confirms that Apple’s policies could be restored if Apple ultimately prevails on appeal.</em></p>
<p>The Xbox mobile store was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-to-launch-mobile-store-via-web-in-july-microsoft-sees-tremendous-growth-in-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to launch in July 2024</a>. When we last heard about the topic in late November, Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-mobile-store-is-ready-to-launch-on-android-says-microsoft-except-google-is-trying-to-block-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blamed Google</a> for trying to block it from launching on its Android ecosystem.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-finally-back-on-ios-app-store-after-protracted-epic-apple-spat.1194966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is finally available on the iOS App Store once again, following a protracted legal battle between itself and Apple over third-party payment systems and storefronts.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1924949632628523199" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Epic confirms that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>has been re-added to the App Store on both iPhones and iPads in the US, while in Europe, it's available as part of the mobile version of the Epic Games Store.</p>

<p>Just last week, Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block" rel="nofollow">complained that Apple was blocking the release</a> of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on the App Store, leading to a worldwide outage of the game on the platform until the issue was resolved (which, thankfully, now looks to be the case).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-ios-restored-shooting.jpg?itok=6sJ6H9Ei 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-ios-restored-shooting.jpg?itok=XPMkebt9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Apple has restored&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on the iOS App Store in the US and the mobile Epic Games Store in Europe.</figcaption></figure><p>Epic's battle against Apple began back in 2020, when the former hosted a sale on in-game currency that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">slashed up to 20% off prices</a> if customers used Epic's own proprietary payment system rather than Apple's.</p>

<p>Apple swiftly retaliated by removing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>from the App Store, prompting Epic to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines" rel="nofollow">file a lawsuit in response</a>. It wasn't just Apple whose wrath Epic incurred, either; the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store" rel="nofollow">also sued Google</a> after the game was removed from the Play Store for the same reason.</p>

<p>What followed was a protracted battle between the two companies, one that saw Apple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-rejects-epic-request-to-relist-fortnite-in-korea" rel="nofollow">blocking numerous attempts</a> on Epic's part to get&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-rejects-move-to-restore-fortnite-ios-on-app-store" rel="nofollow">relisted on the iOS App Store</a> in various territories.</p>

<p>In April this year, Apple was forced to pay a €500m fine by the European Commission due to its refusal to allow developers to direct customers towards alternative third-party payment systems, which Epic will no doubt have seen as a huge win.</p>




<p>As for what's going on within&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>itself, the game is currently in the middle of its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-star-wars-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars</em>-themed Galactic Battle season</a>, which has introduced character skins like Darth Jar Jar and Emperor Palpatine to the game.</p>

<p>Rather embarrassingly, however, Epic had to issue an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-swearing-darth-vader-ai-fixed" rel="nofollow">emergency hotfix last week</a> thanks to an AI-powered Darth Vader that was openly swearing at players. Needless to say, he won't do that anymore. I, for one, am disappointed.</p>

The Last of Us creative director Neil Druckmann says that he'd be keen to revisit the post-apocalyptic series, provided that certain conditions are met.</p><p>One of the primary requirements for Druckmann is that he'd want the threequel to have a story that's "worthy" of being set in The Last of Us series. The creator says that he aims for quality over quantity, an artistic vision that has extended to other projects he has worked on.</p><p>"While I am the caretaker of this franchise, whatever the title is that Sony has entrusted me with, it's important for me that everything is of high quality. I don't want to just make a lot of it. I want to just be very thoughtful about everything that we make," Druckmann said in an interview with Sacred Symbols.</p><p>"When we did the show, now we've teamed up with, I feel like, the best TV-makers, with HBO. We're making the best version of it. If we were ever to come back to it, I want to make sure that it's a story worthy of The Last Of Us. I love that world. I love these characters.

            <p>Microsoft has sided with Epic in its feud against Apple, claiming the iPhone maker has "stymied" the company's efforts to launch its Xbox mobile game store.</p>
<p>Back in May last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-open-web-based-mobile-game-store-this-summer">Microsoft announced plans to release a new Xbox mobile game store</a>. At this time, the company envisioned it to be ready for release by that summer. However, this did not happen.</p>
<p>Now, Microsoft has filed a legal brief in support of Epic Games as part of Apple's appeal against a recent ruling, which follows a five-year legal battle between Epic and Apple, and has now resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-finally-back-on-apple-devices-in-us-and-europe">Fortnite making its return to the App Store in the US</a>. Here, Microsoft shed more light on the delay to its own mobile store.</p>

<p>Microsoft stated it wishes to "offer consumers a workable solution by launching its own online store", but efforts have been "stymied" by Apple and its strict App Store rules.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/671409/microsoft-xbox-mobile-store-delay-apple-epic-court-case">The Verge</a>, this is how Microsoft explains its current situation:</p>
<p>"The district court's injunction allows Apple to maintain its in-app exclusivity but at least should have enabled Microsoft to offer consumers a workable solution by launching its own online store - accessible via link-out - for in-app items to be purchased off-app and used in games or other apps. And that is what Microsoft wants to do. But even this solution has been stymied by Apple.</p>
<p>"Prior to the district court's most recent order, Microsoft had been unable to implement linked-out payments (or even inform customers that alternative purchase methods exist) because of Apple's new anti-steering policies that restrict Microsoft's communication to users and impose an even higher economic cost to Microsoft than before the injunction."</p>
<p>As noted by the publication, the recent court ruling does make it possible for Microsoft to launch its mobile store, but the company still wants to ensure Apple's appeal against the ruling is unsuccessful, in order to avoid having to potentially remove its own store further down the line.</p>
<p>Microsoft notes in its filing that Apple "makes no argument that the technical or policy changes cannot be undone", and that the company's own "experience managing app stores confirms that Apple's policies could be restored if Apple ultimately prevails on appeal".</p>
<p>We will keep you abreast of any further developments regarding both Epic vs Apple, and Xbox's mobile store.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Avowed Game Director Carrie Patel has left Obsidian after over 11 years to join Netflix, specifically the Night School Studio responsible for the Oxenfree franchise. Patel herself provided the announcement <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7330425052565307393/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on her LinkedIn page</a>.</p>
<p>The news is rather unexpected, to be honest. Following the successful launch of Avowed, Patel <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-sales-make-obsidian-happy-so-far-game-director-would-love-to-do-more-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> her interest in doing more in the same world now that the team had found its groove, so to speak:</p>
<p><em>Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I'd love to see us do more with it.</em></p>
<p>There didn't seem to be any issues between Patel and Obsidian. It's possible she simply got a better job offer and decided to take it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Night School Studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-lays-off-employees-at-oxenfree-maker-night-school-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered an unknown number of layoffs just three months ago</a>. Following the 2023 debut of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-familiar-yet-distant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxenfree II: Lost Signals</a>, the Californian studio has just released the mobile life simulation game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.Venice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thronglets</a>, based on the Black Mirror IP. However, given Patel's long-standing expertise in the RPG genre (she also worked on the two Pillars of Eternity games and The Outer Worlds), it seems likely that Night School Studio could be heading toward that kind of game for their next project.</p>
<p>As for Avowed, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent action roleplaying game</a> has just received a <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-announces-its-2025-roadmap-for-avowed-update-1-4-patch-notes-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed roadmap of updates.</a> The Summer patch will add new NPC abilities and behaviors, new active and passive abilities, new Unique armor and weapons, cooking and crafting improvements, and custom map markers. The Fall update will introduce the highly requested Photo Mode and New Game Plus, a new weapon type, the ability for players to change their character's appearance while out in the world, new character presets in the creation tool, and more Godlike feature character presets.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>One of the many game studios smashed to pieces by Embracer Group has come back to life. Campfire Cabal, which was seemingly shut down in 2023 as part of their parent corporation's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-have-laid-off-8-of-their-global-workforce-since-their-restructuring-began">scorched earth "restructuring" policy</a>, have crawled out of the grave to announce they're still around and, in fact, "never stopped working". They've been making a new game in the Expeditions series of historical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>, and have been given "the green light to scale back up and transition into full production."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are finally ready to reveal that Campfire Cabal was never shut down," say the studio in <a href="https://campfirecabal.com/still-alive/">a post on their website</a>. What happened, they say, is that the THQ-owned studio were ordered to close by Embracer two years ago. But some agreement was reached to keep the company going with a reduced headcount, and they instead cut an unknown number of employees from payroll. </p>
<p>"Though we did have to say goodbye to many of our colleagues, the studio survived and a compact team continued the project we had started in 2022. At the end of March of 2025, we received the green light to scale back up and transition into full production."</p>
<p>That project is a new game in the Expeditions series of RPGs, which includes the classical centurion stomping of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/expeditions-rome">Expeditions: Rome</a>, the top-down shield-battering of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/expeditions-viking">Expeditions: Viking</a>, and gunpowdery land-grabbing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/expeditions-conquistador">Expeditions: Conquistador</a>. The studio aren't saying much more about the new game, though. Only that it'll be "set in a new period of our history and in a new part of the world for the series". Expeditions: Mongol, anyone? Expeditions: Pirate? Expeditions: Islamic Golden Age? I guess we'll find out.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Expeditions: Rome had some repetitive quirks but was a "seriously good - and lovingly detailed - romp through centurion times," said Nate in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/expeditions-rome-review">our review</a>. And Expeditions: Conquistador was called "very fine" by Adam, who wrote in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-expeditions-conquistador">his review</a> that some parts were a chore, but "the focus on stories and characters means that there is almost always at least one interesting plot on the boil". </p>
<p>You should know, however, that Campfire Cabal aren't the original studio who made the older Expeditions games. That would be Logic Artists, who were subsumed and digested by blockchain bullshit peddlars Dynasty Studios. But the Cabal have since become custodians of the series under rights-holders THQ. As with many creative studios, it's a bit of a Ship of Theseus situation, somewhat complicated by a round of layoffs and this subsequent reappearance. We'll have to wait and see how the next entry carries the torch.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't that interested in the RPGs, the "revival" of a seemingly shuttered studio is interesting in a wider sense. It could be seen as a hopeful sprout of green emerging from a blackened earth laid bare by years of seemingly endless <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a>. Or it could simply be the re-emergence of a scarred and injured body from a bloody-watered moat, a studio bravely limping on in spite of the brutal overlord that threw them in there, alongside a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio">bunch</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-reportedly-close-down-cult-rpg-maker-piranha-bytes-creators-of-gothic-risen-and-elex">other</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eidos-montreal-lay-off-75-workers-in-further-cuts-to-the-deus-ex-studio">bodies</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Despite the NDAs, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-footage-gives-off-bad-company-2-vibes-dev-says/1100-6531668/" data-ref-id="1100-6531668">Battlefield footage has still been leaked </a>though.</p><p>Battlefield Labs is the name given to the feedback and development process of the next Battlefield game.
