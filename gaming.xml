            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It feels like just yesterday that Revolution Software's classic point-and-click adventure, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/broken_sword_-_shadow_of_the_templars_reforged">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars</a>, was 'reforged' on Switch 1. It was, in fact, a year ago (almost to the day), but that hasn't stopped the studio's reforging efforts. The reforged has been reforged, you could say, as Shadow of the Templars has today arrived back on the eShop as a fancy new Switch 2 Edition.</p>
<p>The catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> popped up on the eShop this morning, where it is now available to pick up for <strong>€29.99/$29.99/£24.99</strong> as standard, or as a <strong>€4.99/$4.99/£4.99</strong> upgrade pack for all those with the Switch 1 version.</p>
<p>As you might expect from a point-and-click, the big addition this time around is Mouse Mode. Yes, the Joy-Con 2 can be flipped sideways and used to add an element of precision to your pointing and clicking. The resolution has also been boosted up to 4K in Docked Mode, and 1080p in Handheld, so you can soak up all the gorgeous 'reforged' art.</p>
<p>"Using the mouse feature is arguably the way that [the game] was always intended," Revolution's co-founder, Charles Cecil, told us recently when we sat down to talk all things Broken Sword on Switch 2, "a lot of the criticisms that were made quite rightly on release last year have since been addressed and obviously go into the Switch 2 as the native version".</p>
<p>It's all a case of bringing the team's vision of the original '90s release to life, as Charles told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>What we wanted to do is be absolutely true to the original intent, because we promised fans that this was going be the same game, but enhanced. So what we really focused on was what existed at the time.</p><p>

For the sprites, we went back to the original character sheets that were drawn back in 1996, interpreted them and then brought those across to the low-resolution sprites that had been upscaled and redrew them all.</p><p>

We looked back at Tin Tin characters, and went, 'yeah, that's the kind of thing that we want' because in an adventure game, you want very expressive characters, you want the gameplay to flow through how the characters behave and how they look, so that the puzzles become logical.</p><p>

As far as the backgrounds are concerned, we pretty quickly went back to the original line art, which I had scanned in a very high resolution, and our digital artists then painted over that. But everything was intended to be in 4K. That's what we painted it to be.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>And just in case this will be your first run-in with Shadow of the Templars, here's a brief rundown of what you can expect, courtesy of Revolution Software:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Step out onto the streets of Paris as American tourist George Stobbart finds himself embroiled in a mysterious journey of intrigue and jeopardy.<br>
- Enjoy a globe-spanning adventure, exploring exotic locations, solving ancient mysteries, and thwarting a dark conspiracy to reveal the secret truths of the Knights Templar.<br>
- Voyage through the game's iconic locations illustrated in beautiful 4K on Nintendo platforms for the first time.<br>
- Listen to enhanced audio as Revolution delivers the finest, most stunning version of George and Nico's original adventure to date.<br>
- Switch between the original 1996 version of the game and the new reforged visuals at the click of a button.<br>
- Play the game the way that you want to - choose between a ‘traditional mode' for people who enjoy adventures the way they used to be, and a ‘story mode' for those who want subtle hints to ensure they never get frustrated.<br>
- Switch between Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, touchscreen, and controller play styles whenever you choose..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll be sharing more of our discussion with Charles in the coming days, so keep an eye out for details on all things Broken Sword on Switch 2.</p>

            <p>
With as young a medium as games is (and it is young, as old as we all might feel), it's no surprise that it would burgeon new genres, and that said genres would be called into question. Metroidvanias! That's a potentially silly one, with a common argument being that it tells you nothing about the genre itself. I prefer Japan's search action as a name myself, though I am but one humble games journalist. A genre I hadn't called into question until today, however, is extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, a name that a former Bungie lead apparently disliked so much he tried to get the studio's marketing team to make something else up for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Bungie lead in question is the developer's former director of product management Chris Sides, who left the studio last year. Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqwje5N5ArA">Shooter Monthly</a> podcast (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/former-bungie-director-different-genre-name-for-marathon-extraction-shooter-dumb/">TheGamePost</a>) of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, Sides said that "The problem is, Helldivers 2 can be called an extraction shooter, but it’s not. The genre name is so bad. I hate the genre name of extraction shooter. When I was working on Marathon, I was working with marketing, dying to be like, 'Can we please create a different genre name,' because extraction shooter is so dumb. It’s the only genre where its name is a mechanic."
</p>
<p>
Sides called into question as to whether or not Helldivers 2 is an extraction shooter simply because you can extract, arguing that it's not because it's not like, as an example, Escape From Tarkov. "So, the terminology of the genre is already terrible; it really makes it hard to compare these games," Sides said.
</p>
<p>
I think that Sides is right to frame it in terms of a marketing perspective, because I think within the world of games genre is much more about selling a game than it is about denoting a particular expectation of it. A good film marketer does not sell one solely based on its combination of genres, yet games marketing does this frequently; I'm so glad you made a roguelike deckbuilder, but what is it actually about? Hit me with that first!
</p><p>
That's kind of the real issue, that marketing is incredibly genre-forward, and part of why I think Marathon has struggled to find an identity. Sure, I understand the basic principle of the thing I am doing in Marathon, I want to be given a stronger reason as to why I'm doing it, and to feel some of what Bungie can do so well, their social elements. If we're thinking about marketing, we first need to be thinking about what makes the game special! That's a better place to start than fixating on a genre that is still in the midst of figuring itself out, if you ask me.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good news: Sony just announced a new<a href="https://kotaku.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-the-kotaku-review-1847047303"><em> Ratchet &amp; Clank</em></a> game. Bad news: It’s some free-to-play mobile arena shooter thing.</p> <p>On November 12, PlayStation Studios and Insomniac announced <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Ranger Rumble</em>. The game is being created by OhBibi, <a href="https://www.ohbibi.com/games">a mobile game developer located in France</a> which&nbsp;has previously created cartoony, colorful action-focused third-person shooters. And what do you know, that’s exactly what<em> Ranger Rumble</em> appears to be in the game’s first trailer.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.rangerrumble.com/?utm_source=SoftLaunch&amp;utm_medium=PreReg&amp;utm_campaign=Socials&amp;utm_id=RangerRumble_SoftLaunch">According to the upcoming game’s website</a>,<em> Ranger Rumble</em> will feature “iconic characters from the <span><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> franchise” as well as big guns and explosions, which are hallmarks of the long-running series that started back on the PS2. PlayStation Studios describes <em>Ranger Rumble</em> as a “fast-paced multiplayer platformer arena shooter,” which, yeah, seems accurate.<br> </span></p>

 <p><span>“​</span>Experience the&nbsp;<span>humor, action</span>, and energy of the&nbsp;<span>iconic universe</span> in a bold new real-time multiplayer format,” says the game’s website. “Play as a Legendary Hero from the past, now with unique abilities. Go solo or team up with other Rangers online in <span>thrilling multiplayer games</span> built for every kind of player.”</p> <p>No release date was announced, but it is supposedly coming to mobile platforms “soon.” You can pre-register now.</p> <p>I think visually, <em>Ranger Rumble</em> looks great. It feels like a Saturday morning cartoon spin on the <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> universe, and I’m here for that. However, I’ve tried multiple times to enjoy multiplayer shooters on mobile phones using touch controls, and I hate it. And sure, many of them let you plug in a controller and play that way, but at that point, I’d rather just play a game on PC or console. Perhaps <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Ranger Rumble</em> will eventually make the leap to PS4/PS5 and PC, but for now, I’m not sure I’ll play it. At least Sony hasn’t forgotten about<em> Ratchet &amp; Clank.</em> So that’s nice!</p> <p>This also lines up with past comments from <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps5-playstation-jim-ryan-xbox-game-pass-activision-1850880301">former PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-mobile-games-apps">who in 2021 explained in investor relations documents</a> that Sony was looking to invest more in mobile games based on famous franchises. I can’t wait for the <em>Sly Cooper</em> match-three game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<h3 id="New_map_and_community_unlock_event">New map and community unlock event</h3><p>The game's first four maps have been joined by a fifth called Stella Montis. Referred to as "cold, pristine, and filled with the remnants of humanity's lost ambitions," Stella Montis will presumably be an unforgiving map filled with snow or icy conditions.</p><p>This new map requires the community to work together to open, however, meaning it won't be available immediately. This multi-phase community event--called Breaking New Ground--will begin at <strong>1:30 AM PT / 4:30 AM ET</strong> and ask players to figure out how to open the path to Stella Montis via the tunnels in Speranza.</p><p>As everyone works toward contributing resources to the tunnel efforts, they'll earn a new currency called Merits that will help push things to a second phase of the event called "Staking Our Claim," which will unleash players into Stella Montis with an all-new progression track, challenges, and rewards. This portion of the event will last until December.</p><h3 id="New_enemies">New enemies</h3><p>The North Line update also includes two new ARC foes for players to take down: Matriarch and Shredder.</p><p>The Matriarch is described as "a hulking ARC that makes the Queen look friendly by comparison," so you'll want to start getting your Wolfpacks and Hullcrackers ready. This giant enemy will only spawn during certain map conditions, similarly to the Queen's Harvester event.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Shredder is exclusively available to fight on Stella Montis, and it's expected to force players into close-quarters encounters. In a game where even a hit or two can spell disaster, the Shredder sounds terrifying by name alone.</p><h3 id="New_rifle__grenades__and_mines">New rifle, grenades, and mines</h3><p>Another weapon called the Aphelion joins the fray, too, adding another energy-based firearm for players to use when tackling the ARC. In addition to this fresh weapon are two new grenades--Seeker Grenade and Trailblazer Grenade--and three new mines--Pulse Mine, Deadline Mine, and Gas Mine.</p><h3 id="New_quests">New quests</h3><p>Lastly, players can continue helping Speranza with a new questline focused on Stella Montis and the resources (and dangers) that await there. We'll be updating our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a> with these as we dive in and begin taking on the ARC in Stella Montis.</p><h3 id="More_on_the_way_in_December">More on the way in December</h3><p>The North Line update is just the beginning of a long road ahead for raiders enjoying their time in Arc Raiders. Embark Studios has already teased what to expect in its next major update, saying, "The North Line is just the beginning of Arc Raiders’ post-launch roadmap. The next update, Cold Snap, arrives this December--introducing the Flickering Flames event, new snowfall Map Condition, the awaited Expedition Project Raider reset, and more."</p>

Nope, that's not very long, but there are a lot of details crammed in there.</p>
<p>To make sure you caught all of the little touches, we've assembled the following rundown of every neat detail, reference, and callback we spotted in the first 'Mario Movie 2' trailer. So, get your fine-tooth combs at the ready, and let's tackle this sucker frame by frame...</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>

<h2 id="the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer</h2>
<p>Before we dive in, here's the trailer in all its glory if you want to catch up on the whole thing:</p>

<p>All good? Let's crack out the 'caps...</p>
<h2 id="everything-you-missed-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer">Everything You Missed In The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer</h2>
<p>We'll work through the trailer chronologically, starting with sweet little Bowser in his sweet little castle...</p>
<h3 id="mario-x-the-scream">Mario X The Scream</h3>
<figure data-uuid="488024737cdac"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/488024737cdac/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>A funny little one to start. It seems that Bowser is a bit of a proto-expressionism fan, as his painting of a particularly bony Mario bears an uncanny resemblance to Edvard Munch's '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream">The Scream</a>'.</p>
<p>It also has a similar appearance to the 'shocked Mario' pose in the first movie's plumbing commercial, but we prefer to think that Bowser is a fan of the classics.</p>
<h3 id="koopa-clown-car">Koopa Clown Car</h3>

<p>We might not get a look at the movie rendition, but one of Bowser's background paintings reveals that Bowser Jr's iconic Koopa Clown Car <em>is</em> a thing in the Mario Movie universe. Just look at how happy the little guy is in his flying machine!</p>
<h3 id="launch-stars">Launch Stars</h3>

<p>In the trailer, we see Peach and Toad head off into space via a Launch Star — the mode of transport that anyone who has played either of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy</a> games will be very familiar with.</p>
<p>"Onward and upwards," right? Oops, wrong game!</p>
<h3 id="drip-drop-galaxy">Drip Drop Galaxy</h3>
<figure data-uuid="dbf7fe3e7e2d7"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dbf7fe3e7e2d7/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, we can't be 100% sure on this, but the Blooper-filled underwater world that we see Peach and Toad travel past looks mighty similar to the 'Drip Drop Galaxy' from Mario's first intergalactic Wii adventure. There appears to be an extra floating palm tree island on the water's surface, but the sandy core and spherical shape immediately brought the 'Giant Eel Outbreak' mission to mind.</p>
<p>There's also a doughnut-shaped planet in the background that vaguely resembles one of the platforms in 'Gusty Garden Galaxy', though we're less sure about that one.</p>
<h3 id="tostarena-sticker">Tostarena Sticker</h3>

<p>It's not just locales from the Galaxy games that will be cropping up in the movie, mind you. We also get a glimpse at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a>'s Tostarena, complete with its upside-down pyramids and sand dunes.</p>
<p>If you really pay attention in one shot, you'll even see that Luigi's bike is sporting a Tostarena sticker, similar to the one you can pick up from the planet's Crazy Cap store.</p>
<h3 id="ninjis-back">Ninji's Back</h3>
<figure data-uuid="28b9afa767f29"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/28b9afa767f29/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ninji has had a bit of a moment in recent years, after appearing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>, and it looks like the cameos will keep on coming in the Galaxy movie.</p>
<p>Here, we see a bunch of Ninjis getting their buttons kicked in by Princess Peach, which is... more violent-sounding than we intended it to be.</p>
<h3 id="a-giant-casino">A Giant Casino</h3>
<figure data-uuid="8cfcae47eee0b"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8cfcae47eee0b/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>That very Ninji fight takes place in what appears to be a giant casino cube, complete with dozens of slot machines lining the walls and a giant roulette wheel on the floor.</p>
<p>Whether it's a callback to the Luigi's Casino minigames in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/super_mario_64_ds">Super Mario 64 DS</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/new_super_mario_bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a>, or the Casino Delfino from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, it looks like a cool setpiece.</p>
<h3 id="wonder-bowser-jr">Wonder Bowser Jr.</h3>

<p>Bowser Jr. arrives on the scene and instantly adopts a similar appearance to his Wonder form from Mario Wonder. This appears to stem from a magical paintbrush à la Mario Sunshine (note how it's embossed with Bowser Jr's face this time, not E. Gadd's) rather than a Wonder Flower, but there's no denying that purple skin, green hair and neon face mask fit the bill.</p>
<h3 id="roaslinas-ice-world">Roaslina's Ice World</h3>

<p>We're not entirely sure where Rosalina is holed up at the end of the first trailer, but those buildings in the background look distinctly like the ones found in the 'Rosalina's Ice World' track from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/mario_kart_7">Mario Kart 7</a>, or, at a push, 'Starview Peak' from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>The ground doesn't look snowy enough to suggest Illumination has gone whole-hog on this inspiration, but at least the central tower with its magical floating rings appears to have made the cut.</p>
<h3 id="megaleg">Megaleg</h3>
<figure data-uuid="7edf6e52b29a9"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7edf6e52b29a9/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just in case the giant robot seen facing off against Rosalina didn't ring any bells, that's Megaleg, a robotic boss from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy">Mario Galaxy</a>.</p>
<p>In the game, the boss is under the command of Bowser Jr., and based on the soft <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far#mario-movie-2-cast">Safdie</a> tones emanating from it in the trailer, we'd say that same is true of the movie version.</p>
<h3 id="baby-luma">Baby Luma</h3>
<figure data-uuid="536d4a65d8d7a"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/536d4a65d8d7a/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're jumping ahead to the extra little slice of footage from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqjMaKQskW8">full movie Direct</a> here, but take a look at that tiny Baby Luma listening to Rosalina's story! It has a little dummy!</p>
<p>Gosh, those plushies are going to sell like crazy...</p>
<h3 id="paper-mario-storybook">Paper Mario Storybook</h3>
<figure data-uuid="e0e1ea3ba4e80"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0e1ea3ba4e80/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rosalinas-storybook-from-super-mario-galaxy-goes-on-sale-this-november">Rosalina's storybook</a> itself. Unlike the storybook from the Galaxy games, the visuals here have a certain papery charm. It's almost as if some animators at Illumination have played a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/paper_mario">Paper Mario</a> game or two, no?</p>
<p>Oh, <em>ohhhh</em>, what if the storybook sections of the film are animated like stop-motion papercraft! Perhaps a bit too ambitious, but we can dream.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="550">There’s no shortage of brands to choose from when looking to boost your PC’s storage, but Crucial has been a trusted name in the game for over 25 years. The company’s award-winning lineup focuses on packing in as much storage as possible while keeping things running fast and smooth. Backed by Micron—the world’s fifth-largest semiconductor company with over 54,000 patents and compatibility across 180,000+ systems—Crucial knows its stuff. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5536/">And right now, you can grab a great deal on the Crucial BX500 internal SSD over on Amazon and it’s not even Black Friday weekend or Cyber Monday yet.</a> Here’s the breakdown of the current discounts.</p>
<p data-start="552" data-end="986">The limited-time sale covers several storage sizes for the BX500 SSD. The 240GB and 480GB models are unfortunately staying put at $37 and $60 respectively. But honestly, if you’re upgrading, you might as well aim higher. The 1TB model is down 23%, taking the price from $94 to $72, and the 2TB model is seeing a 21% discount—now just $130 instead of $164. The big 4TB option doesn’t get quite as deep a cut, sitting 12% off which brings it from $301 to $265.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5536/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>


<p data-start="988" data-end="1397">This internal solid-state drive was built for IT professionals, content creators, and everyday users alike. Whether you’re a photographer organizing thousands of photos, a video editor storing massive raw files, or a writer backing up your work, Crucial’s got you covered. With read and write speeds of up to 540 MB/s, the BX500 will provide you with consistent, high-performance.</p>
<h2 data-start="1399" data-end="1435"><strong data-start="1399" data-end="1433">Big Performance Jump from HDDs</strong></h2>
<p data-start="988" data-end="1397">If you’re upgrading from a standard hard drive, you’ll notice a massive difference right away. Your laptop will boot faster, load files quicker, and feel more responsive overall. The BX500 delivers roughly 300% faster performance than a typical HDD and is up to 45 times more energy efficient, which can even extend your laptop’s battery life.</p>


<p data-start="988" data-end="1397">Installing isn’t as daunting as one might think. Even if you’ve never swapped out a drive before, just follow along with the included step-by-step SSD installation guide included. You’ll be able to transfer everything over from your old drive quickly and easily. It’s a great upgrade for both seasoned PC builders and first-time upgraders who want a big performance boost without the hassle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-physint-od-trailer-showcase-2000627889">Hideo Kojima</a> has apparently been embroiled in a slow-moving online controversy for the past week and is now trying to definitively extricate himself and his studio from the ongoing backlash. “In light of certain misunderstandings that have arisen in some media reports and on social networks, we would like to take this opportunity to accurately convey the facts,” his studio announced on social media on Wednesday.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852">The <em>Death Stranding 2</em> director</a> shared a photo online earlier this month in which he appeared at the <span dir="auto">Lucca Comics &amp; Games convention in Italy alongside author and cartoonist Michele “Zerocalcare” Rech. Kojima was holding a Japanese copy of <em>Kobane Calling</em>, a 2015 graphic novel which illustrates the struggles of a town along the Turkish-Syrian border under threat from ISIS. Rech also recently published another graphic novel called <i>No Sleep till Shengal</i> about the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=persecution+yazidis&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;oq=persecution+yazidis&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIICAEQABgWGB4yCwgCEAAYFhgeGMcDMg0IAxAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBBAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBRAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBhAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMg0IBxAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMgoICBAAGIAEGKIEMgoICRAAGIAEGKIE0gEIMjM0MWowajSoAgGwAgHxBfmT95DIDBFz&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">persecution of the Yazidis</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>But shortly after it was published on his social media channel, Kojima, famous for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/zf3k5d/my_favourite_internet_phenomenon_is_hideo_kojima/">posting photo ops</a> with the people he meets, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kurdistan/comments/1on6y3f/hideo_kojima_faces_backlash_from_turkish/">deleted the picture</a>.</p> <p>Kojima was seemingly spurred to erase evidence of the meeting due to an online backlash surrounding Rech’s political views. <em>Kobane Calling</em> reportedly expresses sympathy for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/what-is-syrian-kurdish-ypg-2023-10-05/">Syrian Kurdish YPG militia forces</a> which, yes, fought against ISIS, but YPG is also <a href="https://mei.edu/publications/child-soldiers-and-ypg">accused by some international groups</a> of recruiting child soldiers and is classified by Turkey and other nations as a terrorist organization (the U.S. does not consider it a terrorist group, although it’s affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) which the U.S. does classify as one). The plight of child soldiers was also <a href="https://metalgear.fandom.com/wiki/Child_soldier#:~:text=In%201999%2C%20the%20military%20fortress,to%20fight%20in%20future%20wars.">a frequent theme</a> throughout the <em>Metal Gear</em> series.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Disappointing backpedaling. Kobane Calling is is a firsthand account of the Kurdish resistance against ISIS during the Syrian war; Zero literally traveled to a war zone to document it. It's only controversial if you think ISIS were the good guys in that scenario. <a href="https://t.co/N6G7KFGw3p">https://t.co/N6G7KFGw3p</a> <a href="https://t.co/HwD73b8b2j">pic.twitter.com/HwD73b8b2j</a></p> <p>— bidonica ❗ (@bidonica1) <a href="https://twitter.com/bidonica1/status/1988592648895291493?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Rech noticed and released <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQoim9wjM6k/?hl=en">his own video</a> about the incident using comic illustrations. Calling Kojima the “<span dir="auto">Jesus Christ of video games,” the cartoonist said it was his publisher’s idea to share a copy of <em>Kobane Calling</em> with the famed game developer, who then voluntarily held it up for the photo op, according to <a href="https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2025/11/05/zerocalcare-scoppia-la-polemica-internazionale-per-la-foto-con-hideo-kojima-al-lucca-comics-il-fumettista-ora-lo-stanno-a-tartassa/8185677/">a report</a> by Italian outlet <em>Fatto Quotidiano</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>“I opened the internet and saw two hundred Turkish sites saying that Kojima had published a post in favor of terrorism,” Rech said in the video published over a week ago, according to a Google translation. “Of course, for the Turks, they’re all terrorists, and now they’re harassing poor Kojima.”</p>

 <p>A week later, Kojima Productions finally addressed the incident with a statement throwing Rech under the bus. “There is no personal or professional relationship between the two individuals,” it declared. “The photo was taken briefly at the Lucca Comics &amp; Games venue after a short introduction through an acquaintance.”</p>

 <p>The studio continued, “Neither Mr. Kojima nor KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS had any prior knowledge or understanding of Mr. Zerocalcare’s works or political positions, and there was no intention to express agreement with, or support for, any particular stance or opinion.”</p> <p>The statement exudes a surprising amount of Ubisoft “let’s not get political” energy from the team behind a recent set of very political PlayStation blockbusters.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Six Takeaways From The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Trailer]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-breakdown-rosalina-2000643501</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/six-takeaways-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer.1351378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>This morning, we got the first real trailer for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-rosalina-bowser-jr-direct-2000643447"><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</span></i></a><span>. We learned that Bowser’s still tiny, his son is coming to save him, and the fight will take Mario and his friends into space. While the movie’s title makes it sound like it’s going to be an adaptation of 2007’s excellent </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy</span></i><span>, the trailer includes several references to other </span><i><span>Mario </span></i><span>games beyond the cosmic Wii adventure. Let’s break down some of the big takeaways from the first trailer.</span></p>

  <h2><b>Bowser is an unrecognized artistic talent</b></h2> <p><span>The king of koopas has had a lot of time to kill while in his tiny confinement, and he’s used all that time to refine his artistic skills. Yes, turning the guy into a small version of himself and sticking him in what is essentially a pet playpen is cruel and unusual punishment; still, the guy seems to have a pretty cushy arrangement. Mario and Luigi have been kind enough to let him be true to himself in decorating his diminutive domicile, and he’s basically made a mini castle in which to spend his shrunken imprisonment. When you’re no longer trying to conquer other kingdoms, you really learn where your true talents lie, and Bowser could have had a lucrative business as an interior designer and painter. Mario tries to crush his spirits by calling his extremely detailed (and embellished) painting of him and Peach “trash,” however, resulting in a tirade from the little guy which reveals that, despite all his attempts at rehabilitation, he’s still an angry despot underneath all that unrecognized talent.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643512" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643512"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643512">© Illumination</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>The team might be splitting up?</b></h2> <p><span>The first time we see any hint of the “Galaxy” side of </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy</span></i><span> is when a (gorgeous) meteor shower falls over the Mushroom Kingdom. Peach and Toad are then shown taking a Launch Star up into space and reaching a water-based planet full of Bloopers. Mario and Luigi, however, are shown riding motorcycles in a desert area that looks like Tostarena from </span><i><span>Super Mario Odyssey,</span></i><span> which also looks like a </span><i><span>Mad Max </span></i><span>homage. We see the inverted pyramid that was a major landmark in </span><i><span>Odyssey</span></i><span>, which means there’s no mistaking that it is definitely the Sand Kingdom from the Switch game. So it seems like Mario and his friends might be splitting up for at least part of the movie.</span></p>

 <h2><b>There’s a surprising number of </b><b><i>Super Mario Sunshine </i></b><b>references</b></h2> <p><span>Well, maybe it’s not </span><i><span>that</span></i><span> surprising considering Bowser Jr. is the main villain this time, but </span><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </span></i><span>has some references to divisive GameCube platformer </span><i><span>Super Mario Sunshine</span></i><span>. We see Peach and Toad fighting a horde of Ninjis in what looks like a planet based on the Casino Delfino stage from </span><i><span>Sunshine</span></i><span>. Ninjis didn’t appear in </span><i><span>Sunshine </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Galaxy</span></i><span>, so it really just seems like the movie is pulling indiscriminately from all of </span><i><span>Mario</span></i><span>‘s</span> <span>history, rather than being a more direct adaptation of the Wii game.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643508" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643508"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643508">© Illumination</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Bowser Jr. is also pulling inspiration from multiple games</b></h2> <p><span>Benny Safdie’s Bowser Jr. is seemingly taking on the main villain role in this movie, and his design and abilities seem to be a mash-up of references from different games. His base design is the classic one we see him sport in most games, complete with the bandana he wears around his neck that has a drawing of vicious, razor-sharp teeth on the front. He also wields his magic paintbrush from </span><i><span>Sunshine </span></i><span>and other appearances, but instead of using it to transform into the Shadow Mario from his debut game, he changes into the corrupted form seen in </span><i><span>Super Mario Wonder, </span></i><span>complete with a new black and purple color scheme and glowing red eyes.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643448"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643448">© Illumination</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Rosalina is a boss</b></h2> <p><span>It wouldn’t be a </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy </span></i><span>movie without Rosalina. </span><i><span>Captain Marvel </span></i><span>star Brie Larson is voicing the cosmic princess for the film, and in the trailer, we see that her magical powers are a force to be reckoned with. She takes out Megaleg, one of the bosses from the Wii game, like it was nothing, and she serves the whole time. Everyone is kicking ass in this trailer, but Rosalina’s magic is on another level. Love her.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000642906" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642906"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642906">Illumination</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Yoshi is nowhere to be found</b></h2> <p><span>I guess Illumination and Nintendo don’t want to show their whole hand, but I don’t see even one reference to Yoshi in this trailer, despite the first movie teasing the dinosaur steed in its post-credits scene. There’s still plenty of time, though, as </span><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </span></i><span>is months away. The sequel is coming to theaters on April 3.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield Studios has announced in its latest community update that it will fix the game’s weapon bloom in Battlefield 6 and REDSEC next week.</p>



<p>The exact date for the chnages will come on November 18th, which will also bring another multiplayer map, Eastwood, to Battlefield 6 multiplayer.</p>







<p>The full patch notes for the upcoming changes can be found below:</p>



<p><strong><em>Coming with California Resistance (November 18)</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Weapon Dispersion (Bloom) Fixes: </strong>We’ve made a small tuning pass that reduces how quickly dispersion and recoil build up during sustained fire. Dispersion adjustments apply to all weapons, while most also receive recoil tuning. These changes make weapons feel smoother and more consistent, especially at longer ranges where we’ve seen players engage more often. We’ll continue to monitor these updates and refine them based on gameplay data and community feedback.</li>



<li><strong>Lighting Adjustments Visibility Upgrades:</strong> We’ve made further improvements to soldier visibility, particularly when transitioning between interiors and exteriors. These updates enhance exposure balance to make enemies easier to see in varying lighting conditions. We’ll continue refining visibility and related visual effects based on player feedback.</li>



<li><strong>Challenge Clarity Updates:</strong> We’ve refined challenge descriptions and tracking to make your progress easier to understand and follow.</li>



<li><strong>Fort Lyndon in Portal:</strong> More segments of Fort Lyndon will be available in Portal for creating community experiences.</li>



<li><strong>Aim Assist Adjustments:</strong> We’ve adjusted Aim Assist to make aiming feel smoother and more predictable, helping players build stronger muscle memory. Tuning is now similar to the Open Beta experience. As a result, Infantry Aim Assist and Infantry Aim Assist Slowdown have been reset to match the new values, so try the update before making changes. Note: Infantry Aim Assist Zoom Snap settings are only active in Single Player and Portal experiences, and not in Multiplayer.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>Targeting the Winter Offensive Update (December 9)</em></strong></p>



<p>In addition to the new limited-time event and new melee weapon, here’s a quick peak at a few of the other updates that are in progress for <em>Winter Offensive</em>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Vehicle Balance Pass:</strong> We’ve made an initial tuning pass to smooth out some of the biggest balance outliers between vehicles. Expect more consistent vehicle combat across the board.</li>



<li><strong>Breakthrough Mode Adjustments:</strong> Several maps in Breakthrough have been updated to improve balance and flow. For example, Sector 1 in Mirak Valley now has fewer available vehicles and adjusted capture zones to help attackers make better progress.</li>



<li><strong>Rush Mode Improvements</strong>: We’ve updated MCOM placements on Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak to create smoother attack routes and more engaging objectives.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Under Review</strong> We also wanted to highlight a few topics of conversation where we’re actively exploring and testing changes, but we don’t currently have confirmation on timeline for just yet.</p>







<ul>
<li><strong>Map Design and Size:</strong> We have seen your comments about map size and pacing. Battlefield is at its best when maps offer different ways to play and constant action around every corner. Striking that balance is always a priority, and we are committed to a variety of map types across future Seasons. With Eastwood arriving in the California Resistance Update, we will continue monitoring existing maps and modes for targeted adjustments (like what’s planned in <em>Winter Offensive</em>) while also learning from community creations in Portal.</li>



<li><strong>Review of Challenges:</strong> We are reviewing challenges to better support the sandbox gameplay that sits at the core of the Battlefield experience.</li>



<li><strong>UI and Menu Improvements:</strong> We are looking into adjustments that will roll out over time, with the goal of making navigation more intuitive, from settings menus to equipping earned skins to discovering Community Experiences more easily.</li>



<li><strong>Player Stats:</strong> We are exploring expanded player stat tracking, including per-season details and other improvements.</li>



<li><strong>Social Play Improvements:</strong> We are evaluating ways to make it easier to group up with friends and resolve issues that may prevent smooth session joining.</li>



<li><strong>Hit Registration (Netcode):</strong> We are investigating improvements to hit registration. This work is closely tied to potential updates around time-to-death (TTD) and time-to-kill (TTK) consistency, as well as bugs such as sometimes dying when behind cover.</li>



<li><strong>Vehicle Ecosystem</strong>: We are reviewing the overall vehicle experience to ensure balanced combat across all-out warfare modes and map types.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>REDSEC</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Audio Performance:</strong> We have identified performance and memory issues that can occasionally cause sounds, such as footsteps or vehicles, to not play consistently on larger Battle Royale maps. Optimization work is underway.</li>



<li><strong>Battle Royale Solo Mode:</strong> We are reviewing Solo mode pacing and difficulty. Playing without a squad can feel punishing, and we want Solo to remain a rewarding Battlefield experience.</li>



<li><strong>Casual Battle Royale Mode:</strong> We are investigating the potential for a more accessible Battle Royale mode that keeps the core intensity but allows for a relaxed playstyle.</li>



<li><strong>Armor Plating:</strong> We are reviewing the current action time and availability for armor plating. It provides meaningful tactical choices, and we want to approach any changes carefully to maintain that balance.</li>



<li><strong>Tank Availability:</strong> We are exploring possible adjustments to tank frequency and placement within Battle Royale matches.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Community Highlights</strong></p>



<p>Recently, we celebrated the spirit of connection in the</p>



<p><a href="https://discord.gg/battlefield" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Battlefield Discord</a></p>



<p>with a community giveaway, where hundreds of players shared their favorite memories from past titles and how they carry that passion into Battlefield 6.</p>



<p><em>“A Battlefield moment that will always stay with me. When I was younger, we just moved to a new state. My dad went out and bought Battlefield 1942 that September and surprised me with it to cheer me up. We took turns playing Battlefield 1942 all summer long. We eventually got Battlefield Vietnam, then Battlefield 2 and Battlefield 2: Special Forces, and the rest was history. It was so much fun teaching him how to fly helicopters and drive tanks in that game with our friends from our clan. RIP Pops, thank you for the memories!“ “A simple but fun memory for my entry, handing the controller to my grandfather, who has sadly been gone for over a decade, and having him fire the M1 on Battlefield 1943. He loved the controller vibration with each shot and, of course, the classic ping. He was a Korean War Navy man, so he didn’t serve in WW2, but said it was something he had always wished to fire in real life. He died about 4-5 months later. I think about this moment a lot and how much it meant to share a moment in my favorite franchise with my favorite person.”</em></p>



<p>The stories we received, from friends reconnecting to families playing together across generations, were a powerful reminder of what makes Battlefield special. Thank you for continuing to make it more than just a game.</p>



<p>And to all of you sharing your favorite in-game moments and Portal Experiences, we can assure you they are making rounds across the offices and are a nonstop highlight of our day.</p>

<p>We’ll see you on the Battlefield.</p>

            <p>Jagex has announced it's removing Treasure Hunter microtransactions from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape 3</a>, after over 120,000 players voted for their swift destruction in a community poll. These microtransactions will be removed early next year.</p>
<p>Treasure Hunter is a daily activity that allows players to earn prizes, including XP boosts, in-game gold and more. You're given a number of keys for free each day, but players have been able to buy additional keys for real money for a while. Basically, you open a chest for free loot every day.</p>
<p>Starting the 19th of January, Treasure Hunting as well as over 225 direct XP and skilling items will be removed from the game entirely. The reason why? Well, Jagex held a community poll on whether or not RuneScape 3 would remove Treasure Hunter. This passed overwhelmingly, reaching well over the 100,000 vote requirement for the change.</p>

<figcaption>Jagex even made a cineamtic trailer for the loss of a revenue stream, check it out.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCjHVGbFwr4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>This isn't the first major community vote Jagex has held for both RuneScape 3 and Old School RuneScape. Back in 2013 it held a vote asking its community <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/2007---old-school-runescape-you-vote">whether it wanted Old School RuneScape to exist, which received a wave of support</a>. There were also votes held for<a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/wilderness-and-free-trade-vote"> the Wilderness and Free Trade</a>, which heavily impacted how PvP worked in the game.</p><p>This big change comes at the start of what Jagex is dubbing a new era for the game, which they'll reveal more about starting the 19th January. This will include a full roadmap for the game moving forward through 2026, so will be well worth a watch if you're interested in one the biggest MMOs out there.</p>
<p>Microtransactions have always been a sore point for RuneScape during its life. Treasure Hunter is actually the second loot box system the game has had, the first being so poorly recieved it was removed entirely. In fact, there's a quest where you can kill its mascot. This vote is, in reality, good thing for the game as unpopular microtransactions have proven a big reason for players leaving.
</p>
<p>It's a frankly respectable amount of fanfare over the loss of a revenue stream that should hopefully earn Jagex a lot of love from its community of RuneScape 3 enjoyers. Still, for games like RuneScape, community is key to maintaining momentum. One has to wonder what the 2026 roadmap will look like, given all the excitement around it. We do know there's going to be a new area called Havenhythe added to the game, so that's a taste of what's to come!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-%E2%80%9Cassume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-%E2%80%9D-game-devs-respond-%E2%80%9Cno-%E2%80%9D.1351336/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Blanket statements are rarely a good idea for several reasons, chief among them being that they can often be disproven almost immediately. That's the situation Nexon's chief executive officer, Junghun Lee, finds himself in after an interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html">Game*Spark</a> (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">translated by Automaton</a>), where, while discussing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">controversy surrounding ARC Raiders</a> and Nexon's subsidiary Embark Studios using generative AI, he claimed, "<em>It's important to assume that every game company is now using AI</em>."</p>



<p>Whether it's "<em>important</em>" to make that assumption largely depends on where you're sitting. If you're the CEO of a big games company, then perhaps it is important if you're concerned about staying ahead of competitors. But for that to work, you'd also have to consider using AI and generative AI technology as an advantage over your competition. </p>



<p>Which Nexon and its subsidiary, Embark Studios, certainly do, not just because Embark has used it in both of its major titles, ARC Raiders and The Finals, but also when Embark was founded back in 2018, it was done so with <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-ea-dice-exec-starts-embark/">the promise of leaning on advanced AI technology to make games</a>.</p>



<p>The full quote from Lee, per Automaton, reads, "<em>First of all, I think it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI. But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it’s important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness</em>."</p>



<p>We also know that Nexon and Embark are not alone in considering it an advantage, as other major companies, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-ceo-says-generative-ai-is-the-very-core-of-business-not-a-buzzword/">Electronic Arts</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-microsoft-laid-off-developers-being-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-built/">Blizzard</a>, have not shied away from using generative AI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/">forcing it into their developers' work pipelines</a>.</p>



<p>Nexon, EA, and Activision Blizzard are some of the bigger companies in the video game industry, and we know they're all using generative AI. The rest of the industry, though? Well, a quick perusal through the responses to Automaton's report confirms what we already knew: it is absolutely not true that every game company is using AI and generative AI technology.</p>



<p>To highlight a few of the many, many responses, Strange Scaffold founder (the studio behind I Am Your Beast, Clikcholding, El Paso, Elswhere, etc.) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/writnelson.bsky.social/post/3m5fpcezxzc2w">Xalavier Nelson Jr. replied,</a> "<em>We don’t use generative AI at Strange Scaffold and I can confirm that a lot</em> <em>of other studios are not—whether indie or AAA</em>."</p>







<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aerialknight.com/post/3m5g4d4npvc2w">Indie developer Neil Jones</a> (maker of Ariel Knight's Never Yield) replied, "<em>We don't use Ai in our games. Ai isn't and hasn't ever been needed been needed to make a good game and CEOs like this don't know what the f*** they are talking about.</em>" <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcdoogleh.bsky.social/post/3m5gw6lddxc2c">Rogue Eclipse developer Huskrafts replied</a>, "<em>I'm happy to confirm Rogue Eclipse is AI FREE and in fact NOT USED as a part of our process AT ALL! We discourage the use and have ANTI AI USAGE clauses in our agreements!</em>"</p>



<p>Goodbye Volcano High developer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ko-op.com/post/3m5fjjxacpc25">KO_OP responded with a simple "<em>No</em>."</a> Necrosoft Games, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-series-inspired-tactical-rpg-demonschool-launches-next-month-on-pc-and-consoles/">behind the upcoming Demonschool</a>, said "<em>Hello, not only do we not use AI we would rather cut off our own arms than do so. Demonschool is 100% human made.</em>" </p>







<p>So, no, it's clear that not every game company is using AI and generative AI technology. From a player's perspective, it's arguably more important to assume the opposite of Lee's statement, that the majority of game developers are not using generative AI, because they see their own artistic ability and commitment to their craft as their real advantage over their competition.</p>



<p>We can assume that the major companies that have talked about using generative AI, like Nexon and EA, are using it.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> developers Rockstar Games have had legal claims filed against them by the UK's IWGB union, with the latter alleging that Rockstar have so far declined to meet with them for negotiations following the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-have-been-accused-of-union-busting-after-the-firing-of-more-than-30-staff-members">firing of over 30 workers</a>. The initial reason given by Rockstar for those firings was "gross misconduct", with the company subsequently claiming that the staff had shared confidential info in a public forum. The IWGB, meanwhile, have accused Rockstar of union busting.</p>
<p>Protests spearheaded by the union took place outside Rockstar North and Take-Two's UK offices last week, and you can read our reports from both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">here</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">here</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to today, and this filing of claims by the IWGB, as outlined in a <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-issues-legal-claims-against-rockstar-over-unfair-dismissal-of-staff/">blog post</a>. The claims accuse Rockstar of "unfairly dismissing staff for union activity and blacklisting its members".</p>
<p>"We are representing employees who were dismissed by Rockstar Games in circumstances that we believe amount to victimisation and collective dismissal linked to trade union activity," reads a statement from the IWGB 's legal team. "Despite our representation and attempts to meet with Rockstar to resolve the matter through negotiation, Rockstar have declined and persisted to terminate members of the union in a manner that is unacceptable and unlawful. Accordingly, we have now issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the Claimants."</p><p>"We are confident that what we’ve seen here is plain and simple union busting, and we will mount a full legal defence with our expert group of caseworkers, legal officers and barristers," added IWGB president Alex Marshall. "Employers like Rockstar would do well to understand that private spaces such as trade union Discord servers have protections, and that their company’s contractual clauses do not supersede UK law."</p>
<p>I've reached out to Rockstar for comment.</p>
<p>These firings and the events which have followed have come as GTA 6's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">second delay</a> has seen its release pushed back to November 19th, 2026.</p>

<p>Stellar Blade developers have revealed that they are considering expanding to other platforms, which could mean that ports for Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox are on the cards. </p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-devs-are-considering-a-switch-2-port-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report from earlier this year</a> claimed that Stellar Blade developers were already working on a Switch 2 port, with an official development kit already in their possession. Now, the devs have outright stated that additional platforms are being considered, which means there is a chance that Xbox and Switch 2 ports are indeed coming. </p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-devs-are-considering-additional-platform-expansions-to-enhance-brand-recognition-and-boost-sales">Stellar Blade Devs Are Considering Additional Platform Expansions to Enhance Brand Recognition and Boost Sales</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/this-big-ps5-exclusive-could-be-coming-to-xbox-soon-the-developer-is-considering-additional-platform-expansions-after-strong-steam-sales-on-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, the discussion about additional platform expansions for Stellar Blade arose during a Q&amp;A session in Shift Up’s latest <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings results</a>. The developers first revealed that the game was recognized “as one of the most successful platform expansions in global AAA IP history” and has had a “stable sales performance in Q3.” The PC version experienced strong sales momentum in the fourth month after its launch, and the PS5 version has also successfully attracted new players. The combined sales across both platforms have “met internal expectations”. </p>



<p>However, “to further enhance brand recognition and boost sales” for Stellar Blade, the developers will carry out various promotional activities and are “considering additional platform expansions” to help make the title more accessible to players. Moreover, they are looking forward to “engaging an even broader global audience” through upcoming seasonal and holiday promotions for both PC and PS5 versions. </p>



<p>Expanding to other platforms seems like a good choice for Stellar Blade, considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-increase-ps5-and-pc-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the boost Helldivers 2 was able to gain</a> with their Xbox port. However, the developers are yet to confirm outright that Xbox and Switch 2 ports for the title are on the way. </p>







<p>In other news, Shuhei Yoshida ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shuhei-yoshida-absolutely-wanted-stellar-blade-on-playstation-after-playing-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">absolutely wanted</a>‘ Stellar Blade on PlayStation after playing it. Also, the title received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-receives-3-new-epilogues-with-the-latest-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three new epilogues</a> in its September 2025 update.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Gathering intel.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield Studios is telling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> players to "keep your ear to the ground" when it comes to a battle royale solo queue option for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-redsec"><u>REDSEC</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke with the Battlefield team to learn more about REDSEC and its battle royale, Gauntlet, and Portal modes earlier this week. During our chat, we asked if solo battle royale fans will ever be able to drop into Fort Lyndon without grouping up with others. Design director Justin Wiebe stopped short of confirming whether additional queue options are on the way, but he does want fans to know the BF Studios team is listening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would say keep your ear to the ground on the future of solos,” Wiebe told us.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield REDSEC was met with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-launches-to-mostly-negative-steam-reviews-as-battlefield-6-players-push-for-battle-pass-changes-and-bigger-maps"><u>a review-bombing campaign</u></a> upon its launch late last month as disgruntled Battlefield 6 players gathered to ask for various changes, including a solo battle royale queue. It’s true the Battlefield battle royale offshoot launched without an option for single-player-minded fans, but Wiebe says adding solos into a squad-based shooter isn’t as easy as it seems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In my mind, that's not something you just turn on and just say, ‘OK, solos,’” he said. “There needs to be enough thought put into it because we built a squad-based experience. At its foundation, the game was designed for squads to play together, with each of them having tactical abilities and options, and training paths that unlock new perks. A lot of those perks are very oriented towards helping the squad, not helping the individual.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I would say keep your ear to the ground on the future of solos.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Wiebe continued: “If we were just to throw that out and say, ‘Well, now you can just play solos, and you're unlocking these abilities that don't even matter to you,’ that feels like a fail.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 and REDSEC are designed around four primary classes: Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon. Aside from a few tweaks between some modes, each can bring everything from quick revives to vehicle repairs to a gunfight. Even vehicles themselves are typically in better care with more than one player behind the wheel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the kinds of mechanics BF Studios is considering when holding off on solos for battle royale in REDSEC. Still, it sounds like the option is far from off the table. Should players be allowed to queue up without teammates in battle royale, Wiebe tells fans they would need to launch “with the right abilities and training paths.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If we were going to launch something like solos,” he added, “we want to do it in a way that makes sense for players, that actually takes the mechanics and makes them work for making solos play better.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched October 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S. REDSEC followed closely behind with its launch for the same platforms arriving October 28, just weeks later. Despite initial review-bombing efforts bringing the free-to-play branch down to “Mostly Negative” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3028330/Battlefield_REDSEC/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam ratings</u></a>, it has since bounced back slightly, now sitting at “Mixed” across the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave REDSEC a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-review"><u>7/10</u></a>. In our review, we said, “Battlefield REDSEC offers an uninspired battle royale mode that dilutes what makes Battlefield 6’s regular multiplayer so much fun, but its Gauntlet option instead concentrates that formula into one of the coolest game modes I’ve seen from a military shooter.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield Studios team says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-redsec"><u>REDSEC</u></a> has plenty of time to regain lost ground with fans after the free-to-play offshoot was hit with a review-bombing campaign by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> players at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN spoke with design director Justin Wiebe and creative director Thomas Andersson earlier this week to learn more about REDSEC, how it got started, and what its future holds. We also asked about the team’s response to the initiative that sought to bring down its user review score on storefronts like Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even as online fan feedback bounces between endless praise and targeted negativity, Wiebe says BF Studios is “extremely passionate and proud” of what it has done so far and is only looking forward to the future. The main thing fans should note, though, is the developers are “always listening.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I mean, as soon as the game launched, we had people kind of looking at all forms of player communication, and taking notes and saying, ‘OK, well, we had planned to do this in live service, but we're hearing that this is a problem for the community,’” he explained. “If it's a problem for the community, then let's talk about it. Let's see how we can prioritize that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wiebe adds that BF Studios has engaged in “mad note-taking” in the wake of REDSEC’s launch as it pivots to prioritize fixes for problems that can be quickly patched. One example he calls attention to involves challenges and challenge requirements in Battlefield 6, with many of the more problematic issues in this area <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-major-overhaul-of-challenges-and-assignments-with-significant-reductions-to-challenge-requirements-available-now"><u>already addressed in an update last week</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For me, I always say, live service, you have a big clock,” he explains, “and every time there's a player issue, you start the clock and you measure and value your time to the player, so that you can make sure that the player and the community knows that we're listening, and we're going to be able to do what we can to react.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If it's a problem for the community, then let's talk about it. Let's see how we can prioritize that.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“But we're also weighing that against our future ambitions of all the different content and experiences we want to create from live services, because this is just the beginning of the experience, and we want to make sure that we're addressing player feedback, and we're also adding new and exciting experiences for players to play.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">REDSEC will continue to coexist alongside Battlefield 6, meaning players can expect seasonal updates to introduce new content to both experiences. The REDSEC Season 1 roadmap has already provided a taste of what’s to come, teasing a new vehicle-based Gauntlet mission called Rodeo for November 18 and an Ice Lock Gauntlet limited-time event for December 9.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We asked if seasonal updates could impact REDSEC’s map, Fort Lyndon, as Battlefield 6, battle royale, Gauntlet, and Portal updates roll out. BF Studios isn’t ready to talk map updates just yet, but when changes like that eventually arrive, don’t expect the developers to deliver surface-level changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For me, when we do map updates, if we're going to spend a bunch of time working on the map, I want to make sure that it's additive to the player experience,” Wiebe said. “That it's not just a quick cosmetic hit, right? That there's new fun things to explore there. It adds to gameplay in new and meaningful ways. I think, for me, that's the important component moving forward.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He adds that Gauntlet, the new game mode the Battlefield 6 community has welcomed with open arms, will continue to be a “tool in our toolbelt” when it comes to thematic seasonal content, calling the mode “the perfect, ultimate live-service game mode.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's not always looking at, ‘What do we do with the battle royale or Fort Lyndon map?’ but also, ‘How do we leverage Gauntlet and utilize it in fresh and unique ways to also hit some of those live service, thematic beats?’” Wiebe said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 and REDSEC launched into Season 1 October 28. The three-part introductory season will introduce new modes, maps, and weapons throughout its run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While BF Studios does its best to retake lost ground, you can check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-review"><u>7/10 REDSEC review</u></a> and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer"><u>8/10 multiplayer review</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of video games’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-vs-battlefield-the-last-great-gaming-rivalry">greatest rivalries</a> is heating up again with the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. It follows hot on the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, which has firmly marked its territory as not just one of 2025’s best shooters, but as the best Battlefield game in many, many years. But Call of Duty proves itself as one of the biggest FPS games in the world, year in, year out – has Battlefield got what it takes to dethrone Activision’s behemoth this year?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there’s everything to play for when it comes to player numbers and financial success, the real question is: What kind of first-person shooter are you looking for? Do you want your multiplayer tight and competitive, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-brought-absolute-cinema-back-to-multiplayer">deeply cinematic</a>? Do you want something grounded in reality, or are you seeking undead hordes to shoot in the face? Call of Duty and Battlefield have long been pitted against each other, but this year’s offerings are good evidence that these games actually offer significantly different experiences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re considering picking Black Ops 7 or Battlefield 6 up to fuel your end-of-year gaming sessions, but are unsure which one is for you, then we’re here to help. Let's take a look at what each game offers across its suite of modes and work out which aligns with your preferences.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Multiplayer</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/battlefield-6-multiplayer-1762789258577.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The key difference between Call of Duty and Battlefield is their approach to multiplayer. Typically, Call of Duty focuses on tightly designed, smaller-scale maps that cater to fast-paced fights, and Black Ops 7 is no different – at launch it will offer 16 different maps for 6v6 matches. Battlefield, on the other hand, is designed around large-scale warfare using a combination of infantry and vehicles to capture objectives. Battlefield 6 features fewer maps - just nine at launch - but in general they are much, much larger than Call of Duty’s maps. They also feel less like killing arenas and more like authentic places, in part due to the fact you can destroy many of the buildings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you <em>can </em>say that the key difference between CoD and BF is small vs big, that’s not strictly true. Black Ops 7 will also launch with two 20v20 “Skirmish” maps for larger-scale battles, and Battlefield 6 features modes like the 8v8 Squad Deathmatch that take place on smaller sections of its big maps. Similarly, it wouldn’t be fair to say that Battlefield is objective-based and Call of Duty isn’t; while TDM is a Call of Duty staple, its multiplayer suite contains a whole host of classic-style objective modes, including Hardpoint and Domination. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All that said, Call of Duty has always excelled at the smaller, more “traditional” FPS experience, and Battlefield is better for those large-scale, “war movie” style multiplayer matches. If you’re looking for a fast-moving, more focused and intense game, Black Ops 7 is your ticket. If you like something more tactically driven, with clearly-defined class roles, longer matches, and the added spectacle of tanks and helicopters, then Battlefield 6 is where you need to be.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Campaign</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/blops-7-characters-1762789329207.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty and Battlefield have frequently delivered story campaigns that feel very similar, but this year they both have very different focuses. Not only are they set in distinctly different universes – BLOPS is going all trippy sci-fi this year, while BF6 keeps it grounded with a modern warfare approach – but Call of Duty’s campaign has a multiplayer approach this year, while Battlefield is strictly single-player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 7 has full four-player co-op support for its campaign, turning the typically solo endeavor into a social experience. That approach is emphasised by the fact that it has an infinitely replayable “Endgame” mode, unlocked after completing the story. A PvE co-op mode, it will see you and your team complete objectives in the face of escalating odds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If it wasn’t already clear that the BLOPS 7 campaign is more closely related to the multiplayer side of Call of Duty than ever, a new unified progression system means that you can earn XP during the campaign and endgame in the same way you would multiplayer. While this is a big shift, it seems like the “classic” single-player Call of Duty campaign will still be there for those who want it. The missions can still be completed solo, and they have once again been designed by Raven Software, the developers behind last year’s fantastic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review">Black Ops 6 campaign</a>.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If a more traditional approach to campaign is your preference, then you may want to take a look at Battlefield 6. Its resolutely single-player story very much feels like an old-school COD campaign, with linear missions that mostly focus on firefights and destroying objectives. It follows a modern day conflict between NATO and the private military company Pax Armata, and will have you unspooling a large conspiracy as you battle through locations like Croatia and New York. You can expect the classic staples of sniping missions, beach landings, vehicle chases, and explosive set-piece design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that if you love Battlefield’s massive maps, use of vehicles and destruction, and its clearly defined class roles, you won’t find much of that here. Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-review">campaign review</a> was disappointed in how it failed to adapt the multiplayer’s winning formula for a single-player experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for a traditional campaign experience, you can find it in both Black Ops 7 and Battlefield 6. If you’d like to play that kind of story in co-op, BLOPS 7 is your best (and only) choice, but it’s important to note that the setting is a near-future sci-fi, which hasn’t always appealed to COD fans. For those interested in more “realistic,” contemporary warfare, then Battlefield 6 will serve you better. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Additional Modes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/blops-7-zombies-1762789379781.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As is tradition for Treyarch’s Call of Duty games, this year’s Black Ops once again includes a Zombies mode. Once a simple bonus PvE game, Call of Duty Zombies has massively grown in scale and scope over the years, and Black Ops 7 features perhaps the series’ most robust offering. Round-Based Zombies is the main one, tasking you and a group of friends to survive zombie hordes round after round, with the danger increasing each time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zombies is known for its cryptic design, and often you need to solve obtuse puzzles to progress. A “Directed” version, returning from Black Ops 6, helps guide you through those objectives, while a “Cursed” version remixes the game with ideas from previous Zombie iterations for a more difficult challenge. “Survival” tasks you with staying alive as long as possible on a smaller version of the new Zombies map, while “Dead Ops Arcade 4” sees the return of a top down, twin-stick shooter mode that was last seen in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Black Ops Cold War</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You won’t find any undead monsters in Battlefield 6, but you will find Portal – a powerful tool that allows you to create almost any kind of Battlefield experience you can imagine. Best thought of as Battlefield’s answer to Fortnite’s creator islands, the Portal tool allows you to create brand new maps and game modes, a feature that has allowed fans to re-create favourite maps from prior games, as well as entirely new types of multiplayer matches. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it may seem at first glance that, when it comes to additional modes, that BLOPS 7 is best for those looking to play and Battlefield 6 is better for creators, it’s worth remembering that non-creatives can still play Portal creations made by the community, and that they are easily accessible from Battlefield 6’s main menu. As such, BLOPS 7 is the best pick for those looking for an arcade-style PvE horror game, while Battlefield 6 is more suited to people who enjoy creating or playing user-made experiences. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battle Royale</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/battlefield-redsec-1762789433569.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Technically speaking, neither Black Ops 7 nor Battlefield 6 have battle royale modes. That’s because Call of Duty and Battlefield both have free-to-play battle royale games, which can be downloaded and played without the need to buy BLOPS 7 or BF6. However, these modes are closely linked to their “parent” games, and so are worth considering, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> is one of the biggest battle royale games in the world, and is frequently updated with content that’s linked to whatever the current “main” Call of Duty game is. Currently that’s Black Ops 6, but we expect a plethora of BLOPS 7-themed content to arrive in the coming months, such as skins and limited time modes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of experience, Warzone’s flagship mode is a classic, large-scale, fight-to-the-last person/squad standing game. More approachable than PUBG and less hero-driven than Apex Legends, it’s nonetheless an exciting and tense take on a now-staple idea. Alternate modes, such as Resurgence (which allows respawns) and Plunder (where squads fight to gain as much cash as possible) makes Warzone a fairly varied suite of free-to-play game types. Importantly, Warzone is part of Call of Duty’s unified progression, so any XP earned contributes to your overall pool collected from every BLOPS 7 mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-redsec">Battlefield REDSEC</a> is the new kid on the block, and plays a similar game to Warzone. It’s also a large-scale battle royale with a shrinking circle, but this time there’s those classic Battlefield elements of vehicle warfare and destructible terrain. Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-review">review</a> found that those ideas perhaps didn’t carve out a whole new niche for REDSEC’s take on battle royale, but was much more enthusiastic about Gauntlet, a brand new knockout-style mode that sees squads race against the clock to complete objectives. REDSEC is also supported by the Portal system, and so is another place where community-driven creations can potentially thrive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As these are both free-to-play games, there’s nothing to lose by downloading and playing both of them. If you’re already locked into the Call of Duty ecosystem, then Warzone’s unified progression system will no doubt be helpful in boosting your XP bar. And if the destruction and class-based design of Battlefield is more your speed, then REDSEC may appeal more. There’s also the modes to consider – we’d consider Warzone better for classic battle royale, and REDSEC better for its alternative Gauntlet mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also worth considering both Warzone and REDSEC as “tasters” for their parent games. While these battle royales offer very different experiences to Black Ops 7 and Battlefield 6, they are built on the same foundations. If you prefer the movement and shooting systems of one over the other, then you’ll likely find that’s a good test for which of the paid-for games your best click with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-vs-battlefield-6-which-one-is-best-for-you]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Only a few weeks after the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, fans learned that the franchise's new cozy game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokemon Pokopia</a>, is coming in early 2026. However, Pokopia will only be given a physical release as a Game-Key Card, rather than a cartridge with the full game. That's proven to be a controversial topic among Switch 2 players, some of whom are angry enough that they claim they'll skip Pokopia entirely.</p><p>Nintendo of Japan's <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/pocoapokemon/ja/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a> confirmed Pokopia's Game-Key release, followed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ldQYMwzWrY&amp;t=15s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an official YouTube video</a> that used it as a Game-Key Card example, and the reaction has been swift. Unlike digital releases, fans are able to resell Game-Key cards. But for players who prefer to own the complete game on a cartridge, it's viewed as Nintendo breaking its pledge not to publish its own games that way. The game was developed by Koei Tecmo's Omega Force, so technically Nintendo hasn't broken that promise. However, not everyone sees it that way.</p><p>Nintendo introduced Game-Key Cards alongside the Switch 2 in part as a way to mitigate the size restrictions of Switch 2 cartridges. The only thing on the card is a digital license that allows the player to download the game directly to their Switch 2. This differs from a digital purchase in that the Game-Key Card needs to be in the console for the game to play, but it's also transferable to a new owner if the player who purchased it no longer wants it. </p><p>Pokemon Pokopia will be released on March 5, 2026 for Switch 2. On Thursday, November 13, Nintendo will debut a new trailer for Pokopia that will feature over 10 minutes of gameplay.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>The developer said it has "evolved" its machine-learning-based anti-cheat measures with the aim of helping the system become "smarter, faster, and fairer."</p><p>"Our aimbot-detection models are trained to decide whether a player’s targeting was performed by a human or an aimbot. In Black Ops 7, these updated models will discriminate between natural aim and cheating with even greater precision by taking what they have learned from real gameplay to catch more cheaters than before," the developer explained.</p><p>Beyond aiming, Activison's Ricochet anti-cheat efforts include behavioral models that examine <em>how </em>people play to deduce if they are possibly cheating. "These upgraded models now analyze not just where a player aims, but how they move, how they engage, and how their play changes," Activision said.</p><p>As an example, if a player is consistently getting kills on a map at places that aren't usually "hotspots," this can be flagged "for deeper analysis."</p><p>"Our pattern recognition is trained on real matches, learning what genuine skill looks like--and recognizing when it's not," Activision said.</p><p>Also in the blog post, Activision said some of the new anti-cheat systems for Black Ops 7 that were tested in the multiplayer beta will be "even more effective" when the game launches.</p><p>"Our mission is simple: Make every round you play fair. Each Ricochet anti-cheat upgrade means cleaner matches and wins that reflect real skill. You deserve nothing less, and that's our promise to you," Activision said.</p><p>Black Ops 7 is available to preload now. For more, check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-times-and-preloading-info-revealed/1100-6535917/" data-ref-id="1100-6535917">Black Ops 7 release times</a>, including details on how to trick your console into thinking it's in New Zealand so you can play early.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"First of all, I think it's important to assume that every game company is now using AI," Lee said. "But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: How do you survive? I believe it's important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness."</p><p>To answer his own question of surviving in a competitive development market, Lee expressed that "human creativity" is what'll push an OK game to a fabulous game. This sentiment mirrors what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-no-shortcut-to-making-great-games-embark-studios-cco-responds-to-and-defends-ai-use-in-arc-raiders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Embark Studios CCO Stefan Strandberg told Eurogamer in October 2025</a>, that there are "no shortcuts to making great games" despite using AI to "assist in some content creation."</p><p>Not everyone agrees with either Lee or Strandberg, though. Strange Scaffold founder Xavier Nelson Jr. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/writnelson.bsky.social/post/3m5fpcezxzc2w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded with condemnation on Bluesky</a>, personally confirming that "a lot of other studios"--whether indie or AAA--are not using generative AI in their games. Tommy Thompson, founder of AI video game analysis company AI in Games, also disputed Lee's argument, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tommy.aiandgames.com/post/3m5geygzyzs2r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posting on Bluesky</a> that "very few [studios] have gone all in" on AI. Developer Neil Jones, creator of the 3D runner Aerial_Knight's Never Yield, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aerialknight.com/post/3m5gwkm6iw22h" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on Bluesky</a> that this is an admission that "they're going to fire you." And former Chucklefish animator Adam Riches shared his contempt for Lee's comments, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/supernorn.bsky.social/post/3m5gohsq7qk2m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">taking to Bluesky</a> to say that Nexon is "too cheap to care about their craft."</p><p>While people are upset with Lee's notion that "every game company is now using AI," one CEO came to his defense: Epic Games' Tim Sweeney. Posting in <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1988053268535406695" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the replies to Eurogamer's review on X</a>, Sweeney said that "political opinions" should stay in the opinion section, not reviews. He continued in <a href="https://x.com/Doubttom/status/1988054048579481663" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">response to X user doubttom</a>, who asked if disliking AI should be considered political:</p><p>"Yes. This technology increases human productivity in some areas by integer multiples, and views on whether this is a net good and should be rewarded, or bad and should be fought against, are speculative and generally distributed along political lines," Sweeney said. "Since the author states the pessimistic case, I’ll put the optimistic one here. Game developers compete to build the best games in order to attract gamers. When tech increases productivity, competition leads to building better games rather than employing fewer people."</p><p>It's worth noting that there are some AAA studios banking on AI. EA said its workers should view the controversial technology as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">thought partners</a>" while demanding its employees train AI on their work. Krafton Inc. has announced plans to invest $70 million to become an "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">AI-first company</a>." Square Enix wants <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-wants-genai-to-automate-70-of-game-qa-by-2027/1100-6535996/" data-ref-id="1100-6535996">generative AI to automate at least 70% of game QA and debugging work</a>. And even Sony has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-lays-out-plans-for-ai-use-in-gaming-going-forward/1100-6534741/" data-ref-id="1100-6534741">laid out plans for incorporating AI in its games</a> going forward. This is not to mention the myriad developers who've recently said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">AI should be embraced by the industry</a>, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devs-who-dont-embrace-ai-are-selling-themselves-short-ex-god-of-war-dev-says/1100-6535614/" data-ref-id="1100-6535614">those who refuse to work with it will sell themselves short</a>.</p><p>Although a hot-button topic, this isn't the first time Embark Studios has used AI in its games. The developer's last game, the 2023 free-to-play multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-finals/" data-ref-id="5000-570887">The Finals</a>, also featured text-to-speech (TTS) that was generated using AI because <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-finals-uses-ai-text-to-speech-because-it-can-produce-lines-in-just-a-matter-of-hours-rather-than-months-baffles-actual-voice-actors/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the team could produce voice lines in hours rather than months</a>. Embark Studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-finals-dev-defends-ai-voices-says-its-not-trying-to-replace-humans/1100-6518802/" data-ref-id="1100-6518802">defended its choice back then</a>, stating that "making games without actors isn't an end goal" and a combination of recorded voice audio and audio generated via TTS tools merely expedited the process.</p><p>Regardless of the discourse surrounding the game, Arc Raiders has been a smash hit since its October 30 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-on-an-upward-arc-surpassing-helldivers-2-all-time-peak-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6536086/" data-ref-id="1100-6536086">smoked the multiplayer shooter Helldivers 2</a>, becoming one of the most-played games on Steam.</p>
