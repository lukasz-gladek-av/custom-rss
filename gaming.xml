<p>The timings for the event are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6pm (Thu) PDT / 7pm (Thu) MDT / 8pm (Thu) CDT / 9pm (Thu) EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2am BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3am CEST / 4am EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 10am JST / 9am AWST / 11am AEST</li></ul><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nlqust&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The official video description reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ARC SYSTEM WORKS Showcase will be broadcast, delivering the latest information on Arc System Works, including the announcement of new titles!</p>
<p>"In addition to the latest information on various game titles, including completely new titles developed and published by Arc System Works, we will also be announcing a new project that Ishiwatari Taisuke is working on."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we can probably expect to see a bit more from the studio's upcoming project with Sony Interactive Entertainment, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>, which is scheduled to launch on PS5 and PC next year. Since Switch / Switch 2 owners won't be partaking in this release (yet), however, we're far more interested in the "announcement of new titles".</p>
<p>Arc System Works has developed and published a few key Switch titles in the past, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear: Strive</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/blazblue_cross_tag_battle">BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle</a>, so we wouldn't be surprised to see something new for Nintendo platforms in the future.</p>
<p>Specifically, Taisuke-san is tied closely to the Guilty Gear series, and with Strive originally launching four years back, it could well be time to see what's next in the long-running fighting franchise.</p>
<p>Either way, we'll be keeping a close eye on the upcoming showcase and will share any relevant news with you as soon as it happens.</p>

            <p>Yep, that sound you can hear is the pounding footsteps of a certain <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> minutefellow. He's coming to tell you that another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> settlement may soon need your help, as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-mods">modder</a>'s figured out how to let folks build stuff using the likes of rocks and beams as they play.</p>
<p>It's not quite got all the bells and whistles of a full settlement building system yet, but its creator is hoping to find someone to collab with on putting together exactly that.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Right now, MadAborModding's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4648?tab=description">settlement building proof of concept</a> lets you spawn in world objects, adjust where they're placed on the fly, and then save them in place to make permanent additions to the world. It's a bit rudimentary at current, but there are "over 12,000 spawnable objects" at your fingertips, plus the ability to put 'em wherever you like and have them be there whenever you load up the game.</p>
<p>To build, you start by either using your left and right arrow keys to scroll through the spawnable objects in a random order or save time by adding the exact ones you want to one of the mod's LUA files. From there you look at and use the up arrow on the stone wall, beam or rock you're adding in to pick it up. You'll need to put it down once to enable its collision physics, then pick it up again to place it where you want.</p>
<p>V and B move it up and down, while Z, X, and C rotate it. Once you're done, you press backspace to save your placed stuff, with the mod recording these as ini files it'll then load up next time you start the game. These ini files are also able to be copied out of the game files if you want to share a creation with other people and let them load it into their game.</p>
<p>"I hope someone expands this into an actual settlement system," the modder wrote, "My goal with uploading this is hopefully to bait someone into doing that." They added that they're open to working with other interested parties to make that happen, with categorising objects and making menus being the aspects they'd need the most help pulling off.</p>
<p>What makes his so cool is that Oblivion Remastered still lacks official modding tools, with modders left to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remastered-potential-pinnacle-of-elder-scrolls-modding-reckons-pioneer-modder">push boundaries and experiment</a> with the tools they do have. That often means there's more to install on the player's end to account for the processes at play behind-the-scenes being <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remastered-coldtyrant-modder-interview-evil-faction-quests">less straightforward</a>, which makes it impressive that all MadAborModding's creation looks to require is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS for OblivionRemastered</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-fallout-4-style-building-from-modder-who-wants-to-collaborate-on-a-full-settlement-system]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A man has been arrested after being accused of stealing "approximately $10,000 worth" of Nintendo Switch video games from US libraries.</p>
<p>The man in question is Jamal Reed-Obafumi, who is said to have targeted multiple public libraries in Northern California. As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-accused-of-stealing-10000-worth-of-switch-games-from-libraries/1100-6532651/">GameSpot</a>, the Marin County Sheriff's Office said on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MarinCountySheriff/posts/pfbid0ooLynurh5d2koiZcGqVUTRTvGhHYRgsDuQXGaLaHtHihBZ4Y9kiY5BhEyxoUGdDpl">Facebook</a> it had arrested 45-year-old Reed-Obafumi earlier this month, on 17th June.</p>

<p>The Office alleged Reed-Obafumi was "connected to a string of at least seven different burglaries of Marin County Libraries". These incidents took place between April and June of this year, although specific libraries were not mentioned.</p>
<p>According to the Facebook post, Reed-Obafumi now faces 12 felony charges. These include multiple "counts of burglary", in addition to "committing a felony while out on bail", the Marin County Sheriff's Office said, before closing:</p>
<p>"Our libraries are pillars of the community and must be safeguarded for everyone to enjoy!"</p>
<p>It is currently unclear if any of the stolen Switch games have been recovered. Eurogamer has contacted the Marin County Sheriff's Office for comment.</p>

<p>Plus a new 'PURE' performance mode</p>

<p>But what do you get with it? Well, Shin'en has confirmed to us that the 'Pure Update' – which is completely free, by the way – will contain three new tracks based on classics from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>. These will be largely faithful recreations of fan favourites from the original 2017 Switch launch title, but with small tweaks to make use of the new 'Hyperjump' feature along with all new visuals and effects.</p><p><figure data-videoid="NK1xJVeVTDM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5b9621oxwmgr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK1xJVeVTDM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>Carbium Cup</h2>
<p>- Alpine Trust<br>
- Sunahara Plains<br>
- Zenshoh Habitat</p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to the new tracks, the Pure Update will also include a new performance mode simply called 'Pure', which renders at 1440p dynamic resolution with no upscaling applied. Fan feedback from the game's release was that the visuals could often look a little blurry due to the application of DLSS, so hopefully this new option will completely erradicate this.</p>
<p>That's not all, though. Shin'en has also shared that the Alpine Trust track will implement a new GPU particle system for the snowflakes effect, and we honestly can't wait to see this in action. We're also getting two new Jukebox entries, tweaks to make progression slightly easier (specifically a lower price for the third cup), a bug fix to resolve a rare crash when switching rendering modes often, and several smaller fixes and corrections.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a closer look at the new tracks:</p>


<p>Fast Fusion is a real showstopper launch title for the Switch 2, earning a well-deserved score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">9/10 in our review</a>. We said that it's "easily the most accomplished entry in Shin'en Multimedia's series so far" and is "an absolute must-buy" for new Switch 2 owners.</p>
<p>If, however, you thought the overall content was a little slim, then hopefully this first major update will help alleviate this with the addition of three new tracks.</p>

            <p>Anticipation for the next mainline entry in the Resident Evil series is evidently high.</p>
<p>Capcom has today announced that Resident Evil Requiem has already had "over" one million of us add the upcoming game to our wishlists.</p>
<p>"Thank you," <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/1937289617008427060">Capcom wrote on social media</a>, with a little infographic showing the figure alongside Grace Ashcroft.</p>

<p>While this does not equate to actual games sales, we are all clearly very keen for the next Resident Evil release. And, it seems rightly so. Our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>, which bodes well!</p>
<p>Back in April, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-remake-becomes-fastest-game-in-the-series-to-sell-10m">the Resident Evil 4 Remake has now sold more than 10m copies</a>. It managed to hit that milestone faster than any other game in the Resi series to date. Could today's wishlisted figure for Resident Evil Requiem mean that Resi 9 will potentially take that milestone crown on its release next year? Time will tell.</p>
<p>We got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem earlier this month, when the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>. We can expect yet another look in just a couple of days' time, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-spotlight-announced-for-next-week-with-resident-evil-requiem-pragmata-and-more-to-feature">Capcom hosts its Spotlight showcase on 26th June</a>.</p>

<p>Along with Resident Evil Requiem, the developer will also give us another look at its astronaut and small girl-starring game Pragmata, as well as existing titles <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>During this stream, the developer will delve further into the newest update for Monster Hunter Wilds. As our Dom wrote yesterday, after a strong start for Wilds the game has suffered an influx of overwhelmingly negative Steam reviews. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">Can Capcom turn things around with Monster Hunter Wilds' upcoming Title Update 2</a>?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-already-looks-set-for-massive-success-as-it-hits-significant-wishlist-milestone]]></content:encoded>

<p>"About 3 times slower than the original Steam Deck LCD"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="slow lcd df switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1fbd80acc0dfd/slow-lcd-df-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic">reported a few days back</a> that the boffins over at Digital Foundry were less than impressed with the Switch 2's LCD screen after running various tests on it.</p>
<p>Now, however, DF's John Linneman has <a href="https://x.com/dark1x/status/1937199770788901151">weighed in on social media</a> to confirm that the new screen is more "problematic" than had first appeared—and then some.</p>
<p>On his social media, Linneman pointed to tests run on the Switch 2 LCD on a specialist PC Monitor site, <a href="https://chimolog.co/">Chimilog</a>:</p>

<p>As you can see, the Switch 2's screen is at the bottom of the list of LCDs when put through a gauntlet of technical tests to measure its performance. The image in his post, on the left, shows average response times of 32 LCDs, and the Switch 2 lands with the worst time here.</p>
<p>Linneman also compares the performance to being "about three times slower than the original Steam Deck LCD" and states once again, as we'd covered in our previous article, that it's actually <em>worse</em> in some ways than the 2017 Switch LCD.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, we (or this writer at the very least) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/weve-seen-switch-2s-lcd-screen-in-the-flesh-and-it-really-doesnt-feel-like-a-downgrade">have been very happy with our screens thus far</a>, and judging by the general reception to it, most gamers perhaps don't need to sweat this stuff.</p>
<p>Still, it's a shame that the screen just doesn't seem to be up to the standard it perhaps could, and should, have been as part of a brand new console circa 2025. There's always the Switch 2 OLED Model though, right?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation has been sued in the Netherlands over the high prices of digital games and in-game content, which the company can force upon users with its dominant position in the market.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-playstation-sued-in-the-netherlands-in-class-action-lawsuit-over-artificially-high-playstation-prices.1226472/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument, a Dutch non-profit consumer foundation representing large groups of consumers in class action lawsuits, confirmed today on its<a href="https://www.massaschadeconsument.nl/nieuws/2025-06-24-sony-gedagvaard-in-collectieve-rechtszaak-om-kunstmatig-hoge-playstation-prijzen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> official website</a> that it has summoned Sony in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Dutch PlayStation players over the company exploiting its dominant position in the console market, and denying potential app stores access to its gaming systems. The class action lawsuit is the culmination of the Fair PlayStation campaign launched back in February, which highlighted how, in the PlayStation 5 generation, consumers are being pushed more and more towards digital-only consoles, where games and in-game content can only be purchased exclusively via the PlayStation Store. This dominant position led to the establishment of the so-called Sony tax, artificially high prices that make gamers pay much more for digital games and in-game content than they would in a free market.</p>
<p>In its summons, the Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument foundation accuses PlayStation of excluding competition and exploiting consumers and game developers, utilizing its dominant position in the market. By removing consumers' and third-party publishers' choice, Sony greatly profits from the situation, making more than twice as much margin on digital sales as on retail copies. As such, the advantages of digital distribution go entirely to the Japanese company. Since 2013, the damage to Dutch consumers has amounted to 435 million euros.</p>
<p>The next step in this class action lawsuit will be the first hearing, which may already take place this year. The Dutch court will evaluate its jurisdiction on the matter and the admissibility of the foundation. If the court grants the claim, the foundation expects Sony to be forced to open the market for selling digital PlayStation content to other providers, which is extremely unlikely to happen, at least not directly via PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>With the pricing of digital games on PlayStation 5 being extremely high and the market being pushed more and more towards an all-digital future, there's definitely some merit to the Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument class action lawsuit. Hopefully, this will lead to some much-needed changes, especially at a time when gaming is becoming an increasingly more expensive hobby, with prices of <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">consoles</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">games</a> rising across the board.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Six or so years on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hypixels-riot-backed-hytale-announced">an announcement trailer</a> that made it clear people had an appetite for their game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y building and survival shenanigans (it's got 61 million views to date), Hypixel Studios have announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has been cancelled. On top of that, the studio themselves are gearing up for closure.</p>
<p>Hytale's development kicked off all the way back in 2015, with its devs being the folks behind the huge <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecraft-biggest-servers">Hypixel Minecraft server</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> publisher Riot Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-have-bought-hytale-developers-hypixel-studios">bought the studio</a> in 2020, not long after we learned that Hytale would have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-will-have-undead-chickens">undead chickens</a>, and not long before the game's target release year started being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-wont-be-launching-until-2023-at-the-earliest">pushed</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-devs-are-redeveloping-its-engine-say-no-release-in-2023">back</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This is not the outcome any of us - at Hypixel or at Riot - wanted," Hypixel co-founder Noxy wrote in <a href="https://www.hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale">an update post</a> on the studio's website, "But after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise."</p>
<p>He went on to paint a picture of feature creep lining the road to the game's demise, explaining:</p>
<blockquote>Over time, as our vision evolved and the genre matured around us, the bar kept rising. Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that Hytale still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be. It became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game. We looked at reducing scope, adjusting timelines, and finding new angles to keep moving forward. But each of those options would have meant compromising on what made Hytale special in the first place. It wouldn’t have been the game we set out to make. And it wouldn’t have been the game you deserve.</blockquote>
<p>Noxy added that the studio did try to seek out "investors or acquirers who could continue to help carry Hytale forward" once Riot had made the call to pull its backing, but this looks to have come to nought. With Hypixel Studios now "winding down", the co-founder thanked the publisher for providing "generous severance and resources" to staff who're being laid off.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that Hypixel's Minecraft server will continue to run as normal despite the cancellation and impending closure.</p>
<p>It's a really unfortunate end for Hytale, assuming the game isn't able to be resurrected in some way further down the line, especially given the decade Hypixel put into developing it. "We’re proud of what we built, and we’ll carry those lessons forward into whatever comes next," Noxy wrote to close out his post.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a massive improvement over the original in terms of visuals and a very effective showcase of the Decima Engine.</p>
<p>A new video shared on YouTube by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Nick930" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick930</a> puts the second entry in the series side-by-side with the Director's Cut release of the first entry in the franchise by Hideo Kojima running on PlayStation 5 Pro, comparing character models, environments, animations, and more. By all metrics, the new entry in the series is a massive improvement over its predecessor, and a great showcase of what can be achieved using the Decima Engine, so much so that the two games don't feel like they are only five years apart.</p>
<p><iframe title="Death Stranding 2: On the Beach vs Original | Direct Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nyMDgwTET2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach doesn't just look better than its predecessor, but it's also a better game, and the culmination of Hideo Kojima's best and worst ideas, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">review-in-progress</a>.</p>
<p><em>As impossible to describe as the first, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a culmination of some of Kojima's best (and worst) ideas all in one package that's more cohesive and less coherent than anything his team has done so far.</em></p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launches on PlayStation 5 on June 26th worldwide. Owners of the Deluxe Edition can play the game already, thanks to the included 48-hour early access perk.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Riot Games is closing the studio behind <em>Hytale</em>, its <em>Minecraft</em>-like game that has been in development for nearly a decade. Hypixel Studios, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223667/riot-games-league-of-legends-hypixel-studios-minecraft-hytale">Riot acquired in 2020</a> for an undisclosed sum, is shutting down “over the next few months,” according to Hypixel CEO Aaron “Noxy” Donaghey.</p><p>“After years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring <em>Hytale </em>to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise,“ says Donaghey in a <a href="https://x.com/noxywoxy/status/1937180229031940439?s=46">post on X</a>. ”This is a painful decision. We still believe in <em>Hytale</em>. We believe in the team, and are forever grateful to every member, past or present, who poured their love into the game.“</p><p><em>Hytale</em> has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/14o3p7n/the_slow_development_of_hytale_a_timeline/">been in development</a> since 2015, when Hypixel was founded as a small indie studio by members of a popular <em>Minecraft </em>server network. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o77MzDQT1cg">trailer was released</a> in late 2018, and Hypixel was supposed to deliver a beta of <em>Hytale</em> in 2021 following the Riot acquisition a year prior. That beta never arrived, and in 2021 there was a major change to the game engine powering <em>Hytale</em> that set development back.</p><p>“Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that <em>Hytale</em> still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be,“ says Donaghey. ”It became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game.“</p><p>The Hypixel closure won’t affect the Hypixel server on Minecraft, which is run separately from Hypixel Studios. Despite the studio closure, Donaghey says he’s “deeply grateful to Riot” and that the team is being “supported with generous severance and resources to help them find what’s next.”</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/691791/riot-games-hypixel-studios-hytale-closure]]></content:encoded>

Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We still believe in the core concept of the Deep Desert — an endlessly renewing location that resets every week and creates an activity loop for great rewards. The tension of heading out there, head on a swivel, eyes peeled for foes as you enter the most dangerous part of the most dangerous planet in the universe, Our wish was that players would embrace this loop, forming guilds to work together to overcome the bleakness of the Deep Desert. But as Stephen King says, 'Wish in one hand, sh*t in the other, see which one fills up first.' One of my hands is overflowing right now and sadly not with wishes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bylos admitted that the "extremely competitive nature" of the Deep Desert was forcing players to engage when they may prefer PvP, and consequently, some areas of the Deep Desert will now be flagged as "Partial Warfare (PvE)" where players can grab rare resources without getting ambushed. The largest spice fields, shipwrecks and Landsraad control points will remain "War of Assassins (PvP)" as "high reward, high risk" areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the whole game is balanced around guilds and groups, so if you prefer to be a lone wolf, you can expect it to be "grindy if [you] play solo."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Orni griefing? "Thopters will always be incredibly important for crossing the desert, but they shouldn’t also be the dominant force in actual battles," Bylos said, adding that the following will be implemented "shortly": </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Scout Ornithopters with rocket launchers attached will have their speed maneuverability reduced</li><li>Rockets fired from Scout Ornithopters will have increased heat generation</li><li>Thrusters will provide a max speed bonus regardless of wings, ensuring that thruster equipped scouts will be the fastest vehicles in the game </li><li>A new T5 infantry rocket launcher will be added to help improve the dynamics of vehicle/ground combat </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the Landsraad. Bylos defines it as "an umbrella for all endgame activities," such as dungeons, contracts, and "more specialized delivery tasks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As a system it is an activity driver that is designed to promote the conflict between the factions, internal politics between the guilds, while providing goal thresholds for individuals and groups to work towards getting personal rewards," the director explained. "And the Landsraad should be doing that for everyone who wants to participate in the elder game, be they PvEer or PvPer. The Landsraad should be giving you things to do every day and every week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s nothing new, from a design perspective, we’ve seen daily/weekly quest systems in games for a long time. Our approach was to try and frame this system around the greater politics of the Dune universe, by having players engage in activities to earn the votes of the various Landsraad houses." Consequently, Funcom will shortly be addressing "key flaws" in the Landsraad design, too, including stockpiling, which is currently rewarded but was not designed to be that way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Once a live game launches, it becomes a collaborative effort between the developers and the players to make it something amazing," Bylos concluded. "We appreciate your feedback on what we hope is the beginning of a long journey together. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Bear with us — our intention is to be clear and open in our communications and to make Dune: Awakening a game that everybody can enjoy."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dune: Awakening Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-dev-working-on-pvp-and-deep-desert-issues-as-new-concurrent-user-peak-record-is-set"><u>Dune: Awakening a Great 8/10 in our review</u></a>, writing: "Dune: Awakening is an excellent survival MMO that captures Frank Herbet’s sci-fi world incredibly well, mostly to its advantage and occasionally to its detriment.

                <p>Unlike Sony or Microsoft, Nintendo doesn't appear to be interested in bringing its games to anything other than a Nintendo console. That hasn't stopped fans from unofficially porting some of Nintendo's older games to PC. Now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-64/" data-ref-id="5000-1330">Mario Kart 64</a> is the latest classic title to make the leap to PC.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fan-made-mario-kart-64-pc-port-released-with-track-editor-and-ultrawide-support/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, the fan programming team known as Harbour Masters has shared its Mario Kart 64 port, which has been dubbed SpaghettiKart. Harbour Masters and its "vast number of contributors" reverse-engineered Mario Kart 64's original code and added modern graphics options including support for ultrawide screens, 4k resolution, and higher frame rates.</p><p>SpaghettiKart also has new features including the ability to create customized race courses and increasing the difficulty of the CPU drivers. Harbour Masters has previously created PC ports for Star Fox 64, The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. These games have "clean codes" that don't borrow or use any of the original code from the original N64 games. However, these PC ports still require players to have legally-sourced ROMs in order to use them.</p><p>Earlier this year, a separate fan-created project brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-64-mod-brings-minecraft-to-the-mushroom-kingdom/1100-6531772/" data-ref-id="1100-6531772">Minecraft to Super Mario 64</a>, both for a PC emulator and it even works on Nintendo 64 consoles with some limitations. The most recent game in the Mario Kart series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/" data-ref-id="1900-6418371">Mario Kart World</a>, was released earlier this month as a launch title for Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<figure><a title="System Shock 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e7f90c57e69c2/system-shock-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nightdive Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nightdive Studios has announced that it has delayed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2</a> on the Switch, with the game now targeting a console release within "the first two weeks of July".</p>
<p>In a statement released on social media, the remaster wizards stated that the team simply "encountered issues" that prevented it from releasing the game on its originally intended launch date of 26th June. If you happen to be playing on PC, get your chisel out, because this date is still locked in – it's just the console release that's affected.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nlqust&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>It doesn't sound like we'll be waiting <em>too</em> long for the game, however, though it's important to keep in mind that the current July estimate is exactly that – an estimate – and is just as prone to a further delay should the team deem it necessary.</p>
<p>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster is an enhanced release of the original 1999 classic from co-developers Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios. It was one of the first projects from creator Ken Levine and is considered a spiritual precursor to the <strong>Bioshock</strong> series.</p>
<p>A full-blown <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/system_shock">remake of the original System Shock</a> was released on PC and consoles, but skipped the Switch when it cropped up in 2024. We wouldn't be surprised, however, to see it ported over to the Switch 2 in the near future to take full advantage of the console's extra power.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes The Deep</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> developers The Chinese Room have laid off a number of staff, seemingly as part of parent company Sumo Digital's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-look-likely-at-sumo-digital-as-company-ditches-plans-to-work-on-its-own-ip">wider strategic decision in February 2025</a> to move away from original game creation and "focus exclusively on development services for partners".</p>
<p>As originally reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-still-wakes-the-deep-developer-the-chinese-room-is-making-layoffs">Game Developer</a>, several Chinese Room devs took to LinkedIn last week to post about leaving the studio.</p>
<p>VFX artist Jamie Berry <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341430185805680640/">writes</a> that "the scourge of redundancy has struck". Technical producer Pascal Siddons <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pascal-siddons-9aa255133_we-are-none-of-us-safe-from-the-headsmans-activity-7341109140871639040-X1eh/">adds</a> that "we are none of us safe from the headsman's axe when redundancy time comes around". 3D animator Bradly Adams and senior environment artist Adam Sharp <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341127507061956608/">both</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341437875885903873/">observe</a> less colourfully that "my current role and many others have been affected by recent events".</p>
<p>The Chinese Room have yet to give a comment on the situation, but Game Developer have confirmed with Sumo Group that several members of the company's Content &amp; Communications team have been affected by the company's recently announced change of direction. Sumo haven't shared a timeframe or any other details about these departures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/bloodlines-2-developer-the-chinese-room-has-laid-off-employees-but-paradox-says-the-game-is-still-coming-in-october/">PCGamer</a>, meanwhile, have picked up a statement from Bloodlines 2 publishers Paradox Interactive, who insist that all this redundancy rigmarole will not affect the game's planned October release. "Development on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is unaffected by the recent staffing changes at The Chinese Room; the game is still scheduled for an October release," a Paradox representative told the site. "We wish those affected the best of luck on their future endeavors."</p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has been delayed so often it may well be subject to some kind of ancient curse. Once in the hands of Hardsuit Labs, it was transferred to The Chinese Room in 2021, becoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">more "spiritual successor" than sequel</a> in the process. Still, this week's revelations are more about Sumo than vampires and their masquerades.</p>
<p>Founded back in 2003 and acquired by Tencent in 2021, Sumo have a long history of work-for-hire projects, including many spells as lead dev on games like the fairly smashing Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing. They had recently been experimenting with original games such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathsprint-66">Deathsprint 66</a> via their own publishing label, Secret Mode, but the last couple of years have been rocky. Sumo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/still-wakes-the-deep-warhammer-40000-boltgun-and-deathsprint-66-makers-to-lay-off-hundreds-off-staff">cut hundreds of staff</a> in June 2024 while closing Canadian studio Timbre Games (<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/timbre-games-is-going-indie-after-being-shuttered-by-sumo-group">who have since resurfaced as an indie</a>).</p>
<p>In February this year, the company <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2025/sumo-group-update/">announced</a> that "we must balance our creative ambitions and the commercial realities to ensure the long-term stability and success of our business", acknowledging that "unavoidably this transition will have an impact on our studios and people." Best of luck to all the everyday humans impacted by these rebalancings.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layoffs-at-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-studio-as-paradox-promise-rpg-will-still-release-in-october]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds removes "unfair" and "stressful" items</p>

<p>Seen as a means of keeping the playing field (relatively) level, this item targets the player in first place, and has been the cause of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/mario_kart_8_deluxe_world_record_attempt_fittingly_destroyed_by_blue_shell">much frustration over the decades</a>—to the point where some people argue it's actually a <em>disadvantage</em> to be in first position for much of each Mario Kart race.</p>
<p>It would seem that Sega has been aware of this issue when designing its Mario Kart rival <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, which is coming to Switch, Switch 2, PS4, PS5, PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S later this year.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog/veteran-sonic-producer-says-sonic-racing-crossworlds-team-completely-removed-items-from-the-game-if-they-were-too-stressful-or-let-players-win-all-the-time/">GamesRadar+</a>, Sonic series producer Takashi Iizuka reveals that when developing the game, there was a focus on making the racing "balanced" and "fair", even going as far as to design the circuits <em>before</em> thinking about adding items to the mix.</p>
<p>"They wanted to make sure the racing itself without any items was fair and fun," says Iizuka. "The dev team really took things down to the base level, and wanted to have that fun, competitive racing mechanic."</p>

<p>Even when items were in place, Iizuka explains that a multitude of playtests took place in order to ensure that the experience remained fair. "Anything that was very stressful for players, anything that always allowed people to come back from behind and win all the time needed to be removed from the concept," he says, throwing some subtle shade on Mario Kart's most feared item.</p>
<p>If you're worried that Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is sounding too sterile and safe, don't be—Iizuka admits that the development team eventually hit a balance which was just "the right amount of chaotic" while remaining "fair to the racers."</p>
<p>We'll see if this balance is successful when the game launches on September 25th. The Switch 2 version is expected at a later date.</p>

            <p>Carcinisation comes for us all, in time. Today, it is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>'s turn. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3455990749">crustacean nation mod</a> adds four legendary lords, heroes, 27 crabulous units, new spells, plus custom tech and building trees for a complete crab-paign experience. It would have been shellfish of me not to share, if not downright altruistic to avoid any and all crab puns.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I played a few turns as King Crab, who appears have to appropriated Greasus Goldtooth's crown and sceptre, and I'd be lying if I said it didn't suit him. You start on the eastern coast of the Empire, at war with a Marienburger lord named "Simon Crab-Hunter' and some Norscans. Your unique campaign mechanic here is a resource named Gleaming Shells, which you'll spend on commands similar to Karl Franz's - refresh army movement range ("scuttle onward"), make yourself immune to trespassing penalties, and so on. You also start with two units of crab knights, which are crabs riding bigger crabs.</p>
<p>The mod is by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023503085/myworkshopfiles/?appid=1142710">Pegaz</a>, who's made several others for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>, such as some unique <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412700662">Ogre Maneaters</a>. As with most custom faction mods, you'll need <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2859968660">Mixu's unlocker</a> to use it.</p>

<p>We're still awaiting the reveal of the final official faction set to join Norsca and Slaanesh for the next DLC, Tides Of Torment. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-fans-reckon-theyve-already-guessed-which-faction-is-coming-next-in-tides-of-torment">The current favourite is the high elves</a>, specifically naval commander Sea Lord Aislinn. Preferably with massive <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/high-elf-realms-merwyrm-2025">Merwyrms</a> in tow, mainly so I can shout "That's not your wyrm, it's Merwrym!" at my stunned and jealous enemies. The reveal should be coming next month.</p>
<p>There's also a good chance we'll be hearing some news about the fabled Total Warty Thousand by the end of the year, say I. Although even if that doesn't end up happening, Creative Assembly have announced the announcement, announcedly, of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-anniversary-event-showing-off-new-games-this-december">new Total War games this December</a> as part of an anniversary showcase. I crab not wait. Pincer me, I'm dreaming. It's Lobster get excited about. I shell go sit in the corner and think about what I've done now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-entire-crab-army-comes-to-total-war-warhammer-3-in-the-crustacean-nation-mod]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-gets-new-arbites-class-via-dlc-and-free-update/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Fatshark announced the release of the first paid DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-patch-13-preview-and-qa-class-system-overhaul-xbox-specs-and-pc-performance-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K Darktide</a>. Priced at $11.99 for the Standard Edition and at $18.99 for the Deluxe Edition, the DLC provides access to a new class, the Adeptus Arbites, who can rely on a Cyber-Mastiff companion, which players can customize in name and looks. The Cyber-Mastiff has its own Passive target selection, which it will use to help players against anything that comes too close. The Cyber-Mastiff can also be commanded to attack a specific target, which will override any behavior of its own. To command the Cyber-Mastiff, double-tap the Tag Input on any enemy eligible to be Tagged.</p>
<p>Arbites have plenty of options to customize their playstyle, with Talent Tree sections like Elite Killing and Cyber-Mastiff Handling, Hybrid Combat and Supportive Utility, and Crowd Control and Melee. Those who don't enjoy having a companion can even grab the Lone-Wolf talent, which removes access to the Cyber-Mastiff but provides +15% Toughness Damage Reduction, +10% Attack Speed, +10% Damage, +1 increased Charges on your Blitz Abilities, and replenishes a charge of Blitz Ability every 60 seconds.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Arbites Class | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GVaGC0xXUVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alongside the Arbites DLC, Warhammer 40K Darktide was also updated with a free patch titled The Battle for Tertium. The core player experience has been overhauled to provide a clearer narrative focus on the Battle for Tertium. Players will now experience a linear campaign featuring new mission debriefs and embedded cinematics. This new progression path is designed to make it easier for new players to get started and gradually unlock features previously restricted by character level. Previously, each new player's experience was completely random. However, the Battle for Tertium narrative presents maps, enemies, and characters in a specific order, enabling players to discover all aspects of the game at a much better pace.</p>
<p>Fatshark has even introduced a new mission board system. Missions will no longer be tied to a specific difficulty, meaning you can select a mission and then choose your desired difficulty. This effectively increases the number of mission options available to players of all levels.</p>
<p>Additionally, the difficulty system in Warhammer 40K Darktide has been completely revamped. Rather than leveling up your characters, you now unlock new difficulties by completing missions. You must prove your skills at your current maximum difficulty to unlock access to the next difficulty. The studio believes it will motivate new players to master the game step by step and give veteran players confidence that their teammates have earned their place.</p>
<p>There's also a new Inferno in-game event running until July 7, and a new Havoc campaign. Lastly, the maximum number of Operatives was increased to 8, and the maximum number of weapon loadouts received the same treatment. Players will also hear around 900 new banter conversations between characters.</p>
