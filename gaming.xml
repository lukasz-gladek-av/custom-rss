<p>How come these games aren't coming to Nintendo Switch Online like the other GBA games in the Expansion Pack? Will I be able to trade? Will we be seeing more Virtual Console-style releases like this?</p>
<p>Well, preempting all those questions, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71365/#s1q4">Nintendo of America has put out a FAQ</a> answering all those and more.</p>
<p>On the question of why these GBA games are being handled differently from others available on NSO, the article says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In celebration of 30 years of Pokémon, we thought it would be fun to return to the ultimate versions of the original Pokémon adventures in the Kanto region with these special releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've also addressed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>"</em><em>Online play is not supported."</em></strong></li>
<li><em><strong>"The games will not receive physical releases"</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>"We have nothing to announce regarding any other potential titles"</strong></em> (re. whether Red, Blue, or other Pokémon games may come to NSO in the future)</li>
<li><em><strong>"We remain focused on offering classic games through Nintendo Switch Online"</strong></em> (re. whether further standalone retro releases are planned)</li>
<li><em><strong>"We thought users will appreciate the ultimate versions of those original adventures"</strong></em> (re. why these aren't the OG Game Boy versions)</li>
</ul>
<p>On other pages beyond this FAQ, <strong>support for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon HOME</a> is confirmed</strong> to be on the way, and <strong>these games won't work with NSO Save Data Cloud backup</strong>.</p>
<p>We'll reproduce the entire FAQ below for your perusal:</p>

<p>So, it seems NOA tried to head the big questions off at the pass.</p>
<p>With the games priced at £16.99 / $19.99 each, and with all those separately listed language variants opening further possibilities for confusion, it seems wise to answer the biggest head-scratchers before a barrage of clarification requests from press and fans alike. The language version thing, in particular, seems more complicated than necessary, but hey, we'd expect no less.</p>
<p><em>Has NOA answered your main questions here? Let us know below if you're looking forward to a return trip to Kanto on Switch next week.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Omega Strikers </em>developer Odyssey Interactive has become the latest studio to be hit by layoffs, with around 50% of the studio's workforce apparently affected.</p><p>That's according to <a href="https://x.com/TotoroIsMyHomie/status/2024579265283706938" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a post</a> by (now-former) Odyssey Interactive artist Jordan Ewing, who says that he, along with "roughly 50% of the team", has been let go. Odyssey itself doesn't appear to have officially confirmed the layoffs anywhere.</p><p>You might recognize Odyssey Interactive's name from "footbrawler" <em>Omega Strikers</em>, which was released in September 2022. Just eight months or so after its launch, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/omega-strikers-will-cease-content-development-8-months-after-release-as-studio-moves-on" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1dfc6fb0-f5c9-4964-89dd-62b8efda69aa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">active content development on <em>Omega Strikers </em>was halted</a>, and the studio pivoted to other projects instead.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Odyssey Interactive is best known for <em>Omega Strikers</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Upon the cessation of regular updates for <em>Omega Strikers</em>, Odyssey pledged to keep the game's servers open so players could continue to play. A quick look at the game's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1869590/charts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steam charts</a> shows a 24-hour peak of just over 200 players.</p><p>To date, <em>Omega Strikers </em>remains Odyssey Interactive's only released game. In September 2024, the developer revealed a platform fighter called <em>Byte Breakers</em>, holding playtesting on Steam despite the admission that the studio "might not even make this game".</p><p>At time of writing, the announcement of <em>Byte Breakers</em>' playtest remains the last video uploaded to the Odyssey YouTube channel, and the status of the project is unknown, although these layoffs don't exactly instil confidence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Odyssey is just the latest in an increasingly long string of developers and publishers to be hit by layoffs. In recent months alone, others include <em>Splinter Cell </em>remake developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="62d2788d-7dd8-425b-8a67-fe5154e140d9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft Toronto</a>, Riot Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2xko-layoffs-riot" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="156c400e-add5-4e40-ad10-9f36c14e77e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>2XKO </em>team</a>, and <em>Ashes of Creation</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ashes-of-creation-layoffs-canceled-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1b59358e-2c0a-4543-a759-154075e27078" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Intrepid Studios</a>.</p><p>The market for competitive live-service games is growing increasingly fierce and cutthroat, and it's becoming more and more common for smaller studios like Odyssey (or, indeed, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/highguard-developer-wildlight-reportedly-lays-off-most-staff" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="662d78d2-0c4f-4bac-903f-7998daba8b76" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Highguard </em>developer Wildlight</a>) to slip through the cracks.</p><p>For now, it seems like Odyssey Interactive remains a going concern, although I sadly can't imagine that the studio has too bright a future ahead of it without a major success under its belt.

<figcaption><em>Burbank </em>was an attempt to reinvent the life sim courtesy of <em>XCOM</em>'s Jake Solomon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Solomon describes <em>Burbank </em>as "life sims + <em>The Truman Show</em>", but he also says the project was "more than that", allowing players to "share whatever stories and characters they can dream up".</p><p>He also confirms that the studio was using generative AI for characters' "memory, reasoning, and speech", which would have been central to <em>Burbank</em>'s systems. However, Solomon says Midsummer "had no interest in replacing <em>any</em> (that's Solomon's stress) developers with AI".</p><p>Alongside Solomon, Midsummer also included luminaries like <em>The Sims </em>producer Grant Rodiek and <em>Marvel's Midnight Suns </em>lead engineer Will Miller. The studio had <a href="https://www.midsummerstudios.com/news/studio-announcement" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">already secured funding</a> for <em>Burbank</em>, so it's not entirely clear why Midsummer has shut down.</p><p>Sadly, Solomon's studio is far from the only one to close without releasing anything.

<p><em>Burbank</em>'s attempt to redefine the life sim genre also isn't the only one that's failed; while it's much less high-profile than <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c822c0ba-3847-4141-97dd-732cffafcf52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Paradox's <em>Life by You</em></a>, it's another name to join that ill-fated project in the life sim graveyard.</p><p>Whether or not Jake Solomon re-emerges with another studio (or as a designer elsewhere) remains to be seen, but at the very least, <em>Burbank </em>is no more, unfortunately.

            <p>Every year, Pokémon holds a presentation to mark the anniversary of the original Pokémon Red and Green titles launching in Japan for Game Boy, and this year is no exception. One thing that does make this February's Pokémon Presents a little different, though, is that this year marks 30 years since Red and Green made their debut.</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company's annual Pokémon Presents broadcast has been confirmed to air next week, on Friday 27th February at 2pm UK time. For those Pikachu fans across the pond, that's 6am Pacific Time, or 9am Eastern.</p>
<p>As to what we can expect, well earlier today the company announced that the remakes of those classic Pokémon Game Boy games from 1996 will arrive on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> on 27th February. FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version - as these remakes are known in their Game Boy Advance versions - will be available exclusively to buy and download on Pokémon Day, once the broadcast has come to a close.</p>
<p>You can check out a little teaser trailer for the Switch editions of Pokémon FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version below. Or, if you are keen, you can pre-order these games <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Pokemon-FireRed-Version-3031207.html">via the Nintendo eShop</a>, where <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Pokemon-LeafGreen-Version-3031289.html">they retail for £16.99</a>. </p>

<p>There's also the chance we will see more from Pokémon Pokopia, which is due to be released next month, on 5th March. Pokopia is Pokémon's take on Animal Crossing, and our Alex is already rather taken with the upcoming release.</p><p>"Mechanics I love mashed up with characters and a world I also have a great affinity for," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-hour-with-pokopia-suggests-itll-might-be-the-best-pokemon-spin-off-ever-and-its-more-viva-pinata-than-minecraft-or-animal-crossing">Eurogamer's Pokémon Pokopia preview</a>. " I haven't felt this way about a Pokémon game since Conquest, the 2012 strategy crossover with Nobunaga's Ambition."</p>
<p>We will also probably hear about some updates for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, Pokémon Sleep, Pokémon Unite and Pokémon EX Masters. Perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japans-pokemon-theme-park-is-opening-next-february-and-pikachus-popping-up-in-an-electric-pokemon-ride">something to do with the Pokémon park in Japan</a>? Our Lottie, though, is hopeful we will hear something about Gen 10.</p>
<p>What do you hope to see next week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Veteran game designer <strong>Jake Solomon</strong>, known mostly for <strong>XCOM: Enemy Unknown</strong>, <strong>XCOM 2</strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-midnight-suns-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a></strong>, announced the closure of <strong>Midsummer Studios</strong>. Solomon had founded the development team after leaving <strong>Firaxis</strong>. In 2024, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xcoms-jake-solomon-qa-building-a-narrative-driven-life-sim-game-at-midsummer-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I interviewed him to learn more about his next game</a></strong>, a narrative-driven life simulation for which he had already raised $6 million in seed funding.</p>



<p>Rather than going for a traditional sandbox-like approach in the vein of the king of the genre, <strong>The Sims</strong> from <strong>Maxis</strong>, the game was conceived around player-driven storytelling. <strong>It was a systems-based approach where conflict, relationships, and consequences would combine to generate compelling, episodic personal stories</strong>. Characters would have jobs, love lives, and competing desires, with failure treated not as a dead end but as a narrative opportunity, in the spirit of improv theater. <strong>There would be no game-over screen</strong>.<br>The game was designed to be <strong>open-ended and ongoing</strong>, with <strong>no fixed conclusion</strong>, and Solomon expressed hopes that a thriving modding community would emerge over time. It would have been a single-player experience only, built in Unreal Engine 5 with a stylized visual approach, deliberately designed to keep the team small and the production sustainable.</p>



<p>The closure announcement came directly from Solomon, who <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote a post on X</a> and also shared a brief Pre-Alpha footage of the game, which was codenamed "<strong>Burbank</strong>":</p>



<p><em>We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both. Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios, I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into. It's like "Life Sims + The Truman Show," but it's more than that. I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up. Burbank lets you do that.</em></p>



<p><em>We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we've never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that's special. What you're about to see is definitely pre-alpha. But this game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us.</em></p>

</div></figure>



<p>Solomon later admitted that <strong>Burbank's characters used AI for memory, reasoning, and speech</strong>, allowing players to create any characters they wanted and drop them into any story. The art, however, was entirely human-made.</p>



<p>It's yet another closure at a dire time for the gaming industry. Just yesterday, <strong>Sony</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong></a>, the maker of the <strong>Demon's Souls remake</strong>. However, Solomon's studio has perhaps more in common with the <strong>"extinction level event"</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/denis-dyack-defends-ue5-decries-state-of-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that was mentioned by <strong>Denis Dyack</strong></a>: the failed <strong>$2 billion deal</strong> between <strong>Embracer Group</strong> and <strong>Savvy Group</strong>, which <strong>flooded the market with prototypes of AA and AAA games</strong>, thus making it much harder for indie studios to get funding.</p>

We don't know what else might be revealed during that show yet.</p><p><em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen </em>are remakes of the original two <em>Pokemon </em>games; while you may remember <em>Pokemon Red and Blue </em>kicking off the franchise, the Japanese versions of the game were actually <em>Red and Green</em>, so the remake stays faithful to those releases.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Nintendo says you'll be able to trade and battle with your friends using local communication, too, so you'll still be able to collect the Pokemon that can only evolve via this method.</p><p>Whether or not <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen</em>'s Switch releases will support <em>Pokemon Home </em>remains to be seen, although I think it'd be a huge misstep if that wasn't the case. Let's hope you can transfer your friends to <em>Home </em>when the games launch.</p><p><em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen</em>'s Switch releases come amid a flurry of activity for the franchise; yesterday, a brand new <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-paldean-wonders-set" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee463c7f-df01-4445-8c97-75dc31184111" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">set was announced</a>, and a range of Lego <em>Pokemon </em>products were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-pokemon-fan-favorites-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="20154363-2140-41d8-aed8-9ac66d983fc8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">also revealed last month</a>.</p><p>Of course, there's also the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-leak" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3eeb790b-1baf-43d8-afe2-99182049c947" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">impending release</a> of the life sim <em>Pokemon Pokopia</em>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-leak-2025-gen-10-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5a709d9-d361-46d9-823d-aa0957eba8ed" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">mounting speculation</a> revolving around the tenth mainline <em>Pokemon </em>generation, which may or may not be revealed during the Presents showcase next week.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what else gets revealed during that Presents show, but for the meantime, <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen </em>launch on Switch on February 27th. It sounds like they'll be standalone releases rather than Switch Online goodies, too.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>Cue the release of a fresh early access trailer by developers Mega Crit, who've also penned a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2868840/view/538879349212840702?l=english">Steam post about the date reveal</a>. "Climb the Spire with a new and returning cast of characters, each with their own cards, motives, and secrets," they wrote. "Make allies of the most ancient of the Spire’s residents, encounter all-new environments, defeat formidable foes, and uncover fragments of the Spire’s past as you ascend it again and again.</p>
<p>"Also, while you can always choose to brave the ascent on your own, up to four players can now team up to face the Spire’s challenges together in an all-new co-op mode. Discover multiplayer-specific cards, powerful team synergies, and carry your friends (or get carried) to victory!" So, you've got a week and a bit to get a gang of mates together if you fancy giving that co-op mode a crack.</p>
<p>The likes of collaborative map-doodling and intense pointing battles over relics await!</p>
<p>Alec (RPS in peace) played 187 hours of the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a> over the course of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slay-the-spire-review">reviewing it</a>, betraying  both how addictively moreish it is and the fact he appears to have had an enviable amount of spare time on his hands.</p><p>"Traditionally, I look at a number like that and hate myself – so much time wasted pursuing incremental item upgrades in an MMO or Diablolike, or, God help me, watching pretend numbers go eternally up in a clicker game," he wrote. "A number like that generally means I lost myself to something unhealthy, like a toddler set loose in a ball-pit full of popping candy. And so I snarl at myself in the mirror, and swear myself off such practices for life. Until the next time.</p>
<p>"I look at those 187 hours in Slay The Spire and I don’t feel that way. I feel... pride? I think 'all that time, and I’m still not tired of this wonderful toy. Do it again, do it again!'"</p>
<p>Well, the time to do a spire slaying again is now nigh.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

<li>Animal</li>

<li>Nature</li>



<li>Game</li>

<p>The Special Edition includes two reproductions of the original Japanese GBA cases, and a rather swanky trio of laser-engraved glass balls with Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle inside. Putting these balls on their respective stand in the included display case, lets them light up in a fitting green/red/blue hue. <em>Oof</em>.</p>


<p>This release will be available from the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/9900000007430.html">Japanese Pokémon Center online store</a> from <strong>Saturday, 28th February</strong>. Both the FireRed and LeafGreen versions (the only difference being the contents of the download code) will set you back <strong>19,800 yen</strong> — which is roughly <strong>£95 / $127</strong>, <em>gulp</em>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, this is a Japan-only release, with TPC saying that it <em>might</em> be available at physical Pokémon Centers at a later date. So... still Japan-only. Hey, let's keep those fingers crossed for a Western launch at some point down the line, eh?</p>

            <guid>1441435</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, <strong>KOEI TECMO</strong> and <strong>TEAM NINJA</strong> announced that <strong>Nioh 3</strong> has already become a <strong>million-seller</strong> and is, to date, <strong>the fastest-selling game in the action RPG series</strong>. We previously had a glimpse of the game's early success in its concurrent player peak on Steam, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-here-and-in-just-3-hours-it-became-the-most-played-nioh-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which far surpassed its predecessors'</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Another side is the very strong critical reception, which is being celebrated with a dedicated accolades trailer that <strong>prominently features our own review score (9.8/10)</strong>. Earlier this month, Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-3-review-rise-of-the-shogun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained in great detail</a> why he felt <strong>Nioh 3 is the Japanese developer's best work yet</strong>:</p>



<p><em>Nioh 3 is the culmination of Team NINJA’s evolution. By masterfully blending the engaging exploration of an open-field structure with a deep, dual-style combat system that bridges the gap between 'Masocore' and character-action, it has evolved into a genre of its own. While technical issues hold the game back, it is the definitive samurai fantasy and a modern masterpiece of action design.</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Nioh 3 - Accolades Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-RMpMyfitco?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The only real downsides are the performance issues, although that's not exactly surprising given that <strong>KOEI TECMO and TEAM NINJA have historically always struggled in this area</strong>. In Wccftech's technical analysis and graphics tuning guide, Sebastian Castellanos <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/nioh-3-pc-graphics-tuning-guide-how-to-get-the-best-experience-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Frankly, Nioh 3 underwhelms when it comes to its achieved balance between visual fidelity and performance — and that’s disappointing for a AAA PC title released in 2026. Despite generally strong reviews for its combat systems and world design, the PC port still carries forward some of the same technical shortcomings that plagued previous Team Ninja releases: subpar optimization on both the CPU and GPU, and an engine that struggles to present a stable experience unless the game is locked to fixed framerates.</em></p>



<p><em>The Katana Engine’s sensitivity to non-standard framerates results in noticeable judder and uneven camera motion when your framerate isn't holding at a steady framerate figure, and many players are still reporting performance issues even on fairly powerful hardware. These issues are not minor tweaking details — they are foundational to the core gameplay feel, and it’s frankly unacceptable that a AAA 2026 PC release ships in this state, requiring players to lock framerates or rely heavily on upscaling/frame generation just to achieve a semblance of stability.</em></p>



<p><em>In short, while Nioh 3 unquestionably has depth and quality in its combat and systems, those strengths are strongly let down by a technical package that feels unfinished and insufficiently optimized. In the modern PC landscape — where much better-looking titles offer solid uncapped performance, smooth frametimes, and correct behavior with fluctuating framerates — Nioh 3 feels like a step backward. Until game updates from Team Ninja or community mods address these issues in a meaningful way, getting a truly impressive visuals to performance balance out of this game remains an uphill battle.</em></p>

<p>His name's Count Strahd von Zarovich and I hear his antics are fairly well known in <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Strahd_von_Zarovich">Dungeons and Dragons parts</a>. In this mod, '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/21485">Dinner With Strahd - A Curse of Strahd Story Mod</a>', this charming fellow invites Tav and their mates to his home in Barovia so he can quiz them about their brain tadpoles over tea and biscuits.</p>
<p>As part of this extra adventure, you can explore Strahd's digs in Castle Ravenloft. According to modder Ocelot, "over 600 fully voiced and animated lines of dialogue" await, as well as some battles and loot. There's also the chance to punch Strahd in the face at one point, and Ocelot's teased "something secret for the Strahd romancers". So, both camps of people who've long been fantasising about doing something to the powerful ancient vampire's body.</p><p>There are clearly a plenty of Strahd fantasisers among BG3's modding community too, since this Strahd mini-campaign is separate to <a href="https://x.com/ProjectStrahd">Project Strahd</a>, one of the many ambitious custom campaign projects for Larian's RPG which have been making some waves online for the past year or so.</p>
<p>Ocelot recommends installing Dinner With Strahd via <a href="https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager">LaughingLeader's Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager</a>. Once you've done so, the new storyline begins when you meet a woman next to a cart and ox in Rivington, the first region you pass through on your way to the city of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> in the game's third act. The modder's handily included one of their own tiefling bard saves at the start of that act in the mod's optional files, in case you lack your own and want to jump straight into the mod's quest.</p>
<p>They've also got plenty of plans to expand their creation in future, via the likes of adding more characters and rooms to Castle Ravenloft, as well as giving its vampires proper fangs.</p>

<p>No official details about what Pokémon Presents 2026 will include have been revealed, so this is just speculation and based on previous rumours.

            <p>Despite calling Bluepoint Games "an incredibly talented team" full of "technical expertise" which has "delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community", Sony has decided to shut the studio down.</p>
<p>Last night, it was revealed that Bluepoint - the studio behind the widely praised Demon's Souls remake and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted-nathan-drake-collection">Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection</a>, to name just two  - was being shut down by PlayStation. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint">Bloomberg</a>, around 70 employees will be impacted by the studio's shock closure, which will come into force in March. A spokesperson told the publication the decision was made "following a recent business review".</p>

<p>The move comes five years after Bluepoint Games released Demon's Souls as a launch exclusive for the PS5. Since then, Sony - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-demons-souls-remake-developer-bluepoint-games">which acquired Bluepoint in 2021</a> - put the beloved and exceptionally talented studio to work on a live-service God of War game, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">project it ultimately cancelled last year</a>.</p>
<p>A reported response to Bluepoint's closure by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloomberg-playstation-is-shutting-down-bluepoint-games-demons-souls-shadow-of-the-colossus-remakes.1440826/">Sony exec Herman Hulst said</a>: "As I mentioned in the December Town Hall, 2025 had some strong highlights within PlayStation Studios. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> launched to critical and commercial success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> further showcased our commitment to narrative excellence, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and MLB The Show continue to drive on-going player engagement and revenue.</p>
<p>"At the same time, we're operating in an increasingly challenging industry environment. Rising development costs, slowed industry growth, changing player behavior, and broader economic headwinds are making it harder to build games sustainably.</p>
<p>"To navigate this reality, we need to continue adapting and evolving. We've taken a close look at our business to ensure we're delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March."</p><p>Hulst said this decision "was not made lightly", before rubbing more salt on the wound by calling Bluepoint "an incredibly talented team" whose "technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community". Hulst closed by stating he knew this news would come as a blow, but he is "confident" in the "direction" PlayStation is heading.</p>
<p>"Creativity, innovation, and building unforgettable experiences for players remain at the heart of PlayStation Studios. We have a robust roadmap for FY26, with much to look forward to in the months ahead," he said. "Thank you for your hard work and continued support."</p>
<p>Personally, I find the closure of Bluepoint absolutely devastating, and a real loss for the gaming industry. Sony's decision to put a studio renowned for its acclaimed remakes on a live-service project raised many an eyebrow, not just mine, with more than just a handful of fans hoping the company would use Bluepoint Games to revive other classic games from within the PlayStation library, namely PS4's Bloodborne. Putting the studio on a live-service project felt like a waste of talent, and a clear misdirection for the team's strengths.</p>

<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live service games</a> over the coming years. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">then-Sony exec Jim Ryan said he believed live service games were a key part of gaming's future</a>, confident in PlayStation's live service push.</p>
<p>However, since then, the company has been pulling back on this vision, with several proposed projects including Bluepoint's God of War game cancelled.</p>
<p>Most prominently in recent years, Sony closed Firewalk Studios after its failed launch of live-service shooter Concord in 2024. Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PC and PS5 debut</a>, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch">lackluster launch and weak sales</a>. The game had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">in the works for eight years</a>, it had been said.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">ceased work on its live-service The Last of Us multiplayer back in 2023</a>, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">live service Twisted Metal project at Firespite was cancelled</a> in 2024. In March of that same year, footage of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">cancelled co-operative live service Spider-Man game from developer Insomniac</a> - titled Spider-Man: The Great Web - appeared online.</p>

			<p>You can tell that a medium has reached some form of maturity once things start getting meta and titles appear that draw attention to the process of being constructed and the dilemmas that are faced by their creators. Countless great modern novels and films that are as lauded as Citizen Kane are clear examples of this and, whilst not in the same league as these, The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest is of a similar vein. You play as a burned out developer who undergoes hypnotism in a therapy session only to find himself trapped inside his own creation, a search adventure game with procedurally generated layouts.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Prisoning: Fletcher's Quest | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aXqAy_wgqlw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The pixel-art aesthetic in Fletcher’s Quest is really nicely done and the various areas of the game look distinct whilst enemies and characters are well designed. Bosses are particularly memorable and everything benefits from a bright and colourful approach. Music is solid enough with a few standout tracks, again often in boss fights.</p>


<p>The game’s narrative is clearly nonsense and is all presented in a suitably tongue-in-cheek fashion. This is perhaps most obviously seen by the fact that the early rooms of the game have to be traversed not just devoid of weapons or skills but also of clothing. The pixel graphics mean that you are saved the detail of such nudity, whether you’d like it or not, but characters do comment on it. Your first mission, therefore, is to find clothes and a means of defending yourself.</p>


<p>While billed as a Metroidvania (I prefer ‘search adventure’ myself) the game actually reminded me more of classic home computer titles such as Jet Set Willy and Manic Miner. The flip-screen traversal and assortment of ludicrous enemy types brought me right back to my earliest days of gaming in the mid to late-1980s, but without the extreme frustration that accompanied those often nigh-on-impossible games. The main difference, however, is actually an unintended consequence of the choice to use procedural generation – rooms and areas are relatively forgettable, lacking the intricate design that the genre really requires to succeed.</p>
<p>The generated layout is completely functional with areas blocked until you beat bosses and unlock new skills, but many rooms feel interchangeable and the extreme frequency of save and travel points mean that backtracking is rarely required. Indeed, on the default difficulty it was generally quicker to collect items and then die to return to the last save point. As collection progress is maintained, the game seems to actively encourage you to avoid playing it. If I’m being generous this might be a deliberate move in keeping with the meta view of the genre, but I think it’s just another result of the use of procedural generation.</p>
<p>In terms of skills, you play through the whole game with just a pistol, and one that initially is a real pea-shooter. You can fire one bullet at a time and if you miss then you have to wait until the bullet disappears from view before you can fire another. This adds a level of strategy and reward for accuracy that does help to keep things interesting. As you defeat each boss you’ll be granted an additional bullet (a fact that I forgot, which made the second main boss unnecessarily difficult) as well as a traversal skill like double-jump and butt bounce.</p>

<p>As well as standard single screen platforming challenges, The Prisoning occasionally breaks things up with horizontal shooter sections and the final boss is an auto-runner minigame that treads a fine line between challenging and downright annoying. That said, given my first playthrough was under three hours, the variety is restricted by the short length of the game. This, again, helps to make the game feel like a lost retro title.</p>
<p>The four boss fights are the most memorable part of the game, not coincidentally because they are clearly the most hand-crafted moments. You’ll find yourself up against a giant robot, a skateboarding shark and more, with all offering distinct challenges and necessitating different approaches. The one that stood out for me was the shark, both because of the uniqueness of the antagonist, but also the slippery slope of forced humour it introduced.</p>

<p>The whole game has a lot of lol random’ humour that is very hit or miss. The nudity is the most obvious example but the shark boss features a lot of dialogue about how badly it is designed and frustratingly difficult it is. This kind of meta-joke is so often undermined by the content being as annoying as the joke pokes fun at. Admittedly this boss was rendered more challenging by my forgetfulness, but the battle goes on for a long time with you only having two hits before death.</p>

	<div id="gp-summary">
		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Prisoning: Fletcher’s Quest isn’t a bad game, and the handful of hours you’ll spend with it will certainly pass the time with a decent level of enjoyment, but there isn’t really anything particularly memorable here. The procedural generation means that subsequent playthroughs will feature slightly different layouts, though this undercuts the intricate level design that good search adventure games need. Coupled with the sometimes questionable humour and you have a title that can offer a passing distraction but won’t stay with you.	</p></div>

<p>Of course, TPC isn't celebrating any old birthday this year. 2026 marks the series' 30th anniversary, so we're cautiously optimistic that there might be a surprise or two in store for us during the show (alongside all of the usual app updates, of course). Gen 10 feels like a no-brainer, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">FireRed and LeafGreen</a> are already confirmed, but could there be <em>more</em>? Don't worry, we've got the clown makeup on standby.</p>

<p>Nintendo has announced that Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green will be released for the Nintendo Switch next week. </p>



<p>Fans have been eagerly waiting for this announcement for quite some time, ever since an insider <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-return-teased-by-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased their return</a>. However, we were not aware of exactly how the two iconic titles would return or on which platform they would appear. Now, an official announcement from Nintendo provides all the details we need. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/the-pokemon-firered-version-and-pokemon-leafgreen-version-games-are-releasing-on-nintendo-switch?cid=&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=vg&amp;utm_term=frlgnswitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> by Pokémon.com reveals when Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green will be released for the Switch. It seems the next Pokémon Day, which also marks the 30th anniversary of the franchise, already has its date set. Pokeom Presents will be hosted on <strong>Friday, February 27, 2026, at 6:00 a.m. </strong><span><strong>PST.</strong>&nbsp;Right</span> after the conclusion of this event, both Fire Red and Leaf Green will be available to purchase for $19.99 on the Nintendo eShop. </p>



<p>Both titles were first released for the Game Boy Advance in 2004, and now, more than 2 decades later, they are returning to the Nintendo Switch. The games feature the classic storylines of Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue that everybody loves, with Fire Red and Leaf Green introducing updated visuals and the Sevii Islands. Players can also look forward to trading Pokémon, battling each other, and more using local communication.</p>

<p>Coming next week</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has seemingly revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> for the Switch earlier than planned, as a whole bunch of eShop listings are now <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/english-pokemon-firered-version-switch/">live on the eShop</a>. <em>[Update: The reveal has now been officially announced - see the trailer below.]</em></p>
<p>Priced at <strong>£16.99 / $19.99</strong> each with a launch date of <strong>27th February</strong> (Pokémon Day, of course), the release has bypassed Nintendo Switch Online entirely, meaning you can own the games digitally à la carte. There will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-is-getting-a-stunning-special-edition-release-in-japan">a 'physical' edition in Japan</a>, although the game itself will still be a code-in-box. Nintendo of America has put out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-explains-why-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-arent-on-switch-online">a FAQ</a> saying that these games "will not receive physical releases".</p>
<p>Releasing FireRed and LeafGreen is a pretty big move to acknowledge Pokémon's 30th anniversary, much like the launch of classic titles on the 3DS almost 10 years ago for the 20th celebrations.</p>
<p>Each language version of the game is available as a separate download, so beware if you're pre-ordering on the eShop and get the language you want!</p>

<figure data-uuid="052e04d374646"><a title="Pokemon Switch eShop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/052e04d374646/pokemon-switch-eshop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The titles will be available shortly after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-presents-announced-for-27th-february-2026">a Pokémon Presents showcase</a> on the 27th, so we'll be sure to keep an eye out for any further anniversary announcements from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company.</p>
<p><em>For now, let us know in the comments whether you plan on picking up either Pokémon FireRed or LeafGreen (or both!).</em></p>

		<p>Having suddenly appeared on the Nintendo eShop, Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green are coming to the Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> next week on 27th February – that’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon">Pokémon Day</a>, which will have a traditional stream with new announcements, for which this was no doubt meant to be a surprise.</p>
<p>The games are priced pretty highly, set at £16.99 / $19.99, but also have the quirk of having distinct versions released for every language that they were shipped in.</p>



<p>The reason for this, per the eShop store page, is that “Because this version replicates the way the game was originally released, each language version is separate and there are no in-game options to change the language.” That’s an unnecessary complication for modern gamers, and honestly doesn’t make too much sense, but it hopefully won’t catch too many people out.</p>


<p>These Game Boy Advance remakes of the original game are rare enough to be prized possessions amongst game collectors, if you can find an original cartridge – it will be a great way to mark the Pokémon franchise’s 30th anniversary, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>The remakes updated the originals with the graphics of the GBA era – also making it so that Green was the pairing to Red, instead of Blue as it had been for the original western release – and added the Sevii Islands to visit, while bringing some other improvements like a contextual tutorial, save game recaps, and ties to the other Game Boy Advance and GameCube Pokémon games. Fire Red and Leaf Green also came with a special wireless adapter for local link play, and since wireless is now built into everything you own, this will also be supported on Switch.</p>
<p>Most importantly for the here and now, these games will have support for Pokémon Home added to them, so Pokémon caught in this game can be brought through to the newer titles.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Incursion Red River’s 1.3 Update Introduces Story Arc, AI Improvements, and More]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/incursion-red-river-update-story-arc/</link>
            <guid>1441387</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Incursion Red River is fast becoming a must-have extraction shooter. We’ve been talking about Incursion since it shone at Steam Next Fest in February 2024, and later that year, a massive update hit the game in development, blowing it wide open.</p>



<p>Now, the team at Games of Tomorrow has unveiled the incoming 1.3 update, which features a massive story segment bolstered by voice acting provided by none other than the BAFTA-award-winning Jane Perry. It’s coming globally on February 25th, and if you’re at all interested in this game, you’ll want to see what it includes.</p>







<h2 id="h-incursion-red-river-continues-to-grow">Incursion Red River Continues to Grow</h2>



<p>In 2023, Incursion Red River was known as PROJECT QUARANTINE, but a major rebrand overhauled the game’s identity and pushed it into the realms that we know now. In April 2024, the game launched in early access, and it has been under ongoing development ever since.</p>



<p>This new update, 1.3, is perhaps the most ambitious the team at Games of Tomorrow has produced thus far.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Games of Tomorrow revealed the 1.3 update has pushed them ‘to the absolute limit’, allowing them to ‘go beyond the boundaries originally set for the project.’</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’ve pushed ourselves to the absolute limit with this one…</p><p>With Update 1.3, we tried to go beyond the boundaries we originally set for the project and deliver something truly substantial.</p><p>With a full story chapter featuring 23 missions, voice by <a href="https://twitter.com/TheJanePerry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TheJanePerry</a>, and… <a href="https://t.co/36tLqEJMfY">pic.twitter.com/36tLqEJMfY</a></p></div>— Incursion Red River (@IncursionRR) <a href="https://twitter.com/IncursionRR/status/2024140999560147145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The 1.3 update includes a full story segment comprised of 23 missions, with voice work from Jane Perry, a legendary actor. It also introduces Solarint to the universe, hired as an AI programmer after his success on SP-Tarkov’s SAIN AI mod. The team wrote in a recent blog post:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>AI behavior has been completely rebuilt. It will feel fundamentally different to the enemies you will encounter in 1.2.</p>



<p>We are aiming for grounded and realistic behavior. Bots won’t be doing jumpshots or anything that a person in their situation wouldn’t plausibly do.</p>



<p>This first version is designed to be a solid framework to build off in future updates. That means it is not feature complete and some behavior is placeholder until the systems can be made to support it as intended. Even so, we think it will be a very compelling upgrade compared to 1.2.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This means that AI enemies have had their pathing, movement, tactical positioning, difficulty, and focus upgraded.</p>



<p>Incursion Red River is one of those extraction shooters that deserves way more attention than it gets. All-time, it peaked at 2,478 concurrent users on Steam, which isn’t at all indicative of the game’s quality. When we played the game during pre-release in 2024, we were pleasantly surprised at how well it handled.</p>



<p>It’s worthstressing that it’s a PvE shooter with cooperative elements, which isn’t typical for the extraction genre, and that’s perhaps why it hasn’t hit lofty heights <strong>yet</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[FURIA Has Stripped Entire Rainbow Six Siege Roster (Except for HerdsZ)]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/furia-rainbow-six-roster-dropped/</link>
            <guid>1441384</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FURIA has unveiled a major restructuring effort that has resulted in the removal of <strong>almost </strong>the entire Rainbow Six Siege roster. The only player to survive the culling is Gustavo ‘Herdz’ Herdina, the sole member to retain his spot with the organization.</p>



<p>The roster that was just dismissed was the former w7m team that claimed the top spot at the Six Invitational 2024, securing a $1 million prize after having dominated at the BLAST Atlanta Major and BLAST Copenhagen Major the year before.</p>







<h2 id="h-furia-s-rainbow-six-presence-drops">FURIA’s Rainbow Six Presence Drops</h2>



<p>FURIA is now sitting without a roster after falling out of this year’s Six Invitational in sixth place. The organization made it into the playoffs in Paris, but back-to-back losses against Team Falcons and Fluxo W7M were enough to eliminate the Brazilian roster from the running.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it was FaZe Clan, a <strong>different </strong>Brazilian unit, that went on to win the Six Invitational. It was a historic victory, as it cemented FaZe Clan as the first back-to-back Six Invitational winner <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>All eyes are now on the team that will be built around HerdsZ, the last player left on FURIA after the cleanout. That’s not all, though, as fans of Rainbow Six esports will be eager to see if the dismissed roster remains a squad and moves on to a new home together, just as they did from w7m into FURIA.</p>



<p>There’s now something of an off-season before the big events start popping up again. Our next BLAST R6 Major will land in May in Salt Lake City, which gives teams plenty of time to get their ducks in a row.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ve got any idea what will happen next with FURIA.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Congratulations, you’ve made it to the end of another tough week. Your reward for making it this far is another string of NYT Connections hints and answers. It’s not much, but it’s all I have! If you scroll down, you’ll get the NYT Connections solutions you need to solve today’s puzzle as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Enjoy your weekend! But don’t forget to stop back tomorrow for another guide!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-20">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 20)</h2>



<p>Here are the words from today’s NYT Connections puzzle:</p>



<ul>
<li>MAGIC WAND</li>



<li>ECLIPSE</li>



<li>TOP HAT</li>



<li>DONKEY</li>



<li>TIDE</li>



<li>PLAYING CARD</li>



<li>WEREWOLF</li>



<li>BOOT</li>



<li>SILVER BULLET</li>



<li>IRON</li>



<li>CHEESE</li>



<li>GREEN CHEESE</li>



<li>SOCKET</li>



<li>PANACEA</li>



<li>THIMBLE</li>



<li>EASY ANSWER</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Words you might link to a quick, simple fix</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Words you might link to the moon in some way</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Words that you’d associate with a game of Monopoly</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Words that pair nicely with the concept of ‘Jack’</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 20:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-20-985">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 20 (#985)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– EASY ANSWER, MAGIC WAND, PANACEA, SILVER BULLET</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – ECLIPSE, GREEN CHEESE, TIDE, WEREWOLF</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BOOT, IRON, THIMBLE, TOP HAT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CHEESE, DONKEY, PLAYING CARD, SOCKET</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>The 2D pixel beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_gaiden_rise_of_the_dragons">Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons</a> continues to add new characters, and in the "largest character update yet", it's now added four more fighters.</p>
<p>Each character in this free "<strong>Bimmy &amp; Friends DLC</strong>" brings a new face, new personality, and a new fighting style to the city - allowing players to experiment with "powerful tag-team" combos. Here's the rundown about and you can see each fighter in action in the trailer above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Armored Okada</strong></p>
<p>Despite being the Oyabun of the Okada Clan, Lady Okada faces constant discrimination from the elders. When a powerful threat emerged, the elders presented her with the sacred clan armor - a challenge disguised as support. If she triumphs, she earns their respect. If she fails, she proves them right.</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p><strong>Jackson</strong></p>
<p>A heavyweight boxer known for his lightning-fast jabs and devastating uppercuts. Once too strong for the ring, he grew bored of rules and regulations. Seeking greater thrills, he turned to the streets, where his power and skill made him a prized asset for every gang.</p>

<p><strong>Bimmy Lee</strong></p>
<p>Legends speak of a secret within the Sōsetsuken - a form that can only be mastered by two. The tale has been passed down for so long that few believe it, dismissing it as myth or joke. But could this be the proof…?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-league-of-legends-tcg-riftbound-has-posted-explosive-early-growth-since-launch-with-searches-surging-over-300">League of Legends trading card game</a> Riftbound's second set, titled Spiritforged, was released in the US on February 13. The newest expansion has been out in China for a couple of months now, and in the west for just over a week, sowe've seen a general picture of how the new cards are impacting the metagame thanks to two recent Regional Qualifiers in Fuzhou and Chengdu. With that being said, these are some of the best Spiritforged cards I think you should look into picking up now that the set is finally available.</p><p id="blood-money"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Blood Money">10. Blood Money</h2></p><div id="234747"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234747" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Blood Money</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At uncommon, this card is relatively easy to pick up at an affordable price as a single. This is a super cheap and efficient early removal spell to help you stay on tempo, and you'd be hard pressed to see Yellow decks like Viktor, Herald of the Arcane not running three copies. </p></div><p id="card-sharp"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Card Sharp">9. Card Sharp</h2></p><div id="234748"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234748" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Card Sharp</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Card Sharp is pretty versatile. There are a few Power hungry decks with Spiritforged, so being able to offset some of that cost with the Gold generated from Card Sharp and pressure with a 3 MIght body is worth considering. </p></div><p id="not-so-fast"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Not So Fast">8. Not So Fast</h2></p><div id="234749"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234749" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Not So Fast</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to the <a href="https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/rules-and-releases/riftbound-spiritforged-faq/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent errata to refexive triggers</a>, nerfing cards like <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/653046/riftbound-league-of-legends-trading-card-game-origins-icathian-rain" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Icathian Rain</a>, Not So Fast got significantly better. Before, you'd only be able to counter just one instance of damage, but now you can just counter the entire spell with Not So Fast. Definitely keep this card on your radar if you like Green decks. </p></div><p id="bellows-breath"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bellows Breath">7. Bellows Breath</h2></p><div id="234750"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234750" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bellows Breath</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Repeat mechanic offers a more dynamic way to interact with opponents. Bellows Breath is one of these, being able to clear a Battlefield of smaller units in the early game. </p></div><p id="trinity-force"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Trinity Force">6. Trinity Force</h2></p><div id="234751"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234751" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Trinity Force</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorite new equipments from the set, Trinity Force is one of the few cards that allow you to store extra points. I can see this making waves in Master Yi, Wuju Bladesman, as his Legend ability buffs defending units. In the Origins meta, the deck was great at holding to score points, and looks to be the same situation with Spiritforged. </p></div><p id="piercing-light"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Piercing Light">5. Piercing Light</h2></p><div id="234752"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234752" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Piercing Light</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Bellows Breath, this can be an early game removal spell for tempo, or an easy two-for-one later on.
