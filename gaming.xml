			<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/673123/ftc-drops-case-microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition">The Verge</a>, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has officially dropped its case against Microsoft over its Activision Blizzard King acquisition. The organization <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/d9412_2025.05.22_commission_order_dismissing_complaint_.pdf">filed a motion to dismiss the case</a> today, May 22, 2025, finally closing the door on the FTC's attempts to block the largest acquisition in video game industry history.</p>
<p>Microsoft first announced its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King at <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-has-been-acquired-by-microsoft-for-70-billion/">the beginning of 2022</a>, and by the end of 2022, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-microsoft-acquisition-ftc-antitrust-lawsuit/">FTC had filed a lawsuit against Microsoft</a>, and so began the long contest that has continued to stretch on, even <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-deal-free-to-proceed-ftc-pause-rejected-ninth-circuit/">after the FTC lost</a> in its one major change to really stop the deal from happening. At the beginning of this month, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/662883/ftc-appeal-microsoft-activision-deal-acquisition">lost a final attempt</a> at stopping the deal and has chosen to put its fight to rest.</p>
<p>"<em>On May 7, 2025, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, FTC v. Microsoft Corp...denying the Commission's application for a preliminary injunction to block the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. by Microsoft Corp,</em>" the filing reads.</p>
<p>"<em>The Commission has determined that the public interest is best served by dismissing the administrative litigation in this case. Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that the Complaint in this matter be, and it hereby is, dismissed by the Commission</em>."</p>
<p>Vice chair and president of Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1925660906702156072">Brad Smith celebrated the dismissa</a>l, saying "<em>Today's decision is a victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, D.C. We are grateful to the FTC for today's announcement.</em>"</p>
<p>After losing its initial attempt to stop the deal, Microsoft closed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King in <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-closes-68-7-billion-activision-blizzard-deal-after-nearly-21-month-long-odyssey/">October 2023</a>, but that didn't stop the FTC from trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-appeal-against-judges-decision-hoping-to-delay-microsofts-closure-of-activision-blizzard-deal/">break it up</a> after the fact. The organization also spoke out against decisions Microsoft has made since the deal closed, like raising the price of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-complaint-against-microsoft-following-game-pass-price-hike/">Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-layoffs-ftc-complaint/">laying off thousands of employees.</a></p>

                <p>With only three months left until the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-589435">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, Konami has taken to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wgH4szXiqU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> to share the game's opening movie. In addition to giving us a whole lot of new footage to swoon over, the three-minute clip also features a new recording of Cynthia Harrell's iconic ballad, "Snake Eater." And yes, she <em>still </em>absolutely knocks it out of the park.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wgH4szXiqU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4wgH4szXiqU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Though the song is fairly similar to the original recording, the overall mix feels a bit softer this time around, with the bass in particular standing out as less intense. The opening visuals, however, are substantially different. Whereas the original opening featured almost psychedelic visuals and was more enigmatic in tone, the new version focuses on showing off some of the game's most iconic moments, including a pivotal confrontation between Snake and The Boss.</p><p>That said, you can rest assured that one of the more beloved parts of the opening is being kept intact. According to the video's caption, fans will still be able to enjoy the "interactive elements from the original, included in the in-game version of the opening," such as using the analog stick to control the snakes that appear on screen.</p><p>Last August, GameSpot had the chance to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-stays-loyal-to-the-mission/1100-6526099/" data-ref-id="1100-6526099">the first few hours of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and found it to be a "relatively straightforward, modernized remake of the original" that handled the game's transition into 2025 with "a deft hand." The game is set to release August 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X | S, and PC.</p>

			<p><strong>Update 22/05/2025:</strong> Bandai Namco released a statement on its <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1925699586640707708">official US X account</a> regarding the Elden Ring movie, saying "<em>We're thrilled to announce that Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. and A24 are teaming up with writer and director Alex Garland to bring FromSoftware Inc.'s world-renowned video game Elden Ring to life as a live-action film.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>We're truly excited to bring the world of Elden Ring to fans in a new form, outside the game. Stay tuned. The path ahead is only beginning</em>."</p>
<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>A report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-directing-a24-movie-1236408999/">Deadline</a> has confirmed that the previously rumored Elden Ring movie with A24 producing and Alex Garland set to write and direct, is in fact real. No word on when it is happening, but Garland is leading the project with Bandai Namco set to collaborate.</p>
<p>The idea of an Elden Ring movie or TV adaptation has been brought up twice before by George R.R. Martin, who mentioned it <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-movie-is-being-discussed-says-george-r-r-martin/">early last year</a> and then again in <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-movie-or-tv-series-seemingly-being-teased-by-george-r-r-martin/">summer 2024</a>, though there's been no word on whether it was really happening or not.</p>
<p>Weeks prior to Deadline's report, a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-point-news-alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182531/">rumor appeared online</a> that it would be Garland writing and directing it and that the movie was happening, but the original source took down their claim that the movie was being made, and that Garland and A24 were behind it.</p>
<p>The original claim's removal led many to speculate that it was a false claim, though Deadline's report today seals that the report last month was correct.</p>
<p>Peter Rice, Andrew Macdonald, Allon Reich, Vince Gerardis, and George R.R. Martin will produce the film. It's unclear when we'll hear about casting and when the film will start shooting, or what it could be about, but the previous rumor claimed that filming would begin in 2026.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it'll be interesting to see how this adaptation shapes up. It's unclear how involved FromSoftware will be, and there are large parts of Elden Ring's story that are purposely left ambiguous. Your journey through the worlds that FromSoftware creates is always part of the larger story the studio is telling, but players who deeply love digging into the lore for all of FromSoftware's games know that, for as much as you can discover, there will always be gaps in what you can say happened for certain, and what the real 'story' behind the characters you'll meet and fight is.</p>
<p>Which is also part of the fun of the story in FromSoftware games, that you can imagine your own version of events for characters, even if their ending is laid bare to you with their corpse lying at your feet after you rest at a bonfire/site of grace. Whatever Garland decides his take on an Elden Ring story will be, it will undoubtedly be food for discussion online.</p>

                <p>After months of speculation, A24 has reportedly confirmed that a live-action <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a> movie is in the works. The project is said to be helmed by Alex Garland (Ex Machina, Annihilation, Civil War), who is set to both write and direct the upcoming film.</p><p>Though several outlets have speculated on the film's existence the past few months, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-directing-a24-movie-1236408999/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> reported it officially confirmed earlier today. In addition to Garland, a few other names have been attached to the film. Most notably is George R. R. Martin, who famously collaborated with Elden Ring studio From Software to help write the game's backstory. Meanwhile, Peter Rice, and DNA's Andrew MacDonald and Allon Reich, are all set to produce.</p><p>The news comes shortly after the release of Garland's latest film, Warfare, which was also made in partnership with A24 and has currently grossed over $32 million since releasing last month. It also comes just ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, an Elden Ring spin-off game that focuses on cooperative, PvE gameplay and it set to release on May 30.</p>

Offering support for thousands of colors and five different lighting modes, it should be a cool way to personalize this standard white gamepad.</p><p>Beyond RGB lights, this is a pretty well-rounded controller. You’ll get Hall Effect sticks to prevent joystick drift, two mappable back buttons, and an ergonomic, wired design that’s responsive and good for long gaming sessions. Of course, you’ll also get the new C button--allowing you to dive into Nintendo’s GameChat feature and hang out with friends. There’s even a 3.5mm jack and on-controller audio controls.</p><p>Since this is an officially licensed product, you’ll find Switch 2 branding on the face of the controller. Bundled with a 10-foot USB cable and a two-year limited warranty, it looks like a pretty great deal at $50.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Super+Mario-Themed+Nintendo+Switch+2+Controllers+Are+Up+For+Preorder&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-05-22+10%3A27%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-05-22+16%3A02%3A47&amp;fnarticle_id=6531752&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FdO3RM3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsuper-mario-themed-nintendo-switch-2-controllers-are-up-for-preorder%2F1100-6531752%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/clicks.trx-hub.com\/xid\/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Super+Mario-Themed+Nintendo+Switch+2+Controllers+Are+Up+For+Preorder&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-05-22+10%3A27%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-05-22+16%3A02%3A47&amp;fnarticle_id=6531752&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FdO3RM3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsuper-mario-themed-nintendo-switch-2-controllers-are-up-for-preorder%2F1100-6531752%2F&amp;event_type=click&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Super+Mario-Themed+Nintendo+Switch+2+Controllers+Are+Up+For+Preorder&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-05-22+10%3A27%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-05-22+16%3A02%3A47&amp;fnarticle_id=6531752&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FdO3RM3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsuper-mario-themed-nintendo-switch-2-controllers-are-up-for-preorder%2F1100-6531752%2F&amp;event_type=click">PowerA Switch 2 Advantage Wired Controller (Mushroom Kingdom)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Super+Mario-Themed+Nintendo+Switch+2+Controllers+Are+Up+For+Preorder&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-05-22+10%3A27%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-05-22+16%3A02%3A47&amp;fnarticle_id=6531752&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FdO3RM3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsuper-mario-themed-nintendo-switch-2-controllers-are-up-for-preorder%2F1100-6531752%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/clicks.trx-hub.com\/xid\/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Super+Mario-Themed+Nintendo+Switch+2+Controllers+Are+Up+For+Preorder&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-05-22+10%3A27%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-05-22+16%3A02%3A47&amp;fnarticle_id=6531752&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FdO3RM3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsuper-mario-themed-nintendo-switch-2-controllers-are-up-for-preorder%2F1100-6531752%2F&amp;event_type=click&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Super+Mario-Themed+Nintendo+Switch+2+Controllers+Are+Up+For+Preorder&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-05-22+10%3A27%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-05-22+16%3A02%3A47&amp;fnarticle_id=6531752&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FdO3RM3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsuper-mario-themed-nintendo-switch-2-controllers-are-up-for-preorder%2F1100-6531752%2F&amp;event_type=click">$40 | Releases June 16</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>All the other Advantage Wired Controllers pack in the same features as the White model--minus the RGB lights.

			<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/673123/ftc-drops-case-microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition">The Verge</a>, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has officially dropped its case against Microsoft over its Activision Blizzard King acquisition. The organization <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/d9412_2025.05.22_commission_order_dismissing_complaint_.pdf">filed a motion to dismiss the case</a> today, May 22, 2025, finally closing the door on the FTC's attempts to block the largest acquisition in video game industry history.</p>
<p>Microsoft first announced its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King at <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-has-been-acquired-by-microsoft-for-70-billion/">the beginning of 2022</a>, and by the end of 2022, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-microsoft-acquisition-ftc-antitrust-lawsuit/">FTC had filed a lawsuit against Microsoft</a>, and so began the long contest that has continued to stretch on, even <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-deal-free-to-proceed-ftc-pause-rejected-ninth-circuit/">after the FTC lost</a> in its one major change to really stop the deal from happening. At the beginning of this month, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/662883/ftc-appeal-microsoft-activision-deal-acquisition">lost a final attempt</a> at stopping the deal and has chosen to put its fight to rest.</p>
<p>"<em>On May 7, 2025, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, FTC v. Microsoft Corp...denying the Commission's application for a preliminary injunction to block the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. by Microsoft Corp,</em>" the filing reads.</p>
<p>"<em>The Commission has determined that the public interest is best served by dismissing the administrative litigation in this case. Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that the Complaint in this matter be, and it hereby is, dismissed by the Commission</em>."</p>
<p>Vice chair and president of Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1925660906702156072">Brad Smith celebrated the dismissa</a>l, saying "<em>Today's decision is a victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, D.C. We are grateful to the FTC for today's announcement.</em>"</p>
<p>After losing its initial attempt to stop the deal, Microsoft closed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King in <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-closes-68-7-billion-activision-blizzard-deal-after-nearly-21-month-long-odyssey/">October 2023</a>, but that didn't stop the FTC from trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-appeal-against-judges-decision-hoping-to-delay-microsofts-closure-of-activision-blizzard-deal/">break it up</a> after the fact. The organization also spoke out against decisions Microsoft has made since the deal closed, like raising the price of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-complaint-against-microsoft-following-game-pass-price-hike/">Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-layoffs-ftc-complaint/">laying off thousands of employees.</a></p>

    <div id="main-content">
        

        <p>Sifu! Weird deliveries! Monster destruction!</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's a kung fu kind of week on the Epic Games Store, thanks its latest headline freebie: developer Sloclap's acclaimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, which arrives alongside several other free titles for mobile and PC.
</p>
<p>
In total, Epic is giving away three free games across PC, Android, and iOS this week, and they'll be sticking around for the next seven days. The full list looks like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sifu (PC)</li>
<li>Deliver At All Costs (PC)</li>
<li>Gigapocalypse (PC/mobile)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Sifu | Official Launch Trailer | PS4, PS5 &amp; PC" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SK89ZRPJXOE?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<figcaption>Sifu's launch trailer from back in the day.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK89ZRPJXOE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Sifu's the biggie, of course, even if it's not the first time it's been <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sifu">free on the Epic Games Store</a>. For those unfamiliar, it takes players on a cinematic rampage of revenge through the streets of China. It's a game of pulverising, cathartic martial arts action, with the twist being its protagonist gets steadily older each time they're resurrected by their magical pendant upon death, despite the world around them staying the same.
</p>
<p>
"An elegant martial arts meditation on temporality and self-possession", is what Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirwell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-review">said in his Sifu review back in 2022</a>, and given all the improvements it's seen since then, it's well worth the (free) entry fee.
</p>
<p>
Epic's other two PC freebies this week come in the form of the newly released <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/deliver-at-all-costs-a30c8d">Deliver At All Costs</a> - a game of bizarre delivery challenges across highly destructible environments, set somewhere in the 1950s - and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/gigapocalypse-fdc53b">Gigapocalypse</a>. This latter title sees players customising their own giant monsters, Kaijū style, and then setting out on a mission of mass destruction developer Goody Gaweworks describes as "loud, punk, metal, anarchy and a lovely homage to the game and movie classics."
</p>
<p>
Gigapocalypse is also currently free for iOS and Android via Epic's mobile store, but you'll need to be in the EU to access it on Apple devices.
</p>
<p>
All the above are available to download and keep via the Epic Games Store right now and will remain so until next Thursday, 29th May. After that, a fresh batch of (still mysterious) freebies will take their place.

But now, Valve <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1B71-EDF2-EB6D-2BB3">explicitly provides instructions</a> for getting that image working on a Legion Go or ROG Ally, even as it warns that “support for all devices that is not officially ‘Powered by SteamOS’ is not final.”</p><p>But even if you don’t care about rival handhelds, SteamOS 3.7.8 has a <em>lot</em> of improvements for the Steam Deck. I’ve been asking Valve to let me use my Bluetooth earbuds’ microphone since <em>launch</em>, and it’s finally happening in desktop mode (sadly not gaming mode yet) thanks to HFP/HSP profiles. You can turn on your Steam Deck LCD from across the room with a Bluetooth controller, a feature previously exclusive to the OLED model, which comes in handy when you’re docked to a TV.</p><p>Speaking of leaving it docked, you can now set a Battery Charge Limit to 80 percent for longevity’s sake if your handheld is always plugged in, frame-limit variable refresh rate displays, and control the P-state frequency of certain AMD CPUs.</p><p>It’s all underpinned by new versions of Arch Linux, new Mesa graphics drivers, a much newer version of the Plasma desktop mode, and more. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1675200%2Fview%2F820329049655084700" rel="sponsored">Here’s the full SteamOS 3.7.8 changelog</a>.</p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamos%2F" rel="sponsored">An updated SteamOS FAQ</a> seems to suggest that Valve is ready to expand SteamOS beyond Lenovo and the Steam Deck. “We’re currently working with select partners on officially licensed Powered by SteamOS devices. Please reach out to us at <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=mailto%3Apoweredbysteamos%40valvesoftware.com">poweredbysteamos@valvesoftware.com</a> for more information about licensing SteamOS for your device,” one answer reads.</p><p>But the industry is still waiting for Valve’s other shoe(s) to drop. Rumors are still heating up that we’re close to the launch of Valve’s wireless VR headset “Deckard,” and that it might be pointing the way toward a SteamOS-powered living room console too. Valve has been moving slow and steady, but it seems like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">a master plan for Steam Machines could finally be coming into focus</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The FTC filed an order to dismiss its complaint on Thursday, just days after it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/662883/ftc-appeal-microsoft-activision-deal-acquisition">lost an appeal</a> for a preliminary injunction to prevent Microsoft from finalizing its acquisition.</p><p>“The Commission has determined that the public interest is best served by dismissing the administrative litigation in this case,“ says the FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/d9412_2025.05.22_commission_order_dismissing_complaint_.pdf">in its filing</a>. The filing brings an end to the FTC’s fight to try and block Microsoft’s $68.7 billion deal, nearly two years after it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/12/23758194/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-complaint-block-acquisition-call-of-duty">originally sought</a> a temporary restraining order and injunction from a US federal district court.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/11/23779039/microsoft-activision-blizzard-ftc-trial-win">won its FTC fight</a> to buy Activision Blizzard in July 2023, and the deal was completed several months later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">in October</a>, nearly two years after the acquisition was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch">first announced</a>. The FTC had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/12/23791274/ftc-microsoft-activision-blizzard-appeal">appealed the ruling</a> nearly two years ago, but an appeals court panel affirmed the denial of an injunction <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/662883/ftc-appeal-microsoft-activision-deal-acquisition">earlier this month</a>.</p><p>“Today’s decision is a victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, DC,” says Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith. “We are grateful to the FTC for today’s announcement.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Unfortunately, 'bricking' personal devices to limit users’ rights and control their behavior is nothing new," Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Victoria Noble told Ars Technica. "It would likely take selective enforcement to rise to a problematic level [in court]," attorney Richard Hoeg said.</p>
<p>Last year, a collection of 17 consumer groups <a href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/research/group-letter-ftc-software-tethering">urged the Federal Trade Commission</a> to take a look at the way companies use the so-called practice of "software tethering" to control a device's hardware features after purchase. Thus far, though, the federal consumer watchdog has <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/closing_letters/nid/160707nestrevolvletter.pdf">shown little interest</a> in enforcing complaints against companies that do so.</p>
<p>"Companies should not use EULAs to strip people of rights that we normally associate with ownership, like the right to tinker with or modify their own personal devices," Noble told Ars. "[Console] owners deserve the right to make otherwise legal modifications to their own devices without fear that a company will punish them by remotely bricking their [systems]."</p>
<h2>The court of public opinion</h2>
<p>In the end, these kinds of draconian bricking clauses may be doing their job even if the console makers involved don't invoke them. "In practice, I expect this kind of thing is more about scaring people away from jailbreaking and modifying their systems and that Nintendo is unlikely to go about bricking large volumes of devices, even if they technically have the right to," Loiterman said.</p>
<p>"Just because they put a remedy in the EULA doesn’t mean they will certainly use it either," attorney Mark Methenitis said. "My suspicion is this is to go after the people who eventually succeeded in jailbreaking the original Switch and try to prevent that for the Switch 2."</p>
<p>The threat of public backlash could also hold the console makers back from limiting the offline functionality of any hacked consoles. After citing public scrutiny that companies like <a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/tesla-remotely-removes-autopilot-features-from-customer-1841472617/">Tesla</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/keurig-stock-drops-10-percent-says-it-was-wrong-about-drm-coffee-pods/">Keurig</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/01/john-deere-relents-says-farmers-can-fix-their-own-tractors-after-all/">John Deere</a> faced for limiting hardware via software updates, Methenitis said that he "would imagine Nintendo would suffer similar bad publicity if they push things too far."</p>
<p>That said, legal capacities can sometimes tend to invite their own use. "If the ability is there, someone will want to 'see how it goes.'" Hoeg said.</p>

The Six One Indie Showcase is a bit of a new kid on the block when it comes to video game presentations, but it's certainly working hard to justify itself. Early today the latest showcase was held showing off a huge range of indies, 48 in total, some of them being brand new reveals, others smaller showcases.

<p>
There's honestly too many showcases around these days, to see a show with a lot of games that made me go "oh I'm going to put that on my wishlist" is a treat. So, here's just a few I think you should check out, because I'm just one freelancer on the night shift and I can't do them all, but I'd like you to take a look anyway.
</p>
<p>
First up was a proper reveal of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3239830">Truth Scrapper</a>, the next games from the dev behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-stars-and-time">In Stars and Time</a>. This one's a scrapbooking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-visual-novels-on-pc">visual novel</a> where your memories reset every day, but there's a mystery that you need to solve. Did I mention there's toxic lesbians? Instant winner.

<p>
I've had my eye on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864000/Artis_Impact/">Artis Impact</a> for a little while now, an incredibly stylish pixelart turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> set in a world overrun by AI. Sounds a bit too relatable right now, but I'm still in.

<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1141260/1000_Deaths_Thousand_Deaths/">1000 Deaths</a> is a "gravity-bending 3D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> where your choices matter", and also a game that looks like graphics card box art from the '90s and 2000s. To be clear, this is the highest of compliments I can hand out.

Okay, this one isn't a game per se, but it does also involve the number 1000. Last year's seminal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/1000xresist">1000xRESIST</a> is getting a <a href="https://www.veryokvinyl.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoq3PvLKTRCWUK91CwpewlE4CQNnP7ZMmMReUMB9c6eXcMP0Ktst">ridiculously gorgeous looking vinyl</a> set that comes in two versions - one with one set of sisters, one with another. The recent fanzine for the game (which you can download for free on <a href="https://0x0ada.itch.io/blue-communion">itch.io</a>) is getting a physical edition too!

<p>
Then we've got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3414580/Forbidden_Solitaire/">Forbidden Solitaire</a>, a "card-slashing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game about unearthing the contents of a cryptic 1995 CD-ROM that should have never existed." This one's for the card game weirdos (I am card game weirdos).

<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2946390/Jump_the_Track/">Jump the Track</a> mixes choice based visual novels with pachinko, following an ambitious slacker called Sam who doesn't understand why we're supposed to spend our lives working awful jobs while the rich get to live it up.

I think you just need to watch the trailer for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2727660/GlitchSPANKR/">GlitchSPANKR</a>, I think any approach I take to explaining it will get it wrong.
</p>

<p>
And then there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2681870/Kidbash_Super_Legend/">Kidbash: Super Legend</a>, a very charming and nostalgic-looking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> action-platformer set in a "world of forgotten game characters as a hero with no memory of his past."

The Six One Indie Showcase really did just have what looked like banger after banger, it'll be worth your time to go and <a href="https://youtu.be/adI4uizTYN4?si=VLceKYiRPwY-JyPj">watch the full thing</a> and get wishlisting anything else that catches your eye.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-review-in-progress.1196964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The first item I ever picked up in Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon that wasn’t clothing or weapons was smut. I know what you’re thinking. “Will, you degenerate, <em>of course</em> it was smut. We know all about you, bro.” Listen. I didn’t know it was smut. But I learned <em>real quick</em>. I found it in what looked like the guard’s break area after I was busted out of my cell. I don’t remember what happened next; there was a drawing of a very pretty woman, and then I read the phrase “love apples” and blacked out. But I’m getting ahead of myself – let me back up a bit and tell you about my experience with this fun but familiar open-world RPG so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon is a reimagining of Arthurian myth. When his homeland is overwhelmed by a plague known as the Red Death, Arthur leads his people to Avalon, conquers the island, and (with Merlin’s help) cleanses the land of the Wyrdness – a chaotic, primordial force capable of reshaping the landscape and the beings in it. That was 600 years ago. Now, the old legends are gone, the Wyrdness has creeped back into Avalon, and the Red Death has returned. You play as a no-name prisoner of the Red Priests, who are desperately searching for a cure. It's a cool setup, and one that gives you everything you need to know while preserving Fall of Avalon’s greater mysteries.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After a brief cutscene that lays all of this out, you’re dropped into a character creator. What’s here is fine, but it’s kind of hard to make a character that looks particularly good, mostly because everyone’s skin looks like it was made out of Play-Doh. Everything else about the process is fine, though, and certain things, like the hair, are really impressive. Besides, you’re going to spend basically all of Fall of Avalon in first-person anyway, unless you opt for the optional and (by the developer’s own admission) not-very-polished-and-mostly-intended-for-accessibility third-person mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’re done creating your doughy hero, you’re dropped into a jail cell. Now, if you’re a person who has only ever played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>, you’re probably getting huge Oblivion vibes from this. Fall of Avalon does clearly owe a debt to The Elder Scrolls throughout, but don’t let that sense of familiarity fool you — it’s definitely a game with its own ideas. One thing I appreciated was the decision to have your character’s starting stats allocated by how you respond to an interrogation by a guard. I wanted to specialize in ranged combat with a trusty bow and arrow, so I told him I was hunting before being taken in, and then I used what I bagged to make clothes. That meant boosts to the associated stats. I wasn’t even out of prison yet, and I was already making something of myself. Who says rehabilitation doesn’t work?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As far as first-person melee combat goes, this feels pretty good.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not going to spoil how you get out of your cell, but you do get out (I like to think of it as time off for good behavior), and the first tooltip I got as I navigated the prison told me how to parry. An ominous sign, to be sure, but as far as first-person melee combat goes, Fall of Avalon feels pretty good. Hits have weight and impact, and when you block an attack, you’ll often stagger a bit. Even weapon choices matter. I used a club early on, but once I got my first knife, I could immediately feel the difference when I hit some poor guy. Less impact, but a very nice slicing sound. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I haven’t landed a single parry yet (the window is pretty tight, or at least it feels that way to me), but I’m glad that I really haven’t <em>had </em>to so far either. Blocking works just fine and you’ve got a nice backstep if you need to quickly disengage. This combat probably isn’t going to win any awards for re-defining what first-person RPG fights look like (although hey, I’m early, who knows?), but it’s engaging enough to keep my attention.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon 1.0 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, a lot of the 5 hours I’ve played of Fall of Avalon so far has been spent exploring, accidentally picking up smut, talking to people, and so on. This is a pick up everything, speak to everybody, the world exists to be your playground kind of game, and if you’ve played The Elder Scrolls, you’ll probably be right at home. Yes, I need to pick up that bucket, and the one next to it. Why wouldn’t I? I might <em>need it</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m still very early in Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon. This is a <em>big</em> RPG, and I have a lot more to see and do before my final review, but I dig what’s here as someone who’d read way too much Arthurian literature. Nothing I’ve seen really feels incredibly unique yet, but what’s here is at least <em>interesting. </em>Now I just have to avoid killer rabbits. I’ll bet you anything there’s one around here somewhere.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The dark sci-fi spin on a typing teacher was shadow-dropped during a series of announcements made during the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4A1s4DH78w">Warhammer Skulls Showcase</a>. Also shown was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG19wrCGR5g">trailer for <em>Boltgun 2</em></a>, a sequel to Auroch Digital’s first-person shooter the new typing game is based on.</p><p><em>Words of Vengeance </em>follows in the footsteps of games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/30/5046068/play-this-typing-of-the-dead-overkill-sequel-released">Typing of the Dead</a></em> where you type on-screen prompts as quickly and as accurately as you can to defeat enemies and progress in on-rails levels. It’s set in the world of <em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em> and uses the same pixelated 3D aesthetic with plenty of blood and violence, except the blood is spilled by typing.</p><p>As a fan of mechanical keyboards, I personally love occasionally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23623723/touch-typing-keyboard-home-row-qwerty-dvorak-colemak-how-to">firing up typing tests</a> to hear what the latest keyboard I’m obsessing over sounds and feels like. But as much as I love <a href="http://monkeytype.com/">Monkeytype</a> or <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">Keybr</a>, an actual typing game offers a different kind of fun. The thought of going full boomer-shooter with my proper grammar and punctuation exercises just has me more stoked than ever. Plus, it’s free. </p><p>Brother! It’s time to get those fingers moving. More blood for the blood god!</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to Ultron, a new playable character, there's a new map, a new limited-time mode, and a ton of balance changes.</p><p>Despite his character history of destruction and conquest, Ultron is a strategist, Marvel Rivals' healer class. He's also the first healer who can fly, placing him among the ranks of characters like Human Torch and Iron Man. Based on what we can see in the trailer, his primary fire is a laser that ends with a burst of damage, and he can both heal allies and grant them shield.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YUSbKQO674w"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YUSbKQO674w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Ultron will be accompanied by a new map, Arakko. "Once Krakoa's sister island, Arakko has lost all its vitality," creative director Guanguang says in the video update. It's been overrun by a somehow-even-more-evil version of Ultron after he combined himself with Cerebro to become X-tron.</p><p>A new limited-time mode called Ultron's Battle Matrix Protocol will be available on June 6. It's a single-player mode where you assemble a roster of computer-controlled heroes to battle enemies while you observe from the sky as one of Ultron's drones. By unlocking buffs and abilities, the battles can get wacky, as the video shows off a massive Venom, a rapidly firing Hela, and a Namor with an army of Monstro spawn turrets.</p><p>Season 2.5 also comes with a smattering of balance adjustments. Groot, Captain America, Emma Frost, Iron Fist, Human Torch, and Psylocke will all receive buffs, while Doctor Strange, Magneto, Squirrel Girl, and Punisher will all receive buffs. Meanwhile, Jeff will receive a "partial adjustment for a fresh experience," reworking several of his key abilities.

            <p>
As much as I'm up for trying a new one whenever one arrives, I'm not particularly good at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>. It just gets too sweaty for me, I prefer a good single-player shooter above all else because I can actually take down my opponents without the fear of embarrassing myself somehow. And yet here we are again, with the open beta for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a>, which started earlier today, leaving me thinking "well, I could give it a go I suppose."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, I haven't actually had a go yet because, well, I'm a bit busy letting you all know that you can go and play it, and what it contains. Gotta earn a living somehow. Anyway, there's a lot! The biggest thing is The Lab, which is essentially its new map creator that was teased in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-is-almost-ready-for-you-try-it-out-as-the-portal-with-actual-guns-shooter-sets-a-date-for-its-open-beta">initial open beta trailer</a>. This pretty much does what it says on the tin, i.e. you can build your own maps and game modes. Pretty great fit for a game that combines Halo and Portal!

<p>
Then there's the return of Takedown, a team-based mode where if you kill an opponent your team's respawns are shorter, but if you get killed your respawns take longer. If you manage to down every enemy at the same time, you win! Stadium 2.0, a rework of the map from the original game, arrives with the beta too. There's also new 24-player onslaught maps, for those that like a bit more chaos. 
</p>
<p>
Hunt the Devs will also be returning from the open alpha, which isn't a mode so much as an achievement to set out. If you find a 1047 dev wearing a special flaming disco ball skin, you'll get a Dev Killer skin for the faction they're playing in return.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/1047-games">1047 Games</a> say that "one more massive surprise" is yet to be shown off, planned to be revealed whenever the game enters 1.0. There's no date set for that just yet, but player progression will continue on to the full game, so don't feel like you have to wait around for it. To sign-up to the beta, all you need to do is head to the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/">game's official website</a>, and pick your platform of choice. Easy peasy!

But what there <em>isn’t</em> is a new <em>Mission: Impossible</em> video game, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-tom-cruise-movie-game-1850637210&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-tom-cruise-movie-game-1850637210">we’d like to hear someone explain why not</a></span>. It’s outrageous. The 1960s TV show has games. The first of Cruise’s movies, 1996's <em>Mission: Impossible,</em> has a game. (No Tom Cruise likeness <em>in </em>the game, though.) Why aren’t I playing the <em>Just Cause-</em>like game<em>&nbsp;</em>based on the franchise right now? I demand answers. But in the meantime, let’s look back at all the games that <em>do</em> exist, and wonder quietly to ourselves if that was actually a good idea.</p></div><div><p>The very first <em>Mission: Impossible</em> video game, albeit an unofficial one, came out in 1979. And no, that’s not a typo. Scott Adams (no, thank god, not the <em>Dilbert</em> one) and Irene Adams made a series of text adventures after being inspired by Scott’s colleagues who created the seminal <em>Colossal Cave Adventure</em> in 1976. Widely considered to be a joint founders of the entire genre, the Adamses made a series of text adventure games (what you kids now call Interactive Fiction) for the TRS-80 in the late ‘70s, one of which was originally called <em>Mission Impossible </em>(without the distinctive colon that’s officially in the title of the TV shows and movies)<em>.</em></p><p>Things were a bit of a wild west back then, given that there wasn’t really a vast home gaming industry. The game featured a spy called Phelps after the main character of the original show, who begins sat in front of a tape recorder containing a message that begins much like those on the show often did. “Good morning Mr. Phelps. Your Mission (should you decide to accept it) is to prevent this automated nuclear reactor from being destroyed by a saboteur’s TIME BOMB!” Perhaps it’s not surprising that the owners of the TV show  threatened legal action.</p><p>This led to all manner of names ending up attached to the game, the most common being <em>Secret Mission</em>, which was added to the already-printed boxes via a cheaply produced gold sticker. It’s something of a joy that one of the first ever popular text adventures should be such a brazen rip-off.</p></div><div><p>Tempting as it is to include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/ivHFP3dJAkM?si=g7NEpA5WDt7Zu3Bf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/ivHFP3dJAkM?si=g7NEpA5WDt7Zu3Bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the fantastic <em>Impossible Mission</em> platform/puzzle games</a></span> of the 1980s in this list, they don’t really count, though they <em>do </em>still feature the greatest somersaults in gaming history. So instead we jump forward to 1990, when the Nintendo Entertainment System was blessed with a game based on the short-lived 1988 reboot of the TV series. </p><p>This time we have an officially licensed game, developed by Konami, that was released just in time to mark the TV version’s cancellation after just 35 episodes. (The original 60s/70s <em>Mission: Impossible</em> ran for 171 episodes, with Leonard Nimoy appearing in 49 of them.) The IMF team is tasked with rescuing Jane Badler’s character, Shannon Reed, along with “Dr. O,” an IMF scientist, all through the magic of top-down 1990 action.</p><p>You could switch between three characters, Max Harte, Grant Collier and Nicholas Black, each with their own skills as they charged through Venice, Switzerland, and all those good Eurozone adventure locations. </p></div><div><p>It’s a year later, and there’s a second licensed game from the franchise! But this time, it’s a graphic adventure! This time <em>published</em> by Konami but developed by Distinctive Software, makers of many a TV/movie tie-in game, this was very much an attempt to muscle in on Sierra’s territory, complete with a near lift of Sierra’s distinctive row of interaction options across the top of the screen.</p><p>It was then made more complicated by playing in real-time, with four characters to control at once as you tracked down terrorists, bugged phones and infiltrated enemy HQs. Only Jim Phelps appears to have made it over from the TV shows, however, with new characters to chose from, including the extraordinarily spelt “Rodger.”</p><p>What’s so surprising about this game is that I’d simply never heard of it, despite being 14 years old at the time of its release and playing every graphic adventure I could get my hands on. However, its midi rendition of the theme tune really should have made it an all-time classic. </p></div><div><p>Slipping subtly past Micro Games of America’s 1996 dedicated handheld game based on the series, we next find the spies appearing in video games in 1998, with the Tom Cruise era of <em>Mission: Impossible </em>now underway. And it’s on N64 (and a year later, PlayStation). Sometimes known as <em>Mission: Impossible - Expect the Impossible</em>, this console game was intended to be a tie-in with the first of the Cruise-led movies. Except, keen chronologers will note, 1998 was two years after 1996.</p><p>This was originally supposed to be created by Ocean, a studio famous for its movie-based games. Think <em>RoboCop</em>, <em>Platoon</em>, <em>Total Recall</em>, and <em>Lethal Weapon</em>, all improbably realized as side-scrolling action games. That wasn’t the plan this time, however—ambitions were far higher. <em>Mission: Impossible </em>was an attempt to create something in the style of Rare’s <em>GoldenEye 007</em>, and, well, it wasn’t going great.</p><p>After three years in development, and the slow realization that the N64 wasn’t powerful enough for their plans, Ocean was bought by Infogrames in 1997, and a whole new team was assigned to the project. Apparently at that time, the game was running <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/03/18/men-on-a-mission&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/03/18/men-on-a-mission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at four frames per second</a></span>. Things were made harder by Viacom, owners of the film rights, refusing to let the game feature too much gun-based violence, and Tom Cruise refusing to allow his face to be in games The new team wound up crunching for months.</p><p>Yet, despite all this, it went on to sell over a million copies, even though its reviews weren’t exactly great. A late ‘90s <em>IGN</em> went as low as a 6.6, which was about as a low a score as the site back then would give. </p></div><div><p>It was four long years between Brian de Palma’s original Tom Cruise movie and John Woo’s somewhat unlikely follow-up. So it was that as late as 1999, the Game Boy Color’s <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game was still based on that first film. But this time it was as all movie-based games should be: an isometric action game. </p><p>Incredibly, this belated tie-in was the work of developer Rebellion, who that same year brought us the landmark <em>Alien Versus Predator</em> on PC, and are now best known for an infinite number of <em>Sniper Elite</em> games (as well as this year’s <em>Atomfall</em>). There were all sorts of ambitious ideas, including an entirely game-irrelevant Agent Action Kit that let you use your GBC as a calculator, address book, and a notebook that could print stuff out on your Game Boy Printer. Sadly, none of these were part of the game itself, which was deeply mediocre.</p></div><div><p><em>Mission: Impossible - Operation Surma</em> came out in 2003 on PS2, alongside a very different and much worse version on Game Boy Advance. It seems unfair to put them into the same slide, given they’re made by entirely different developers.</p><p>By this point, Infogrames had begun wearing the ill-fitting skin of the long-dead Atari, and like so many games of the era, had two lots of developers make two versions of a game with the same name. For the GBA, it was M4 Ltd, a small UK developer that seemingly only made GBA games based on existing licenses. So alongside <em>Antz World Sportz</em> and <em>Mary-Kate and Ashley: Winner’s Circle</em>, they also created the handheld incarnation of the movie tie-in.</p><p>Set between the events of <em>Mission: Impossibles 2 </em>and <em>III</em>, <em>Operation Surma </em>finds our espionaging heroes trying to stop the evil Surma group from releasing a virus called ICEWORM which can disable any type of security system. As you’d expect, you go all over the world in your efforts, although on the GBA version you do this in painfully static 2D, rather than in the PS2 version’s 3D action. </p><p>This version got an absolute kicking by the press, with <em>Cheat Code Central</em> stating, “I would have had more fun gluing spray-painted macaroni to my ass than playing <em>Mission Impossible: Operation Surma</em> on the GBA.”</p></div><div><p>OK, so this version was far better received, although not exactly widely loved. It was, as you can tell from the video, an <em>entirely</em> different game from the GBA incarnation. (As I say, this was common, but didn’t always end badly. The <em>Tony Hawk</em> GBA games, for instance, were masterpieces.)</p><p>A third-person action game, it was packed with missions, spy tech, and a big cast of characters. And, rather importantly, it was attempting not to recreate the plot of one of the movies, but rather to bridge the time between the second and third films in the franchise.</p><p>Developed by Texan team Paradigm Entertainment, who were best known for the N64's <em>Pilotwings 64</em>,  it was a perfect example of that most damned gaming territories: fine. It was fine. As 7/10 as a game can be. It tried to do loads, it had excellent ambitions, but it all just fell a little flat without ever being bad.</p><p>Yet, as Zack laments, it also marked the last console-based attempt to make a <em>Mission: Impossible </em>game. Why? Perhaps enough average-to-bad games had convinced Atari that the license wasn’t proving likely to get results? Or perhaps people were just fed up with Tom Cruise for being such a bloody spoilsport, and not letting his face or voice appear in any of the games. (Incidentally, Ving Rhames and John Polson showed up to voice their characters in <em>Operation Surma</em>!)</p></div><div><p>That’s right, we get near to the end of our round-up of every <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game ever with 2006's <em>Mission: Impossible III</em>, the mobile-only tie-in for the 2006 J.J. Abrams threequel. </p><p>Created by Gameloft, who have also brought us <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em> and <em>Sexy Poker: Top Models</em> (alongside the <em>Asphalt </em>franchise and a billion other mobile IPs), this game was only ever released for phones, as were numerous other licensed Gameloft games of the era.</p><p>Was it any good? I don’t know! It was released for mobile only in 2006! The game’s in portrait. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pocketgamer.com/mission-impossible-iii/review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pocketgamer.com/mission-impossible-iii/review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pocket Gamer </em>liked it at the time</a></span>, though, and while Carolyn here on staff hasn’t played it, she’s heard good things about a number of Gameloft’s mobile-only efforts of the era.</p></div><div><p>I don’t think anyone’s ever even heard of this web-only game from developers Funtactix, and having watched the video above, I think that may be for the best.</p></div><div><p>Glu Mobile’s 2015 tie-in <em>Rogue Nation </em>looks like a visually impressive gallery shooter, at least<em>. </em>In his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pocketgamer.com/mission-impossible-rogue-nation/review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pocketgamer.com/mission-impossible-rogue-nation/review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brief review of the game for <em>Pocket Gamer</em></a></span>, Ric Cowley says all that probably needs to be said about it: “If you stick with it, there’s a perfectly average game in here. But it’s so repetitive that you’ll have seen everything it has to offer in ten minutes.” </p><p>It’s now been over 20 years since there was a proper <em>Mission: Impossible </em>game for console or PC, despite the movies being such a massive deal. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-tom-cruise-movie-game-1850637210&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-tom-cruise-movie-game-1850637210">Zack correctly laments</a></span>, this is a series ripe for a fantastic video game. It’s somehow never received one. Perhaps making that hypothetical, great <em>Mission: Impossible </em>game is the most impossible mission of all.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ishizaki explained that Nightreign is balanced for people to play solo or with groups of three. With From Software spending so much time and attention trying to nail the experience for solo and three-player <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/" data-ref-id="2900-5361">co-op</a>, this meant two-player co-op wasn't considered.</p><p>"In putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect," Ishizaki said.</p><p>Ishizaki explained that two-player co-op is "something we are looking at and considering" for a post-launch update. Nothing is confirmed, however.</p><p>Also in the interview, Ishizaki discussed taking over the reins from Hidetaka Miyazaki to become the game director on Nightreign and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-reveals-the-advice-miyazaki-gave-him/1100-6531757/" data-ref-id="1100-6531757">revealed the advice that Miyazaki gave him.</a></p><p>Nightreign launches May 30 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC for $40. It's a standalone spin-off developed by From Software, following the <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1916855058097938564" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">gigantic success of Elden Ring.</a></p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-trailer-news-everything-we-know/2900-6095/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6095">everything you need to know about Elden Ring Nightreign</a>.

Even if you can't participate in one of these gatherings, however, you'll have a chance to join the festivities with <a href="https://pokemongo.com/post/global-events-gofest2025-overlays" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">three upcoming global events</a>, each of which is set to introduce a new Gigantamax starter Pokemon to the game.</p><h2>Serene Retreat, May 30-June 3</h2><p>First is the Serene Retreat event, which will take place from May 30 to June 3. Throughout the event, cute Pokemon such as Chansey, Cutiefly, and Morelull will appear in the wild and hatch from eggs more frequently. On top of that, Gigantamax Rillaboom will make its Pokemon Go debut. You'll be able to encounter the grass-type starter in six-star Max Battles from May 31 to June 1.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkTPlZ0GhY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JPkTPlZ0GhY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>Instrumental Wonders, June 7-11</h2><p>The following week, Pokemon Go will host an Instrumental Wonders event from June 7-11. As part of this event, Pokemon like Ferroseed, Galarian Stunfisk, and Falinks will appear more frequently in the wild and as Raid bosses, and Gigantamax Cinderace will make its debut in six-star Max Battles from June 7-8.</p><h2>Phantom Ruins, June 14-18</h2><p>Finally, an event called Phantom Ruins is slated to run from June 14-18. This event will revolve primarily around ground and ghost Pokemon. Monsters like Duskull, Drilbur, and Phantump will spawn more frequently in the wild, while Sableye, Greavard, and other Pokemon will be drawn to Incense. Gigantamax Inteleon will also arrive in Pokemon Go for the first time, appearing as a six-star Max Battle boss from June 14-15.</p><h2>Pokemon Go Fest 2025</h2><p>Pokemon Go Fest 2025 kicks off with a gathering in Osaka, Japan, from May 29 to June 1, with events in Jersey City and Paris scheduled to follow in the subsequent weeks. Tickets to attend these in-person events are available through the official <a href="https://pokemongo.com/en/gofest" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pokemon Go website</a>.</p><p>Shortly after the in-person events conclude, Pokemon Go will hold a <a href="https://pokemongo.com/en/gofest/global" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">global Go Fest celebration</a> from June 28-29. As with previous Go Fests, different "habitats" will rotate throughout the event, with certain Pokemon appearing more frequently depending on the habitat. Players who purchase a virtual ticket for the event will also have a chance to catch the mythical Pokemon Volcanion.</p>
