            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-muse-ai-gameplay-generation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has announced Muse, a generative AI model that can "generate game visuals, controller actions, or both". The company is calling it the first example of a WHAM, or World and Human Action Model.</p>

<p>In a post on the official Microsoft website, the company reveals that Muse was developed in conjunction with <i>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice&nbsp;</i>studio Ninja Theory. The model was trained on Ninja Theory's battle arena game&nbsp;<em>Bleeding Edge</em>.</p>

<p>A followup post on the Xbox website says Muse can "create consistent and diverse gameplay rendered by AI", which Microsoft calls "a major step toward generative AI models that can empower game creators". I'm not so sure about that one myself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bleeding-edge-microsoft-muse-ai.jpg?itok=5FC-wPky 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bleeding-edge-microsoft-muse-ai.jpg?itok=EuWjQAMN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft trained its new AI on the Ninja Theory game&nbsp;<em>Bleeding Edge</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In both posts, Microsoft gives some examples of the kind of gameplay Muse is currently able to generate. Honestly, I might just not be infected by the tech brain worms, but to me it looks pretty low-quality.</p>

<p>It's not just me, either; The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirms</a> that Muse is currently only capable of generating gameplay at a paltry 300 x 180 resolution, and not only that, but it's also limited to 10 frames per second. Find me a PC gamer that would be happy with those numbers.</p>

<p>I know, I know. The tech is still in its early stages, and I'm sure that Microsoft will be able to iterate on it in order to create a model that can convincingly generate higher-resolution gameplay at a better frame rate.</p>

<p>Honestly, though, I'm still left wondering what the point of it all is. According to Microsoft, it's all about "effectively support[ing] human creatives" and that potential applications include "the opportunity to make older games accessible to future generations of players across new devices and in new ways".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inzoi-generative-ai-krafton.jpg?itok=NnujBJSC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inzoi-generative-ai-krafton.jpg?itok=YO5dc2Vt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Generative AI is popping up in games like Krafton's&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>From a cynical perspective, though, I can only really see companies looking for ways to cut out human developers and replace them with AI processes once the tech becomes even remotely viable for doing so.</p>

<p>That's not to mention the <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">colossal environmental impact of AI</a>, which doesn't appear to be mentioned in either of the aforementioned Microsoft posts, nor (ironically) in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nature article</a> in which the Muse research paper is contained.</p>

<p>Still, if you'd like to read about Microsoft's new Muse model and get some of the nerdy details about how it works, you can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do so here</a>. There's also a less technical and more gamer-focused explanation <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on the Xbox website</a>&nbsp;if you prefer.</p>

The developers did not give a reason for the layoffs, which came as a shock to the gaming community because of Rivals’ evident success. However, in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, NetEase has clarified that the reason was organizational streamlining.</p><p>“We recently made the difficult decision to adjust <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game,” wrote Alex Armour, a PR representative from NetEase Games. “This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.”</p><p>The statement continued by reassuring fans that development on <em>Rivals</em> would continue with a core group of developers based in China. “We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game.”</p><p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/netease-is-unloading-its-overseas-game-properties-hurting-u-s-gaming/">According to a report in <em>VentureBeat</em></a> though, organizational streamlining doesn’t give the full picture of what’s going on, with sources claiming the real reason for the layoffs is that NetEase executives are no longer confident in overseas development teams. The success of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226834/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-impression-game-science">Black Myth: Wukong</a></em> has apparently proven to NetEase that blockbuster hits can be made cheaper and closer to home without the need for expensive overseas teams in Europe and America. </p><p>In a statement to <em>VentureBeat</em>, NetEase denied claims that it intends to retreat from overseas development and that the layoffs in Seattle only represent a small portion of its holdings abroad. “Our studios in North America, UK, Spain, and Japan all continue to refine and develop their ongoing game projects.”</p><p>NetEase declined to detail the exact scope of the Seattle layoffs which come just two months after <em>Marvel Rivals</em> launched to rapid critical and financial success with reports estimating that it raised over $130 million in revenue in its first month.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I can never remember the technical term for that wibbly effect you get in PS1 games when you sidle up to surfaces and look askance at the textures. I thought it was "dithering", but Brendy says that's not what dithering is you sap, you absolute dunce. If you know the answer, please educate me in a comment. But first, try Blue Wyrm.</p>
<p>It's a free first-person melee dungeon crawler from SaintPesticide. It's awash with rich, diseased shades of ruby, amethyst and malachite. And brother, it has not-dithering to spare. Here's a video.

In Blue Wyrm you play the Red Knight Gabriel, who is trying to rescue her wife, the Blue Knight Lucia, from a crypt populated by hissing marionettes, green diamonds and photon-spitting sentries. Gabriel is equipped with a sword that handles like an oversized ice pick, tinking off surfaces in a musical way. She can swipe left and right or stab forward by pressing the left, right and mouse-wheel buttons respectively. If you chain together all three kinds of attack in a single combo, you'll leach health from the body of your assailant.
</p>
<p>
This is vital, because Gabriel ain't so hot at defending. She's a fast runner and she can double-jump, but she can't dodge, parry or block. Or at least, these abilities were not available in the 20 minutes I spent with the Itch build, during which I spent a lot of time cooing over the fittings. Blue Wyrm is a gorgeous piece of work, the kind of lurid imagineering that blows the dust from senses deadened by overmuch photorealism. Calling it "PS1-esque" bleaches away the specificity. That said, I <em>really</em> need to see this running on a CRT.

<p>Elon Musk recently expressed his intention to ‘make video games great again’ on the social media platform he bought for $44 billion in 2022. It has been just a few weeks since Elon Musk admitted to cheating in games like Path of Exile and Diablo, and despite being a contributor to problematic areas of the industry, he now intends to found an AI-powered dev studio.</p>



<p>In a recent post, the ‘xAI’ profile invited users to email in to chase jobs revolving around ‘designing AI games first principles’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-potential-is-incredible">‘The Potential is Incredible’</h2>



<p>Elon Musk was aired out a couple of weeks ago for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-cheated-diablo-poe-admit/">cheating by sharing his accounts</a> in Path of Exile and Diablo. He didn’t care about the revelation going public, and now he has decided to single-handedly save the gaming industry, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891396362404565341" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaning on the quip</a> made famous by his new best friend, President Donald Trump:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s got to be done. </p>



<p>Make video games great again!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like Trump, Musk lacks originality in the attempted coining of that phrase. The billionaire tech titan made this comment in response to a post suggesting that he’s ‘fed up with woke politics and DEI destroying the games industry’.</p>



<p>And of course, these comments came days after Musk branded games journalism as ‘garbage’. And to think I once branded him one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-stream-success/">most successful streamers in history</a>!</p>



<p>Musk followed up today with <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1892087111055974879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another bold statement</a> on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Join us to make revolutionary video games using AI. </p>



<p>The potential for a dynamically generated video game using AI is incredible!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many users commented on these posts hoping that the use of AI would be confined to ‘backend processes’ to better automate a human-led development ecosystem, but that’s probably not the case. Elon Musk is no stranger to cleaning house and stripping teams down to the bare bones.</p>



<p>In an ideal world, the space-mad, eccentric billionaire would probably have Grok manufacture entire games at the press of a button. The scary thing is, that he’s surrounded by such capable people that it’s probably not too far from becoming a reality.</p>



<p>What do you think about Elon Musk’s desire to ‘make gaming great again?’ Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The WHAM, Katja Hofmann, Senior Principal Research Manager and lead of the Microsoft Research Game Intelligence team, said in a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, is a generative AI model of a video game that can generate game visuals, controller actions, or both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft calls this generative AI model Muse, which was developed by the Microsoft Research Game Intelligence and Teachable AI Experiences (Tai X) teams in collaboration with Hellblade developer Ninja Theory. It’s open sourcing the weights and sample data and making the executable available for the WHAM Demonstrator — a concept prototype that provides a visual interface for interacting with WHAM models and multiple ways of prompting the models.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company provided a number of gameplay clips showing what Muse is capable of. Currently, the model can generate “complex gameplay sequences that are consistent over several minutes” just by prompting the model with 10 initial frames (one second) of human gameplay and the controller actions of the whole play sequence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game used to train Muse was Ninja Theory’s 2020 multiplayer game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bleeding-edge">Bleeding Edge</a>. “We worked closely with our colleagues at Ninja Theory and with Microsoft compliance teams to ensure that the data was collected ethically and used responsibly for research purposes,” Hofmann insisted.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/wham-gen-2-1739980350168.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Muse was trained on Bleeding Edge, and early results look very close.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s been amazing to see the variety of ways Microsoft Research has used the Bleeding Edge environment and data to explore novel techniques in a rapidly moving AI industry,” said Gavin Costello, technical director at Ninja Theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“From the hackathon that started it all, where we first integrated AI into Bleeding Edge, to building AI agents that could behave more like human players, to the World and Human Action Model being able to dream up entirely new sequences of Bleeding Edge gameplay under human guidance, it’s been eye-opening to see the potential this type of technology has.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Muse is used in “world model mode” meaning it is used to predict how the game will evolve from the initial prompt sequence.

As video game development costs rise, publishers are increasingly looking to AI tools to speed up work and cut costs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic">Call of Duty reportedly sold an "AI-generated cosmetic" for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a> in late 2023, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash">fans accused Activision of using generative AI again for a loading screen last year</a>. EA said in September that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">AI was "the very core" of its business</a>, and just last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-create-hundreds-of-thousands-of-unique-ideas-needed-to-build-in-game-environments">Capcom said it was experimenting with generative AI</a> to create the "hundreds of thousands" of ideas needed for in-game environments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios Asad Qizilbash <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-exec-says-ai-is-important-to-gen-z-and-gen-alpha-gamers-who-want-personalization-across-everything">weighed in on AI to say its use in video games is important to Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamers</a> who seek "personalization across everything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For instance, non-player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal,” Qizilbash said. “This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft is all-in on generative AI, as anyone with even a cursory knowledge of ChatGPT and OpenAI will be aware of, and so this development with Ninja Theory comes as little surprise. Still, the company will face tough questions from some within the video game development community who are worried models like Muse will put them out of a job.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the blog post, Hofmann insisted that Microsoft's team “focus on exploring the capabilities that models like Muse need to effectively support human creatives.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I look forward to seeing the many ways in which the community will explore these models and build on our research," Hofmann continued. "I cannot wait to see all the ways that these models and subsequent research will help shape and increase our understanding of how generative AI models of human gameplay may support gameplay ideation and pave the way for future, novel, AI-based game experiences, including the use cases that our colleagues at Xbox have already started to explore.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has commented on Microsoft's relatively new strategy whereby it launches some of its first-party games on rival platforms, including PS5. For Microsoft, this is about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-no-longer-trying-to-move-ps5-players-to-xbox/1100-6529532/" data-ref-id="1100-6529532">making money and bringing its games to more people</a>. It's also a win for PS5 owners, according to Yoshida.</p><p>"I think it's a win for PlayStation owners; they didn't have access [to those games] before," he said on the Sacred Symbols podcast, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshida-xbox-games-on-ps5-a-win-for-playstation-owners/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by VGC</a>.</p><p>Yoshida was at one point managing Sony's first-party game production pipeline before he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-indies-job/1100-6529536/" data-ref-id="1100-6529536">switched positions to running the indies team</a>. When he was running first-party, Yoshida said it was a "nightmare" scenario for PlayStation to become "the minority platform" because that would make it "impossible to maintain the first-party development because the best creators would leave."</p><p>He added: "They are not just creatives, they are business people as well; they want their games to reach the biggest audience as well."</p><p>Microsoft, of course, is in last place as it relates to console sales among the big three, with PS5 and Switch sales outpacing the Series X|S. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently said he's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-no-longer-trying-to-move-ps5-players-to-xbox/1100-6529532/" data-ref-id="1100-6529532">no longer trying to get PS5 owners to switch to Xbox</a> but instead wants to bring more of Microsoft's first-party games to PS5 to meet them where they are.</p><p>Microsoft has been embracing a more platform-agnostic strategy for many years already but only recently has the company actually begun releasing more and more games for PS5 and Switch. For its part, Sony continues to focus on exclusives for its own platforms, while also bringing more games to PC, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/#2" data-ref-id="2900-6143">day-and-date titles for its live-service games. </a></p><p>One of the next big Xbox game to come to PlayStation is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which comes to PS5 this spring following its debut on Xbox in 2024. After that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> comes out in May for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, launching on all platforms at the same time.</p><p>The RPG Avowed from Microsoft-owned studio Obsidian launched on February 18, but it has not been announced for any platforms outside of Xbox and PC.</p>

                <p>Microsoft and Xbox have <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> their new generative AI model, Muse, which is the world's first <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">World and Human Action Model (WHAM)</a>. Muse's stated purpose is to help out studios by generating gameplay during the development process. Microsoft also claimed the technology might be capable of preserving long-unplayable games on obsolete systems.</p><p>It was trained using developer Ninja Theory's now-dormant and abandoned Bleeding Edge game. The developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-theory-drops-bleeding-edge-to-focus-on-hellblade-2-and-other-projects/1100-6486869/" data-ref-id="1100-6486869">dropped support for the game</a> back in 2021 to focus on newer projects. Ninja Theory partnered up with Microsoft Research due to their close proximity to each other in Cambridge, England. Muse used Bleeding Edge to learn about game physics and reactions to players' controller actions.</p><p>According to Xbox, Muse is used for gameplay ideation, and it's already being used to develop a real-time playable AI model trained on other first-party games. Xbox also mentioned how Muse could possibly take older games lost to time and older hardware from its first-party portfolio and optimize them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c15vxDHJ2lU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c15vxDHJ2lU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Additionally, Xbox claimed that Muse would help teams prototype new gameplay experiences during development and introduce new content. Xbox noted that it's up to its studios whether to participate in the use of generative AI based on their goals and vision, and acknowledged that AI won't be the single solution for every project.</p><p>For Ninja Theory, studio head Dom Matthews said, "It's not about using AI to generate content, but it's actually about creating workflow and approaches that allow our team here of 100 creative experts to do more."</p><p>The subject of AI still remains controversial. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">recent study</a> showed that a majority of game studios already use generative AI, but workers are concerned about how AI could impact their roles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">EA CEO Andrew Wilson</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">Microsoft president Brad Smith</a> have said that the rise of AI would displace workers in the short term but lead to more opportunities in the long term. (Although not tied directly to AI, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">Microsoft laid off more than 2,500 individuals</a> in gaming roles last year.)

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-sad-trombone<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember the Humane AI pin, which gave the worst people you know a small crisis back in April 2024 when a reviewer <a href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-marques-brownlee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gave it a bad review</a>? Well, it’s over now.&nbsp;</p><p>Humane announced <a href="https://humane.com/media/humane-hp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday</a> that it’s been bought by HP for $116 million, which will purchase Humane’s “AI-powered platform Cosmos, highly skilled technical talent, and intellectual property with more than 300 patents and patent applications.” Those people “will form HP IQ, HP’s new AI innovation lab focused on building an intelligent ecosystem across HP’s products and services for the future of work.”&nbsp;</p><p>If you are not an engineer at Humane who is going to become an engineer at HP, but instead an owner of the Humane AI pin, well, tough shit. Humane <a href="https://support.humane.com/hc/en-us/articles/34243204841997-Ai-Pin-Consumers-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promptly discontinued</a> sales of the pin, and after February 28 the pin will stop connecting to Humane’s servers and lose what appears to be pretty much all of its functionality except telling you the battery level of a device that doesn’t do anything. Humane writes that anyone whose device is within the 90-day order window can get a refund, but everyone else is out of luck. In response to the FAQ question “What should I do with my AI Pin once it stops working?” Humane encourages buyers to “recycle your Ai Pin through an e-waste recycling program.” If you want to use your AI pin to locate an e-waste recycling center, you’d better act fast.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172718/humane-ai-pin-selling-hp-rumor-1-billion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> notes that “The $116 million HP is paying pales next to the $230 million [Humane] raised since it was founded in 2018. (There was a rumor last spring that Humane was trying to sell to HP <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172718/humane-ai-pin-selling-hp-rumor-1-billion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for somewhere near $1 billion</a>.)” Going from buzzy tech startup to cramming AI functionality into printers that <a href="https://aftermath.site/printers-suck-so-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already barely work</a> is a pretty hard fall from grace,&nbsp; a fall marred by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24211339/humane-ai-pin-more-daily-returns-than-sales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returns outpacing sales</a> and a <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2025/Humane-Recalls-Charge-Case-Accessory-for-Ai-Pin-Due-to-Lithium-Battery-Fire-Hazard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charger recall</a> to boot. My first thought at seeing the news yesterday was that the remnants of Humane are now going to use AI to make my printer worse, a task I do not think is possible, but if anyone can do it, it’s them.</p><p>The early review controversy around the Humane AI pin felt like it centered around all of us regular people not <em>believing</em> in the product enough, not giving AI the benefit of the doubt its hucksters so regally believe they deserve. And in this case, we were right! Whatever marginal improvements the pin made after its launch, it was never a useful product that did anything near what it promised, and reviewers like Marques Brownlee were right to call it out. If there’s a lesson to be learned from this, it’s that we should point out when the emperor isn’t wearing clothes more often.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ll start: As I write this, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2025/feb/14/guardian-media-group-announces-strategic-partnership-with-openai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a> has entered into a deal with OpenAI, and The New York Times is <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/02/16/2025/new-york-times-goes-all-in-on-internal-ai-tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushing AI products on its writers</a> despite the fact that it’s <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/02/the-new-york-times-will-let-reporters-use-ai-tools-while-its-lawyers-litigate-ai-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still embroiled in lawsuits</a> over AI.

						<h5>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</h5><p><span>18 February, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Diving into <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-interview-discussing-the-setting-inspirations-multiple-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a> Part One "Bloom," I had a lot of high hopes. I love story-based games where you have to make decisions that will have consequences later down the line. The aesthetic of this game also really pulled me in. I love games that have that retro feel and are full of neon vibrancy that is reminiscent of the 90s. Despite being neon, it has a beautiful muted feel to it at times and really provides the grittiness and dated feel to help you travel back in time.</p>
<p>Loading the game for the first time, you're immediately pulled into a gritty cutscene, giving you glimpses of the events that took place that summer. As soon as that unraveled before me, my interest was peaked. It slows right down quickly soon after that, as you play as Swann gets a phone call from her mother. Examining items in the car, I immediately noticed the masks and became very aware that it took place during the pandemic, a time I would much rather forget. For those who had a difficult time during the pandemic, this game may prove to be a little bit uncomfortable at times, with the reminders that crop up throughout the story.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ss_3efe444163d418f162a8ec19c4a7039c444b93e2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After the scene in the car, you are introduced to Swann as a teenager who loves to film everything she can with her camcorder. This was something that I spent a lot of time doing. Getting to see the environments through the camcorder was a lot of fun and very nostalgic. It also reminded me a lot of Life is Strange, and the collectibles being in the form of photographs. Instead, you would film a bunch of scenes of life happening around Velvet Cove to create a memoir. Whether this was birds, items moving in place, or your gang of friends, there were lots of optional memoirs to create alongside the story-based ones.</p>
<p>What really helped elevate the game's aesthetic was the art style that went with it. While music played an important part in the game, having the color schemes of the 90s helped bring the game to life. I loved the lighting that was used to reflect off of objects in the world, as well as the characters. Seeing Nora, Kat, Autumn, and Swann bathed in neon lights was one of my favorite aspects of the game, and it made me happy to see that a photo mode had been implemented into Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage.</p>
<p>Getting to examine items from around the world, such as the books and videotapes in Swann's bedroom, helped me remember my own childhood and fond memories of mixtapes, CDs, and videotapes. I loved the amount of detail that went into every little thing that you could examine. Whether it was a beer bottle in the park or a book in Swann's room, there was so much detail, and love poured into this game to help provide a true, immersive experience in the 90s. Every recording helped to build the world up further, as well as provide beneficial evidence in tough situations.</p>
<p>While the game is quite a slow burn, it helps set up the story for the second episode, which I am eagerly awaiting. There's a lot of unanswered questions, and I'm excited to see where this supernatural tale will end.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ss_a1c06cd0be3234b375eaad5c44662135aee55a08.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>That being said, there were moments in Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage that were a little awkward. With games that rely on your choices impacting the story, there are often a lot of pauses to allow you time to respond. However, in this game, the conversations feel a little bit too drawn out, even when I'm not actively contributing to the conversation. Pauses are long, and conversations often overlap. While this would make sense since it's a group of people all talking to each other, sometimes the option to give a response comes in a bit too late, and it feels wrong to contribute to the conversation. I found this to be an issue predominantly with Swann, as she is quite an awkward teenager and is very nervous around people.</p>
<p>In addition to this, some of the animations for the conversations were a little bit wonky. For example, when you finally meet up with Autumn at the bar in Velvet Cove, sometimes you can hear the voice-over of the conversation that is taking place, but her mouth isn't moving. Alternatively, her mouth moves after a delay, and she only says half of the sentence or after it has already been said. While these issues were relatively minor, they did break the game's immersion and lessen the impact of conversations, as it became something I focused on.</p>
<p>Although it's to be expected, I did wish that the game had a save option rather than relying solely on autosaves. Because of this, it meant that saves were pretty few and far between, meaning I had to commit to some beefy gaming sessions to make progress in the story, as well as having to get to a certain point before the game was saved.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ss_014ee10912f8a01a19b9c64658f62e1743cd6d44.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Overall, getting to experience the conversations between the girls was a lot of fun and reminded me a lot of my own childhood and adolescence, just without the supernatural elements to go along with it. The game is very aesthetically pleasing, and there is a ton of optional content that you can do within the time frame of playing the main game due to the function of the camcorder.</p>
<p>Certain parts did feel a little bit drawn out, especially the scene of Swann and Autumn collecting Autumn's keys. A lot of that scene was Swann and Autumn reminiscing on the past and how they became friends at that very moment. Despite that, it felt like it ran on longer than it needed to, which really added to the slow-burn effect of walking through their adolescence.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-interview-discussing-the-setting-inspirations-multiple-timelines/">playing as adults</a>, it felt like it progressed a bit quicker, and the scenes in adulthood weren't as long as those in adolescence. I look forward to seeing how this story will conclude in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902960/Lost_Records_Bloom__Rage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second tape</a>, and I hope I get to hunt for more collectibles again.</p>

<p>Microsoft and Xbox have announced a new generative AI technology known as Muse that could help with game preservation. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy blog post</a> going over the new tech, Microsoft says that there is a belief that Muse can change how games are preserved and how players experience classic titles.</p>



<p>“Today, countless classic games tied to aging hardware are no longer playable by most people,” Fatima Kardar, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of gaming AI said. “Thanks to this breakthrough, we are exploring the potential for Muse to take older back catalog games from our studios and optimize them for any device.”</p>



<p>Due to it still being early in hits lifecycle, no examples of how exactly the Muse technology can work with game preservation on Xbox were shared, but it seems like Microsoft is gung ho about the possibilities.</p>



<p>“We believe this could radically change how we preserve and experience classic games in the future and make them accessible to more players,” Kardar said. “To imagine that beloved games lost to time and hardware advancement could one day be played on any screen with Xbox is an exciting possibility for us.”</p>



<p>If you want to read more about the Muse technology, Microsoft has a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full research blog</a> on what went into its development.</p>

                <p>Humble has launched an awesome new video game bundle geared toward retro enthusiasts.

All told, this bundle includes 69 games for only $20,  which breaks down to 29 cents per game.</p><p>Unlike many Humble Bundles, the Capcom retro bundle doesn't have tiers; it's an all-or-nothing collection of Steam games that's available to purchase until March 11. The bundle supports Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. As usual, you can donate more than the minimum $20 and adjust the ratio of your donation between the charity, the publisher, and Humble.</p><p>If the number of games included sounds abnormally high, that's because the bulk of the inclusions are technically paid DLC within Capcom's pair of Arcade Stadium collections. Capcom Arcade Stadium is a free download, but adding games to the platform requires cash. With this Humble Bundle, you'll get a key for Arcade Stadium and Arcade Stadium 2 that instantly unlocks a wide assortment of games.</p><p>Capcom Arcade Stadium is a well-curated collection of '80s and '90s arcade games, including both Mega Man arcade games, great shoot-'em-ups such as 1943, classic platformers like Strider, and numerous entries from Capcom's popular fighting game series. In addition to several versions of Street Fighter 2, you're also getting the brilliant trilogy of Street Fighter Alpha games as well as Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xboxs-muse-ai-model-is-a-one-of-a-kind-model-that-can-generate-gameplay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It has long been speculated when the time would come for generative AI models to be widely used in game development to actually create gameplay, and it seems like that time is coming with Muse, an Xbox one-of-a-kind AI model that was unveiled today.</p>
<p>Presented today on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature</a>, Muse is a generative AI model that can essentially generate gameplay based on visuals or players' controller actions, understanding a 3D game world and physics and reacting to how players interact with a game. The model was trained on human gameplay data from Ninja Theory's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bleeding-edge-never-enough/">Bleeding Edge</a>, giving it access to the equivalent of seven years of human gameplay, a close collaboration that gave Microsoft Research the chance to understand what needs to be in place for the model and how to access a large amount of gameplay data.</p>
<p>However, Xbox's Muse AI model is still in the early stages of development. It can only generate gameplay visuals at a very low resolution of 300 x 180, so it will be some time before it can be used for anything practical. At the same time, Microsoft stresses that it will never be used to replace actual game developers but only empower them, as it can be used, for example, in the early stages of development. Something that is really hard to believe, given the <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/">sad state of the video games industry.</a></p>
<p>In addition to aiding in new game development, Xbox's Muse AI model could also be used to improve classic games and bring them to modern consoles, according to Phil Spencer. These models and their ability to learn how a game plays without the necessity of the original engine running on original hardware will provide new opportunities for game preservation, according to the Microsoft Gaming CEO.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I reported in November that Microsoft was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290468/microsoft-xbox-ai-features-copilot-development-notepad">about to start a bigger effort</a> to bring AI features to Xbox, and today, the company is unveiling what it’s calling a breakthrough in AI for gaming. Microsoft’s new Muse AI model could help Xbox developers create parts of games in the future, and the company says it’s even exploring the potential of using it to preserve classic games and optimize them for modern hardware.</p><p>Microsoft Research <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/?p=1122837">has created Muse</a>, a first-of-its-kind generative AI model that can generate a game environment based on visuals or players’ controller actions. It understands a 3D game world and game physics and can react to how players interact with a game.</p><p>“This allows the model to create consistent and diverse gameplay rendered by AI, demonstrating a major step toward generative AI models that can empower game creators,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/">explains Fatima Kardar</a>, corporate vice president of gaming AI at Microsoft.</p><p>The Muse model was trained on a large amount of human gameplay data from the Xbox game <em>Bleeding Edge</em> thanks to a collaboration between Microsoft Research and Xbox studio Ninja Theory — both of which are based in Cambridge in the UK. “This partnership allowed us to closely collaborate with the game studio to understand what needs to be in place and how we can responsibly unlock access to a large amount of gameplay data,” says Katja Hofmann, head of Microsoft Research’s game intelligence team.</p><p>This allowed Muse to access the equivalent of seven years of human gameplay, resulting in the model being trained on a billion image action pairs in total. It’s a milestone research project that’s being <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3">published in <em>Nature</em> today</a>, but as it’s early work, the model is limited to generating gameplay visuals at a resolution of just 300×180 pixels. That’s up from the 128 x 128 resolution of Microsoft’s earlier work on generative AI gaming models, but it’s still far behind the 1080p (1920 x 1080) resolution that is common among PC gamers.</p><p>Microsoft has released a number of examples of the Muse model in action, generating gameplay and even allowing players to load visual elements into the game to prompt the model. This could be used for the early iteration stages of a game, but Microsoft is stressing this isn’t designed to generate an entire game and replace creators.</p><p>“For Xbox, the principles that drive our approach to AI are to create more value for players and game creators, bring more games to more people around the world, and recognize that the development of a great game will always be grounded in the creator’s vision and artistry,” says Kardar. “We believe generative AI has the potential to enhance this creativity and unlock new possibilities.”</p><p>During a press briefing, Hofmann also demonstrated a real-time version of Muse that Microsoft is currently experimenting with to enable interactive AI-powered games. The demo generated game visuals on the fly in real time and even reacted to objects being dropped into the game to change the environment. While the real-time gameplay only ran at 10fps and a 300×180 resolution, it was an early demonstration of what might be possible in the future.</p><p>Microsoft is now exploring how Muse could help improve classic games and bring them to modern hardware. “You could imagine a world where from gameplay data and video that a model could learn old games and really make them portable to any platform where these models could run,” says Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer. “We’ve talked about game preservation as an activity for us, and these models and their ability to learn completely how a game plays without the necessity of the original engine running on the original hardware opens up a ton of opportunity.”</p><p>Microsoft is also exploring how Muse can help game developers prototype games or how teams could add new AI-powered experiences to existing titles. Some short interactive AI game experiences will be available on Copilot Labs soon for people to try out. Microsoft is also planning to share AI tools and experiments with Xbox players and creators “earlier on” so that it can “make sure that our AI innovations address real problems and add new value to creating or playing with Xbox.”</p><p>While Microsoft is still in the exploration phase of AI in gaming, it’s also making it clear it’s up to individual studios at Xbox how they want to use AI in games. “As part of this, we have empowered creative leaders here at Xbox to decide on the use of generative AI. There isn’t going to be a single solution for every game or project, and the approach will be based on the creative vision and goals of each team,” says Kardar.</p><p>There is already a lot of fear from game developers and studios about how AI could affect the creative process of making games, particularly at a time when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610851/crysis-4-on-hold-crytek-layoffs">barely a week</a> goes by without <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614819/marvel-rivals-us-layoffs-netease">layoffs in the gaming industry</a>. A recent report revealed that 1 in 10 game developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results">lost their jobs in 2024</a> alone.</p><p>“We don’t intend to use this technology for the creation of content,” says Ninja Theory studio head Dom Matthews. “I think the interesting aspect for us that’s exciting, is how can we use technology like this to make the process of making games quicker and easier for our talented team, so that they can really focus on the thing that’s really special about games: the human creativity.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-remaster-announcement/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Future Tony Hawk’s Remasters and Remakes games seemed unlikely. However, not only are discussions underway, but a new Tony Hawk’s Remaster or Remake could be in production.</p>



<p>2020’s Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 was a critical and commercial success. It quickly sold a million copies and reminded everywhere why it’s one of the most heralded franchises in gaming history. It featured all the beloved levels and modes from the original two games and added many modern Tony Hawk’s mechanics and additional content.</p>



<p>A remaster of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 and 4 was on the cards—until it wasn’t. Activision canceled the project, leaving all of us disappointed. Quicker than you can land a 360 Melon, the dream might no longer be stuck in the half-pipeline.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-a-tony-hawk-s-remaster-or-remake-happening">Is a Tony Hawk’s Remaster or Remake Happening?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a franchise. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Activision has yet to offer anything concrete on a new Tony Hawk’s Remaster or Remake, but evidence suggests it’s happening, and might arrive sooner than anyone expects.</strong></p>



<p>Professional skateboarder Tyshawn Jones—already a two-time Thrasher Skate of the Year winner—let slip he’s appearing in an upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-remaster-is-coming-skater-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Remaster</a>. “<strong>I’m in a Tony Hawk coming out</strong> so that’s cool,” he said. “They got a new one they <strong>remastering</strong> so that’s about to come out. I was in the last one,” said Jones.</p>



<p>It’s not declarative proof, however, common sense is a Tony Hawk’s remaster is coming. Activision canceled plans for future Tony Hawk’s games, but Birdman himself (Hawk) stated in September 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-is-talking-to-activision-about-tony-hawk-pro-skater-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talks with Activision had resumed</a>.</p>



<p>He was brief but candid when he commented on a new project: “I wish I could tell you more. But I can tell you that I’ve been talking to Activision again which is insanely exciting. We’re working on something.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-continues-to-tease-future-pro-skater-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hawk teased more Pro Skater</a> information about a new game a couple of weeks later: “I’m not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, <strong>but there will be a future</strong>.”</p>



<h2 id="h-when-could-a-tony-hawk-s-remaster-be-announced">When Could a Tony Hawk’s Remaster be Announced?</h2>



<p><strong>Gaming insider eXtas1s has suggested the rumored Tony Hawk’s Pro Skate Remake could arrive as early as the June 2025 Xbox Showcase Event.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a> is known for their gaming leaks—which are quite accurate. Not only did the gaming personality give a timeframe for the announcement, but they think the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Remaster will be a shadow drop</a> once the showcase ends.</p>



<p><strong>This means it will be released the same day it is announced.</strong> Stay tuned as we try to learn more about this incredible development.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-thps-games-could-be-remastered">Which THPS Games Could be Remastered?</h2>



<p>As many as <strong>10-15 Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games could be in contention</strong>, but it’s likely a dual remaster of <strong>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4</strong>.</p>



<p>Honestly, Activision can remaster them all and I will buy them. I grew up looking forward to a new Tony Hawk’s game every Christmas. But given the success and starting point of the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 Remaster, I think a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remaster feels the most likely outcome.</p>



<p>Again, take this guide with a pinch of salt until we hear more. All signs are pointing toward a Tony Hawk’s Remaster though, so keep checking back as we update this with the newest details.</p>



<hr>



<p>What are your fondest memories from the third and fourth THPS levels? I still recall blasting Motorhead’s Ace of Spades while shredding it up in Airport. Or are you secretly hoping Activision chooses different games such as the Underground series?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-address-biggest-isssues/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 CPU will address one of the most critical issues of its predecessor, which caused slowdowns in certain games.</p>
<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/the-nintendo-switch-limited-cpu-and-ram-but-it-also-made-optimization-a-fun-puzzle-to-figure-out-japanese-engineers-talk-about-difficulties-they-faced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AUTOMATON</a> recently interviewed some Japanese developers who worked on ports for the original Switch, asking them what difficulties they had to face and what are their expectations for its successor. Speaking about the CPU, the most frequent comment from developers was that it was often running at full capacity in games and thus couldn't handle background loading, forcing developers to either optimize background loading to make it happen whenever possible or to abandon optimization entirely, leading to performance drops in games. The much more powerful CPU of the Nintendo Switch 2 will address this issue, making background loading easier for developers.</p>
<p>Another well-documented weakness of the original system, which the Nintendo Switch 2 will address, is the RAM, as its measly 4 GB made it difficult for some developers to port games developed for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which had 8GB of RAM. One developer who worked on a port of an open-world RPG said that working around the RAM limitations of the system was like solving a puzzle, as compressing textures to the absolute limit to save as much memory as possible actually made their game look better the more memory was saved.</p>
<p>No matter what individual game developers' expectations may be, the vast majority of them are really looking forward to the Nintendo Switch 2's improved hardware specifications. Those working primarily on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S titles, in particular, highlighted the urgent need for the system, as its increased specs will make porting games much easier.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch later this year. According to analysts, it should be priced at<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-399/"> $399</a> for a variety of reasons.</p>
