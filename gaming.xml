<p>During an IRL livestream, popular streamers Valkyrae, Emiru, and Cinna were stalked and harassed by a young man who threatened to kill them. The stream ended abruptly, but thankfully all three women and their staff were unharmed after the disturbing incident.</p>



<h2 id="h-stream-stalker-charges-at-and-threatens-streamer-trio">Stream Stalker Charges at and Threatens Streamer Trio </h2>



<p>During the multi-day Sis-a-Thon stream, hosts Valkyrae and Cinna were hanging around Santa Monica Pier yesterday with fellow streamer Emiru when the incident occured. The trio, along with members of the camera crew, walked past a young man crouching on the ground who asked for Emiru’s number. She declines and the group decides to move on, but the man says “I’m going to keep following her.”</p>



<p>After being followed for some time, despite asking him to stop, the group attempts to leave. The man then gets into an altercation with one of the friends of the group, and when the streamers call for security to intervene, he charges at them, threatening first to fight them before saying “I’ll kill you right now.” After distancing themselves from the man, amidst more calls for security, the stream ended.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Soon after the stream ended, both Cinna and Valkyrae took to Twitter to tell fans they were alright, but also to inform them that the Sis-A-Thon would be ending as a result. The next day, Valkyrae went back on Twitter to <a href="https://x.com/Valkyrae/status/1896613433245614442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">address</a> baseless accusations that the incident was staged, while also criticizing those that stirred up hate towards the women earlier during the stream:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Seeing accounts that have harassed us for a 10 second clip of downtime during a 24/7 marathon accusing us of “just begging for subs, women do nothing” to then farming engagement from this stalker situation while we IRL stream has been so sad to see. Seeing accounts accusing my friends and I for faking this and blaming us instead of questioning the man’s behavior has been embarrassing to see. I’ve learned it doesn’t matter how much I accomplish in this industry or how much I try to gain respect, some men will hate women and blame women no matter the situation.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pockets-triumphant-light-expansion-just-gave-water-decks-another-powerful-card-and-everyones-a-little-over-it.1124154/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pockets-triumphant-light-expansion-just-gave-water-decks-another-powerful-card-and-everyones-a-little-over-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When Pokemon TCG Pocket first launched, the meta quickly came to be dominated by a very small handful of decks. One of those, centered around Misty and water-type Pokemon, came to be hated early on due to its potential to overpower opponents early on based entirely on how well some coin flips went. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, three expansions later, you would think other cards would have swooped in to replace or counter Misty decks. But instead, Pokemon TCG Pocket's latest expansion just added a new card that makes Misty decks stronger than ever, and a lot of players are kind of over it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, it's not that Misty decks are necessarily the most powerful in the game. It's that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokmon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain">the luck-based nature of Misty makes losing to them feel very, very bad</a>. Misty is a Supporter card, with the unique ability to allow the user to pick a water-type Pokemon, and flip a coin until they land on tails. They then attach a water-type energy to that Pokemon for every heads they flipped. This could result in a player attaching 0 water-type energy, effectively wasting a deck spot on the card and a supporter card play. Or they could attach 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 energy, or more, if luck is on their side that day. A well-flipped Misty could allow a player to win on turn one in certain situations, before the opponent even has a chance to make a move. Or, in more common scenarios, the user gets enough bonus energy to bring extremely powerful cards online before their opponent can build a meaningful defense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All that's fine and dandy, but what's made Misty worse are the numerous cards in subsequent expansions that have made it even more powerful. Mythical Island added Vaporean, which has an ability allowing players to essentially move all that bonus energy freely around between their water-types. Space-Time Smackdown brought Manaphy in, which adds <em>even more water energy</em> to the board. Both expansions saw new, powerful water-type Pokemon that can make use of that energy, such as Palkia ex and Gyarados ex. As a result, water decks have been at the top of the meta consistently for multiple expansions in a row.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, with Triumphant Light, there's <em>another</em> card out there making Misty decks even more hellish: Irida. Irida, like Misty, is a Supporter card, but its effect is that it can heal 40 damage from each Pokemon that has any water-type energy attached. Up to this point, grass-type decks have been the healing experts. But with Irida, water-type decks can make significant comebacks as long as they've collected and spread out enough energy...and between Misty, Manaphy, and Vaporeon, they're very likely to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For what it's worth, some Pokemon TCG experts are offering a pretty logical explanation for Irida. In TCG Pocket, decks are limited to 20 cards That means if you want to add something like Irida, you need to take something else out. Water decks are simply swimming in good cards - at a certain point, players must weigh whether or not it's actually worth removing Misty for a card like Irida. Some players are speculating that developer DeNA added Irida in an effort to crowd Misty out and force players to make tough choices about which Supporters to include. But that doesn't mean plenty of wise deckbuilders haven't found ways to include both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the player above points out, Pokemon TCG Pocket is gearing up for a regularly-scheduled event, where rewards will be doled out for going on win streaks in the game's online competitive mode. The best reward, a gold profile badge, will be given out for winning five matches in a row. This is surprisingly difficult to do, and even moreso when many decks you'll be facing can sweep you away within the first few turns if they flip coins correctly, and have backups like Irida to save them even if the flips go bad for them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect to see a lot of water decks during this event and for a long time to come. In fact, at this point, it may just be worth playing one yourself if you're not already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Just one week after it admitted to using generative AI in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> for a number of assets, the publisher is now being accused of using generative AI again to promote a different game: Guitar Hero Mobile. But even as audiences criticize the promotion, sharp-eyed fans are discovering that Guitar Hero Mobile may not even be a real game in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/guitar-hero-mobile-ad-ai-art/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by Insider Gaming</a>, the generative AI in question appears to have been used in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram ad for the newly-announced Guitar Hero Mobile</a> posted two days ago. The ad features four guitar players on a stage in very similar poses with similarly-blobby red guitars, surrounded by distorted speakers that look suspiciously like washing machines and some mass of blobby microphones directly behind them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In front of them is an audience that includes a number of visible legs that don't seem to belong to anybody, and down the center is a Guitar Hero track with incorrectly colored tracks and blobby, inconsistent notes, some of which don't color match the track they're on. Put together, all of these issues are tell-tale signs of generative AI art, and given Activision's recent track record, it's pretty likely that's what's happening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the comments, fans are furious. "Shows how much effort went into this when you can't even get your own game right," reads one response. Another calls the ad "Lazy AI slop," while another reads, "you’d think a giant company like Activision would have some budget for a real graphic designer". A fourth says, "Wow. It appears they're still using midjourney 1.0. I haven't seen AI art this bad since the early days."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn't where the weird generative AI ads end. As a few websites such as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/activision-comes-under-fire-for-using-ai-art-to-gauge-interest-in-new-mobile-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Extension</a> and <a href="https://80.lv/articles/activision-gets-criticized-for-ai-generated-mobile-game-advertisements/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80.lv</a> have pointed out, Activision appears to have quietly dropped a number of generative AI-created ads on Instagram for a smattering of games that haven't otherwise been announced by the company. These include a Call of Duty Zombies mobile game, something called Call of Duty: Sniper, and something else called Crash Bandicoot Brawl. At the time we're writing this, none of these ads are viewable publicly on Activision's official Instagram, but the Guitar Hero Mobile game ad is still <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available via direct link</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where this gets even weirder is that fans have managed to <a href="https://store.geeklab.app/p/f6c46a6e325cb82fbb206399" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find a page for Guitar Hero Mobile</a> on a website called Geeklab, complete with even more AI imagery. Geeklab is a user acquisition and insight company that allows publishers to create "look-alike" store pages for mobile games in order to test user interest. Clicking "GET" on the Guitar Hero Mobile page <a href="https://lab.geeklab.app/survey/7562005b447f52556c832f82?tq=267a0d4c6151982266fa5a03d97051&amp;pid=3252054" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">takes users to a survey</a> that claims "This isn't a real game, but could be some day!" and asks them a number of questions about why they clicked on the ad and how likely they would be to play something like Guitar Hero Mobile.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>OFFICIAL: Activision is currently looking into making a new COD Zombies mobile game. The kicker?</p><p>They're using AI Generated advertisements in order to garner interest on it. </p><p>Full story below:</p><p>Recently, an official Call of Duty Instagram ad has been posted a few hours ago… <a href="https://t.co/CQeQYiVwFq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/CQeQYiVwFq</a></p></div>— COD: Zombies News (@MargwaNetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/MargwaNetwork/status/1895612833821536676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 28, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">What appears to be happening here is that Activision launched some sort of ad campaign to gauge user interest in a number of possible mobile games that don't exist yet. Because those games aren't real, it used generative AI for its advertising art, and confused the heck out of fans who otherwise would have been stoked for an actual Guitar Hero Mobile game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes just one week after Activision admitted to using generative AI in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Said generative AI assets were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash">actually discovered and called out back in December</a>, but it took the publisher nearly three months to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">admit it had used generative AI in Call of Duty loading screens, calling cards, and other in-game art</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision declined to comment to IGN for this piece.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The visuals also received a significant overhaul, and the 23-year-old game looks nice on modern consoles. The graphical upgrades coupled with the chilling soundtrack help create a tense and unsettling atmosphere. That said, the combat system is rather repetitive, but if you're in the mood for a straightforward PS2-era shooter, The Thing: Remastered is worth checking out.</p><p>And if you'd like to watch the film first before playing, Amazon has the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thing-Blu-ray-4K-UHD/dp/B098Z28MSY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original horror classic on 4K Blu-ray</a> for less than $20.

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of La Quimera, a new sci-fi first-person shooter in development at Reburn (formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine), 4A Games (the Malta office) decided to <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/2/28/4a-games-studio-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> a brief explanation to those in the community who might still be confused.</p>
<p>As we explained in last week's news, the two studios are entirely separate now, and the Maltan developer, who is now the only one to carry the revered name, has confirmed to be working on the next Metro installment with franchise creator Dmitry Glukhovsky.</p>
<p><em>We are the team that created and built the Metro games you know and love. We’re still making the next Metro with Dmitry Glukhovsky, the same core founders, leadership, developers, and nearly 20 years experience on the series. We also have our other new IP project in the works. We’ll reveal more about both when we’re ready.</em></p>
<p><em>We are proudly Ukrainian in our roots, and in the majority of our diverse team. We make games from our offices in Kyiv and Sliema, as well as remotely, and even sometimes from the front line in Ukraine. We now have studios in two countries, but the majority of our team remain in Ukraine - roughly 150 out of about 200+. The rest work in Malta, or remotely.</em></p>
<p><em>In 2014, we, led by the original "four A's" - the founders of 4A Games - formed “4A Games Limited” and created a new HQ in Malta with roughly 50 of our fellow team members. We have since grown and work to this day on Metro under contract with Deep Silver and Plaion.</em></p>
<p><em>We continued to work closely with our remaining Ukrainian colleagues at “4A Games Ukraine” on Metro Exodus through an outsource relationship led by us. Once Metro Exodus and its DLC was released, we created another Kyiv studio under 4A Games Limited and welcomed roughly 50 more of our colleagues to continue on with us, while 4A Games Ukraine continued to pursue their own project La Quimera, as a completely separate entity and recently renamed themselves Reburn. We wish them every success.</em></p>
<p><em>The 4A Games you know and love have not changed, and we are not rebranding. We are the same developers of Metro that brought you Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light, Metro Redux, and Metro Exodus.</em></p>
<p>It's been a long time since the last mainline entry in the post-apocalyptic franchise. Exodus <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metro-exodus-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched over six years ago</a>, after all. Sure, there have been the DLCs and other post-launch drops, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-enhanced-edition-impressions-4a-games-delivers-the-most-advanced-lighting-yet-without-sacrificing-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enhanced Edition</a> and the mod tools, but the fans are eager to get back into the world envisioned by Dmitry Glukhovsky - and the recently released VR-only game <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-awakening-vr-announced-for-psvr2-launches-november-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metro Awakening</a> (developed by Vertigo Games) certainly didn't sate them.</p>
<p>4A Games owner THQ Nordic (now Embracer Group) first <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-new-metro-game-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new Metro game in August 2019. Since then, the studio has been awfully quiet, although they did <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sold-10-million-units-in-5-years-next-mainline-installment-coming-in-202x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirm</a> about a year ago that the next game is coming in '202X'. Industry rumors have previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sequel-reportedly-fully-playable-could-be-revealed-later-this-year-for-2024-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> the game to have been fully playable as early as February 2023, so perhaps they'll surprise with a launch in late 2025 or early 2026.</p>

          <p>Zach Barth, the namesake of game studio Zachtronics, tends to make a certain kind of game.</p>
<p>Besides crafting the free browser game <em>Infiniminer</em>, which <a href="https://www.cascadepbs.org/2015/08/the-godfather-of-minecraft-a-conversation-with-indie-gamer-zachary-barth">inspired the entire global <em>Minecraft</em> industry</a>, Barth and his collaborators made <em>SpaceChem</em>, <em>Infinifactory</em>, <em>TIS-100</em>, <em>Shenzen I/O</em>,<em> Opus Magnum</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Exapunks</em>. Each one of them is some combination of puzzle game, light capitalism horror, and the most memorable introductory-level computer science, chemistry, or logistics class into which you unwittingly enrolled. Each game is its own thing, but they have a certain similar brain feel between them. It is summed up perhaps best by the Zachtronics team itself in a book: <em><a href="https://www.zachtronics.com/zach-like/">Zach-Like</a></em>.</p>
<p>Barth and his crew have made other kinds of games, including a forward-looking visual novel about AI, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/eliza-review-startup-culture-meets-sci-fi-in-a-touching-fascinating-tale/"><em>Eliza</em></a>, and multiplayer card battler <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/nerts-is-the-free-pleasant-six-player-card-game-we-could-all-use-right-now/"><em>Nerts!</em></a>. And Barth himself told PC Gamer that he hates "<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/puzzle/one-of-the-best-puzzle-game-designers-is-back-with-kaizen-a-factory-story-a-game-about-manufacturing-japanese-consumer-goods-during-the-largest-economic-bubble-in-history/">saying Zach-like</a>." But fans of refining inputs, ordering operations, and working their way past constraints will thrill to learn that Zach is, in fact, back.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2275490/Kaizen_A_Factory_Story/"><em>Kaizen: A Factory Story</em></a>, from developer Coincidence and comprising "the original Zachtronics team," puts you, an American neophyte business type, in charge of a factory making toys, tiny electronics, and other goods during the Japanese economic boom of the 1980s. You arrange the spacing and order of operations of the mechanical arms that snap the head onto a robot toy, or the battery onto a Walkman, for as little time, power, and financial cost as possible.</p>

                <p>Despite Activision's efforts to curb cheating among some Call of Duty players, it remains an issue even in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Black Ops. 6</a>. But now, there's potentially cause for celebration among CoD fans as Phantom Overlay, one of the most prominent cheat developers, has announced that it is shutting down.</p><p>Via <a href="https://gamerant.com/call-of-duty-phantom-overlay-cheat-provider-shut-down/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Rant</a>, Phantom Overlay's <a href="https://t.me/PhantomOverlayAnnouncements/1052" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Telegram channel</a> states that it plans to "immediately" close its operations, with a caveat that it will remain online for at least another month to fulfill the 30-day keys that it has already sold players. Phantom Overlay went on to promise that anyone who bought lifetime keys would get a partial refund.</p><p>"This is not an exit scam and no external entity could ever compel me to exit scam my customers," wrote the creator of Phantom Overlay. "I'll keep everything updated, safe, and online for 32 days longer."</p><p>There was no information in the post about why Phantom Overlay is closing down, and <a href="https://x.com/Beyond_Dark_TM/status/1896214682727579879" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some players online are naturally skeptical</a>. Phantom Overlay successfully monetized CoD cheats, and the creator could theoretically try again with a different company or a new alias. As noted by one user on X, Phantom Overlay's cheats <a href="https://twitter.com/InsuredFrames/status/1896052805653426600" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were reputed to be undetectable</a>, while rival cheat-makers have struggled with that.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/27000-call-of-duty-cheaters-were-banned-this-past-weekend/1100-6522492/" data-ref-id="1100-6522492">27,000 CoD cheaters were banned in a single weekend</a>. Activision's Call of Duty anti-cheat program, Ricochet, shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheaters-may-now-lose-their-parachutes-sending-them-plummeting-to-their-death/1100-6519058/" data-ref-id="1100-6519058">its ambitious anti-cheat CoD plans</a>, but Activision has previously apologized for not being able to kick cheaters out of Black Ops. 6 ranked play as quickly as promised. Activision has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-call-of-duty-cheat-makers-ordered-to-pay-3-million-to-activision/1100-6511845/" data-ref-id="1100-6511845">sued cheat developers in the past</a>, and successfully won a $3 million judgment against them. Regardless, the battle between Activision and the cheaters will likely continue well into the future regardless of whether Phantom Overlay makes a comeback under a new name. In the meantime, Activision has launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-recon-squad-announced-but-its-not-a-new-game/1100-6529557/" data-ref-id="1100-6529557">Call of Duty: Recon Squad</a> to get more feedback from players.</p>

Beloved 8-bit isometric puzzle-platformer Head Over Heels is back and (not for the first time) getting the remake treatment, bringing "colourful modern visuals" and "refined gameplay" when it comes to PC and Switch later this year.
</p>
<p>
The original Head Over Heels was developed by Ocean Software and released for various platforms, including the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64, in 1987. It cast players as Head and Heels, two interstellar spies on a mission to liberate planets from an evil Emperor.
</p>
<p>
All this unfolded across 300 isometric rooms, with players needing to utilise Head and Heels' slightly different abilities in order to overcome obstacles - including, famously, a dalek with the head of (then) Prince Charles - and mount their escape from Castle Blacktooth.

<p>
Head Over Heels is beloved enough that it's already had one remake; this initial 2003 update brought substantially overhauled visuals in a version that would later come to PC and Switch. Now though, it's set to get a more faithful remake in the form of Head Over Heels: Deluxe.
</p>
<p>
Head Over Heels: Deluxe's most obvious difference is its art style, which adheres far more closely to the pixel art visuals of the 1987 original. It also features a brand-new soundtrack composed by Space Fractal, "re-engineered controls that feel snappy and precise", multiple save points, three difficulty levels, hints, and selectable play speeds.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, there's a new world to explore - complete with new enemies and objects (including chickens!) - bringing the total number of "majestic" locations up to 500. And for those hoping for something a bit more traditional, it's possible to switch to "classic mode" graphics and sounds closer to the 8-bit original.
</p>
<p>
Head Over Heels: Deluxe is developed by Rusty Pixels and Ogre Games Ltd and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3153640/Head_Over_Heels_Deluxe/">releases on Steam</a> this Thursday, 6th March. A Switch version is due to arrive later this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/pvpve-mech-shooter-sand-enters-early-access-via-steam-on-april-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This news was announced at the IGN Fan Fest, where publisher tinyBuild games and developer Hologryph said that the highly anticipated PvPvE extraction shooter SAND, would be getting an Early Access release date of April 3, 2025.</p>
<p>Players were first introduced to SAND and the difficulty of the intense game with a demo that was showcased during <a href="https://wccftech.com/sands-steam-next-fest-demo-available-now/">Steam Next Fest</a> last year and was so popular that it ranked among the top ten most played demos. Additionally, last month saw an open playtest for SAND, with over 200,000 testers participating.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen what SAND is all about, make sure to check out this trailer below, which showcases the Tramplers you'll get to pilot, as well as some of the high-octane combat you'll get to take part in.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAND | Release Date Reveal | Action-packed Multiplayer Mech Action" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6rvIyS0eIlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In SAND, you are thrown into an alternate history of 1910 with an industrial spin. In this game, you'll get to experience first-person PvPvE combat, where you can choose to play on your own or with a group of friends, where you can then take on other players in the dunes of Sophie, an area that was once filled with resources but now lays barren and desolate.</p>
<p>Not only will you get to pilot the Tramplers, which are your gigantic walking bases. Here, you will be able to store any resources that you plunder, as well as hide here to get protection from the intense elements, as well as get to utilize it in battle. You can choose the size, the layout, the placement of its engine and compartments, as well as what weapons you equip on your Trampler.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1431300/Sand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> for SAND, the developers are estimating that the title will be in Early Access for around a year based on the roadmap and developmental goals. This game has been in the works since 2023, where the game has built up a dedicated community that has participated in multiple playtests and demos to provide valuable feedback to the team.</p>
<p>When asked how the full version will differ from the Early Access version, the developers have stated the following:</p>
<p>"<em>SAND is expected to evolve and grow significantly over the course of Early Access, with new weapons, Trampler compartments, islands/POIs, PvE mechanics, crafting mechanics, cosmetic options, world hazards, visual improvements, optimization and more already either under discussion or in active development."I</em></p>
<p>Will you be playing SAND when it releases in Early Access? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

Some of my friends are lapsed fans and I lobbied them to go in on a play booster box of <em>Final Fantasy</em> for a chill draft when the set drops in June. The universal response upon sharing a screenshot of the BestBuy pre-order page prices in the group chat was “hell no.” I imagine it’s even tougher for any kids without tons of pocket change or who aren’t secretly playing <em>MTG</em> like a stock market in their spare time. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-lovecraft-inspired-the-sinking-city-2-starts-crowdfunding-this-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Frogwares, the Ukranian studio best known for its long-running series of Sherlock Holmes deduction adventures, is launching a Kickstarter campaign this Thursday, 6th March, to crowdfund development of its Lovecraft-inspired survival horror sequel, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Sinking City 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-will-pivot-to-a-horror-focus">announced last year</a>, teasing a "horror-first" evolution of the open-world formula established in the 2019 original. It features a standalone story, albeit one still set in 1920s United States, and its big change is that deduction (previously core to the experience) is now entirely optional - a way to uncover more of the story but never required to progress.
</p>
<p>
The Sinking City 2's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2">Kickstarter page</a> is a little light on detail ahead of Thursday's campaign launch - although it does confirm a PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC release - but the studio previously explained it would be seeking crowdfunding as a "safety net" during development.

<p>
Frogwares successfully <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-remaking-sherlock-holmes-and-cthulhu-crossover-the-awakened">took a similar crowdfunding approach for 2023's Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened</a>, as it continued to adjust to life during Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sherlock-holmes-developer-frogwares-shares-update-on-life-in-ukraine-amid-ongoing-war-with-russia">shared some harrowing updates</a> during that game's creation.
</p>
<p>
The Sinking City 2's imminent Kickstarter campaign comes after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-now-sole-publisher-of-the-sinking-city-following-dispute-with-nacon">resolution of Frogwares' lengthy dispute with publisher Nacon</a> over the rights to the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city">The Sinking City</a> - a dispute that at one point saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-dev-tells-people-not-to-buy-its-own-game-from-steam">Frogwares urging people not to buy the game</a> after Nacon published an out of date version missing features on Steam. Since last year's resolution, Frogwares has taken over as The Sinking City's publisher, updated the Steam build, and released new DLC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/03/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii might seems like an incredibly outlandish idea at first glance, but once you think about it for a minute, you realise just how easily it slots into the Yakuza/Like A Dragon universe. Sure, the series is a serious crime drama, but each game has wacky encounters and over the top characters. Goro Majima, our protagonist in Pirate Yakuza, is probably the most outlandish of the main cast of the franchise, to the point that sticking him on a pirate ship and making him a captain barely even raises an eyebrow.</p>
<p><iframe title="Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B0B9NbawsHI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is set after the events of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> and, despite being a spin off, does contain major spoilers for that game. So if you have not played Infinite Wealth and want to experience the story without spoilers, get to that before Pirate Yakuza.</p>


<p>The plot in Pirate Yakuza begins with Majima washing up on a small island with a nasty case of amnesia. A young boy called Noah finds him and is set on helping Majima, but very quickly you realise that this is no ordinary island, what with all the pirates. We are talking about pirates with wooden ships armed with cannons, tricorn hats, and lots of treasure. This nautical throwback is down to the pirates searching for treasures in the waters around Hawaii, and taking refuge in the pirate cove of Madlantis – again, this is like an only slightly abnormal situation for Majima. Madlantis is a pure pirate heaven, as an NPC constantly shouts when you are docked there, full of bars, brothels, brawls, and battles. After his run in with the pirates on Rich Island – the island he washed up on – Majima makes his way to Madlantis with a crew in tow.</p>


<p>Piracy has a bit of depth to it. You can go around recruiting people to the crew, if you meet their requirements. These can range from having a sufficient pirate rank to beating them in a fight. Once someone is recruited, you can assign them to a job on your crew, matching their skill rating to a post. Crew can be assigned to the cannons, the ship’s machine guns, or to be part of the boarding party. As you find success in battles on the open sea, and in the Coliseum, experience will be earned by your crew and it does not take too long until they have an A Rank or even S Rank in their skills. The ship itself can be upgraded too with improvements to the hull and through better weapons, visiting Julie’s store once you have the right materials to have her craft things like coconut machine guns and shark cannons.</p>
<p>Once you’re feeling confident, you can sail the waters around Hawaii and other islands to search for treasure and engage in battles with other ships and crews. At first, this is fun. Firing off cannons and machine guns at incoming ships, instructing your crew to repair the ship, switching to deck mode to heal characters and fire a rocket launcher at enemy ships is decent. Then, where it is possible, boarding an enemy ship with your chosen crew to fight a large enemy group is great to see and experience too. However, eventually it all gets a bit samey and when your ship is suitably powered up and your crew levelled up, most challenges become easy enough to sweep aside. The ship’s speed on the water is rather slow too, and even the boost doesn’t feel like it speeds up that much.</p>

<p>The Pirate Coliseum is a great spectacle to witness, where you fight another ship in a massive arena, but all the glitz and glamour can’t hold off that repetitiveness for long. There is a side story here where you hunt dangerous pirates to get hold of cursed instruments, which grant Majima access to new powers to use in fights, but you can make do without them.</p>
<p>In fact, exploring Honolulu as Majima and diving into the classic Yakuza formula was much more fun. While there are much fewer sub stories than the bigger games, Honolulu still has enough to keep you entertained. You can search for treasure in the city, take on a load of bounties (which are also available in Madlantis), complete the challenges, and really dive into the silliness for which the substories are known for – My Dream Minato Girl is a particular highlight. You also have side activities returning such as Dragon Kart and Crazy Eats.</p>

<p>Pirate Yakuza’s combat is fun, with the ability to switch between two styles. You have Majima’s pirate style combat which sees him armed with two cutlasses, a hook rope, and a pistol. You also have a classic brawler style as well, which doesn’t have access to the tools and weapons of pirate style. Having played pretty much all the Yakuza games, I did notice a reduction of Heat move options, which do add an entertaining element to fights. Over the years, Majima has proven to be a creative and chaotic fighter, so a few more options to tap into that would have been welcome.</p>
<p>There is also still the issue around crafting. To get some of the new weapons you need to have the right components, and sometimes you need to craft those components. Unfortunately, you can only craft one component at a time instead doing a batch. If you need 20 quality components, for example, and have the resources to make them, you will be pressing craft 20 times. You can also reach Legends of the Sea rank very easily, and without having to set sail much at all. Just complete the standard challenges, most of which you will do without thinking, and you’ll rise up those ranks. Having it tied to the pirate side alone would have made achieving that rank an accomplishment.</p>
<p>The story is not peak Like A Dragon but it serves its purpose, giving an outlandish yet fitting reason for why Majima has lost his memory, and why so many people are searching for a lost treasure. It has both silly and serious moments, with Majima dishing out a lot of good advice to his young protégé, Noah. The new characters are a welcome addition to the franchise, and I hope that we see them appear in a mainline entry.</p>

PUBG still holds the record with 3.2 million.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds just launched a few days ago on Friday, February 28, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-is-off-to-an-amazing-start-on-pc-smashing-through-several-steam-records/1100-6529783/">got off to an amazing start on PC</a>. The game smashed previous Steam records for the franchise. For instance, Monster Hunter World only topped 300,000 concurrent players on the service, though World was not a simultaneous release with the console versions as Wilds was. Additionally, Monster Hunter Wilds saw more players on release day than Elden Ring and Cyberpunk 2077. However, despite its popularity, some PC players have experienced performance issues with the action-adventure game, leading to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mixed reviews on Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/mobile-suit-gundam-gquuuuuux-pronounce<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Despite my reputation as an anime sommelier, I’m still developing my palette for all things <em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em>. As a show of receipts, I’ve watched all of the very yuri (<a href="https://kotaku.com/gundam-witch-from-mercury-characters-lesbian-anime-1850707971" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">despite Bandai Namco’s protests</a>) <em>Revolutionary Girl Utena</em> spiritual successor, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI_BM736Unw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Witch From Mercury</em></a>, <em>Iron-Blooded Orphans</em>, <em>Thunderbolt</em>, <em>08th MS Team</em>, <em>Hathaway’s Flash</em>, stray episodes of <em>G Gundam</em> on Toonami, Netflix’s <em>Requiem For Vengeance</em> (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/netflix-gundam-requiem-for-vengeance-ending-explained-spoilers-2000515554" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regrettably</a>), roughly 13 episodes of the OG anime, and the first episode of <em>Wing</em>. All that to say, I have yet to even <a href="https://gizmodo.com/every-gundam-timeline-explained-anime-mecha-1849487550" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scratch the surface of <em>Gundam</em>’s 45-year history</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t get it twisted: The above is not a flex. It’s a cry for help from someone with intermediate-level <em>Gundam</em> enjoyer status desperately reaching across the aisle on behalf of the rest of the anime community, who’ve collectively asked themselves how the hell you pronounce the name of the new Gundam anime movie in theaters.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in December, Bandai Namco, Studio Sunrise, and Studio Khara jointly announced their three-way team-up on the next mecha series in the <em>Gundam </em>franchise. If the sheer aura of the aforementioned studios weren’t enough, it is co-written by anime juggernauts like <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>’s <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideaki Anno</a> and <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=4290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yoji Enokido</a> of <em>FLCL, Revolutionary Girl Utena</em>, and <em>Sailor Moon</em> fame. It’s directed by <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuya Tsurumaki</a> (a director for numerous <em>Evangelion </em>episodes and assistant director on <em>FLCL </em>and <em>Diebuster</em>), mecha designs from <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=3734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ikuto Yamashita</a> (<em>Evangelion </em>and <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>), and character designs by <em>Pokémon </em>illustrator, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=85937" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take</a>. The only problem is that the anime (and the compilation film of its early episodes) is called <em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Capital GQ, six Us, capped off with a distinguished capital X to tie the whole vowel-heavy thing together. Is it pronounced “jee-kuuk-ecks” like “Jeez, anime and those kooky mechas?” Do you have to have watched more anime to get it, or is there some untapped phonetic diction unuttered by meager English-speaking tongues to make sense of how to say this anime’s goddamn name? The fuck.</p><p>To make sense of this mess, I asked <a href="https://gizmodo.com/author/ursus-veritas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>io9</em>'s deputy editor James Whitbrook</a> to teach me how to say <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> and SparkNotes the significance behind its esoteric name.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption> © GKids/Bandai Namco FIlmworks<span></span><a href="https://x.com/G_GQuuuuuuX/status/1879136381609644540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunrise/Khara</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> So, what is up with the new <em>Gundam</em> anime's vowel-heavy title? How do you even pronounce that?</p><p><strong>JW:</strong> The katakana for the series title is “ジークアクス”, which is pronounced “Jīkuakusu”–we don’t have an English dub yet to see how it’s specifically pronounced, but it’s basically “G-Kwux” as we’d understand it.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> Is there lore significance behind the name, or is it simply anime nonsense?</p><p><strong>JW:</strong> It’s actually kind of both! The title itself is just a bit of stylization–it’s the official designation of the suit, but no one in the series is saying “G-Kwuuuuuuuuuuuuux” as long drawn out thing or anything. But the name itself comes from a computer science term, Qux, a metasyntactic variable in programming. “Qux” itself is a common placeholder word in coding designed to be replaced at a later date for regular use.</p><p>It makes sense for the show–not to get too deep into spoilers, but the G-Qux itself is a prototype mobile suit when we first encounter it, being used in testing a special piloting interface when it crosses paths with the protagonist, Machu.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> Is <em>Gquuuuuux</em>'s pronunciation ever brought up by the mecha animation warlords behind the series or the characters in the movie for reference?</p><p><strong>JW:</strong> Yes! It’s referred to by name quite a few times, and is referred to as the G-Qux more than it is a Gundam so far. In fact, there’s a few characters we meet early on that are also confused about its name, so it’s not just us viewers who need to get used to it.</p><figure><figcaption> © GKids/Bandai Namco FIlmworks<span></span><a href="https://x.com/G_GQuuuuuuX/status/1874108891673608415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunrise/Khara</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> Are there any other <em>Gundam</em> anime with strange names worth explaining, or is <em>Gquuuuuux</em> in a u-shaped league of its own?</p><p><strong>JW:</strong> The GQux definitely stands out as particularly odd for a mainline <em>Gundam</em>, but there’s tons of mobile suits across the franchise that have peculiar names that have just become part of the franchise, like the Palace Athene, The O, the Agguguy, the Gelgoog, the Hamma Hamma… The Universal Century shows (those set in the same continuity as the original 1979 <em>Gundam</em>) in particular love some odd names.</p><p>My personal favorites come from <em>Turn A Gundam</em>, the series’ 20th anniversary mainline entry. It’s set in a timeline heavily implied to be a far future of the original <em>Gundam</em>, so a couple of familiar mobile suits appear in the show, but the characters have no clue what their names are, so they give them totally new ones–the Capule became the Kapool, the Zaku became the Borjanon. And that’s even before you get to the show’s actually wildly-named suits, like the “WaD” Walking Dumpling, or stuff like the Mahiroo and Muttowooo. I love <em>Turn A</em>, more people should watch it.</p><hr><p>Mystery solved, and then some. Now go out onto the internet and “Um, actually” your peers into submission with your shiny new insight into the orthoepy of the new <em>Gundam</em> anime that you acquired from the good website Aftermath.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
