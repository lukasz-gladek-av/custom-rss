			<p>A few hours ago, a spiritual sequel to the best-selling game ever, Minecraft, was <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> by creator Markus 'Notch' Persson. As you might recall, Persson left Mojang after selling the studio he created to Microsoft for $2.5 billion in September 2014. The following year, he founded another game development studio called Rubberbrain, which, however, never released a game.</p>
<p>Persson relaunched it in 2024 under the new name Bitshift Entertainment. On January 1, the game designer <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> openly about Bitshift's current project (a traditional roguelike mixed with a tile-based first-person dungeon crawler) but also polled his fans to see if they'd rather him make a Minecraft spiritual successor. Which they did (78% voted for this option). Two days later, Persson shared the mindset behind this announcement:</p>
<p><em>I basically announced Minecraft 2. </em><em>I thought that maybe people ACTUALLY do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again.</em></p>
<p><em>I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I'm making one, so I figured I'd absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to Minecraft and put up a poll about it.</em></p>
<p><em>My intentions are to be clear and honest about it, saying that spiritual successors are usually kind of... you know... washed up. Tragic. The things I'm fearing my next game is going to be anyway and try to push myself to avoid. So why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even MORE cash for. </em><em>I intend for the money to be spent for good, but my god have I learned I fail a lot. Winning is failing until you make yourself succeed.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, and I also very much value being a man of my word, so I also intend to do this in a way that in no way tried to sneakily infringe on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft shittification about. </em><em>And I respect them for doing that. It's their job. And they, from what I understand, let the studio do things their way, which seems very fair to me.</em></p>
<p>When a fellow X user asked him if he'd really make Minecraft 2, he replied:</p>
<p><em>No, I'd make a similar game based on what I think the audience that says they want that game might enjoy. Probably do early access to make sure we're on track. </em><em>But I mean I still sort of think I'm just a clown getting lucky in a sea of actual talents, so I have no idea if it actually will be good. But I'll try.</em></p>
<p>Based on his track record, it would be no exaggeration to call him a one-trick pony, as Minecraft is his only real claim to fame in the game industry. Even if he does end up releasing such a game, it would inevitably be compared to his previous creation, which Mojang continuously updates for the legions of fans who still play it regularly.</p>
<p>The last content patch, The Garden Awakens, dropped in early December and added a new biome and a new mob. There are also plenty of spin-off games for those looking for different experiences, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/minecraft-dungeons-the-shallowest-depths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft Dungeons</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-legends-will-release-on-consoles-and-pc-on-april-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft Legends</a>. And A Minecraft Movie airs in theaters on April 4, 2025.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> fans think they've spotted a clue that the series' signature morality system may be making a comeback in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst developer BioWare has confirmed nothing either way - which means we can only take this with a healthy bucket of salt for now - fans like X user Kalaelizabeth believe they've spotted a sneaky nod to Mass Effect's Paragon/Renegade system hiding in plain sight.</p>

<p>Take the post embedded below, which includes an <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1722012172166025591">official promotional image</a> of the next Mass Effect game that, at first glance, may not be telling us very much at all.</p>
<p>Look a little closer, though, and you can see why fans are drawing the conclusions they are. Regardless of whether or not you believe the image is sneakily acknowledging the morality system is making a return, it's a curious image for BioWare to have shared, especially when super-imposed by the iconic Paragon symbol:</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>The flames of speculation have been further fanned by the post Kalaelizabeth was quoting.  BioWare project director and executive producer Michael Gamble recently commented on the series' long-held morality mechanic, acknowledging that although more players opted to be a Paragon - that is, a "good" Shepard - in the original trilogy, how you play is "meaningless" unless the ability to be "bad" also exists.</p>
<p>"Regarding Renegade and Paragon - yes, it’s true that more people played Paragon. But, it would have been meaningless if Renegade had not existed. The ability to choose is stronger than the number of people playing any option, IMO," Gamble tweeted (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mass-effect-5-paragon-renegade-options-return-not-confirmed/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>Does all of this mean Paragon/Renegade is "absolutely returning" for Mass Effect 5? Absolutely not. But it's arguably one of the best interpretations we've had yet as to why BioWare teased such an interesting image...</p>
<p>As for the eagerly-anticipated Mass Effect TV show? An adaptation was first touted back in 2021, when former BioWare lead writer Mac Walters explained various factors had contributed to the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-explains-why-the-mass-effect-movie-fell-by-the-wayside">shifting its initial vision of a movie adaptation toward something for the smaller screen</a>. Later that same year, reports surfaced claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-nearing-a-deal-for-mass-effect-tv-series">Amazon was "nearing a deal" for a Mass Effect TV series</a>, as part of its ongoing push into sci-fi and fantasy storytelling.</p><p>And now those reports have been confirmed. Variety revealed on the most recent N7 day - 7th November 2024 - that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">a Mass Effect TV series is now officially in development at Amazon</a>, with 10 Cloverfield Lane and Fast &amp; Furious 9 (AKA F9: The Fast Saga) scribe Daniel Casey on writing and executive producer duties.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fun-remakes-wed-love-to-see/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Remake and remaster culture continue to thrive. Countless other retro relics desperately need to be dug up and restored for a new generation, but our handpicked 2025 remakes are extra special, and would cause a big stir if announced—we can dream!</p>



<p>We’re in an era where wishes and dreams are closer to reality than ever. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/square-enix-wants-last-final-fantasy-7-remake-to-be-out-within-3-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7</a> was a remake people clamored after for years, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/glen-schofield-dead-space-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Space</a> is the horror title of our generation, making its remake more special, and Link’s Awakening brought an age-old <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-is-finally-getting-a-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zelda</a> classic into the limelight. Each year we’re seeing a plethora of remakes and remasters, and more continue to be revealed.</p>



<p>Our fondest and deepest desires are happening. Games we used to love are becoming titles to love all over again. 2025 is shaping up to be another huge year in the annals of gaming, and certain remakes could etch it in history.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-remakes-we-want-to-see-in-2025">Best Remakes we Want to See in 2025</h2>



<p>These remakes can either be a sudden shadow drop, an announcement, or an end-of-year launch. As long as we get something relating to a release or announcement, this is a big W in our books. Please devs, make our dreams come true.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-simpsons-hit-amp-run">The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The one we all want. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Simpsons had every other type of game by 2003, so why not a GTA clone? Unlike the majority of Simpsons games, Hit &amp; Run was really good, dare I say exceptional. It did what few (if any) predecessors did and gave us a chance to explore Springfield in detail. Trademarks, catchphrases, collectibles, spying bee cameras, and pure comic violence synergized to create the perfect, coherent open-world Simpsons game. The world is crying out for a remake, so for crying out loud, if we can’t have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-didnt-we-get-the-simpsons-hit-run-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hit &amp; Run 2</a>, someone put down their Duff and do it!</p>



<h3 id="h-burnout-revenge">Burnout Revenge</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Nasty. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Criterion Games was scorching hot in the mid-2000s with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/burnout-revival-possibly-coming-from-stellar-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burnout</a> franchise. This is peak arcade racing—more so than NFS: Underground 2—and we didn’t know what we had until it was gone. Burnout 3: Takedown was the turning point for the series, but after finding its niche, Burnout Revenge injected the franchise with a more potent, high-octane dose of super speedy, car-crunching action. Revenge’s introduction of Traffic Checking was revolutionary, and everything is better here.</p>



<h3 id="h-resident-evil-5">Resident Evil 5</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Chris never stops. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Resident Evil 5 feels like the awkward middle child between the genre-defining excellence of Resident Evil 4, and the ambitious and awkward nature of Resident Evil 6. It’s lost in the shuffle, and it’s a shame because Resi 5 is low-key excellent. The African setting did well and truly mark the full-blown departure from the series’ roots, and this rubbed some fans the wrong way. But the overt killing of infected enemies, spectacular action, and evolved Resi gameplay carry on Resi 4’s good work. The best detail is, you can play the campaign in co-op with Chris and Sheva. The earlier games have gotten a new gloss of bloody paint, so it’s only right a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-resident-evil-5-getting-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 5 remake</a> is next.</p>



<h3 id="h-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-amp-4">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 &amp; 4</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I feel like a teenager all over again. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>2020’s Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 was a nostalgia ride as emotional as any. Kickflipping gaps, finding secret tapes, and seeing if it’s possible to break bones with the hardest bailouts imaginable—just me? Goldfinger’s Superman alone is enough to bring a tear to your eye, and I want this feeling again with a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake. I spent hours trying to beat my high score in Pro Skater’s 3 Airport level, and don’t get me started on Zoo. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-continues-to-tease-future-pro-skater-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk is teasing future Pro Skater games</a>, but it remains to be seen if they’re remakes for 2025, even later, or not at all.</p>



<h3 id="h-god-of-war">God of War</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What an intro. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Before Kratos calmed down (ish), grew a beard, and refused to give his son a name for a while, he was a vengeful, powerful Spartan with his own army. A last-second plea to Ares changes Kratos’ life forever, and 2005’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-series-redone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> explores the Ghost of Sparta’s haunting past. There are no third-person cameras or jumping bans here, this is the pinnacle of fully-fledged hack ‘n’ slash gameplay. After playing it recently, I can assure you it holds up; the use of puzzles and special abilities makes the OG GOW a well-rounded, must-play title—and it would look stunning if remade.</p>



<h3 id="h-bioshock">Bioshock</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Creepy. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Over 15 years on, and I still have nightmares of being served up as a Splicer’s side platter. Bioshock was a groundbreaking exercise in storytelling, horror, FPS innovation, and world-building. It ignores the conventions of generic, linear-pathed shooters and creates a whole universe to become immersed in—Rapture. Big Daddys, Little Sisters, an underwater city, shocking plot twists: It’s the brainchild of someone thinking seriously outside the box. That someone is Ken Levine, and his upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/judas-gameplay-trailer-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Judas</a> is a spiritual successor to Bioshock. Maybe it’s time to infuse ourselves with one final Plasmid.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-star-wars-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With 2025 looming, Star Wars fans have a whole new year’s worth of content to look forward to. Unfortunately, 2025 isn’t shaping up to be the franchise’s biggest year. With no new movies on the docket and only one live-action series confirmed for release, the pickings are looking a little slim. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not to say there’s nothing exciting on the horizon. The release of Andor Season 2 alone is reason for Star Wars fans to celebrate like the Rebels dancing on Endor. Let’s take a closer look at what is coming in 2025, and the many Star Wars projects we hope to learn more about in the next 12 months.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Upcoming Star Wars Movie and TV Show</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Andor Returns for Season 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the big one. The Star Wars slate may be a little sparse in 2025, but it’s hard to complain too much when we’re getting a sequel to what is widely regarded as the best Star Wars project Disney has released so far. That’s right, Andor Season 2 is finally dropping in April 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 2 chronicles the second half of this deep, introspective origin story for Diego Luna’s Cassian Andor. If Season 1 was the story of how a young Cassian became radicalized and joined the fledgling Rebel Alliance, then Season 2 will show us the dangerous missions he undertook leading up to the events of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fittingly, with the series moving closer to the time period of Rogue One, we’ll see more familiar faces from that movie pop up in Season 2. Most notably, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-2025-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-k-2so-in-star-wars-andor-season-2-and-the-alien-earth-tv-show"><u>Alan Tudyk will reprise the role of K-2SO</u></a>, as we learn how Cassian first met this eccentric Imperial assassin droid. We’re also looking forward to seeing Ben Mendelsohn don his cape once more as Death Star project manager Director Orson Krennic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans can expect Season 2 to cover a lot of ground, with multiple time jumps unfolding over the course of the season and the final batch of episodes <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/tv/news/andor-season-2-final-three-episodes-cover-three-days-before-rogue-one-exclusive/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>set in the days leading up to Rogue One</u></a>. In other words, don’t expect a Season 3. But do expect a Star Wars story that continues to explore the ordinary men and women who lit the spark of rebellion in a time of great darkness. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">More Star Wars: Visions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">More Andor is great, but what about the animated side of things? With The Bad Batch wrapping up in 2024, the one Star Wars animated series confirmed to return in 2025 is Star Wars: Visions. Once again, fans will be treated to an anthology of animated shorts featuring various animation studios interpreting the mythology of Star Wars through their own, unique lens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 3 is said to bring Visions back to its roots as an anime anthology, whereas Season 2 took more of a global approach. The studios involved in Season 3 include Cyberpunk Edgerunners’ Studio Trigger and Attack on Titan’s WIT Studio, along with David Production, Kamikaze Douga, ANIMA, Kinema Citrus Co., Polygon Pictures, Production I.G, and Project Studio Q.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Will There Be More Star Wars TV?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">However much we’re looking forward to more of Star Wars: Andor and Star Wars: Visions, there’s no getting around the fact that 2025 is looking pretty thin on the Star Wars TV front compared to previous years. In 2024 alone we got two live-action shows in The Acolyte and Skeleton Crew and two animated series in The Bad Batch: Season 3 and Tales of the Empire. But in 2025, we only have one confirmed live-action series and one animated series, plus the final two episodes of Skeleton Crew.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is there a chance Disney has more shows planned we don’t know about? Possibly, at least on the animated front. Don’t forget that we only learned about the existence of Tales of the Empire a month before it dropped on Disney+ in May 2024. It’s entirely possible that they could pull the same trick again in 2025, announcing another “Tales of” anthology series to follow up Tales of the Empire and Tales of the Jedi.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also the question of whether Disney has any long-form Star Wars animated projects in development right now. With The Bad Batch wrapping up last year, we have to imagine that Dave Filoni and others have been hard at work crafting the next great Star Wars animated saga. We probably won’t see that series release in 2025, but it’s possible we’ll at least get an announcement and maybe even see some early footage. That could be one of the big announcements at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-celebration-2025-will-take-place-in-japan"><u>Star Wars Celebration Japan in April</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But on the live-action front, don’t expect any big surprises in 2025. The Acolyte was officially canceled, and with The Mandalorian saga continuing on the big screen, we don’t even know if The Mandalorian: Season 4 is ever happening. That just leaves Ahsoka: Season 2, and that series isn’t returning until 2026 at least. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The End of the High Republic</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If things are looking a little barren on the live-action Star Wars front right now, the same certainly can’t be said for the publishing side of things. Fans of the Star Wars books and comics will be eating very well in 2025, particularly those following Lucasfilm Publishing’s High Republic saga. For the past several years, these books and comics have been exploring the triumphs and tribulations of the Jedi hundreds of years before the Star Wars movies, and it all comes to an end soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look for several major High Republic novels to be released in 2025, including Charles Soule’s The High Republic: Trials of the Jedi, Claudia Gray’s The High Republic: Into the Light, and Justina Ireland’s The High Republic: A Valiant Vow. Of these, Trials of the Jedi is the one most worth keeping an eye on, as it serves as the climax of the entire High Republic initiative. This novel will chronicle the final battle between the Jedi and the Nihil and the Nameless. Look for Trials of the Jedi to be released on June 17.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/20/star-wars-the-high-republic-phase-three-trials-of-the-jedi-v0-zp0zo36nupsa1-1734720411627.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Not to be outdone, Marvel Comics has quite an ambitious Star Wars lineup planned for 2025. In 2024, most of Marvel’s ongoing Star Wars comics were exploring the period between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Now that those books have ended, Marvel is casting a wider net and branching out to multiple Star Wars eras in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kicking things off, look for Marvel to wrap up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-star-wars-comics-battle-of-jakku-return-of-the-jedi"><u>the limited series Star Wars: The Battle of Jakku</u></a> in January. This series has been busy fleshing out the final major battle between the dying Empire and the New Republic two years after Return of the Jedi, and we’ll see the climax unfold in writer Alex Segura and artist Jethro Morales and Leonard Kirk’s The Battle of Jakku: Last Stand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From there, Marvel is veering in two wildly different directions with its newest ongoing Star Wars comics. First, writer Marc Guggenheim and artist Madibek Musabekov are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-comics-star-wars-jedi-knights-series-phantom-menace-nycc-2024"><u>heading to the Prequel era in Star Wars: Jedi Knights</u></a>. Set before the events of The Phantom Menace, the series will follow numerous members of the Jedi Order, including Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Mace Windu, and Shaak Ti. The series even focuses on Count Dooku before his defection from the Jedi Order.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Star Wars: Legacy of Vader - Preview Art Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Marvel is venturing deep into the era of the Sequel Trilogy for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-reveals-star-wars-legacy-of-vader-series-starring-kylo-ren"><u>Charles Soule and Luke Ross’ Star Wars: Legacy of Vader</u></a>. Set in between The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker, the series explores Kylo Ren’s struggle as the newly crowned Supreme Leader of the First Order and his quest to recommit himself to the Dark Side following his battles with Rey and Luke Skywalker. Soule previously fleshed out Ben Solo’s Dark Side origins in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-true-origin-of-kylo-ren-and-his-crossgaurd-lightsaber-revealed">2020’s Star Wars: The Rise of Kylo Ren</a>, so consider this a sequel of sorts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have to assume these aren’t the only new Star Wars comics Marvel will be launching in 2025, as the publisher has tended to publish four or five ongoing titles at any given time. Will Doctor Aphra get another solo series? Will we see other books fleshing out the blank canvas that is the post-Return of the Jedi era? Only time will tell on that front. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Future of Star Wars Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If 2025 is shaping up to be a relatively quiet year on the movie and TV front, it’s not looking any better in terms of video game releases. In fact, there are no Star Wars games confirmed for release in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">About all fans have to look forward to at the moment is new DLC for Star Wars Outlaws. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-season-pass-roadmap-revealed-along-with-two-story-packs"><u>According to Ubisoft’s DLC roadmap</u></a>, fans can expect a new story campaign called “A Pirate’s Fortune” to release in Spring 2025. This campaign focuses on fan-favorite pirate villain (or perhaps he’s more of an anti-hero) Hondo Ohnaka as he bumps into Kay Vess.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has yet to reveal what, if any, new Outlaws content is planned beyond “A Pirate’s Fortune.” Are there even more adventures planned for Kay and her motley crew, or do the lukewarm sales numbers spell doom for Outlaws’ ongoing future? We’ll have to wait for future announcements to learn more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, all we can do is hope that 2025 brings with it news about other upcoming Star Wars games. We know EA is developing a third game in the Star Wars Jedi series. But with there being four years between the release of 2019’s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and 2023’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, it’s probably too much to hope the new game will actually release in 2025. At best, we might see early footage of the game and get a better idea of when in the Star Wars timeline it takes place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re also crossing our fingers for news on the oft-delayed remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch confirmed in 2024 that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-says-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well"><u>the game is still in active development</u></a>, despite rumors to the contrary. But what state is the game in right now, and when will we see footage of the remake in action? Hopefully, 2025 brings with it some good news on the KOTOR front.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s not forget Quantic Dream’s Star Wars: Eclipse, another title that was announced and then seemingly vanished off the face of the Earth. Will 2025 be the year Eclipse finally rears its head again, or will it go the way of so many other canceled Star Wars projects?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What About the Star Wars Movies? </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 won’t deliver any new Star Wars theatrical releases, which at this point is nothing new. On the theatrical side, the franchise has been dormant since the release of The Rise of Skywalker back in 2019. But that’s not to say Lucasfilm hasn’t announced plenty of new Star Wars movies in recent years. It’s worth looking at what’s currently in the pipeline and how likely we are to get an update in 2025.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">First, there’s the lone Star Wars movie that’s actually in production right now, The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu. This big-screen spinoff of The Mandalorian continues the shared story of the two heroes after the events of The Mandalorian: Season 3. Co-creator Jon Favreau is directing the film, which is currently slated for release on May 22, 2026. With any luck, we should see a teaser trailer for the film at some point in 2025, possibly as early as Star Wars Celebration Japan.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dave Filoni’s Mando-Verse Movie</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Not to be outdone, Favreau’s partner Dave Filoni is directing his own live-action movie, one expected to tie together characters and threads from The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, The Book of Boba Fett, and other projects from that era. Don’t expect much news on this movie in the foreseeable future, however, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ahsoka-season-2-is-officially-in-development">Filoni has to focus on Ahsoka: Season 2 first</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">James Mangold’s Star Wars Movie</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Logan director James Mangold is helming a movie set in the distant past of the Star Wars universe, revealing the origins of the Jedi Order and reportedly featuring a “Biblical” scope. Lucasfilm may announce a writer for the movie in 2025, but don’t expect more updates than that. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy's New Jedi Order Movie</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Daisy Ridley is reprising the role of Rey Skywalker in a new movie set 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker. Ms. Marvel’s Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy is directing. Hopefully, we’ll see some updates about the film in 2025, but it’s unclear where in the pipeline it currently falls.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Simon Kinberg’s Star Wars Trilogy</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">X-Men producer Simon Kinberg has been tapped to oversee a new trilogy of Star Wars movies. Despite early rumors the trilogy will directly continue the Skywalker Saga, IGN was able to confirm <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-star-wars-trilogy-in-the-works-from-x-men-producer-simon-kinberg"><u>it’s instead meant to focus on a new storyline</u></a>. It’s still early days on this project, so we’re not expecting to hear much about Kinberg’s trilogy in 2025.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Taika Waititi’s Star Wars Movie</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Thor: Ragnarok’s Taika Waititi is apparently still set to venture into the Star Wars universe, though it’s been years since we’ve gotten any substantive updates on this mysterious project. Will that finally change in 2025? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s what you can expect from the Star Wars franchise in 2025. It’s a relatively quiet year, but there are still some very cool projects for fans to look forward to in the new year. What Star Wars story are you most excited to experience in 2025?

            <p>Markus "Notch" Persson has "basically announced" Minecraft 2.</p>
<p>In an X exchange over the New Year, Persson invited his millions of followers to indicate which project they'd like him to focus on in 2025 - a traditional roguelike mixed with a "tile-based first-person dungeon crawler" or a "spiritual successor" to Minecraft.</p>

<p>In the post asking for "honest and legitimate [...] feedback for once", Persson explained briefly what his dungeon crawler would entail, but then admitted, "but then I gots to thinking that maybe there are people who like my work but might not share my taste in retro nostalgia and would prefer for me to make a spiritual successor thing to Minecraft, and I mean sure, I'd take that cash".</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Honest and legitimate request for feedback for once:</p><p>The new game I'm passionately working on is currently set to be a traditional roguelike (i.e. ADOM, nethack, etc) mixed with a tile based first person dungeon crawler (ie Legend of Grimrock (esp 2), Eye of the Beholder)</p><p>But…</p></div>— notch (@notch) <a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>At the time of writing, almost a quarter of a million of his followers have left a vote, 78 percent of which have, perhaps unsurprisingly, been in favour of a new Minecraft game, even though he'd asked people to "[please] vote potion. You can do this Zoomers, it's actually super cosy.</p>
<p>"Kinda feels like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, but more diagonal door kicking," Notch added.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>A few days later, responding to commenters who missed his original posting, Persson summarised what had happened, saying: "I basically announced Minecraft 2. I thought that maybe people ACTUALLY do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again.</p>
<p>"I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I'm making one, so I figured I'd absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to Minecraft and put up a poll about it.</p><p>"My intentions are to be clear and honest about it, saying that spiritual successors are usually kind of... you know... washed up. Tragic," he added. "The things I'm fearing my next game is going to be anyway and try to push myself to avoid. So why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even MORE cash for.</p>
<p>"I intend for the money to the [sic] spent for good, but my God, have I learned I fail a lot. Winning is failing until you make yourself succeed."</p>
<p>Persson <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874532193227473093">added</a> that he had no non-compete clause in the sale of Minecraft to Microsoft - "there was a one-year period where I couldn't make a game with modifiable terrain or something like that, but I was off in the Maldives during all that, didn't affect any creative decisions" - but did acknowledge that using the Minecraft name "would be super illegal".</p>
<p>"Instead, I'd make a new original game of the same type as Minecraft and call it something else," he <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874523772734390380">said</a>. "These are traditionally sometimes referred to as 'spiritual successors', but usually kinda mostly feel a bit flat.</p>
<p>"But, like, if that's actually what people want, I would LOVE to make that game. It'd be my Gremlins 2."</p>
<p>Persson also said that as "a man of [his] word", he intended "to do this in a way that in no way tried to sneakily infringe on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft shittification about".</p>
<p>"And I respect them for doing that. It's their job. And they, from what I understand, let the studio do things their way, which seems very fair to me," he added.</p>
<p>It's been a busy time for Minecraft. At the end of last year, the game finally received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-years-after-ps5s-launch-minecraft-finally-gets-a-native-version">PlayStation 5 native version</a>, announced it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ditching-psvr-support-minecraft-is-officially-abandoning-vr-on-pc-from-next-year">ditch PC VR support</a>, and confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-attractions-set-to-open-in-uk-and-us-as-85m-deal-with-alton-towers-owner-signed">plans to launch Minecraft theme park areas in the US and UK</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The first few days of a year are always a bit sleepy in the game’s industry. It takes a little while for those press releases to start rolling in, for the announcements and trailers to drop, and developers and publishers alike are wary of launching too soon after everyone’s Christmas spending. So, it’s a quiet week for this round-up, but here’s what’s happened.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>Naturally, there hasn’t been all that much news in the past few weeks, so here’s the sum total of our reporting:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Game of the Year 2024</h2>
<p>We ran our Game of the Year awards around Christmas, as we always do, building up to our GOTY reveal on New Years Eve. Astro Bot and Metaphor: ReFantazio were both very heavily featured, but which took home the overall award?</p>

<p>So… that’s just about it for this weekend. Things will no doubt pick up next week, not least because of CES bringing some GPU announcements from Nvidia and AMD. We’ll see you then!</p>

But slow news hardly means no news, and we kicked off the new year with a look at the games to keep an eye out for this month. Also, the chief creative officer at Arrowhead, the studio behind <em>Helldivers 2</em>, chimed in on “DEI” in games in an online exchange, the devs of <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>hinted at why last year’s blockbuster has yet to arrive on Xbox, and the folks behind a stunning fan remake of <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion </em>using the <em>Skyrim </em>engine announced that we can expect that massive project to release this year.

<p>In a lengthy post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-gavin-441765_why-did-we-sell-naughty-dog-its-a-question-activity-7277011334121058305-JZKz/">LinkedIn</a>, Gavin cited the spiralling costs of game development as one of the reasons the studio was sold, saying "a systemic issue in the AAA space" wherein developers "almost never have the resources to fund their own games [...] gives publishers enormous leverage".</p>

<p>"Why did we sell Naughty Dog? It's a question I've been asked countless times. The answer is simple: budgets were skyrocketing," Gavin - who worked at Naughty Dog for almost 20 years before leaving in 2004 - said (via <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/522635/article/naughty-dog-co-founder-reveals-why-they-were-acquired-by-sony/">Gameranx</a>).</p><p>"When we started Naughty Dog in the 1980s, game development expenses were manageable. We bootstrapped everything, pouring profits from one game into the next. Our early 80s games cost less than $50,000 each to make. Rings of Power ('88-91), saw budgets rise to about $100,000, but yielded slightly more than that in after tax profits in 1992.</p>
<p>"In 1993, we rolled that $100k from Rings into a self-funded Way of the Warrior. But Crash Bandicoot ('94-96) cost $1.6 million to make. By the time we got to Jak and Daxter ('99-01), the budget busted the $15 million mark.</p>
<p>"By 2004, the cost of AAA games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jak-3">Jak 3</a> had soared to $45-50 million - and they have been rising ever since," Gavin added. "But back in 2000, we were still self-funding every project, and the stress of financing these ballooning budgets independently was enormous.</p>
<p>"It wasn't just us. This was (and still is) a systemic issue in the AAA space. Developers almost never have the resources to fund their own games, which gives publishers enormous leverage. Selling to Sony wasn't just about securing a financial future for Naughty Dog. It was about giving the studio the resources to keep making the best games possible, without being crushed by the weight of skyrocketing costs and the paralysing fear that one slip would ruin it all.</p>
<p>"Looking back, it was the right call."</p>
<p>Gavin ended by admitting that "AAA games have only gotten more expensive since then", citing costs for today's big-budget games "easily" top "$300, $400, or even $500 million".</p>
<p>"Would we have been able to keep up? Maybe. But selling - to the right party - gave Naughty Dog the stability it needed to thrive and to continue making the kinds of games we'd always dreamed of!"</p>
<p>Several months after studio lead Neil Druckmann confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">Naughty Dog had a number of games in the works</a>, the team has lifted the lid on its next, all-new title: Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet for PS5.</p>
<p>"Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic puts players into the role of Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago," teases the blurb.</p>
<p>"Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit," reads the game's official blurb."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> Nightreign will not include the game's signature in-game messaging system because there will be "no time" to read or write messages.</p>
<p>Whilst Nightreign's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-is-making-more-elden-ring-after-all-with-the-co-op-elden-ring-night-reign">announcement trailer</a> featured plenty of familiar elements like sites of grace and Evergaols - as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms">enemies from Dark Souls</a> like The Nameless King from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> - Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed the studio is pulling its in-game communication because with sessions around 40-minutes long, there simply isn't any time to waste.</p>

<p>"You can still see the ghosts of other players, but the ability to leave messages has been removed," Ishizaki told <a href="https://jp.ign.com/elden-ring-nightreign/77870/interview/elden-ring-nightreign-403rpg">IGN Japan</a> via machine translation.</p>
<p>"The reason we removed the message feature is that in this game, where each session is about 40 minutes long, there is no time to write your own message, and no time to read messages written by others."</p>
<p>"The concept was to make a 'condensed RPG'. RPGs have their ups and downs, and players sometimes gain and sometimes lose," Ishizaki added. "I think the best part of RPGs is that all of these experiences ultimately come to fruition. In order to create a harmonious experience that allows players to experience the true essence of RPGs, each game took place over three days."</p><p>Interestingly, this means defeated foes will not revive during the match - not even when you rest at a site of grace - and although ashes will make an appearance in Nightreign, how they're "handled" will differ from the original Elden Ring game.</p>
<p>The interview also revealed that Miyazaki was involved "up until the creation of the initial concept" for Nightreign, but he has since stepped aside for the new director, who has been at FromSoft since 2011.</p>
<p>"Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign is a very exciting game that will excite players," Ishizaki concluded. "It will provide a sense of accomplishment and joy that is different from previous titles, so please look forward to it."</p>
<p>ICYMI, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-co-op-spin-off-nightreign-network-test-announced-and-you-can-register-for-it-soon">network test for Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> will take place in February, with registration beginning on 10th January.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/04/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-40-to-36/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-40-to-36.1073889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/04/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-40-to-36/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Just like the music charts, we are now entering the Top 40 of the games we are looking forward to this year. The countdown here may throw up some surprises, with games maybe not being where you would expect them to be in this countdown. Without further ado, let us commence the Top 40 countdown with a musical number…</p>
<h2>40 – Ratatan</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, NSW, PC – TBC</em></p>
<p>Patapon lovers, rejoice! Revealed towards the end of 2024, producer Hiroyuki Kotani announced a spiritual follow up to Patapon with Ratatan. Ratatan is a rhythm roguelike action game, that will combine the beat of the music with the action on screen, with up to 100 characters fighting on screen at any one time. Players can also play in four player co-op.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ratatan Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HR9r-LXLGnI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>RATATAN’s roguelike element comes from the fact that after each battle players are rewarded with different power ups and awards, with these changing on each run. Ratatan is accompanied by Cobuns, and it is they who get these power ups to use in battles and trials that are on their path.</p>

<h2>39 – Hell Is Us</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC</em></p>
<p>Hell Is Us was<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/04/12/hell-is-us-nacon-trailer/"> first announced back in 2022</a>, and after a long period of quiet development, we were treated to 1<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/01/15-minute-hell-is-us-gameplay-video-explains-lack-of-maps-and-quest-markers/">5 minutes of gameplay</a> in October that gave us a good long look into the world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell is Us - Gameplay Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/it9wGffvYGM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hell Is Us is set in the fictional country of Hadea, which has been torn apart by war. Players will have to explore the world with melee weapons and a drone, which will help navigate as well as face off the dangerous creatures that wander it. Players won’t be able to rely on map markers and waypoints, instead having to learn the world itself and pay attention to everything happening in it, and listen to what people are saying to figure it out.</p>
<h2>38 – Dragon Quest 1&amp;2 HD</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Probably the shortest entry on this list as there is so little official information on it, and yet such surety of what this will offer. These remakes of the earliest Dragon Quest games were announced back in June alongside a re-reveal for Dragon Quest III HD-2D, a long in development project that built up to release in November getting a<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/"> 9/10 in our review.</a></p>
<p>Dragon Quest 1&amp;2 HD will continue the narrative chronologically, and it is likely it will have the same features as Dragon Quest III HD-2D, including HD-2D graphics, an improved battle system, and a large world to explore.</p>
<h2>37 – Eternal Strands</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 28th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Eternal Strands is another one that is coming early in 2025. This month, in fact. Eternal Strands has a huge and expansive open world that can all be explored, which is called the Enclave. Unfortunately, the Enclave has largely been invaded and taken over by a force known as the Surgeborn, an otherworldly enemy that has trapped the people in a smaller and smaller corner of it.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Eternal Strands - Release Date Trailer | Yellow Brick Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhMT5IWrTlk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Enter the Weaver, Brynn. She is on a mission to push back the Surgeborn, liberating the Enclave from their incursion. It will not be an easy fight as the Surgeborn consist of towering creatures that will prove a challenge to take down. However, Brynn has access to weapons and magical abilities to fight back, as well as being able to use the environment to help her. You can use enemy attacks against each other as well to even the odds. The world can be manipulated so new paths can be created showing hidden parts of the Enclave. Be careful though, as the world is dangerous and destructible.</p>
<h2>36 – Pokémon Legends Z-A</h2>
<p><em>NSW – 2025</em></p>
<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A was announced back in February 2024, another spin off following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends Arceus</a>. However, where that game jumped back hundreds of years in time, Pokémon Legends Z-A is set in a modern setting and swaps the wilds for one city setting, that being the Paris inspired Lumiose City. The city itself is undergoing a major redevelopment plan to make it easier for Pokémon and people to co-exist within it.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A releases simultaneously worldwide in 2025!​" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uq-Znr_jGIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That will mean Pokémon will be roaming around Lumiose City, so you will be trying to catch them all as people go about their lives. We do know Mega Evolutions will return, and… that is pretty much all we do know!</p>
<p>There have been no further official updates regarding the starter Pokemon, how the gameplay will work, and what the city will look like. What we can say is that Pokémon Legends Z-A is expected in 2025 for the Switch, and we’d bet it’s a cross-gen game for Switch 2 as well.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warhammer Orruk Warclans New Releases Review - Waaagh!]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-orruk-warclans-new-releases-review-waaagh</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-orruk-warclans-new-releases-review-waaagh.1073886/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-orruk-warclans-new-releases-review-waaagh<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When the Waaagh! bells begin to ring, there's no more terrifying sound for civilized society. But for the Orruk Warclans, it's sweet, sweet music! Games Workshop sent us a few new&nbsp;<em>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</em> Orruk Warclans releases, along with their updated Battletome, to check out - so follow along for our thoughts! (Psst... stick around to the end for new&nbsp;<em>Bloodbowl</em>&nbsp;releases!)</p>

<h2>Battletome: Orruk Warclans</h2>

<p>Let's start with the wonderfully aggressive&nbsp;<em>Battletome: Orruk Warclans</em>, which reintroduces the army into the newest edition of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</em>&nbsp;(we <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-review-perfect-starter-set" rel="nofollow">reviewed the new edition with the release of the&nbsp;<em>Skaventide</em>&nbsp;box set</a>). Over 120 pages long, this&nbsp;<em>Battletome</em>&nbsp;covers everything you need to know to play with the Orruk Warclans army. The first 76 pages are devoted to backgrounds and lore for the army, including information on various clans, how the Orruks see the world (generally as a place to fight), and more.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-battletome.jpg?itok=bcio2SZD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-battletome.jpg?itok=XTgiNxEC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From there we get into the rules, and there are distinct sections for both the Ironjawz faction and the Kruleboyz faction. I can't show screengrabs from my review PDF of the Battletome, so I'll summarize some of my favorite bits here.</p>

<p>For the Ironjawz, there are brand new battle traits that key off of their aggressive nature, with one allowing a friendly Ironjawz unit to move up to 3" (including moving into combat), and the other allowing a friendly Ironjawz Hero to add 1 to charge rolls and 1 to their Attacks characteristic of their melee weapons.</p>

<p>There are also Battle Formations (you can pick one) which allow them to add 1 to attack rolls for a unit that rolled high on their charge roll, give them Ward (6+) when they're near Ironjawz Wizards and Priests, and more! There are also Artefacts of Power like Trophy Skulls (which add 10 to the unit's control score, not bad!), and spells like "Da Great Big Green Hand Of Gork" which, along with winning the award for the best name of a spell, allow you to teleport a unit halfway across the battlefield.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-ironjawz-medium.jpeg?itok=ue3_Ixv1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-ironjawz-medium.jpeg?itok=rY3x3Em9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For the Kruleboyz, there are plenty of dirty tricks they can employ (with a successful dirty trick roll), allowing them to sneak around the battlefield, use venom-encrusted weapons to score crits on rolls of 5+, and more. Their battle formations allow them to hide near terrain features, boost the range of ranged weapons (not that&nbsp;<em>too</em>&nbsp;many units are interested in ranged here), and more.</p>

<p>Their Artefacts of Power include Mork's Eye Pebble, which gives them Ward (5+) for the rest of the turn, the ability to boost a wizard up with a Swamp Staff, and stinging ash that makes it harder for your enemies to hit you. Along with updated unit profiles, rules for Spearhead and campaign play, and so much more - if you run a Orruk Warclans army, you really can't afford to skip the new&nbsp;<em>Battletome</em><em>: Orruk Warclans</em>.</p>

<p>Now let's take a look at some of the new models we received!</p>

<h2>Warhammer Orruk Warclans - Hobgrot Slittaboss</h2>

<p>For when your Kruleboyz need some leadership - and I use that term&nbsp;<em>very&nbsp;</em>loosely when talking about the Orruk Warclans - you can now look to the Hobgrot Slittaboss, a real mean little dude with a Toxin-smeared Slitta-sword (ouch!). He's got two nasty abilities.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-hobgrot-slittaboss.jpg?itok=0v2sos5p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-hobgrot-slittaboss.jpg?itok=r_jFICgS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>First up is the Kompany Taktikz (these spellings are driving my spellcheck insane) ability, which triggers after you've declared a Fight action with this unit. In doing so, you can then allow another friendly Hobgrot Slittaz unit in his command range to immediately fight after he fights, adding 1 to their wound rolls.</p>

<p>There's also the potentially devastating Toxic Stash ability, which can be used once per battle. This ability allows you to pick an enemy unit currently in combat with the Slittaboss and roll 2D6, if you roll higher than the target's health characteristic... they're immediately destroyed! All in all, I think this leader does what I want a Orruk leader to do - some light unit benefits, with a big old nasty attack up his sleeve. From here, we move onto some fun terrain/manifestations for the army.</p>

<h2>Warhammer Orruk Warclans -&nbsp;Bossrokk Tower/Skaregob Totem</h2>

<p>This absolutely towering piece of terrain can be put together either as a Bossrokk Tower (if you're running an Ironjawz army) or as a Skaregob Totem for you Kruleboyz players. I built it as a Bossrokk Tower, but both builds are easy to assemble considering their size and amount of component parts.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-bossrokk-tower.jpg?itok=pRfZaG_N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-bossrokk-tower.jpg?itok=beEJvB34 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As a Bossrock Tower, which has 12 Health and a 4+ save, you'll move an Infantry Hero onto it and from then on all attacks against them will target the Tower. The Tower also boasts the "Aggressively Bossy" ability, which effects a visible enemy unit within 18" of the Tower. The Tower is surprisingly defensive (which makes sense as its a Tower, but doesn't make sense as this is the Orruks we're talking about), and can subtract from an enemy's control score, subtract 1 from casting rolls, or even subtract 1 from the number of dice rolled when making charge rolls!</p>

<p>As a Skaregob Tower, you'll really only want to use this if you're all-in on Kruleboyz' dirty tricks, as it adds 1 to your dirty trick rolls and can extend the range of said tricks to 18". Of the two, the Bossrokk Tower definitely packs more of a punch, but it still looks extremely cool on the tabletop in any configuration.</p>

<h2>Warhammer Orruk Warclans Manifestations</h2>

<p>Next up is a collection of Manifestation spells that you can cast with both Ironjawz or Kruleboyz factions, adding a bit of fun chaos to your army.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-foot-of-gork.jpg?itok=iann9cbA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-foot-of-gork.jpg?itok=jZdBuoLt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Let's start here with the Foot of Gork, the only spell you can rely on to put a big, stinky foot on the battlefield. Coming in two parts as you can see from the image above, these big footprints wander around the battlefield, stomping enemies where they land. These stomped units lose 1 of their charge dice, seriously slowing down your enemies!</p>

This, with proper rolls, speeds up nearby armies, allowing them to add (with good enough rolls) additional value to their charge rolls. Sort of like the opposite of the big foot!</p>

First up, any enemy unit within 3" of the Marsh subtracts 3 from their control scores (which could be huge with proper placement). Secondly, enemy units cannot use Run abilities when they're within 6" of this Manifestation.</p>

<p>All in all, these Manifestations are really fun ways to utterly mess with the tempo of the game - much to the advantage of a charge-happy Orruk Warclans army. This isn't really the kind of utility I think of when I think about running Orruks, but seeing it all laid out here I can really appreciate a path forward with the Warclans where you're stifling your enemy's movement and rolling over them like a tide of blades and jawz.</p>

<h2>BONUS! New <em>Bloodbowl</em> Releases!</h2>

<p>In addition to all this great Orruk Warclans content, I also got to check out the new&nbsp;<em>Spike! Presents: 2024 Almanac!</em>&nbsp;and two new models for&nbsp;<em>Bloodbowl</em>, Rowana Forestfoot and Rashnak Backstabber.</p>

<h3><em>Spike! Presents: 2024 Almanac! and New Models</em></h3>

<p>Mostly focused on the Vampire, Gnome, and Chaos Dwarf teams, the new&nbsp;<em>Spike! Presents: 2024 Almanac!</em>&nbsp;offers a veritable feast for&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>&nbsp;players.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-2024-almanac.jpg?itok=hV7w8ozt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-2024-almanac.jpg?itok=JwCG40X9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each of the three above-mentioned teams get updated rules and little bonuses. I won't go through them all here but to highlight some of the juiciest bits, for the Vampires, you can now run a Vampire Lord as your head coach, who can recruit a new thrall in the post-game sequence if you've killed a specific kind of enemy player during the match. They also have the Bloodlust rule, which effectively says that if they roll poorly after taking an action, they have to bite a nearby friendly thrall to feed!</p>

<p>For the gnomes, a new trait called "My Ball" means that the player holding the ball cannot willingly give up the ball under any circumstances - so long to handing off the ball when in a tight spot! They also have the new Trickster trait, which says when a Gnome is about to be hit by a block action they can move one adjacent square! Very tricky indeed!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-rowana-forestfoot.jpg?itok=JWmWezby 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-rowana-forestfoot.jpg?itok=PhyDhvIo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Also included is one of the models we received, Rowana Forestfoot, who sits atop an elk! I LOVE the look of this model, and her special ability "Bounding Leap" allows her to take no penalties to an Agility test while leaping, and she can even re-roll the result.</p>

<p>Finally, the Chaos Dwarves get the new Breathe Fire special trait, allowing them to attempt to blast an opponent with a ball of mouthy fire. On a good enough roll, they make their opponent go prone (and with a roll of a 6, the target is Knocked Down). They also have an update to their Iron Hard Skin skill, which reads" Opposing players cannot modify any Armour rolls made against this player. In addition, the Claws skill cannot be used when making an Armour roll against this player."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-rashnak-backstabber.jpg?itok=U9nmj3dM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-rashnak-backstabber.jpg?itok=ori0Bnzm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, in addition to the Almanac and Rowanna, I also got to check out another new Star Player, Rashnak Backstabber. This Hobgoblin plays the Sneaky Stabba position, and has the special rule "Toxic Connoisseur," which reads: "Once per game, when Rashnak successfully breaks an opposition player's armour as a result of a Stab Special action, you may apply an additional +1 modifier to the Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.</p>

<p>Nastiness all around! For fans of&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>&nbsp;a new year always sees an exciting new Almanac, and I think this year's edition is one of the most useful for fans of the three featured armies. Everything I've written above is just the smallest little sample of what's included, so I'll leave it to you to dive in to see more Star Players, more sample lineups, point buy values for these armies, and so much more.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Over the next few weeks we'll see more exciting new releases from Games Workshop I can't talk about yet, which will be a little less "all over the place" than this week's batch of fresh entries. But even so, I don't see how you could be disappointed as either an Orruk Warclans player or a&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>&nbsp;fan. These new releases give fans exactly what they're looking for - and while they won't be of much value if you don't field Orruk or play&nbsp;<em>BB</em>, for those interested this is going to feel like a real touchdown. Waaagh!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/why-naughty-dog-was-acquired-by-sony/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2001, Naughty Dog was acquired by Sony for an undisclosed amount after the two companies had worked together on Crash Bandicoot in the 1990s. Recently, one of the co-founders of Naughty Dog, one of the most iconic modern gaming studios, revealed exactly <strong>why </strong>the studio was happy to be acquired by Sony.</p>



<p>In a post on LinkedIn, Andrew Gavin explained that it was all down to the stress of managing budgets.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-makes-the-world-go-around">It Makes The World Go Around</h2>



<p>Andrew Gavin and Jason Rubin founded Naughty Dog in 1984, creating a few forgettable (or never-heard-of) titles before moving into the success stakes with the likes of Crash Bandicoot in the 1990s. From there, the studio blossomed, with the team coming up with Jak and Daxter, Uncharted, and The Last of Us.</p>



<p>For the longest time, Naughty Dog has been a Sony studio. It was one of the earliest acquisitions made by the tech titan, and it has proven to be one of the most fruitful purchases the Japanese firm ever made.</p>



<p>In a recent post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-gavin-441765_why-did-we-sell-naughty-dog-its-a-question-activity-7277011334121058305-JZKz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on LinkedIn</a> (found by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/522635/article/naughty-dog-co-founder-reveals-why-they-were-acquired-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>), Andrew Gavin, one of the co-founders of Naughty Dog, explained why they were eager to accept an acquisition by Sony in 2001:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Back in 2000, we were still self-funding every project, and the stress of financing these ballooning budgets independently was enormous. It wasn’t just us. This was (and still is) a systemic issue in the AAA space. Developers almost never have the resources to fund their own games, which gives publishers enormous leverage.</p>



<p>Selling to Sony wasn’t just about securing a financial future for Naughty Dog. It was about giving the studio the resources to keep making the best games possible, without being crushed by the weight of skyrocketing costs and the paralyzing fear that one slip would ruin it all.</p>



<p>Looking back, it was the right call. AAA games have only gotten more expensive since then. Today’s big budget games can easily cost $300, $400, or even $500 million to develop.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gavin went on to suggest that Naughty Dog <strong>might </strong>have been able to ‘keep up’, but selling to Sony allowed the studio ‘to thrive’.</p>



<p>Today, Naughty Dog is one of the most recognised and awarded studios on Earth.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/esports-betting-100-million-customers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A research group has estimated that the esports betting industry could accommodate up to 100 million customers by 2029, marking an increase of almost 30 million users from today. It’s no big secret that esports betting is a major revenue driver in the world of competitive gaming, but these predictions suggest up to 60% of all revenue will be associated with betting by 2029.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-money">Big Money</h2>



<p>From data collected by Statista and leaned on by BetIdeas, it has been estimated that approximately 74 million people worldwide take part in esports betting, in some capacity. This figure is expected to swell to around 95.2 million by the start of 2029.</p>



<p>The amount of money the esports industry generates will grow in kind.</p>



<p>It was suggested that this year, the esports industry will generate $4.8 billion in revenue, more than $2 billion of which will be associated with betting. In 2029, the numbers are expected to climb to $5.9 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively.</p>



<p>This data was compiled by BetIdeas (and circulated <a href="https://cardbiz.ca/esports-betting-will-drive-nearly-of-market-revenue-by-p739-178.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Cardbiz</a>). The report also suggested that by the end of the decade, a whopping 900 million people worldwide will be tuning into esports events.</p>



<p>For years, esports and betting have gone together like peanut butter and jelly. They’re complementary concepts, working together in the same way that traditional sports have for many years. The COVID-19 pandemic brought about a boom in the esports betting industry, and things have been riding high ever since.</p>



<p>Per the predictions, almost 20 million Americans are expected to lay a bet on esports by 2029. That’s immense growth.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/notch-has-%E2%80%98basically-announced-minecraft-2%E2%80%99-on-social-media.1073868/</guid>

<p>Markus ‘Notch’ Persson, best known for creating Minecraft, has written a lengthy post on social media explaining how he has ‘basically announced Minecraft 2’.</p>



<p>The comment comes almost fifteen years after he produced the first working version of Minecraft, a feat that took little more than a week in 2009. On Twitter, Notch explained that the game might never see the light of day and he doesn’t ‘super duper care’ which game he makes, but he ‘(does) know (he’s) making one’.</p>



<p>In his words, it could be a spiritual successor to Minecraft.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-minecraft-2-two-decades-later">Minecraft 2, Two Decades Later</h2>



<p>The first iteration of Minecraft, released in 2009, is now known as the Java Edition – Notch pieced it together in just a few days, and it eventually became a powerhouse of the gaming world worth billions of dollars. For the longest time, fans have wondered what comes next, but since Microsoft acquired the label, nothing more than a few spin-off titles have emerged.</p>



<p>Minecraft 2? Perhaps Notch wants to take control of that one.</p>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Notch wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I basically announced minecraft 2. </p>



<p>I thought that maybe people ACTUALLY do want me to make another game that’s super similar to the first one, and I’m loving working on games again. </p>



<p>I don’t super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I’m making one, so I figured I’d absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to minecraft and put up a poll about it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He went on to explain that spiritual successors are ‘tragic’ and ‘washed up’ but he’s willing to do what people want if they’re open to stumping up the cash for a new product. </p>



<p>Notch also assured fans that his game wouldn’t infringe on ‘the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing’.</p>



<p>However, further down in the comments under his post, Notch was transparent:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I’m not even sure I’ll make it to release, based on having been me for all my life. </p>



<p>But I do know I’m genuinely loving having fun working on a game in an office and would love to give it a shot.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What do you want to see from a spiritual successor to Minecraft? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

No, I don't mean the Super Bowl - it's time for Awesome Games Done Quick, the annual charity speedrunning marathon that features a week of talented gamers showing off the wildest things they can do with video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Done Quick (GDQ) has been running for 15 years now, since 2010. The event is a live broadcast speedrunning marathon, during which speedrunners take turns showing off beating video games as fast as possible, and often in wacky and especially impressive ways. In recent years, the events have shown off increasingly ambitious performances, including blindfolded or one-handed runs, two players using a single controller, showcases of tricky arcade games, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-start-2024-by-interviewing-the-worlds-first-dog-speedrunner">even speedruns performed by dogs</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The annual event is held to raise money for the Prevent Cancer foundation, having previously raised a record high of $3,442,033 in 2022, and $2,539,832 just last year. And this year's marathon has some pretty ridiculous runs on the docket. There's a run of Crazy Taxi backed by a live band, someone playing Elden Ring with a saxophone, new Super Mario Bros. Wii run while simultaneously playing piano, a two-players-one-controller run of Breath of the Wild, loads of randomizer races, and it all wraps up with a Map Randomizer Race between some of the best Super Metroid runners out there. If you've never watched GDQ before, it's really worth tuning in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">AGDQ 2025 kicks off at 9:00 AM PT on Sunday, January 5 with a run of Pikmin on Nintendo Switch, followed by Portal 2. In fact, Sunday's full of bangers: Kirby's Air Ride follows, there's an Astro Bot run, then The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, a run infamous for appearing at GDQ every years and getting shorter each time as the community discovers new, run-changing skips.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/03/fsh-08395-1735942959021.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Awesome Games Done Quick 2024, photo by Wes "Fish" Chan</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If I keep going I'll just list every single run in the entire event, so here's a quick list of highlights you should definitely check out.

<p>Earlier today, Valve officially updated their Counter-Strike 2 Major <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/counter-strike_rules_and_regs/blob/main/major-supplemental-rulebook.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rulebook</a>, confirming the reports that their illustrious tournament would <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40062/sources-majors-to-expand-to-32-teams-from-2025-rmrs-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expand from 24 teams to 32</a>. The increase in teams also means that the CS2 Major will expand the number of Swiss Stages from two to three. There will also be a new series of qualifier events, called the Major Regional Qualifiers.</p>



<p>The next Major on the schedule, the BLAST.tv Austin Major in April 2025, should be the first to incorporate the new changes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-re-gonna-need-a-bigger-stage">We’re Gonna Need a Bigger Stage</h2>



<p>The CS2 Major will now prominently feature three 16-team Swiss Stages before culminating in the traditional eight-team single-elimination playoff bracket. Each Swiss Stage will still feature best-of-one matches in the first two rounds. </p>



<p>Eight teams will receive a direct invite to the third stage, and eight will receive a direct invite to the second stage. The Major Regional Qualifiers, which are replacing the Regional Major Ranking (RMR) events, will determine the 16 teams that begin in stage one.</p>



<p>The regional distribution of the teams invited to each stage of the CS2 Major is directly determined by that region’s performance at the previous Major. Six European teams, one Americas team, and one Asia/Pacific team are invited to stage three, based on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the teams that reached the playoffs of the Perfect World Shanghai Major</a>. Four EU teams and four Americas teams will be invited to stage two. Six EU teams, six Americas teams, and four Asia/Pacific teams will qualify from MRQs to stage one. </p>



<p>The official Valve Regional Standings for each of the three regions will determine which teams are invited to stage three, stage two, or the MRQs. The highest ranked teams from each region that haven’t already been invited to stage two or stage three will be invited to the MRQs.</p>



<p>Speaking of MRQs, which are replacing the Regional Major Ranking (RMR) events for determining Major participants, here are the new formats:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eight Asia/Pacific teams will compete in a two-group GSL-style bracket. Four teams will advance to Stage One.</li>



<li>16 European teams will compete in their own Swiss Stage. Six teams will advance to Stage One.</li>



<li>16 Americas teams will compete in their own Swiss Stage. Six teams will advance to Stage One.
<ul>
<li>If Americas must be subdivided to North America and South America due to ping issues, “Major invitations will be split evenly among the regions.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, the changes to the CS2 Major rulebook say that the MRQs may be held online, though players and teams will likely heavily oppose playing online. </p>

<p>Atari has unveiled the Gamestation Go, an all-new handheld device with a few bizarre features that contribute nicely to a retro-futuristic vibe. In a short trailer uploaded on social media, we’re given a glimpse at the new console, which features typical button-based inputs alongside a keypad, paddle, and a Trak-Ball input.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-icon-reimagined">An Icon, Reimagined</h2>



<p>Atari is preparing to fully showcase the Gamestation Go handheld console at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, which will commence on January 7.</p>



<p>The first whispers of this device surfaced more than a year ago when it was revealed that Atari was partnering with MyArcade to piece together a handheld unit with these very features. That collaboration has come to fruition with the Gamestation Go.</p>



<p>At CES 2024, the ‘Gamestation Portable’ was revealed, featuring:</p>



<ul>
<li>A 7-inch high-resolution display</li>



<li>Paddle, Trak-Ball, and keypad inputs</li>



<li>Officially licensed titles</li>
</ul>



<p>The original design showcased at CES 2024 has undergone a few changes, with the team making some aesthetic tweaks and shifting some buttons around.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer released by Atari:</p>











<p>With charming hints of backlighting, a colour scheme that screams retro, and a promising line-up of titles, the Atari Gamestation Go could be a winner in the ever-growing handheld market. The unique inputs promise to accommodate games found on platforms like the Atari 5200 and the Jaguar. </p>



<p>In recent years, the concept of the handheld console has exploded in popularity, with almost every major tech manufacturer getting in on the action. Recently, we’ve seen every tech titan from MSI to Logitech and from Lenovo to ASUS have their crack at making a handheld gaming device.</p>



<p>When CES 2025 kicks off, we’ll likely have more information about the unit, including a release window and potentially a price point.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-dead-tcg-artifact-suddenly-had-12000-players-on-new-years-day-and-the-community-is-baffled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As we rang in the new year earlier this week, thousands of people <em>seemed</em> to be celebrating in an admittedly unusual way: by playing Valve's 2018 TCG Artifact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, as quickly as they started, the 12,000-ish individuals all stopped playing at once on January 3, leaving the game as empty as it had been at the end of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who were these people? No one seems to know. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/12k_players_again/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artifact community isn't reporting any sudden spikes in interest</a>, and no one's really talking about the game on social media apart from marveling at the sudden jump in player numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why, then, is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/583950/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a> suggesting that a free-to-play card game that is, by all accounts, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/artifact-valve-stops-development-on-struggling-card-game">close to dead</a>, seeing wild spikes in users over very specific two-day periods?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2025/01/01/12000-people-are-playing-artifact-right-now-and-no-one-knows-why/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by Forbes</a>, Artifact Classic's (the original, now free-to-play version of Artifact) player count suddenly spiked on December 31, jumping from a measly ~200 concurrent players up to the 5,000s, before spiking to a height of over 12,000. Artifact remained at around 11,000 concurrents through the second, before its playercount absolutely tanked back down to ~150 at midnight on January 3rd. What's strange is that something almost exactly like this happened earlier this month, too: on December 14, player counts shot up to around 14,000, hung out there for about two days, and dive bombed again into the hundreds on the 17th.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's really going on here? The actual answer is that no one <em>really </em>knows. The most prevalent community theory seems to be that it's bots, though why someone would train bots to play Artifact isn't exactly clear. One person suggested someone was training an AI to play the game "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hf87nf/comment/m2agrbz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for shits and giggles</a>" which is perhaps as good an explanation as any. Another person suggested the spikes were due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/comment/m4y3g74/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scam bots increasing playtime in random games</a> in order to make their Steam accounts look legitimate for <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/70E6-991B-233B-A37B" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other purposes</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Hero in Artifact's Call to Arms Release Set</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another theory pointed out by multiple members of the Artifact subreddit is that the spike in players is due to pirates. Because certain video games require Steam authentication, in order to pirate those games, pirates will use the AppID/SDK of a different, free-to-play game to fool Steam into thinking they have a real copy. In this case, it's being suggested they're using Artifact. That said, this theory doesn't entirely hold up, due to the extremely sudden spikes and then drops in activity at very precise times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the actual answer behind Artifact's mysterious player numbers remains a mystery for now. We did reach out to Valve for comment, but did not hear back in time for publication. What is clear at least is that despite the numbers, Artifact itself doesn't seem to be garnering any meaningful, real-world interest eight years after launch and four years after Valve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/artifact-valve-stops-development-on-struggling-card-game">effectively called it quits</a>, even though the game itself <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/13/artifact-review">was pretty fun at first</a>. At least the bots, if they are indeed bots, in Artifact don't seem to be bothering legitimate players, unlike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-fortress-2-steam-reviews-drop-to-mostly-negative-as-players-plead-with-valve-to-do-something-about-bots">the on-and-off situation over in Team Fortress 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-first-edition-artist-proof-set-on-sale-for-2-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dedicated <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> collectors have gotten a golden opportunity recently. A new listing on eBay promotes the sale of a complete <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> First Edition Artist Proof set. That is over 300 cards signed by dozens of contributing artists. As for the price, you may need to take out some serious loans.</p>



<p>The official <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/386107788022" rel="nofollow">eBay listing</a> of the complete <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>First Edition Artist Proof set was posted by user thelotusvale.</p>

<p>That listing includes a comprehensive number of screenshots showcasing every single card from the first edition of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. Each card is signed by the artist. Among these cards is the one of the most sought-after, The Black Lotus, in PSA Certified mint condition.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-first-edition-card-screenshots.jpg?itok=ajpHlDfU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-first-edition-card-screenshots.jpg?itok=QGI7tsJb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition, each card is accompanied by a signed, sketched artist proof of each card. These are single-sided white cards with the artist's sketch of the initial card artwork. They are meant for esteemed collectors and diehard fans of the respective artists.</p>

<p>So, about that price. According to the listing, the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> First Edition Artist Proof set will be available for as little as $2.2 million. If you live in Richmond, Virginia, the set is available for local pick up on purchase. Otherwise, shipping to the US will cost you $54.67.</p>

<p>Finally, if you buy this set, no refunds. That is, unless the set isn't as advertised, which would make it fall under eBay's Money Back guarantee policy.</p>

<p>It's not an unheard of price for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> history. Last April, a pristine copy of the Black Lotus was sold for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-black-lotus-shatters-records-in-staggering-3m-sale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$3 million</a>. Furthermore, rap artist Post Malone purchased the one-of-a-kind <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/post-malone-buys-magic-gathering-one-ring" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The One Ring</em></a> card from the Lord of the Rings set, a card speculated at $2 million in value, for an undisclosed amount.</p>

<p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> First Edition was released to the world in 1993. This was the start of the iconic card game and the start of collectible card games within the tabletop space, inspiring competitors like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pokemon TCG</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>. It is a game packed with 30 years of history and a deeply passionate playerbase still drafting decks to this day.</p>
