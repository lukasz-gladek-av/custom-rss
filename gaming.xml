			<p>What is WWE 2K’s next move now that the franchise is no longer on the defensive? After the disastrous WWE 2K20 and a year off to recoup, developer Visual Concepts has been slowly building a new foundation piece-by-piece, leading up to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really-quite-solid WWE 2K24</a>. So, with most of the most obvious holes in WWE 2K’s game patched up, what now? It seems the new direction may be turning the series into a more of a playground for wrestling fans, rather than a more straightforward sim-like approach, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WWE 2K25</a> offering up new features like The Island hub and things verboten on actual WWE programming, like intergender wrestling.</p>
<p>Does WWE 2K25 build on the series’ momentum or does it let off the pressure? I recently had the opportunity to travel to Indianapolis to go hands-on with WWE 2K25 amid the backdrop of this year’s Royal Rumble. During my demo I was able to sample WWE 2K25’s tweaked in-ring mechanics, new Bloodline-focused 2K Showcase, and more. While there’s still more I need to tackle before I can render a final verdict, you can roll on for my pre-show impressions.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFwwe2k256.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you’ve played WWE 2K24, you largely know what to expect from WWE 2K25’s between-the-ropes fare. Over the past few years, Visual Concepts has added some much-needed depth and finesse to the WWE 2K action, offering new ways to change the momentum of matches like combo breakers and dodges, and simpler, better-designed mechanics for fundamentals like pins and submissions. This year, the list of truly original additions is short, with one of the big “new” mechanics being the return of chain wrestling, last seen in the ill-fated WWE 2K20. Triggered at the beginning of some (but not all) matches, the minigame tasks you with trading holds and reversals by anticipating your opponent’s moves.</p>
<p>I must admit, I’m somewhat ambivalent about the return of chain wrestling. Sure, the mechanic works well enough, and is a more interesting way to determine who gets the advantage at the beginning of a match than simply “Who punches first?” Animations and transitions also have seem to have been improved making chain wrestling feel more polished than before. That said, following WWE 2K20, Visual Concepts largely deemphasized gimmicks like chain wrestling, and I’m hoping the series doesn’t allow itself to fall victim to minigame creep again, even if some individual minigames are fun enough to play.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFwwe2k257.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I’ve long advocated for Visual Concepts to push the WWE 2K franchise in the direction of faster, more versatile, fighting-game-style mechanics, and it feels like they’re edging away from that again. Case in point, blocking has been removed from WWE 2K25. Admittedly, I didn’t use blocks all that often in the last few WWE 2K titles, but some sort of functional blocking system is really core to any sort of serious combat-based video game. While you still have reversals, breakers, and dodges at your disposal to stymie your opponent’s attacks, I’d like to see Visual Concepts reconsider their jettisoning of blocks.</p>
<p>Perhaps my favorite new WWE 2K25 gameplay features is one of its least promoted – the new Giant fighting style. Giants now have an extra bar of “armor,” which essentially makes them impervious to certain attacks (with funny, unique animations playing when the giant shrugs off a punch or brushes aside a grapple attempt). Once the giant’s armor is worn down, they’ll play more like a regular wrestler, and, at least in theory, their limited invulnerability will be balanced by them not being able to do certain more acrobatic moves. While we’ll see how balanced the giants really are, playing as them now feels genuinely unique, and I wouldn’t mind seeing other WWE 2K fighting styles updated to stand apart more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k259.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, there’s one other very noticeable change to the in-ring action, as male and female Superstars are now free to tussle. Of course, intergender wrestling is a divisive topic -- I’m not always a great fan of it in real life, but I’m also all for letting people have their fun within the largely consequence-free world of video games. Wisely, certain features, like blood and bruising, are turned off in intergender matches, but otherwise, it’s pretty much anything goes. This does occasionally lead to some odd incongruities, such as a match I had between Nia Jax and Ethan Page where Jax was acting like a giant, even though she’s shorter than Page. But ultimately, if we all survived three-plus decades of Ryu and Chun-Li throwing fireball at one another, Rhea and Dom putting each other through a table or two isn’t anything to get overly fussed about.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k2510.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Visually, WWE 2K25 has received a modest, but still noticeable, upgrade of the type I’ve come to expect from the series in recent years. The lighting feels better this time around, bringing a new level of realism and depth to the wrestlers, and the series’ sometimes-unruly hair tech has been tamed somewhat. While we’ll have to wait and see how the full roster fares, the small selection of wrestlers we were allowed to play with at the preview event looked strikingly true-to-life, with a lot of effort clearly put toward getting the Bloodline members looking just right.</p>
<p><strong>[2K Showcase video]</strong></p>
<p>In terms of ways to play, “The Bloodline’s Dynasty” 2K Showcase builds nicely on the positive upgrades the mode received last year. While I never had any particular issue with it, the “Slingshot” technology that blended live historical footage with gameplay has been canned. There are still relatively lengthy non-interactive “cutscenes” included in some Showcase matches, but they’re now rendered in-engine. The Slingshot tech getting the boot was probably unavoidable as the Bloodline Showcase moves away from strictly recreating history this year, with the addition of matches that let you change history and “dream” showdowns that never happened in the real world. This adds some much-needed variety to the Showcase experience, which sometimes felt like a bit of a grind in years past. The dream meeting between the Wild Samoans and Dudley Boyz was probably my favorite Showcase match I had the chance to play at the preview event, as it had very straightforward objectives that largely let you play how you pleased.</p>
<p>And that’s about all I can definitively say about WWE 2K25 at the moment. 2K Games has set a second embargo for the new Underground match type, which I’ll be able to talk later this week. Beyond that, two of the more intriguing, and potentially divisive, additions – The Island hub and the Bloodline Rules match type – weren’t shown to us. It feels like a lot is riding on The Island, and to be fair, similar hubs like The City in the NBA 2K games have helped foster a strong sense of community surrounding that franchise. By the same token, NBA 2K’s hubs have also been criticized for their sometimes-overbearing monetization, which leaves me to wonder if Visual Concepts has managed the delicate ropewalk required to make The Island a success.</p>
<p><strong>[Intergender match video]</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Current Thoughts on WWE 2K25</strong></h2>
<p>WWE 2K25 seems to be largely more of a good thing, but despite playing the game for hours, my hands-on time felt a bit like one of those slick vignettes WWE shows before debuting a new Superstar – flashy, promising, but somewhat short on specifics. I remain cautiously optimistic, but I’m still waiting to see what WWE 2K25 can really do between the ropes.</p>
<p>If you’d like to know a bit more about what to expect from WWE 2K25,<a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k25-inteview-bloodline-showcase-the-island-skipping-pc-ps4-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> do check out my interview with the game’s producers</a>. And again, look for my thoughts on the game’s new Underground match type later in the week.</p>
<p>WWE 2K25 launches on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 on March 14, although those who buy the Deadman or Bloodline special editions can play a week early on March 7.</p>

            <p>Steam early access games that haven't been updated in a long while will now be more prominently labelled as such, according to reports. As noticed by third-party tracking platform <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhgj6fphkx2y">SteamDB</a>, Valve have begun adding warnings to early access info boxes, making it harder to accidentally spend your pocket money on a promising project that hasn't advanced in years.</p><!--more-->
<p>I'm not sure it was ever <em>that</em> easy to mistakenly buy a 'dead' early access game, mind you, but it saves you the Dr-Watson-level detective work of digging up the last few update changelogs, or peering at the user reviews. </p>
<p>Valve have yet to formally announce this new approach. It's a popular move already, but there are a few complaints about the execution. In the case of poor <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/567380/Heartbound/">Heartbound</a> up there in this article's header image, some have pointed out that the game <em>has</em> recently received updates in beta. Valve's labels only seem to apply to gaps between full public updates.</p>
<p>I'm writing this up partly because I'm interested to know what you all consider too long an interval between early access updates. At what point do you declare the patient dead on the operating table? Continuing with that metaphor, I guess Valve's new labels are the equivalent of a doctor walking around the surgery loudly saying "Ms <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heartbound">Heartbound</a> has definitely popped her clogs - I guess it's time to cancel her lunch order". Which, with any luck, will cause Ms Heartbound to jolt out of her stupor, protesting that "no no, I was just having a nap, please don't take my spaghetti bolognese with extra parmesan away". </p><p>My take is that the acceptability of a gap between early access update varies by the game or genre, and that I broadly subscribe to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/long-dark-dev-criticises-manor-lords-for-lack-of-updates-hooded-horse-ceo-replies-that-not-every-game-needs-to-be-some-live-service-boom-or-bust">the Hooded Horse philosophy of let-devs-cook</a>. Personally, I only ever buy early access games if I'm absolutely satisfied by what they're offering right now - day one <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>, for example. I will never buy something for what it might become. Embrace presence, I say. The future makes oafs of us all.</p>
<p>Valve have made a show of cracking down on slippery Steam practices lately. Back in November, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-tighten-up-rules-for-games-with-season-pass-dlc-you-have-to-commit-to-completing-that-content-on-time">tightened the rules for games with delayed season pass DLC</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For a series so often insulated in its wrestling fandom bubble, it was trending on social media for a period in late 2019 after it launched because of how severe and sometimes hilarious the bugs were. The game was so poorly received that the series actually took a year off. This is practically unheard of in the world of annualized sports (and sports entertainment) games. Since then, WWE 2K has rebounded incredibly over the course of several games.</p><p dir="ltr">You could argue the WWE 2K series, like Cody Rhodes, finished its story last year, with a great game that does most of what it wants to do very well. Now, like WWE's poster boy is learning week in and week out, heavy lies the crown. Where does the series go from here? To a great extent, the goal has already been achieved. The belt is around the game's waist. At the same time, "the story" continues unabated when the next game is perpetually coming down the pipeline, so there's no opportunity to pause and enjoy the fruits of your labor. After several hours with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k25/" data-ref-id="5000-656808">WWE 2K25</a>, this next chapter seems like another step up, even as what might ultimately conclude the next chapter hasn't yet been revealed in full.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4437791-ggqs5gbwgaezbtm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4437791" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4437791-ggqs5gbwgaezbtm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4437791"></a><figcaption>In an annualized video game, like in pro wrestling, the story is never truly over.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4437791-ggqs5gbwgaezbtm.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k22/" data-ref-id="5000-529940">WWE 2K22</a> was a "comeback year," lead combat designer Derek Donahue told me. "We had extra time. There was no 2K21. We also rebuilt the game. We redid so many core systems, but we still hadn't been able to redo everything we wanted. I think you could look at [2K22], and it's almost unrecognizable from the engine and the tools that we were working with back on 2K20, especially. But it's taken many, many years to get to a point where now this feels like our game and the way that we've always envisioned being able to work on it and build it."</p><p dir="ltr">Donahue spoke to how the last two games helped reshape the culture around the series. "[<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k23/" data-ref-id="5000-580650">2K23</a>] was a unique kind of challenge, in the sense that, now we have to do it in a year like we used to, right? We didn't have the extra time. It was really, really gratifying to pull off what we did with [2K23], especially WarGames and all that. [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k24/" data-ref-id="5000-615521">2K24</a>] was finally, like, 'Can you repeat it?' And I feel like we're at the point where we've proven ourselves and said, 'Hey, we can come back to this annual franchise, make huge improvements each year with the game on its own, standing alone as something that feels good.' But it also, of course, ups the stakes, because expectations are higher than they've ever been, so it's about meeting those expectations."</p><p dir="ltr">From the outside, the perception was that WWE 2K20 fell apart because Yuke's, the Japanese studio making WWE games since 2000, left the series, and the team that remained wasn't able to overcome that absence. Donahue told me that's not exactly the case. More accurately, the team that would replace Yuke's didn't really exist yet.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yuke's made the game for, like, 20 years," Donahue said. "It's a huge amount of institutional knowledge they have. And the goals that we had when setting out from 2K20 and beyond were to modernize a lot of systems. I think when a game gets as big as ours is, it is an extremely hard challenge to take something that works <em>now</em>, but needs to be rebuilt to do something for <em>tomorrow</em>; it takes so many resources, and you have to pick and choose what you're going to do, and to do that in an individual year just seemed insurmountable.</p><p dir="ltr">"So it was a huge change in the way that we work on the game, and what goals we are setting, and what expectations we have for ourselves and for the product. To bring everything in-house was a massive effort. When we worked with Yuke's, it was like 20-something people in our office, including designers, producers, some entrance cutscene animators, but almost everything else was happening across the world with the people who we spoke with and translated emails and had weekly meetings with, but it was so disconnected from our work and made it really challenging.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434189-wwe2k25rheaanddominik.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434189" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434189-wwe2k25rheaanddominik.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434189"></a><figcaption>Intergender matches are finally playable, so you can pit Rhea against Dom in any kind of match you prefer... or even all of them.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434189-wwe2k25rheaanddominik.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We always knew we wanted to be able to sit next to an engineer and work with somebody in the same office and collaborate in a way in which we knew we'd be able to do so much more. But the gulf between where we were and where we wanted to be was so vast, and so it's really taken this time for us to finally get to this point."</p><p dir="ltr">One of the new features in this year's game is the third-person camera controls. Whereas past games allowed you to present matches from the real-life hardcam angle or the retro-inspired entrance-facing camera, this year's game also gives you the option to dynamically control the angle at any time using the right stick. In moments when you need the right stick to perform something in-game other than adjusting the camera, like pinning or turning an opponent, you just hold down the right trigger while you use it, like the shift key on a computer performing a secondary function.</p><p dir="ltr">Since the right trigger wasn't mapped to anything before anyway, the effect was a seamless new toy that enhanced the many matches I played, giving me directorial control of how each match was presented. It's interesting to note that the team originally built this feature for entrances, but when they liked it so much, they decided to apply it to the matches themselves, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The third-person camera is especially useful in backstage brawls, as I could swing the camera around a full 360 degrees and better see and utilize the space in settings new and old, like when I found I could climb up several structures in the WWE Archives and throw my opponent to the floor far below like he was doing a forced Mick Foley impression. I'd overlooked that space until I opted to change the camera settings during the match. With the camera's aid, my match was better off for it, translating into more stars in the game's Meltzer-like rating system.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the exciting new feature the marketing team plans to lead with, assumedly, but in practice, I expect players to come to really appreciate it, and many will prefer it as their go-to option. It's a subtle but satisfying change to a game building on a much sturdier foundation these days. However, the more broadly exciting additions to the game are--as they often are--the Showcase mode and new match types. I played three Showcase matches, which this year highlights the Anoa'i wrestling dynasty. This includes current superstars like Roman Reigns and Nia Jax, as well as past legends like The Rock and The Wild Samoans. Showcase is WWE 2K's annual history lesson and reliably a great time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434191-wwe2k25solobloodline.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434191" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434191-wwe2k25solobloodline.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434191"></a><figcaption>The Bloodline Showcase arrives just as Jacob Fatu's meteoric rise feels like it's hitting a new speed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434191-wwe2k25solobloodline.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">I was disappointed to see the seamless transitions from gameplay to real-life stock footage from the matches have been removed, but I learned there are a few reasons for that. For one, the team said players largely didn't like that feature--that's absurd to me, but I can understand being in the minority on that one means I won't get my way. Another reason that aspect isn't on display in 2K25 is because Showcase features some fantasy matches we never got to see in real life, like The Wild Samoans taking on The Dudley Boyz in a tables match.</p><p dir="ltr">More noticeably absent from the Showcase mode is Brock Lesnar, who is such a major chapter in the story of cover star Roman Reigns that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brock-lesnar-and-vince-mcmahon-arent-playable-in-wwe-2k24-but-arent-gone-entirely/1100-6521315/">you can sometimes see the game skirting around his existence</a> for the second year in a row, like when a cutscene tells the story of Seth Rollins' famous cash-in at WrestleMania 31. Rollins pinned and had more of a feud with Reigns, but Lesnar was in that match, too, and he's entirely missing from the cutscene--not to suggest I want him there. It's just notable when the 2K team has to dodge-roll away from some of the wrestling company's past scandals.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, I'm greatly looking forward to this mode, as I found last year's WrestleMania-focused match list to have filled in some of my knowledge gaps as a fan, and I have no doubt this year's will do that with The Bloodline family tree, too. It also helps that it's all narrated by Paul Heyman. Based on what I saw, Heyman is giving his fullest effort, not at all phoning it in. I don't think the man even knows how.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the new Showcase, new match types like Underground and Bloodline Rules, and other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-release-date-trailer-news/2900-6171/">recently announced WWE 2K25 features </a>all seem to build on last year's game in ways players are going to appreciate, my most anticipated feature of this year's game is rather simple: the addition of online multiplayer in GM mode. Equivalent to something like an Owner mode in NBA 2K or Madden, GM mode asks that you book shows, manage production, and run your roster--and to do it all so well that you actually defeat the competition--in this case, expressed as cross-company rivalries like Smackdown, Raw, and NXT, rather than something like AEW.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434190-wwe2k25wyattsicks.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434190" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434190-wwe2k25wyattsicks.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434190"></a><figcaption>Of those I saw while playing the game, character models look excellent and, in many cases, are clearly improved from last year's.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4434190-wwe2k25wyattsicks.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">GM mode is already where I spend the majority of my time with the game. I love to make stars out of those who aren't yet at that level in reality, putting my own stamp on the WWE Universe. The prospect of playing it with three others online likely ensures I spend even more time in the mode this year. I'm eager to see how things like drafts and trades are implemented, but if done well, WWE 2K25's online GM mode might be my new favorite sports league I'm a part of--and there are already a few of those in my life.</p><p dir="ltr">With another interesting Showcase subject, fun new match types, and subtly cool new camera controls, I really liked what I played of WWE 2K25. There's a lot more to see, including several major modes like the narrative-driven MyRise, and the card-collecting MyFaction, and possibly the most impactful of them all: the new social space called The Island, so I'll reserve my final opinion for when I review the game later this year. But what I played gives the community more of what they want on top of a much sturdier foundation than the series had just a few short years ago. I have more questions to answer for myself, and I'll get to them before I've published my review, but as any patient wrestling fan would suggest, for now, I'll let it play out.</p>

                <p>Steam has added a new warning to the Steam pages of early-access games that have not been updated in a long time.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhgj6fphkx2y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB spotted</a> this addition to the early-access widget on Steam pages. Steam has historically denoted that early access games "are not complete and may or may not change further," but it's now getting more specific as to when a game was previously updated, regardless of what the developers wrote in their early access widget. Specifically, it seems to kick in if the publicly available build of an early-access title has not seen an update in over 12 months.</p><p>Take <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/atlas/" data-ref-id="5000-490221">Atlas</a>, a pirate open-world game from the same publisher as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ark-survival-ascended/" data-ref-id="5000-609380">Ark: Survival Ascended</a> that was released in early access in 2018 but has not gotten an update since May 2023. A message on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/834910/ATLAS/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its Steam page</a> now reads, "Note: The last update made by the developers was over 20 months ago. The information and timeline described by the developers here may no longer be up to date." Similar messages can be found on the Steam pages for games like Pirate Software's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/567380/Heartbound/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heartbound</a>, Hi-Rez Studios' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/813820/Realm_Royale_Reforged" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Realm Royale Reforged</a>, and League of Geeks' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1893820/Jumplight_Odyssey" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jumplight Odyssey</a>.</p><p>Although Steam can't force developers to update their games or bring them out of early access, this warning at least gives potential buyers a clear warning that the game they're about to purchase hasn't been supported in a while. You can check the Steam News page of any early-access title or SteamDB to see when a game was updated last.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fight-for-america-j6-rascal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This article appeared <a href="https://www.rascal.news/red-hats-red-blood-roleplaying-the-january-6-insurrection-in-a-brooklyn-warehouse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 4</a> on <a href="https://www.rascal.news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rascal</a>, an "independent, reader-supported, worker-owned outlet for journalism about tabletop roleplaying games and the people who make them."</em> <em>Rascal is having their <a href="https://www.rascal.news/rascal-celebrates-its-first-birthday-with-a-pledge-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first anniversary subscriber drive</a> right now; if you like what you see here, please check them out!</em></p><p>In the center of a repurposed Brooklyn warehouse loomed a scale model of the U.S. Capitol, as imposing a symbol of empire as the real building a couple hundred miles to the south. Surrounding it stood a line of blue-uniformed miniatures — police, meant to protect the election certification going on inside. Just beyond them, an ocean of red and white, miniatures of men and women holding flags that proclaimed that the time for revolution had come; the time to make America great again was here at last.&nbsp;</p><p>I knew what I had signed up for — a playtest of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fightforamerica.games/game?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><u>Fight for America!</u></em></a>&nbsp;a wargame produced by Neal Wilkinson, Christopher McElroen, and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40K&nbsp;</em>designer Alessio Cavatore, depicting the insurrection attempt of January 6th, 2021 — but still, I was not prepared to relive the surreal horror that day has burned into the core of the American psyche.</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>A group of twenty or so stood on opposite sides of the miniature capitol hill. Divided into two factions by the designers, one in a red hat, the other in blue, the groups’ awkward, nervous energy felt more like the first minutes of a school dance than a game depicting a violent coup. Left stunned by the jarring contrast, I was ushered off to one side of the room, put in front of a camera, and asked the same preliminary question as every other player:&nbsp;<em>What about America is worth fighting for?&nbsp;</em>My response yielded more of an ideal than a reality — a commitment to equality, protection of the most vulnerable, and a rejection of the violent oppression the country was unequivocally built on.&nbsp;</p><p>Seemingly content with my answer, the game’s organizers handed me a card. Like every player, I was embodying a real person: Adam Johnson. A QAnon supporter who you may know colloquially as “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/25/1083230184/the-man-who-grabbed-pelosis-podium-during-the-jan-6-riot-is-sentenced-to-prison?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>The Podium Guy</u></a>”, Johnson was depicted on the card with his real-life photo carrying Nancy Pelosi’s podium. Having missed the opening rules video — an immersive, in-character speech where an actor, dressed in MAGA regalia, spoke to the players as freedom fighters who should achieve their mission by any means necessary — I was then handed a ruler with a brief breakdown of the game’s mechanics, before being sent off to a quadrant of Capitol Hill. Divided into multiple areas of combat, each section had at least two players: one representing the capitol police, the other acting as the MAGA coalition of Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, QAnon truthers, and other assorted right-wing groups.&nbsp;</p><p>The collected players awkwardly introduced themselves to one another (a surprisingly diverse group of people across spectrums of gender, age, and race). The two women in my quadrant introduced themselves as casual board gamers. One, overwhelmed by the rules, played an Oath Keeper; the other, facing down both of us on her own, played Eugene Goodman, the Black police officer whose mere presence diverted the racism-driven mob away from Mike Pence’s location.</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>Introductions were cut short when a man stepped on stage, flanked by American flags and television screens. Now dressed as Uncle Sam, the same actor who had introduced us to the mechanics of the game shepherded us through its story.&nbsp;</p><p>Our mutually exclusive win states were made clear. Team blue, the capitol defenders, must hold the line and defend the capitol. Team red must stop the steal — and hang Mike Pence.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>On January 6, 2021, I was alone. Hidden away in the forests near Albany, I walked through the snow-covered landscape, attempting to reconcile the horror of the previous four years and process the months of protesting I’d done that summer. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rascal.news/covid-has-changed-ttrpgs-have-we-changed-with-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pandemic had brought the world to a halt</a>, killing millions and disabling millions more. The collective lack of distraction forced us to bear witness to the horror of the brutal, yet all too routine, murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Elijah McClain. The promise of America had been broken, had always been broken, and now it could not be ignored.&nbsp;</p><p>After hours of silent contemplation, I returned to my cabin, checked my phone, and for a moment, I fell out of time. There, streaming on every possible platform, was a sea of red storming the U.S. Capitol building.&nbsp;</p><p>As I watched these people mob the beating heart of the nation they supposedly love, the only thing I felt in my chest was a pit of sorrow so deep that there was no bottom. To my horror, I recognized myself in these people. I had felt the violent fury of righteousness they believed they were fighting for. Though we stand at opposite ends of a vast chasm, I knew them. I’d sat in that seat of revolution. I’d felt the fire of injustice in my soul and wanted to use it to burn down the world around me. I’d enjoyed the rush of being a single piece of a larger whole, marching forward and staring down the barrel of empire.</p><p>I turned off my phone and wrote in the cabin’s guest book to document this moment that would mark the final schism of the grand democratic experiment.&nbsp;</p><p><em>What about America is worth fighting for?</em></p><hr><p><em>  </em>Just before the game started, those playing capitol police took an oath to defend the constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic. They stood together as a unified front, reciting this oath line by line — one the current President recently took while refusing to touch a Bible. The MAGA coalition each took their respective oaths.</p><p>Those playing the Oath Keepers, an anti-government paramilitary group founded in 2009 by Yale-graduate Stuart Rhodes, recited the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/oath-keepers/?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>10 unconstitutional orders</u></a>&nbsp;they claim they will refuse to obey. Those include orders to disarm the American people, conduct warrantless searches, detain American citizens, put American citizens into concentration camps, confiscate property, or infringe on protest or free speech — all of which were sped through during the game, seemingly as a way to show the half-hearted nature of this oath, which relies heavily on exactly&nbsp;<em>who</em>&nbsp;the Oath Keepers deem as American enough.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>The Proud Boys, a white nationalist hate group, were told to sing along to “Proud of Your Boy”, a bastardized song from the Disney musical&nbsp;<em>Aladdin</em>&nbsp;and the organization’s namesake — a fact confirmed by founder Gavin McInnes. The player acting as Jacob Chansley, better known as the QAnon shaman, recited the speech he gave at the capitol to his fellow QAnon truthers, believers in the once-fringe conspiracy network with far less organization. Documented as being drunk on that day, I and other QAnon players were given a real, actual beer. The national anthem played, and I performed a heightened degree of respect, assuring my fellow players that while I would take this game seriously, above the table, we were all on the same side.&nbsp;</p><p>The absurd, almost comedic aspects of seeing the insurrection’s component parts created enough distance from our current reality that I felt able to tap into the mindset of my assigned role. As the final line of&nbsp;<em>The Star Spangled Banner</em>&nbsp;rang out —&nbsp;<em>The land of the free and the home of the brave</em>&nbsp;— I cracked my beer and chugged.</p><p>And then, the game began.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>The night before, I’d seen the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rascal.news/the-dimension-20-msg-show-was-everything-i-hoped-it-would-be-except-for-the-venue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u><em>Dimension 20</em>&nbsp;Madison Square Garden show</u></a>. I’d almost not gone to the playtest, drained from a night of euphoric communal joy that I was afraid to let slip through my fingers by once again confronting reality. I’m not our wargames correspondent, and I could easily wait for Caelyn to attend the game when it toured in London this summer.</p><p>But this felt…personal, I suppose. Days before, Donald Trump had been re-inagurated. Within 48 hours, and in the two weeks since, his administration has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/omb-memo-freeze-federal-grants-scoop?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>attempted a fundamental overhaul of the United States government</u></a>. Truth itself has become malleable, and personhood a subject for debate. Each day I look at the news, facing an onslaught of horrors, and I have to pragmatically decide whether my partner and me — both chronically ill and trans — will be able to survive.&nbsp;</p><p>In the eyes of the current regime, we are expendable. Drains on the system at best; enemies of the state at worst. According to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/28/nx-s1-5277106/trump-executive-order-transgender-military?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>executive order banning trans people from the military</u></a>, we cannot live an “honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle”. In going to this event, I donned a baggy sweater and a hat, saying nothing as people around me referred to me as a man. Not out of fear of retaliation in the leftist enclave of Brooklyn, but out of the reality that to acknowledge myself as trans in this space would be to recognize that the person I am portraying&nbsp;likely wants me dead.</p><hr><p>It was slow at first. Units amassed on the board, two insurrectionists for every officer. Turn by turn, the capital defenders held the line, unable mechanically and morally to strike first. A resulting red wave rapidly amassed on the steps of democracy. We waited, tensions rising, plotting when this standoff could escalate into violence. We moved tactically and with purpose.</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>Clips began to play on screen: news anchors from the ideological left and the right (all played by the same actor as Uncle Sam) recited broadcasts from the day. The left condemned the riot, and the right blamed insurgent groups like antifa rather than acknowledging their own base’s violence. Interspersed throughout was Donald Trump’s speech and tweets — which were used as evidence in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(election_obstruction_case)?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>now-dismissed court case against the President</u></a>&nbsp;for charges of election interference — encouraging his supporters to march on the capitol.&nbsp;</p><p>As the speech ended, a timer went off allowing another hoard of units to enter the field, creating an even more horrifying imbalance between the two sides. This overwhelm allowed me to distract and cordon off the police units, opening a straight path to the halls of Congress. During the game, I found myself making sub-optimal moves. I could pretend that this was in character as the disorganized, drunken mob, or that it was based in my play philosophy of prioritizing fun over winning. But truly, it pulled my punches out of a profound need to avoid a total slaughter by fascist paramilitaries, a potential reality I simply couldn’t stomach even in a game. Units slowly disappeared from the board as insurrectionists overtook police, or the blue line repelled the domestic invaders.</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>As the facilitators continued their immersive elements, speaking directly to either side, announcements came to the group. Updates from the government, shouts from the insurrectionists to reaffirm their righteous cause. Bear mace burned in the air, tear gas canistered deployed. And then, shots fired. Live ammo was on the field.&nbsp;</p><p>Uncle Sam began a chant. “Hang Mike Pence. Hang Mike Pence.” In the spirit of buying into the game, I chanted along. He handed me a card, my second amendment right to a concealed firearm.</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>When a fourth player joined our group, an experienced gamer and the child of a well-known game designer, the dynamics of the game shifted. I was no longer there to observe the game and guide my fellow players through this experience — I was there to win. Our moves picked up pace, and conflict broke out multiple times every round.&nbsp;</p><p>I approached the Capitol and found myself staring down a half-dozen heavy tactical units. A clear problem for some, but I held the solution in my hand — my God-given right as an American to kill anyone in my way. I put down the card and fired. A police unit disappeared. What I had not realized was they had the chance to return fire. They did; one of my units, gone. My teammate and I had the choice: to return fire again and continue the bloodshed, or to stop it there. We fired again. There were more of us than there were of them. Another unit gone. Fire returned. This was no longer a protest, this was a battlefield.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>In the blink of an eye, half the people in our section had been wiped off the board. I turned to my fellow revolutionary, hesitating to continue this slaughter, and found her silently weeping. The spell broke, and I told the facilitators that we were done. As the miniature battle raged on around us, I checked in on her, assuring her that if we needed to stop entirely we could. No article was worth the lasting trauma this moment could undoubtedly bring. She told me everything was okay, that she wanted to keep playing. “I get it now,” she kept saying. “I understand what this game is.”&nbsp;</p><hr><p>For the last eight years, I have had escape routes mapped, contingency plans in place just in case the worst does indeed happen. It’s an exercise in futility, but preparation has always been my coping mechanism. Doomscrolling through the onslaught, looking at the sun hoping it does not blind me, is a survival tactic. Still, it will only buy me a little time, that much is clear now.&nbsp;</p><p>This insurrection is ongoing. These factions are emboldened, celebrated for their acts of hate as immigrants are rounded up and deported, as trans people are stripped of their rights and documents, as an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-associate-bfs-federal-payment-system/?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>unelected oligarch commandeers the government’s most sensitive data</u></a>&nbsp;and stripmines America for profit.</p><p>While the worst is yet to come, it’s clear that a revolution has already happened. It’s currently happening. But there’s nowhere to run. Even for the most privileged among us, regardless of where you are, it will find you.&nbsp;</p><p>Fascism cannot be escaped, it can only be fought.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>After a pause, a moment to collect ourselves and remember exactly what this game is, my team and I continued into the endgame and stormed the U.S. Capitol.&nbsp;</p><p>Once we breached the walls, the insurrectionists moved from the exterior of Capitol Hill into a scale floorplan of the building itself. One by one, we kicked open rooms that awarded us dice to add to a pool for a final roll. Our frantic, desperate search mirrored&nbsp;<a href="https://rumble.com/c/CHASubcommitteeOnOversightRepublicanMajority/playlists?ref=rascal.news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>the one seen from CCTV footage</u></a>: a swarm of red screaming out in search of Nancy Pelosi and Mike Pence. Driving their rage was an insatiable hunger for faulty justice against a system they believed is the fault of their suffering, revenge against the ones they’ve been told have perpetrated it, a vile desire to preserve a social hierarchy dependent on suffering.</p><p>As we reached the final moments of the game, the insurrectionists had an overwhelming advantage. Dice spread across the floor in a pool of blue and red blood, the answer clear. The insurrectionists had won. We had captured the vice president, who had held his oath to maintain the results of the election. It was now up to us to decide what we do with this traitor to our great leader.</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><p>Our group looked around at one another, knowing what we had to do—knowing what they would have done. Almost unanimously, some of us covering our eyes out of shame, we voted to hang Mike Pence, achieving our success scenario. Among the few who did not vote ‘yes’ was a man who’d been eager to play, but was accompanied by his young child. A girl of about 7 or 8 who was born into this broken, violent world, she watched this game removed from its reality, with an innocence only children can maintain. I can only imagine he wanted to prove to her that there is always hope for the good of people. A hope I hang on to as the days pass, and it becomes clear that they did win, even if not on January 6.&nbsp;</p><p>As Uncle Sam delivered with stoic horror the decision we made, a montage of footage from the insurrection began to play. A flurry of CCTV footage, of congresspeople fleeing, of battered police dragged to safety by their comrades. We all sat in solemn silence, horrified at what we had just done, what had been done to us as a nation. Facilitators handed out a second set of character cards — this time showing the lives of these people since.&nbsp;</p><p>My card, which had been drafted and printed prior to Trump’s re-election, said Adam Johnson had been convicted and sentenced to prison time and community service. On the card was a sticker, clearly not part of the original design. It was a single word, hastily laid over his image: Pardoned.</p><figure><figcaption>Rowan Zeoli</figcaption></figure><hr><p>I don’t know where we go from here. No one does. But it is not over. Amidst all the noise, journalists are working to keep the public informed of what is going on, while organizers and activists show us what there is to do about it.

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has already been majorly successful since its release. In just over a day, the game has sold one million copies after entering the market. This news comes from Warhorse Studios' social media.</p>
<p>"Over a million of you have stepped into our world. We're beyond grateful for your support - thank you for making #KCD2 a triumph!" says the <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1887155255130866099" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X post</a>. If you're on the fence about whether you want to purchase Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, make sure to check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">the review written by Chris Wray</a>, which gives you an insight into what you can expect from this title, published by well-known publisher Deep Silver.</p>
<p>In addition to the impressive sales numbers, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has a Very Positive rating on Steam thus far, across 5,873 reviews at the time of writing. The reviews praise the game for being well polished on the first day of release, which a lot of the time feels like a rarity, depending on what titles you're playing. It's to be expected, as the developers learn what needs to be patched on PC especially, as well as any bugs they may have missed.</p>
<p>However, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 seems to have really knocked it out of the park, with an immersive story, well-balanced combat, and stunning graphics to help bring it all together and make it a worthy experience. Combine that with minimal issues, and the game runs significantly better than the first one did; the fans are very happy with the results and efforts put in by Warhorse Studios.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is the sequel to Kingdom Come: Deliverance and is an open-ended RPG that takes place in 15th-century Bohemia, where you play as Henry of Skalitz and go on a journey filled with romance, combat, and the need for revenge to spur you on. Compared to other historical games, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 prides itself on being historically accurate for the most part, but the developers also made sure to not be too strict with themselves about making it too precise.</p>
<p>While it may seem like a game where seeing mythical creatures would be commonplace, you won't be finding any goblins or griffins in Bohemia, and instead, you're stuck with regular humans.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is currently available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple editions available</a>, which will grant you in-game bonuses depending on the edition you purchase.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gives-all-players-trade-tokens-after-trading-criticism.1100940/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-tokens<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced that it's gifting free Trade Tokens to all&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>players by way of an apology for the way in which the game's trading feature launched last week.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1887035219351368102" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the company says it's giving 1,000 Trade Tokens to every player via the game's Gifts menu as it "continue[s] investigating ways to improve the [trading] feature", commending players' "patience".</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder, the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>trading feature <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow">launched on January 29th</a>, quickly attracting ire from players for what they see as overly strict restrictions on the ways in which they can trade cards with others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-free-trade-tokens-leafeon-honchkrow-cards.jpg?itok=mprEzzaq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-free-trade-tokens-leafeon-honchkrow-cards.jpg?itok=neip40CR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>players are being gifted Trade Tokens thanks to the trading feature's poor reception.</figcaption></figure><p>Common <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/518217/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-changes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">criticisms</a> include poor conversion rates for Trade Tokens, as well as complaints about which cards can be traded. It's currently not possible to trade any card beyond a one-star rarity level, for instance, and only cards from the Genetic Apex and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion" rel="nofollow">Mythical Island</a> sets can currently be traded.</p>

<p>Criticism of the trading feature became so fierce that the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>devs <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1885447974094070090" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">responded</a> to it on X a few days ago, acknowledging that while trading restrictions were put in place to "prevent abuse from bots and other prohibited actions", they were "preventing players from being able to casually enjoy the feature".</p>

<p>As such, the devs are "actively investigating ways to improve the feature", and multiple ways to get Trade Tokens will also be offered in future, "including through event distributions".</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is, it's essentially a mobile app version of the popular&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>card game, albeit one that's been significantly streamlined and simplified compared to its tabletop counterpart.</p>

<p>The game allows you to collect, trade, and battle Pokemon cards, some of which are exclusive to the app. New sets are due to be added over time, too; just a day after the trading update, the game's latest set, Space-Time Smackdown, was released.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> devices.</p>

Now, a third Dead by Daylight and Resident Evil crossover is just days away, and it's going to pit players against two of RE's most famous villains.</p><p>Dead by Daylight's latest 2v8 mode will bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-3-remake-review-farewell-raccoon-cit/1900-6417441/" data-ref-id="1900-6417441">Resident Evil 3</a>'s Nemesis and The Mastermind--aka longtime RE villain Albert Wesker--together as they hunt down Jill Valentine, Leon Kennedy, Ada Wong, and Rebecca Chambers. All of these characters have appeared in at least one of the previous Resident Evil collaborations with this title. Dead by Daylight's original monster, The Legion, will also be a part of this event.</p><p>In an amusing touch, this collaboration is even including Resident Evil's green and yellow herbs, which have been a staple of the franchise from the beginning. At the start of each match, green and yellow herbs will spawn in random locations and survivors can use them for healing. However, if either Nemesis or Wesker get to the herbs first, they can destroy them and get a brief increase in their speed.</p><p>For the duration of the collaboration between February 10-25, all Resident Evil characters will be free to play in 2v8 mode. Just to make the RE characters feel at home, the 2v8 mode will revisit Raccoon City's Police Department--as seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-2-review-re-vived-nightmares/1900-6417071/" data-ref-id="1900-6417071">Resident Evil 2</a> and Resident Evil 3.

In 2024, Netflix <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">closed one of its AAA studios</a>, headed up by industry veterans including former Halo boss Joseph Staten. Netflix still has an internal game development studio, <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/team?slug=netflix-games-studio" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Netflix Games Studio</a>, as well as wholly owned external teams such as Night School Studio, Boss Fight Entertainment, and Next Games.</p><p>During an earnings call recently, Netflix boss Gregory Peters said Netflix has "plenty more" planned in the video game space, with the aim of launching "bigger and bigger games every year." Peters acknowledged that Netflix was in the middle of an effort to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-raising-prices-again-as-it-discusses-vision-for-video-games/1100-6528932/" data-ref-id="1100-6528932">"refine" its strategy for game launches</a>, which might explain why the six games mentioned here are no longer being released on Netflix.</p><p>Going forward, Peters said Netflix will focus on "more narrative games" based on Netflix franchises, while at the same time launching "party and couch co-op games" for your TV delivered from the cloud. Netflix's main offerings for games currently are on mobile, but the company has--<a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/testing-games-on-more-devices" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">for years now</a>--worked on cloud streaming to beam games directly to your TV or computer.</p><p>"We think of this as a successor to family board-game night or an evolution of what the game show on TV used to be. So we're excited about delivering some cool experiences in that space," Peter said.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-already-surpassed-a-million-sales.1100913/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>sales have already topped a major milestone, even though the game has only been available for a day.</p>

<p>The Czech developer's latest action RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward" rel="nofollow">launched yesterday</a> across PC and consoles, but it's already managed to hit a million sales, according to a <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1887155255130866099" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Warhorse X account.</p>

<p>In the post, Warhorse thanks&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>players for "stepp[ing] into our world" and says it's "beyond grateful" for the support it's received so far, calling its game a "triumph". With sales numbers like that, it's hard to disagree.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m-artwork.jpg?itok=rmcvlmQ3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m-artwork.jpg?itok=-nUN7D57 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has already sold a million copies.</figcaption></figure><p>The popularity of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>probably shouldn't come as much of a surprise; Warhorse has clearly put a lot of effort into the game, especially if the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">sheer size and density of its script</a> is anything to go by.</p>

<p>Despite its impressive sales figures, <i>Deliverance 2&nbsp;</i>hasn't been without its fair share of controversy. Prior to release, the game was subject to rumors that it would be banned in Saudi Arabia due to "unskippable" gay romance scenes, claims that game director&nbsp;Daniel Vávra <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-rumors-director" rel="nofollow">shot down in no uncertain terms</a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has attracted a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Very Positive rating</a> on Steam so far across 5,660 reviews (at time of writing), with players praising the game's presentation, narrative, and improvements over its predecessor.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is, it's the sequel to 2018's medieval action RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>. Like its predecessor, the game is an open-ended RPG set in 15th-century Bohemia.</p>




<p>You'll once again play as blacksmith's son Henry of Skalitz, navigating a (relatively) historically accurate world of political intrigue. Since&nbsp;<em>Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>emphasizes realism and historical detail, don't expect to see any dragons or goblins around Bohemia.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9n4w31hsmvvd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

The production agreement was signed last month and the movie is tentatively called simply <em>Gundam</em>. Bandai Namco and Legendary didn’t share any information beyond that. We have no idea when the movie will come out, what parts of the mech warfare anime it will adapt, or if there’s even a script yet. The only other detail the two companies confirmed is that it will release in theaters worldwide when it arrives. </p><p>This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about a live-action <em>Gundam</em> project. One <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2021/film/news/gundam-live-action-movie-netflix-jordan-vogt-roberts-1234949518/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/gundam-live-action-movie-netflix-jordan-vogt-roberts-1234949518/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was first reported back in 2021</a></span> as a Netflix release with <em>Y The Last Man</em> comic series creator Brian K. Vaughn set to to write and produce it. Late last year, however,<em> Deadline</em> reported that the project had moved to Legendary with a new creative at the helm, Mickle. He’s been in charge of the Netflix sci-fi fantasy series <em>Sweet Tooth</em> about a post-pandemic world full of whimsical human mutants. He’s also currently working on an adaptation of the Western fantasy comic series <em>God Country</em>. </p><p>The official confirmation that a big-budget Gundam project is in the works will have long-time fans’ heads swirling with questions and skepticism. We’ve seen how poorly this can go before, from 2009's <em>Dragonball Evolution</em> to 2017's <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>. Netflix’s live-action remake of <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> didn’t impress many fans either, though the recent<em> One Piece </em>series has found a warmer reception. The closest thing we’ve had to a <em>Gundam</em> movie with real people are Guillermo del Toro’s <em>Pacific Rim</em> movies, so there is at least an existing blueprint to make the formula not suck. </p><p>In the meantime, there’s been no shortage of ongoing Gundam anime series and movies. The newest, called <em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em> (that’s actually the name) released in Japan last month and has seemed unexpectedly decent so far. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <ul><li><strong>Build Your Little Gnome Village</strong> – Above the caves is where you’ll build your thriving little gnome village.

At the end of your turn, reposition your entire team, add more gnomes if needed, and gather again! But be warned with each turn, the cave becomes more and more unstable and ravenous bats pick at your supplies. So decide when it’s time move on and choose your path down the caves. The deeper you go, the more supplies you’ll need.</li><li><strong>A Different Team For Every Expedition</strong> – Every run lets you adapt, change, and upgrade your team at various points, making each expedition into the caves unique. Modify your team and playstyle to what you need out of the run, mixing it up when a change in tactics is required. Pick and swap from a variety of gnomes to get the job done, assign game-changing upgrades that combine in unexpected ways, and discover hidden special abilities for certain gnomes.</li><li><strong>Progress In Every Run</strong> – Venture into the caves knowing each run gets you resources no matter how they end.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> has announced Takeover, the 24th season of Respawn's battle royale, which introduces a new way to grab weapons called Arsenals. Additionally, Assault Class Legends take center stage with several perk changes, while Ash and Ballistic gain strong buffs. POIs will now be visible from the drop ship so you'll be able to see exactly where you're headed. Finally, there's new ranked challenges and the introduction of Mythic weapons - in short, there's a lot to sink your teeth into.</p>
<p>Arsenals will be available in all game modes across Apex Legends from the start of the season, as a new way of obtaining weapons once you land from the drop ship. They'll be across the map near POIs, be visible from the moment you exit the drop ship and they'll have map icons as well as HUD elements.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Arsenals are small weapon caches that you can visit to change the weapons in your inventory or those you pick up at the beginning of a match, somewhat reducing the chaotic scramble to grab anything before you get shot. Arsenal locations are fixed but the weapons stored in them will be randomised. In a recent press event attended by Eurogamer, we learned that this was designed in part to give players better chances for getting the weapons they want and are more comfortable with.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/apex-legends-season-24-arsenal-respawn-screenshot-alter%2C-revenant-and-fuse-by-arsenal-stash.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p>Speaking of weapons, Mythic guns are being added that will serve as the best version of weapons already available in-game, with their own twists on the classics. These weapons will be inspired by individual Legends, and the Season 24 addition is the Mythic R-301 inspired by Wraith. Complete with a new void-inspired look, the Mythic version comes with new animations you can equip on other R-301 skins you own as well.</p>
<p>In addition, every weapon this season has been buffed and most of them have received a damage increase as well as an alteration on their headshot multiplier. The Havoc, for example, is staying in the care package for this season and, while the Kraber remains a one-shot headshot weapon for most armor pieces it will become more than one-shot when faced with the new red helmet armor piece.</p>
<p>White, blue and purple helmets will be fully removed for Takeover to make the headshow damage value consistent for each weapon; it will no longer be dictated by the helmet a target wears. However, the only way you can get one will be to grab the red mythic grade helmet that will only show in late game care packages and in mythic bins. Once equipped, this helmet will turn the rest of your armor red. This is the only way to get this level of armor in Season 24 and armor evolution for every player for white, blue and purple armor pieces will be capped at level three. To help you stay alive longer with these changes, Shield Cells, Med Kits and Syringes are now faster to use.</p>

</figure>
<p>Assault Class Legends have been buffed with new perks for Takeover. In addition to being able to access red supply bins and carry one extra ammo per stack, the Combat Reserve perk means they'll also have two extra ordinance slots specifically for grenades. Battle Surge is gained after an Assault Legend cracks an enemy shield - once active, they'll get a temporary speed boost, faster reload speed, and highlight the cracked target for the rest of the team. The Stowed Reload perk will auto-reload any stowed weapon after two seconds.</p>
<p>Ash and Ballistic in particular have seen more buffs for this season. Ash's ultimate will further and you can move through it faster with better end point detection, the tether will snare from its own location rather than at the enemy target's location. Her passive has changed, and she now has an omni-directional dash ability, Predator's Pursuit. Both Ash's ultimate and passive can be upgraded through the upgrade tree to have two charges. She'll still be able to see Deathboxes on the mini-map too.</p>
<p>Ballistic's sling upgrade and dual tactical charge has now been integrated with his base kit, plus it can now carry crate weapons with unlimited ammunition when active. His upgrade that used to allow extra charges has been replaced with an upgrade that doubles his tactical charges, meaning at tier three Ballistic can carry four charges of his Whistler. His Tempest also now has a team movement speed bonus added to it too.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>However, Support Class Legends have had their heal expert perk removed for the upcoming season to focus them more on reviving.</p>
<p>Road to Ranked is a fresh way for new players to get into Apex Legends' ranked mode. The previous account requirements for joining ranked has been removed and replaced with a set of challenges designed for you to prove you can make it in ranked modes. Road to ranked challenges are for you to show you're a good enough teamplayer and have the skills, as well as experience, to succeed in ranked mode.  However, if you're already a ranked player from previous seasons then you won't need to participate in these challenges - these are just for new players trying to get into ranked.</p>
<p>Your starting skill value will be influenced by your performance in non-ranked modes across Apex and there will be more transparency in displays for the lobby as well as improvements made to the end of match summary screen, Respawn has said. Account progression has a dedicated home and access away from the main ranked lobby for Takeover. Finally, weapon mastery trials have changed, and the system itself has been simplified with some of the more intense and complicated challenges being removed.</p>
<p>Apex Legends Takeover will see different creators from the Apex community helping to create and curate their own challenge and rewards all season. As well as a collection of new takeovers and limited-time modes. Some to look forward to are a second change mechanic and an OG-inspired loot pool takeover.</p>
<p>Alongside the creator modes and challenges, starting at season launch Rampart Care Packages will appear in all PUBS modes for the first three weeks of the season. Within these care packages are Rampart-designed weapon variants and this time they'll be dropping with three mythic R-301 weapons. Each variant has its own unique perks, for example, the red vermillion has increased critical hit damage and triggers thermite on knocked enemies.</p>

Nintendo was asked about that last one in its latest earnings call, and while the company’s president remained cagey, he also said Nintendo will continue to take its reputation for affordability into account when determining the final price, which some experts predict will be $400. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,194141,193706" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The original Switch launched at $300 back in 2017. Since then, however, inflation has driven up the cost of various components, and console makers this generation have declined their usual hardware price cuts, even raising prices in some regions instead. And while it remains to be seen just how good the specs of the Switch 2 might be, this time around the device will also be partially competing with higher-end PC gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. </p><p> “We are aware that inflation is currently rising and that the exchange rate environment has changed significantly since the launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017,” Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told investors</a></span> in the company’s third-quarter earnings call this week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-considering-various-factors-for-switch-2-price-switch-1-cost-staying-the-same/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-considering-various-factors-for-switch-2-price-switch-1-cost-staying-the-same/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a translation by <em>Nintendo Everything</em></a></span>. “We also need to consider the affordable prices that customers expect from Nintendo products. When considering the price of our products, we believe that it is necessary to consider these factors from multiple angles. At this time, we cannot announce the specific price of the Nintendo Switch 2, but we are considering it taking into account various points.”</p><p>There will certainly be pressure to price the Switch 2 higher than its predecessor, especially because Nintendo traditionally tries to make profit off of its hardware rather than selling it under market value as a loss-leader for selling software. At the same time, Furukawa’s remarks suggest that, despite the wild popularity of the original Switch, Nintendo knows it risks pricing itself into irrelevance if it aims too high.</p><h2 id="h201"><a id=""></a>What might the Switch 2 cost?</h2><p>So what will the Switch 2 actually cost? Last month, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-cost-analysts-weigh-in&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-cost-analysts-weigh-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN </em>interviewed several industry analysts</a></span> for their expert opinions. While some think Nintendo could charge as much as $500 for the new device, many are banking on it costing $400. This was the “sweet spot” for Rhys Elliot of MIDiA, and Ampere Analysis’ Piers Harding-Rolls told <em>IGN</em> he was currently basing his sales projections on the same number. At the same time, diehard fans upgrading in the first year would probably be willing to pay more. “Early adopters won’t be price sensitive, and prices can always be lowered,” Circana’s Mat Piscatella said. “Of course, people will want it to be lower than whatever it is it will be announced at.”</p><p>And what does history tell us Nintendo will do?<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/509976/nintendo-switch-2-cost-how-much-price&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/509976/nintendo-switch-2-cost-how-much-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em> assembled a chart</a></span> of inflation-adjusted prices of all of the company’s consoles. Starting with the launch of the Nintendo 64, the price has mostly hung around $350 to $400. That seems like the minimum price this time around considering the Switch OLED itself is still $350, and while the Switch 2 is rumored to have a cheaper LCD screen, its other features, including the Joy-Con with mouse-like functionality, are a lot beefier this time around. </p><p>  <strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512">21 Games We’d Love To See On The Nintendo Switch 2</a></span></p><p>Polygon also notes that Nintendo has a history of trying to undercut its competition when it comes to price. This is the tradition of “affordability” Furukawa was referencing in this week’s call. But that will be harder to do late into a console generation where the disc-less PS5 is $450 (<em>up</em> from its 2020 launch price of $400). The current cheapest Steam Deck is also $400, though you can also get refurbished ones for under $300 when they’re available. </p><p>My own gut tells me that making the Switch 2 cost $400 is the logical play here, with $450 the absolute max the company can charge, unless it debuts something truly stunning during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848">its April Switch 2 Direct</a></span> that will get people excited to upgrade. I showed my kids the original Switch 2 reveal and they haven’t asked about it again at all, content to keep toiling away in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> and <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>. </p><p>Families without a parent that writes about video games for a living might feel similarly unmoved about upgrading early if the price is too high. But all of that will depend on everything Nintendo still hasn’t told us about it’s next console. We’ll have to wait a couple more months for that info too. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s been a great launch for Warhorse Studios’ Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 as the studio has announced that the game has sold one million copies in a little over a day on the market.</p>



<p>“Over a million of you have stepped into our world,” the studio <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1887155255130866099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on social media</a>. “We’re beyond grateful for your support – thank you for making [Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2] a triumph!</p>



<p>In Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, our Grant Taylor-Hill called the game a “masterpiece”. </p>



<p>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is beautiful in every aspect,” the review reads. “It’s deeply authentic and riddled with emotion and catharsis, and the way the story comes together is just perfection.”</p>

From ethereal sequences packed with tearjerker scenes to a phenomenal weather engine, and from genuinely interesting side activities to a neat little photo mode, I cannot find one major fault with this game.”</p>

                <p>Last year saw Destiny 2 wrap up a decade-long saga, and as the live-service game prepares to enter a new storyline later this year, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fdestiny-2-story-so-far-2025&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-the-entire-destiny-2-experience-for-30-at-humble%2F1100-6529251%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble is offering a pretty great deal on the saga so far</a>. For just $30, you can get every available Destiny 2 expansion on PC, as well as a few content packs to help you beef up your arsenal.</p><p>If you've never played it, Destiny takes place in a distant future where humanity is a step away from extinction. Following a glorious golden age after the discovery of the Traveler--a god-like entity that resembles a giant golf ball--humanity was almost wiped out by an enigmatic entity known as the Witness. The Traveler intervened at the 11th hour, but the damage was done and a new dark age began. During this time, Guardians rose to become the protectors of our species, and centuries later, a new order was established.</p><p>That's where newcomers start in Destiny 2, as you'll be cast as a freshly resurrected Guardian tasked with keeping humanity safe. That's easier said than done, as with numerous hostile alien species wandering the solar system, you'll have your work cut out for you. You can choose to grab a three-item bundle for just $5, six items for $10, and the full bundle for $20.</p><p>The game is an MMO-style online firt-person-shooter that can be played solo or cooperatively, with optional PvP content as well, where the best elements take the form of complex co-op content that involves puzzle-laden dungeons and raids.</p><h3>Pay $5 or more</h3><ul><li>Destiny 2: Forsaken Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: Shadowkeep expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Beyond Light expansion</li></ul><h3>Pay $10 or more</h3><ul><li>Destiny 2: Forsaken Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: Shadowkeep expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Beyond Light expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: The Witch Queen expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Lightfall expansion</li></ul><h3>Pay $20 or more</h3><ul><li>Destiny 2: Forsaken Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: Shadowkeep expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Beyond Light expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: The Witch Queen expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Lightfall expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: The Final Shape and Annual Pass expansion</li></ul><p>There are some things to note with this collection. 2018's Forsaken campaign is no longer accessible in Destiny 2--although you can play a few highlight missions--and the pack for it gives you access to a selection of powerful Exotic weapons and armor that you can earn in the game. The campaign for every expansion since Shadowkeep is still accessible, and while these can be hit-or-miss in their design, they're generally fun to play in a binge gaming session.</p><p>You will need Destiny 2, but the good news is that the game is free to download. The real gem here is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">The Final Shape</a>, Destiny 2's best expansion thanks to its killer storyline, exciting Prismatic powers, and coolest weapons. The new Heresy storyline has begun, and this is a great way to dive into Destiny 2 before the game is shaken up with new content later this year. Since you're saving so much cash on this bundle, you can put some leftoever funds into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/star-wars-brings-the-dark-side-to-destiny-2-with-lightsaber-emotes-death-star-ghost-and-more/2900-6223/" data-ref-id="2900-6223">Destiny 2's new Star Wars crossover</a>, unlocking armor and accessories inspired by the popular sci-fi franchise.</p><p>While this is the only gaming bundle that Humble is offering at the time of writing, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-the-entire-destiny-2-experience-for-30-at-humble%2F1100-6529251%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subscribing to Humble Choice this month</a> will get you eight PC games. The highlight here is Immortals of Aveum, and the rest of the list includes several fun fantasy and sci-fi games to check out. This is basically a deal that gives you eight games for $12, as each game is yours to own forever, even if you decide to cancel your membership.</p>

There may be some things happening in the year that may cause us to think differently about our launch timing." While he didn't explicitly name any games that could impact Battlefield 6's release date, it's obvious that GTA 6 is one of them. GTA 6 is currently set to release in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">Fall 2025</a>, but it's always possible that it could be delayed.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Introducing Battlefield Labs | Battlefield Studios</p>
      </div>
<p>Yesterday, EA revealed that Battlefield 6 is due out during its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-game-releasing-by-march-2026/1100-6529243/" data-ref-id="1100-6529243">2026 fiscal year</a>, meaning that it'll release sometime between April 1, 2025 and March 31, 2026. Battlefield games traditionally launch during fall, with the current rumor being an October 2025 release. However, if GTA 6 launches close to that time, EA is certainly willing to pivot.</p><p>Wilson said, "But if we got close to that timeframe and believe that this wasn't going to be a great window for us, then we would take a look at what an alternate window might be that would give us the appropriate time, energy, and player-acquisition opportunity for this Battlefield to be all that it needed to be."</p><p>Players can get a chance to test out the new Battlefield early through EA's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">Battlefield Labs community program soon</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-max-gaming-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Samsung announced its highly anticipated Galaxy S25 lineup last month, which comes with more or less the same design, but the internals have been improved a lot. The raw computational and graphical performance is far superior to the company's Galaxy S24 lineup, and it will make a lot of difference if you are into mobile gaming. A new comparison test was conducted between the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and the gaming performance reflects which device is better at running Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves.</p>
<h2>iPhone 16 Pro Max roasts the Galaxy S25 Ultra in Genshin Impact with a solid 95 FPS average compared to the latter's 60 FPS</h2>
<p>The App Store and Play Store offer a wide range of high-end games that make the right use of the chips in the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Galaxy S25 Ultra. A new comparison test conducted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DameTech">Dame Tech on YouTube</a> highlights the performance of the Galaxy S25 Ultra against the iPhone 16 Pro Max in Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves. The test will detail the FPS of both games, along with performance throttling and power usage on the flagship smartphones and how they compare against each other.</p>
<p>One important aspect to note at this point is that the iPhone has been the top-performing gaming device. Dame Tech mentions that despite the Galaxy S25 Ultra's exclusive high-resolution settings for games, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a better in-game resolution. We also have to take note that the Snapdragon 8 Elite's <a href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-8-elite-chip-for-galaxy-s25-is-faster/">exclusive chip</a> has better performance on paper, and it is reflected in the overall performance of both Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the comparison video below, the game settings were set to maximum, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra maintains a solid 59.2 FPS across Wuthering Waves with minor ups and downs. Additionally, the game plays smoothly with no stutter whatsoever, which goes on to show that Snapdragon's exclusive chip for the Galaxy S25 Ultra is pushing performance on par with the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max, which scored 59 FPS.</p>
<p>However, we have to consider the higher power draw for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, taking in as much as 7.2 Watts against 5.4 Watts on the iPhone. Additionally, the iPhone 16 Pro Max was played at a higher 1705 x 786 resolution compared to the Galaxy. Moreover, the test also revealed that the iPhone 16 Pro Max maintained almost the same level of frame rates while running more than 10 degrees cooler than the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It clearly shows that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-8-elite-performance-cores-overclocked-can-beat-a18-pro-in-single-score-benchmark/">A18 Pro chip</a> is handling the high-end game quite easily compared to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the iPhone 16 Pro Max crushes the Galaxy S25 Ultra in Genshin Impact on the highest settings, maintaining 95.2 FPS on average and reaching as high as 120 FPS on several occasions at a higher resolution. The Galaxy S25 Ultra seems to be running at a steady 60 FPS, likely due to a frame rate cap implemented by the game developers. The iPhone 16 Pro Max also ran a few degrees cooler.</p>

<p>While the iPhone 16 Pro Max performed better, Samsung has finally introduced a device that can compete against the iPhone. In addition, it is possibly the best gaming smartphone when it comes to competition from Android. We will share more details on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and its performance, so do stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny, culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As we settle in for the long, excruciating wait for more tangible news on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo has thrown us a little extra nugget of information. While we knew the company was planning to share more about the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">on April 2nd</a>, now we have a time: 9 AM ET / 6 AM PT / 10 PM JST. If you were taking bets on this time, you would have won handily as this is generally the usual time Nintendo holds its big events. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fsuccessor%2Fen-us%2Fnintendo-direct%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored">The announcement on Nintendo’s website</a> didn’t contain any extra detail about the duration of the event or the exact breakdown of topics that’ll be covered, other than to say it “will share a closer look” at the new device.</p><p>Last month, the company finally confirmed the existence of its new console dubbed, helpfully, the Switch 2. The reveal itself was sparse on detail, only confirming that the console would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">be larger than its predecessor</a> and that its Joy-Con controllers appear to attach <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">via some kind of magnetic action</a>. Because of the reveal’s relative lack of concrete information, we’re left with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24344718/nintendo-switch-2-specs-date-price-launch-games-mario-kart">so many questions about the new console</a>. Nevertheless, there was still lots of speculation about what the Switch 2 could possibly do. Theories were put forth that the new Joy-Cons contained some kind of mouse functionality and that the extra button on the right Joy-Con was related to some kind of party chat feature. Hopefully, Nintendo will let us know those if theories were correct during the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct on Wednesday, April 2nd bright and early at 9 AM.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
