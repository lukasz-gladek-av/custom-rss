			<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a massive game that is packed with detail. Whether it’s the huge amount of different types of armour you can wear, the reams of codex entries giving in depth background information, or how easy it is to die to a pack of wolves, it’s filled with so much stuff. Blacksmithing, swordfighting, hunting, duels, thieving, there’s a lot to keep track of. It’s in many ways a Medieval immersive sim more than what is commonly called an RPG, and can be thoroughly engrossing because of this, but the ambitions to create such a broad world can fray at the edges.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Review –&nbsp;Another medieval epic RPG" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yYdOp8TGCpQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story picks up from the cliffhanger ending of the first game, as Henry goes with Sir Hans as part of his retinue to deliver a message of peace to Lord von Bergow of Trosky Castle. Unsurprisingly, things don’t go according to plan and bandits attack whilst you’re having a bath in a lake, resulting in the loss of your horse, armour, weapons, allies, the letter for Bergow, and eventually splitting you up from Sir Hans, who storms off after an argument. Now with nothing but filthy beggars clothes to your name, you still need an audience with von Bergow, but you simply can’t get one because you look like a commoner. Ew, stinky!</p>


<p>From this opening, you’re drawn in several different directions. Wanting to meet von Bergow means trying to get into a wedding he’ll be attending, but that means you need to get in the good graces of the locals. The best way to do that is by picking up a trade like blacksmithing – Henry’s the son of a blacksmith, after all – and odd jobs to help people. Alternatively you can just hare off and try to find Henry’s dog, Mutt. This ends up being more of a wild goose chase than a dog hunt, taking you to unexplored parts of the map, filled with dangers.</p>


<p>Mutt himself is… strange. As you interact with him, your Houndsmanship skill will improve, allowing you to unlock perks that let him to do things like bark to attract attention or hunt down game, except when I’ve used this he mostly followed our prey around without managing to bite it. NPCs also vary between liking him so much that you can hear “silly doggy!” every few minutes, to being very annoyed about his mere existence. I once snuck into a room in a castle to use an alchemy station and could hear a guard outside the entire time telling my dog off. When I got outside, there were actually six different guards crowded about Mutt telling him to move. Silly doggy, indeed.</p>
<p>This isn’t even the strangest thing you can level up in this game. Every stat that you have is levelled up through performing relevant actions, a video game equivalent to practice making perfect, and through this you’ll boost your swordsmanship, smithing, thievery, and so on. This goes so far as to letting you get better at drinking alcohol. Over time you’ll become resistant to the negatives of being drunk, such as hangovers or (ironically) addiction, whilst the positives such as a boost to charisma last longer, not to mention being able to drink more before getting properly drunk.</p>
<p>In general, it’s good to do a little bit of everything.&nbsp;I focused on the things I’d expect an honourable wannabe knight to be doing, which excluded things like thievery, but I quickly felt that the game was pushing me into situations where I needed to do things outside of my comfort zone. If you haven’t been levelling thievery when you reach a mission that requires stealth, you can struggle a lot.</p>
<p>I, myself, had a disastrous three hour stretch after being tortured where I was trying to sneak away whilst what seemed like an army of guards were patrolling the hilly woods through which I was sneaking. I died over, and over, and over, much to my frustration, particularly since being tortured had halved all my stats. This also happened at the end of a very lengthy questline that, whilst cool, was exceptionally long.</p>

<p>That’s a running theme in this game; everything takes a long time. It’s exceptionally long-winded and, much like the intensely detailed mechanics elsewhere, whether or not this is for you is going to depend on either your patience or your enthusiasm for medieval politics. Conversations with everyone from smelters to lords can be absolutely packed with information, whether interpersonal details about other characters, background information about smelting, mining or countless other topics. Much of it is optional, but you never know what will be necessary to learn and you can sometimes feel a little worn out after a lengthy chat you’ve just had. To be honest, I really enjoy the incredible amount of detail, but it won’t be for those with a shorter attention span.</p>
<p>With a game of this scope, it’s no surprise that there’s some nagging issues, such as sometimes not actually explaining things clearly enough. Even now, dozens of hours into the game there are details I am still working out, such as why, when blacksmithing, I get the exact sparks and ringing sound that signals a good hit, but Henry comments about nearly breaking the piece I’m smithing. Add to that some clumsiness with aiming hammer blows and it makes it feel like it’s not working properly, or that I’ve missed a particular nuance. Still, heating up metal and working it into a sword here is far more immersive and bespoke than a hasty QTE or rhythm action mini-game you might expect.</p>

<p>That’s part of why I just can’t get enough of the game. It’s unique and challenging, with a specific vision that it doesn’t compromise at all. Going on a trip with a lord early on was a highlight, it was like it was taken out of a medieval drama and incredibly immersive. I even enjoyed a wedding as I was kept entertained by various hijinks, such as regularly hunting down someone to stop them getting drunk, or getting destroyed three times in a row in a duel.</p>
<p>Starting off in the verdant countryside surrounding Trosky Castle, going between villages and hunting through the woods on missions, the large city of Kuttenberg is a big change of pace. The streets are packed with stalls and traders, there’s crowds that will gather to see someone’s crimes read out as they stand in the stocks, and generally the feel of a hustling, bustling city. The streets can get busy, but there’s maybe not enough people consistently to really sell the population count you’d expect, though it’s convincing enough when compared with villages around Trosky.</p>

<p>Some of the illusion is broken by bugs and other minor moments of weirdness, many of which we expect to be to addressed with a day 1 patch, but they thankfully rarely affect the game experience too much. There’s some visual glitches with rain and some flickering lights, for example, and NPCs can get a little lost, walk in circles or get caught between bits of the environment. They also like to bunch up in corridors and stairs, blocking the way through, which isn’t helped by the typically cramped medieval buildings. Reactions to you and the permissiveness of the world are also inconsistent feeling. You can’t really tell if you’re allowed in somewhere without just barging in and seeing how people react, but even if it’s someone you’re acquainted and generally cordial with, they might snap at you rudely.</p>
<p>The inventory and the UI in general looks quite nice, with a skeumorphic medieval style, but the maps, inventory, quest log screens slide a lot of details and important information off the side of the screens in a way never feels natural. It’s a bit of a pain.</p>

<p>On the other hand, and very much in keeping with the tactile crafting and jobs you do, I don’t mind the lockpicking minigame, where you wiggle your right analog until you find the sweet spot, then try to keep it in the same relative position as the lock rotates. It’s takes a bit to get used to it, but works quite well and at least it’s not the same lockpicking minigame or Pipemania from every other game in the world.</p>

					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PlayStation, Xbox</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance was a game I massively anticipated when it was first announced. I eventually got <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my first hands-on with it</a> and then finally played it. Playing it did reveal the more modest nature of the development, but it also made it clear that Warhorse Studios cared about what they put out. With what was nothing short of a monumental success, the sequel—Kingdom Come: Deliverance II—was inevitable.</p>
<p>Now, I can't deny that I also held a lot of hype for this game. This was strengthened when <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I could play the game in Kuttenberg</a>, which is part of its setting. I certainly went into it thinking Warhorse could learn from and build upon the strengths of the first and work on the weaknesses that resulted in some issues for people. The question is, have they managed to do this?</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II-Review-02-Party-in-the-Bathhouse-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>A line I often hear is, "Bigger is not always better". In my case, it's frequently followed by "but in this case, bigger would have been better", as yet another person looks disappointed at the two minutes we've just spent together. Judging by the comments from the girls in the bathhouses, this isn't an issue Henry suffers from, though he may have a few unusual requests based on the dialogue. In the case of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, bigger is most certainly better, but that's because the bigger is justified, explained, and done right.</p>
<p>Going on a slight tangent, but it will come back around, is something I want to say about world design. Ideally, the open or linear world must be believable when playing a game. I don't mean believable in the sense that it can't have magic, dragons, or that middle-aged blokes from Yorkshire are suddenly the main attraction for all women; we all know only one of those is the case, and David Copperfield has given us that answer.</p>
<p>No, what needs to happen is that the events and locations need to be believable in the world presented in front of you, and the corresponding information, dialogue, and characters all need to reflect that reality. Most open-world games will tell you how massive they are, but few feel real - even those based on actual areas. In Kingdom Come: Deliverance, the villages felt like villages and had the things needed in places like that. Rattay felt big, but that was the scale for Henry, and Sassau felt huge, with the monastery astounding for a person like Henry.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a whole new level, and I believe every second of it. When you realise that the events of the second game take place 100km and 30km away from the events of the first game, based on the locations of the first and second maps of this outing, respectively, the scale makes a supposed galaxy-spanning trip like those in Starfield feel like walking to the corner shop. The characters' behaviour, their reaction to new areas, and how these areas react to them all make it feel like uncharted territory. It makes it believable.</p>

</figure>


<p>Let's start with size. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II takes place across two maps. According to Warhorse, combined, this makes the sequel a little under double that of the original, and based on my time across both maps, I would have said at least double. However, and with game maps, this is true; size doesn't count. What counts here is the <del>girth</del> density. This feels packed, like the meatiest sausage you steal from the warehouse of Sigismund and give to beggars. Get your mind out of the gutter.</p>
<p>Indeed, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-more-dialogue-than-baldurs-gate-3-half-of-all-wheel-of-time-books-combined/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sheer quantity of quests, side quests, activities</a>, and even just random easter-eggs you come across, this feels like Warhorse wanted to strike a nearly impossible balance of making what are genuinely small areas - we're talking kilometres across - feel huge. Part of this links to what I said before because these things will feel huge to Henry, and the scale represents this. The first time you see Kuttenberg, it looks enormous. Once you're inside, it feels it, too.</p>
<p>Let's talk length. If you like to explore, and you want to do the side quests, you want to go off the beaten track in the hopes of finding some easter eggs; essentially, if you play like me, be ready for a hundred-plus-hour experience, one where I don't think for a second you'll be bored. There is also replay value, as many of the game and quests will have changes based on your actions. Sometimes, these are slight changes; other times, they are big.</p>
<p>What is important to note is that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is on a grander scale than the first. Being a direct sequel, you are no longer Henry, the random scrub from Skalitz; you are Henry, the squire of Sir Hans Capon. You are the bastard of nobility, and you have your experiences and demons from the first game. The start of the game makes Henry a near-blank slate again to get the progression back in.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II-Review-04-Kuttenberg-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I've covered how this happens in my preview - <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here's a link to it again</a> - so long story short, you are ambushed, and Henry gets seriously injured and weakened as a result. You don't forget how to read; everything else must be built back up. Even your now almost-fresh relationship with Mutt, Henry's doggo companion, is explained adequately. It is not quite sequel amnesia, but it is close to it and, again, explained.</p>
<p>Like in the first game, levelling skills are achieved through your actions. You fight with a sword; you'll improve your swordsmanship. Read books and ask questions in conversations; your scholarship will be boosted. You also have people who can teach you, strengthen your skills - and give you new combat techniques - through the game, some only available depending on the outcome of certain quests. Granted, you can cheat this system by getting all quest outcomes in some (side quest) situations.</p>
<p>The second area provides an example. A pregnant lady asks you to find a Thunderstone, believed to bring good luck. Only the people who had it had it stolen. Long story short, you can eventually get a hold of it, give it back to the people from whom it was stolen, and get a reward. Then you can pickpocket the person or obtain it some other way, and steal it, go to the pregnant lady and get a reward from her. Then you can steal it from her and keep it for yourself. I'm not aware if it brings good luck, though.</p>
<p>I digress, skills. So yes, your skill levels will develop over time, and you can target your development; I particularly pushed scholarship as I wanted the perk from it, which unlocked all the key icons on the maps, giving me a good idea of things I may be missing, and more for me to explore. One such thing was a Disney easter egg, where there was indeed a poisoned apple, which gave me permanent tiredness. Fortunately, I saved before eating it.</p>
<p>Digressing again. Most of all, the progression feels natural, and the quests are reactive; if your alchemy skill is high enough, you can lecture people who could accidentally harm others. With a high enough Scholarship, you're going to be able to surprise a few nobles here and there. With Survival and others, you'll become a good battlefield medic.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II-Review-05-Sleeping-Snow-White-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, all that is gameplay, but how about the other aspects of gameplay within Kingdom Come: Deliverance II? One of the more complicated parts of the first game was the combat. It was certainly unique in its style, with the only games with a more detailed melee combat system being titles like Chivalry. Warhorse Studio knows this was a bit of a barrier for people, and they have eased off a little.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean it's simplified in a "casual" way because it isn't. They have reduced the number of points on the target system to four: up, down, left and right, and this has undoubtedly made combat "easier" in the sense that you can get to grips with it better. The way enemies are attacking is more transparent, which makes parrying and countering easier, but at the same time, the enemies will be more than happy to do the same to you.</p>
<p>No, combat is just as engaging, if not more engaging, than in the original. I've found myself on the edge of my seat with some duels, with parries and counters coming close to double digits, a keen eye on my stamina, and wishing to hell that the enemy would tire out a little or try to get in a counter and then a combination to give myself that edge. Combat feels incredibly fluid for the most part. My only real complaint is the locking system, which can be a hindrance when you are dealing with multiple enemies, as it doesn't always do what you want.</p>
<p>What I find impressive about Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is that it adds scale to the combat. The first had its set-piece battles, but they feel bigger here because they are. For spoilers, I'm not going to go into much detail, but there are battles and sieges, and of course, you're not facing every single enemy; there are more on the battlefield. The battlefield also features new ways of combat, which has a key impact on the game and its story.</p>
<p>One of these is gunpowder. It had only started being used in Europe around 80 years before the game's setting, and it was still limited in its use. The first was never on a big enough scale to feature a cannon, and as you're in bigger territory now, you'll also find the use of guns. I don't like them - they take an absolute age to reload - but they do damage and can significantly impact enemy morale.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II-Review-06-Reforging-the-Sword-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The other systems featured in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II add to this. Energy and hunger are present but aren't pushed too far to impact the game's enjoyability. The two crafting systems, Alchemy and Blacksmithing, have two reasonably interesting minigames. The reputation system, with the added impact of much more intelligent AI, which can remember your actions and make simple deductions based on your presence in an area, massively impacts the game and adds to the world extensively.</p>
<p>A great example can be a random person reporting you for theft to the guards. Not because they saw you stealing but because they saw you snooping around an area when something was stolen. They made the logical deduction, and the guards will search you. You're free to go if you don't have the stolen goods but rest assured, people will remember you. You're even more memorable to people if you're a terrible drunk who gets into lots of fist-fights.</p>
<p>You'll notice I've avoided speaking about the story, and that's also because of spoilers. This directly continues from the first game, and much of what happened in the first game is directly referenced and linked to the story here. Some characters will return, and some things will be wrapped up, even if only slightly. While a little spoiler, and I won't say how, Henry gets back the sword crafted by his murdered father, stolen in the first game.</p>
<p>As a history fan, I find it interesting that characters like Jan Žižka play a significant part in the game. The game even teases Henry as the person who cost Jan one of his eyes. To give context, Jan Žižka lost one eye in battle before becoming blind and still leading troops afterwards. However, history is somewhat altered for the story's sake, as certain characters die before the game's setting. Anybody who has read up on some of these characters will know some spoilers, though.</p>
<p>I'm just looping this back to the systems; this focus on history in game form makes me love Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. It's not a power fantasy as with other RPGs; even when you have almost maxed out every skill and have outstanding equipment, you are one silly move or one three-vs-one battle from death. Early in the game, you're not even a foolish move from it. This is still the same challenge as the original, but in a more approachable form, where janky combat and other aspects aren't making things harder through lack of polish.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II-Review-07-The-First-Battle-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If I were honest with myself, I don't think I've ever enjoyed an open-world game in the same way I have Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. Or, more accurately, the last time a game ever felt this transformational as to what I would expect from an open-world RPG of this nature was The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion almost twenty years ago. The Witcher III is up there, but even that doesn't feel as responsive as this. In the case of Oblivion, the fact that Bethesda hasn't moved the dial even a millimetre since then is telling: the same janky AI, the same bugs, the same genuinely average worlds.</p>
<p>Where the world reacts to everything, from the clothes you wear to how dirty they are and even if you happen to have walked through some excrement, to your behaviour and the way people remember your actions and can even make some logical assumptions in the case of thievery, this is the closest I've ever felt to being part of a living, breathing world, where the inhabitants feel like part of that world.</p>
<p>This isn't to say it is flawless. I've encountered a few bugs, though they have been scarce. There are a few floating objects here and there, including a magical bird nest hovering a metre above a rooftop. I've had the rare line of dialogue swapped and others where a line is repeating itself, over itself. I've also had a few enemy NPCs stuck on fences, which made my victory much more straightforward. A few random graphical glitches have popped in, too. Still, the flaws have been so few and far between I can't fault the polish.</p>
<p>I would genuinely argue that this could be judged as a benchmark on how to do an open world, and even though I'm over fifty hours in, there's more I want to do and see. There are side quests to complete, easter eggs to hunt, wenches to fornicate with, and bandits to kill. I didn't want to write this review now, not in the slightest; I wanted just one more day to give even more context, and I know I would have wanted just one more day after that.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1886390949091123378" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> shared with Kotaku's Ethan Gach, the ESA says that tariffs on gaming hardware and products would "impact Americans of all ages" and that they could cause "significant harm to everyday Americans", as well as to the gaming industry itself.</p>

<p>The ESA goes on to urge Trump and his administration to "consult with the private sector in a transparent process" to avoid causing such harm to both Americans and "one of the fastest-growing entertainment sectors in the US".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/esa-trump-tariffs-comments-e3.jpg?itok=bxfJLpBX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/esa-trump-tariffs-comments-e3.jpg?itok=ICjfNyW7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The ESA is perhaps best-known by many for being the driving force behind E3 prior to its demise.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're not aware, the tariffs to which the ESA is referring <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn93e12rypgo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">were imposed</a> by President Trump this weekend, primarily targeting goods made in Mexico (although those particular tariffs have been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-sheinbaum-trudeau-017efa8c3343b8d2a9444f7e65356ae9?taid=67a0e79c4fe82f000101eeaa" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">paused for a month</a>), China, and Canada.</p>

<p>Specifically, Trump will impose a 25% tariff on Mexican- and Canadian-made goods, with a 10% tariff being slapped on Chinese-made products. This is, of course, a problem for companies that import their goods from those countries.</p>

<p>Many gaming consoles and peripherals are made in China, and as the BBC points out in the above-linked story, economists say that import hikes for companies are usually passed on to consumers in the form of increased prices.</p>

<p>This means that for a console as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">eye-wateringly expensive as the PS5 Pro</a>, for instance, you could expect to pay significantly more in future, which could in turn lead to fewer consoles and accessories being purchased on the whole.</p>

<p>Of course, that would also probably mean a price hike for digital games in order to ensure parity between the two media types.</p>

<p>It's impossible to predict exactly what's going to happen at this stage, but the ESA is spooked enough to call on Trump and his administration to discuss the matter further with the gaming sector. Whether they do or not is another matter entirely. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a> recently dropped <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafts-beta-versions-now-offer-adorable-hot-and-cold-pig-variants">pig variants</a> into beta, giving porkly variants in cold and warm climates. The other barnyard animals were presumably breighing and neighing from the neglect, but here comes a solution: cows are getting cold cow and warm cow variants, too.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The cold climate bovine seems clearly modelled to resemble the highland cow - which I am nation-bound to call the best cow, because it is. The warm cow is a deeper shade of brown and that's fine, too.
</p>
<p>This same salvo of updates also adds a firefly bush, which grow near bodies of water and glow when night falls. You can apparently dig these up and bury them below other blocks "to make them sparkle". No word on how the fireflies feel about that. There's also an ordinary bush to be found in foresty, greenery biomes and new ambient desert sounds. 
</p>
<p>All of the above is now available in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft-java-edition">Minecraft: Java Edition</a>'s snapshot beta. They'll come to Bedrock's beta later - although Bedrock players now have access to the crunchy leaf litter and decorative wildflowers that entered beta with the pig variants earlier this month.
</p><p>My son and I have recently transitioned from Bedrock to Java Edition, to give us access to more skins and mods. He's playing on the Steam Deck, which poses extra challenges in making everything run smoothly. It also means that I won't be installing any Java Edition betas anytime soon, because a lot of mods tend to lag behind even Minecraft's fully released updates.
</p>
<p>Who needs updates anyway when we've got Ollie's list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-mods">best Minecraft mods</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Like any developer we’re limited by time and resources.  I know that this is painful for everyone, and I know every member of PFG feels it too, but I have to call this out, you’re entitled to what you say and think, but when there are threats to harm it’s crossing the line.

It also abandoned <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, which won’t receive any new updates but will remain online, after it struggled to win fans in its first year in what amounted to a reportedly $200 million loss for the publisher. The good news is that both games will remain available to play offline, unlike most live-service games that don’t make it. </p><p>And not everyone is using <em>MultiVersus</em>’ demise to settle scores or rehash old design debates.” Thank you <em>MultiVersus</em> for the awesome memories,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1igaodz/thank_you_multiversus_for_the_awesome_memories/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1igaodz/thank_you_multiversus_for_the_awesome_memories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reads one recent top thread</a></span> on the subreddit. “Wanted to say thank you to the development team for the probably insane work that they’ve done to make this game,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1ighm6a/thank_you_to_the_dev_team_for_making_this_game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1ighm6a/thank_you_to_the_dev_team_for_making_this_game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another</a></span> began. “It really is a shame that this game is shutting down, but I’m still happy that it happened and that we had the chance to play it.

<p>EA has given players a small tease of what appears to be gameplay from the upcoming Battlefield 6 (name not confirmed). As part of their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of Battlefield Labs</a>, EA released a short clip of gameplay from the popular shooter.</p>



<p>The gameplay comes from a Pre-Alpha version of the next game. You can check it out for yourself, courtesy of EA, below.</p>



<figure><video controls="" poster="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BF6Screen.jpg" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BF6Gameplay.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>With Battlefield Labs, select players will be able to have a direct line of communication with developers as they build the next game in the Battlefield franchise. </p>



<p>“We’re going to test all the new features that we’re putting out, and we’re going to test hardware like weapons, vehicles, and gadgets,” Creative Director Thomas Andersson said. </p>



<p>“That feedback is crucial in helping us know what’s prioritized, what needs improvement, and what feels like a true Battlefield experience.”</p>



<p>The next Battlefield game is currently in development at what EA is calling “Battlefield Studios”. These studios are made up of four EA subsidiaries—DICE, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect—working on different aspects of the new title. More information on the next game in the franchise will come later on. </p>

<p>As I watched the credits roll over an impeccable soundtrack, I found myself reflecting on my journey through Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. This beautiful, unforgettable game captured my full attention (no easy feat) for more than 70 hours, and I felt a strange concoction of emotions running through me.</p>



<p>It was a sense of relief at how the story had wrapped up, and a comedown from the adrenaline-fuelled high that accompanied the final sequences of this wonderful game. I revelled in victory and mourned those I’d lost along the way, and of course, I looked to whatever would come next, as for all the hours I’d invested, my path through KCD2 <strong>wasn’t yet finished</strong>.</p>



<p>This is everything I ever wanted in a sequel – and so much more. In this comprehensive Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review, I hope you’ll come with me as I look back at one of the best games I’ve ever played.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pure-cinema">Pure Cinema</h2>



<p>From the very opening sequences of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, you’re made aware that Warhorse Studios wants to transcend delivering ‘a game’ and instead has chosen to offer players worldwide the ultimate cinematic experience. The soundtrack is bold and lifting, the visuals stunning, and the acting right off the bat is nothing short of sumptuous.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 doesn’t mess around with a light-hearted introduction. Within the first hour of the game, you’ve seen slaughter and decimation at the hands of bandits, you’ve been left for dead, and your situation is looking dire. It’s quite a callback to the first game, which was released in 2018 and opened much in the same way.</p>



<p>As the game unfolds, you’ll be treated to a twisting, winding story packed with choices and consequences, which is exactly what I was hoping for. The paths you pick will shape the world around you, and from the relationships you embrace to the decisions you make midway through a conversation, <strong>everything means something.</strong></p>



<p>This isn’t just a medieval RPG – it goes far beyond that.</p>



<p>In Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, you’ll be forced to meander through an intense story with intrepid abandon, ready and willing to change the course of history and the lives of those close to you. How you dress, fight, act, kill, and succeed (or <strong>fail</strong>) will mould your story and your version of Henry of Skalitz, the game’s bold protagonist.</p>



<h2 id="h-small-becomes-mighty">Small Becomes Mighty</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The pacing shifts in such a nice way between wanton violence and jubilant revelry</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s not just about the gorgeous landscapes, the towering castles, or the ambitious mission sequences in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. One of the things I love most about this game is the attention to even the smallest details. This is a world that lives and breathes around you, and at no point in my 70-hour campaign run did I feel as though I <strong>wasn’t </strong>immersed in something.</p>



<p>The best way I can explain this concept is to highlight how <strong>crime </strong>works in this Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review.</p>



<p>If you steal a set of keys from a character, you might return to their home later to find they’ve changed the locks. When you commit a crime against nobility, you’ll be more harshly pursued and punished than if you’d robbed a peasant. When you drop something on the floor, an NPC might steal it – but only if it suits their character or their desires.</p>



<p>On the topic of NPCs, the game’s ‘named characters’ aren’t just existing, they’re living their lives and working through a schedule. They might wake up in their designated home, go to work, revel in the tavern in the evening, and then head home for some food before going to sleep again.</p>



<p>In one sequence, I saw a gaggle of women huddled outside the local pub having a chat, and when it started to rain, they moved under a shelter to get out of the bad weather and continue their conversation. In another, I walked into a town covered in dirt and was berated by an innkeeper – until I washed in a nearby trough, prompting him to praise me for a job well done.</p>



<p>These interactions feel almost unscripted, and they’re more common than you’d think.</p>



<p><strong>Time </strong>also plays a detailed role in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. If you accept a side quest but take too long to do something, you might miss some kind of deadline and you’ll fail that task. People aren’t waiting on you forever – life doesn’t last that long in 15th-century Bohemia.</p>



<h2 id="h-and-scale-it-up">And Scale It Up</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll be mindblown by the scale of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</figcaption></figure>







<p>From the grandeur of the story and the depth of the smaller details to the scope and scale of the wider world.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-back-to-trosky-kcd2-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">split between two large maps</a> – Trosky and Kuttenberg. The first is more of a starter realm, while the second is a gargantuan, open-ended environment with more than a dozen towns and villages to explore. Both are rich, varied, and stunning, and you’ll never want for something to do while you’re out digging through the forests and fields.</p>



<p>As your story unravels, you’ll go from small-scale skirmishes to immensely brutal fortress sieges, such is the natural progression of the incredible story of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. It’s not done quickly, though – the events that lead from the opening hours to the grandest battles in the game are plentiful and relatively heavy.</p>



<p>The meat on the bone is, in a word, staggering. One of the things that kept slowing down my playthrough was the plethora of content up for grabs, the spontaneity of random events and side quests, and the ability to just <strong>look</strong>.</p>



<p>I’m being literal when I say that.</p>



<p>On more than one occasion, I found myself sitting down in a glade or the middle of a village somewhere, soaking up the sunlight and the atmosphere around me, listening to the wind in the trees and the birds tweeting above me. In the distance, a cart rolled by, prompting a guard dog to bark loudly, and down the road, I could see two farmers sharing a joke as they passed each other by.</p>



<p>The small details might be remarkable in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, but it’s the enormity of the game and the consistency of the world-building and environment around you that blows your mind.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-honest-experience">The Honest Experience</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a cutthroat world out there, but he’ll find my chain hard to slash</figcaption></figure>







<p>For 70 hours, I played a pre-release version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, but I’m pleased to report that I had no performance issues (on PC), nor did I have any game-breaking bugs. I experienced some minor issues with shaders, misbehaving AI, and some glitching ragdoll physics, but that was about it.</p>



<p>My biggest concerns were eliminated by the game’s day one patch, which I received ahead of launch.</p>



<p>As I explored the game to piece together my Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review, I thought after a while that the title’s forced stealth sequences would ruin my impression of the game altogether. There are plenty of them and they’re a little cumbersome at times, but once you learn your routes and understand the core mechanics of how to be stealthy, they’re not <strong>terrible</strong>.</p>



<p>I’ll also stress quite openly that this game is <strong>challenging</strong>. The combat and some mechanics <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-lockpick-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like lockpicking</a> are notorious, and since the first game, they’ve evolved but remain quite tough in general. Even at a higher level with a stack of advantageous perks and killer equipment, I found myself getting my head stoved in during the many fights you get involved in.</p>



<p>Practice makes perfect, and you can often run away to fight another day, of course.</p>



<p>Also, I’ll address the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-banned-saudi-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KCD2 controversies</a>‘ here. Before launch, it slipped out that Henry of Skalitz, the game’s protagonist, could engage in a homosexual sequence with another male character. That prompted people to launch into a tirade against the game, but I’m here to set the story straight.</p>



<p>It’s entirely <strong>optional</strong>, it’s the result of a few choices you’re <strong>offered</strong> throughout the game, and it’s beautifully portrayed by Warhorse Studios. It’s not graphic, and it’s not gratuitous – it <strong>makes sense</strong>, given the circumstances and story. In a similar vein, I was able to romance a female love interest and frequented the city baths for favours – so ignore the chatter of anyone deluded enough to judge without first experiencing what’s on offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-beautiful-palette">The Beautiful Palette</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How will you get out of this one?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is beautiful in every aspect. It’s deeply authentic and riddled with emotion and catharsis, and the way the story comes together is just perfection. It features my favourite trope, with all the game’s heroes (and villains) coming together for a grand, full-scale, spectacular battle at the end of the adventure.</p>



<p>It’s not a bridge too far to suggest that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 <strong>taught me </strong>something, too. From the codex packed full of historical information to the <strong>real people, places, and events</strong>, there’s a lot to break down from this title that’ll have you feeling like a genuine historian, rubbing shoulders with old kings, lords, and ladies.</p>



<p>I implore you to buy and finish Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 – the final cinematic cutscene made me yearn for this game to generate a sequel and perhaps a few spin-off television shows and movies. I can’t stress enough how much of a fantastic time I had playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and I am forever grateful to everyone at Warhorse, and to Tom McKay (Henry of Skalitz) and Luke Dale (Hans Capon) for their stellar work and performances.</p>



<p>This monumental medieval adventure will have you living a double life – but in this one, you’re a brave adventurer exploring the most faithful recreation of a real place I’ve ever seen. From ethereal sequences packed with tearjerker scenes to a phenomenal weather engine, and from genuinely interesting side activities to a neat little photo mode, I cannot find one major fault with this game.</p>



<p>It has been hard to find the words to accurately represent how phenomenal this game is. If I could sum up Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 in just one, it would be this: <strong>masterpiece</strong>.</p>



<p>Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going back to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. I’ve got a lot left to do, and this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three expansions</a> are set to be released, which means I’ve got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many hours of gameplay</a> left to unpack.</p>

We want our community to play a key role in the future of <em>Battlefield</em> and this is an opportunity for many of you to do just that.</p><p>We will test (almost) everything but not everything you see will be complete. To ensure that your feedback has impact, players will experience, under NDA, different pieces of an unfinished puzzle so we have time to incorporate your feedback into the final product. </p><p>Even in pre-alpha, we are proud of where the game is at.

                <p>Electronic Arts and DICE have announced Battlefield Labs, a new community test program for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">next Battlefield game</a> that aims to help make the new game the best it can be. EA is rolling out this program in the wake of the poor reception to Battlefield 2042, which launched in a rough state back in 2021.</p><p>EA also announced Battlefield Studios, which is the new banner under which four studios will make "the future of Battlefield." These development teams include DICE, Ripple Effect, Criterion, and Motive. <strong>DICE</strong> is working on multiplayer, <strong>Motive</strong> is developing single-player content (and multiplayer maps), <strong>Ripple Effect</strong> is making an unannounced new Battlefield experience, and <strong>Criterion</strong> is a partner studio supporting single-player, EA said in the video below. The first gameplay footage for the new Battlefield game was also released in the video and can be see--albeit briefly and in pre-alpha form--at the end of the video.</p><p>Anyone can <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a>, but DICE said only a select number of players will be admitted, and the test itself is only open to people in North America and Europe to begin with. More territories will be added later as the test environment expands. Only a "few thousand" people will get in to the test, EA said, and it will comprise both Battlefield veterans and newcomers alike. Eventually, EA will ramp up the test to include "tens of thousands" of people.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="848915071" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Battlefield possible. The testing will take place across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>"Battlefield Labs is our most ambitious community collaboration in franchise history, launching as we enter a critical phase in development," DICE said. "We want to build Battlefield with our community. So it is a space for play and exploration; an environment where we can test concepts and mechanics with our players before we release them publicly. Our community is at the heart of Battlefield; their feedback is crucial in helping us know what to prioritize, what to improve and what feels like an authentic Battlefield experience."</p><p>"Battlefield Labs is launching as we enter a critical phase in development with what's next for Battlefield where we are looking to cross-collaborate with the community like never before. Now is the time to test big areas of the experiences our teams have been building for our upcoming launch."</p><p>The first Battlefield Labs test will begin "in the coming weeks," DICE said. An EA Account is required. EA said there will not be a "rigid cadence" for the testing sessions. "The plan is to run sessions that are at appropriate times for different players in different regions, and build (to allow for repeated testing) every few weeks. Test sessions scheduled will be pre-defined and communicated directly to Battlefield Labs participants ahead of them taking place," EA said.</p><p>As for the available content, EA said players admitted to the test will get to try an "early test of concepts and mechanics, and that players should expect "rough edges, bugs, and crashes."</p><p>"Battlefield Labs content will be tested at a time in our development when it is critical for us to cross-collaborate with our community, with their feedback being crucial in helping us know what to prioritize, what to improve and what feels like an authentic Battlefield experience," EA said. "Each Battlefield Labs testing session will have specific feedback goals, whether very specific to core combat loops, or map layout for example, or more general goals around the content being tested and how fun it is for players."</p><p>EA said it will test "almost everything" via the Battlefield Labs program. </p><p>"Even in pre-alpha, we are proud of where the game is at. We tirelessly playtest, but your feedback will supercharge our development as we strive to hit that perfect note between form, function, and feel," EA said. "This is an unprecedented moment for Battlefield. We will start by testing the pillars of play, like core combat and destruction. Then transition to balance and feedback for our weapons, vehicles and gadgets, ultimately leading to where all these pieces come together in our maps, modes, and squad play."</p><p>The Conquest and Breakthrough modes will be in the Battlefield Labs tests as well, EA assured fans, referring to the franchise's most iconic modes. "BF Labs will also be a place to explore new ideas and fine-tune and improve Battlefield pillars like our class system (Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon) to create deeper more strategic play," EA said.</p><p>Players can submit feedback directly to the developers via a private Discord channel. EA said its teams will collect feedback and come up with plans that inform "what we need to prioritize, what we need to improve, and what we need to change to make it an authentic Battlefield experience when we release it publicly."</p><p>EA said it will publish public recaps of what it's learned from the testing phases, in addition to the steps being taken to address fan feedback. What that means is even if you don't get chosen to participate, you'll still be able to learn about what's changing and why.</p><p>EA also noted that everyone invited to the test will have to sign an NDA that prohibits them from talking about or showing off any footage of the early version of the next Battlefield.</p><p>What's more, EA published the system requirements on PC for the Battlefield Labs test, which can be seen below.</p><ul><li>PC Minimum Specs:  <ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li><li>GPU: Nvidia RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT 6GB</li><li>Memory: 16GB</li><li>Storage: Minimum 30GB</li></ul></li><li>PC Recommended Specs:  <ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-10700 / AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li><li>GPU: Nvidia RTX 3060Ti / AMD Radeon RX 6700-XT</li><li>Memory: 16GB</li><li>Storage: Minimum 30GB</li></ul></li></ul><p>The test environment for the new Battlefield game is no surprise, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/large-scale-playtests-for-new-battlefield-will-start-early-next-year/1100-6526539/" data-ref-id="1100-6526539">EA already confirmed a large-scale testing period for the game back in 2024.</a></p><p>As for the shift to the Battlefield Studios umbrella, EA said it needed multiple teams to realize its ambition for the future of Battlefield.</p><p>"To make our vision for the future of Battlefield a reality, we had to think bigger than just one studio. We rallied 20+ years of Battlefield experience, combined them with the best emerging talent in the industry, and united them under a single banner: Battlefield Studios," EA said. "This represents the largest team in franchise history, across a world-class group of development studios, focused on delivering on our ambitious vision for the future full of fun, authentic Battlefield experiences for our community built on our unique DNA."</p><p>The next Battlefield, which doesn't have an official title yet, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">returns to modern times</a> after Battlefield 2042 took the fight to the future. Battlefield boss Vince Zampella said previously that Battlefield 2042 didn't resonate with fans in part because some of the game's ideas were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-strayed-a-little-too-far-from-what-makes-the-series-fun-ea-exec-says/1100-6507599/undefined/" data-ref-id="1100-6507599">too ambitious</a>, like its 128-player matches.</p><p>"I think they just strayed a little too far from what Battlefield is. They tried to do a couple things that were maybe ambitious: grow the player count etc. I don't think they spent enough time iterating on what makes that fun," Zampella said. "It's not inherently a bad idea. The way they were set up and the way they executed just didn't allow them to find the best thing possible."</p><p>DICE's new GM, Rebecka Coutaz, said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">the work-from-home setup was challenging as well for Battlefield 2042.</a></p><p>"It is different to work from home, even though that is the way we're working now, it took time to adapt," Coutaz said. "And it took time to know how to work well together. Everybody was disappointed--our community, our players, and our team as well. It's a team that has invested years of their lives into this game. And for that game not to live up to any expectations from the team or from the players, that was tough. We are moving forward and we've done a lot of things since then."</p><p>Zampella was elevated to the overall boss of Battlefield after Battlefield 2042's launch. He has said that under his watch, the Battlefield series is being developed under a "whole new structure."</p><p>"We're putting multiple studios together. We're bringing the best talent together and giving them the time to do something amazing," Zampella said.</p><p>Though Battlefield 2042 might not have landed with everyone, the game finished 2021 as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-vanguard-and-black-ops-cold-war-were-no-1-and-2-best-selling-games-of-2021-in-the-us/1100-6499720/" data-ref-id="1100-6499720">fifth-best-selling game of the year in the US</a>.</p>

            <p>
EA has shown off a glimpse of its next Battlefield game, as it begins what it describes as its "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" - an initiative known as Battlefield Labs. 
</p>
<p>
Fans can sign up now, with the first testing phase beginning "in the coming weeks". The launch of Battlefield Labs comes, EA says, as its work enters "a critical phase in development that will benefit from collaboration with the community like never before".
</p>
<p>
Anyone who signs up will need to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) in order to test classic modes such as Conquest and Breakthrough, the game's returning class system, as well as "new ideas". (I wonder if that includes the mode that developer Ripple Effect is working on, which some suspect to be a battle royale?)

<p>
The next Battlefield game is being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-amassing-largest-battlefield-team-in-franchise-history-to-double-down-on-live-service-multiplayer">developed by a huge group spread across four major EA teams</a>, now working under the umbrella name of Battlefield Studios. As previously announced, this includes franchise creator DICE, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-developer-dice-la-renamed-to-ripple-effect-studios">splinter studio Ripple Effect</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-remake-directors-join-battlefield-development">Star Wars Squadrons and Dead Space Remake maker Motive</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-developer-criterion-to-focus-on-battlefield">Criterion, the veteran UK studio behind Burnout and Need for Speed</a>.
</p><p>It won't, of course, include Ridgeline Games - the studio previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-game-director-marcus-letho-leaves-ea-and-ridgeline-games">led by ex-Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto</a> that had been working on a narrative-led Battlefield campaign - which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-studio-closure-a-gut-punch-marcus-lehto-says">shut down a year ago</a>. Work on the mode is now expected to be completed by Criterion.</p>
<p>
Currently, Motive is the only developer within Battlefield Studios known to be still working on another project (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-iron-man-is-using-a-community-council-to-feedback-on-everything-during-development">its under-wraps Iron Man game</a>, which seems far-off). </p>
<p>
  As Eurogamer reported today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now">all work on Criterion's Need for Speed franchise is meanwhile on pause</a> - though there's a commitment that the franchise will continue at some point in the future.
</p>
<p>
All eyes are on EA to bring back Battlefield as strongly as possible, after the poorly-received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> failed its mission to do the same.
</p>
<p>
EA previously said its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">new Battlefield game would be set in the modern day</a>, with a return to its traditional classes and more focused maps. 
</p>
<p>
There's no detail today on exactly when the next Battlefield game will actually arrive. EA will likely be looking to see how well Battlefield Labs is going first, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">how the rest of 2025's video game release schedule</a> shapes up.
</p>
<p>Last month, EA says <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard "underperformed"</a>, as it lowered its financial forecast for the year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>An all-digital future may still be far away for Sony, as the PlayStation 6 will likely not be a completely discless console, according to SIE Worldwide Studios' former CEO Shawn Layden.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KIWITALKZ">KiwiTalks</a>, the former PlayStation executive commented on the PS6, saying that he doesn't think Sony can get away with releasing a discless console. Xbox has had more success in this strategy as they are mostly successful in markets such as the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, where conditions were better suited for the jump. Sony, on the other hand, is the number one platform in around 170 countries around the world, and has an obligation to evaluate how many of the markets they are successful in would be able to make the jump into an all-digital future. In addition, the former executive also highlighted how PlayStation consoles are popular in military bases, where there's often no internet connection, and with athletes who bring the systems with them to hotels, where downloading tens, if not a hundred plus, gigabytes would be extremely inconvenient. With their market being so huge, Shawn Layden ended, it will be hard for them to release a completely discless PlayStation 6.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 6 has yet to be officially announced, but work on the new console has unsurprisingly already started.&nbsp;<span>The new system, like its two immediate predecessors, will be powered by&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD hardware</a>, although Intel did try to produce the system</span><span>. The design of its SoC is complete and already in the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-soc-design-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-silicon validation phase</a>. According to other rumors, there are&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/two-playstation-6-socs-affordable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two different SoCs</a> in the works, and one of them is said to be more affordable</span>, which will possibly power a less powerful variant of the system like a handheld.</p>

<p>The United States government—led by Donald Trump—is set to impose new trade tariffs across a number of countries such as Canada, Mexico, and China. These tariffs are set to impact a number of industries including video games, and has garnered a response from the Entertainment Software Association (ESA).</p>



<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1886390949091123378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, the organization is asking Trump and the United States government to consult to avoid “significant harm” to people in the United States.</p>



<p>“Tariffs on video game devices and related products would impact Americans of all ages across the country,” the statement reads. “We urge the administration to consult with the private sector in a transparent process to avoid causing significant harm to everyday Americans and to one of the fastest growing entertainment sectors in the United States.”</p>



<p>It’s worth nothing that digital software is likely to avoid the tariffs, physical products like game discs and consoles aren’t likely to be so lucky. It’s unknown just how much of an impact on prices gamers will see on things like the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, computer graphics cards, and even the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The tariffs are scheduled to being at 12:01 ET on February 4.</p>



<p>How do you think these tariffs will affect the video game industry, and what do you think of the ESA’s statement? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

                <p>Civilization VII reviews have gone live, and the new entry in the series is proving to be quite divisive with critics. A 4X turn-based strategy game, Civilization VII offers a familiar foundation for returning players, as you'll pick an influential leader from human history, expand an empire through various eras, and aim to reach multiple societal milestones along the way.</p><p>The difference here is that developer Firaxis shakes up that formula with big changes, with these tweaks ranging from impactful to possibly controversial for veterans of the series. It's also worth noting that all of these reviews were done on PC, the platform that's generally considered to be the best for traditional 4X strategy games like this. The game is also coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch, so it remains to be seen how well the experience translates to consoles.</p><p>"For Civilization VII, Firaxis has made some sweeping changes, most notably with how you progress through each historical period," Jason Rodriguez noted in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review/1900-6418332/" data-ref-id="1900-6418332">Civilization VII review</a>. "Several of these new features are welcome, given that they address concerns from previous titles while also making campaigns more dynamic. However, a few design decisions are bound to be contentious, especially for longtime fans, since these mechanics tend to impact the player's control over certain outcomes."</p><p>Critical reception from other outlets has been mixed, and on GameSpot's sister site Metacritic, Civilization VII currently has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">metascore</a> of 79 from 32 reviews. Some of these reviews have praised Firaxis for the sweeping changes made to the game's formula, while other critics have commented on how the game can be frustrating and frequently dull. For a closer look, you can read below to see what the critics have to say so far.</p><ul><li><strong>Game:</strong> Civilization VII</li><li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch</li><li><strong>Release date:</strong> February 11</li><li><strong>Metascore:</strong> 79</li></ul><h2>GameSpot -- 80</h2><p>"Sid Meier's Civilization VII's "one more turn" aspect is still as engaging as ever, and I enjoyed huge portions of my playthroughs. Several facets, such as those related to diplomacy, espionage, crises, and combat address long-standing concerns. Legacy Paths and narrative events, meanwhile, offer rich and rewarding avenues for advancement through the ages. Unfortunately, as someone who's seen the heights that previous series entries have reached, the vanilla Civilization VII experience still needs a few tweaks, as it's held back by the aforementioned issues that occur during brief but crucial era transitions. Granted, the changes this series has undergone over the years--whether it's the square tiles or hexes debate, the "one unit per tile" drama, or city-planning with districts--have been for the better, eventually." -- <em>Jason Rodriguez</em> [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review/1900-6418332/">Full review</a>]</p><h2>VGC -- 5/5</h2><p>"Civilization VII is bold enough to add big changes to its formula, without getting rid of everything that has made the series iconic. Say goodbye to your free time, as from PC to handheld, every waking moment will be consumed by One More Turn." -- <em>Jordan Middler</em> [<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/civilization-7-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Windows Central -- 4.5/5</h2><p>"Civilization VII's biggest changes fix mid- and end-game pacing, clean up clutter on the map, and open up more strategic avenues than ever before. Victory and unit balancing will no doubt be tweaked as developers receive feedback and data, but otherwise, the game is in a great state--something that's becoming increasingly rare in AAA games. Pricing and DLC gripes aside, Civilization VII should prove to be the best playground for world domination for years to come." -- <em>Cale Hunt</em> [<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/civilization-vii-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>VG247 -- 4/5</h2><p>"The subtle whiff of compromise in order to launch the game far and wide <em>is</em> there--but compromise is just fine if the end result works. It does. I'm happy. As someone who has somewhere in the region of a thousand hours logged across Civ 4, 5, and 6, I’m ready to add hundreds more to that tally in the seventh entry. Some of that will come in years as the game grows and expands, as is Civilization tradition. But the point is, the foundations here are firm. The legend of one desperate extra turn, over and over again, forever, is secure." -- <em>Alex Donaldson</em> [<a href="https://www.vg247.com/civilization-7-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>GamesRadar -- 4/5</h2><p>"Civilization VII is a revolutionary strategy game for newcomers and long-time fans alike. Though some tweaks around diplomacy and Ages fall short, a host of small reinventions--along with Firaxis' biggest gamble in tackling the tedium of long-running campaigns--pays off superbly." -- <em>Andrew Brown</em> [<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/strategy/civilization-7-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>IGN -- 70</h2><p>"With Civilization VII, the desire to streamline and simplify this legendary 4X series feels like it has gone a bit too far, particularly when it comes to the interface. It's frustratingly inadequate at providing me with the information I need to play well, or even understand what's going on sometimes. Even so, it does have improved warfare and diplomacy, a bit of added narrative flair, as well as mostly gorgeous graphics and sound, so it can still give me reasons to keep clicking one more turn late into the night. There’s good reason to believe that with Firaxis's usual pace of patches and expansions it can refine its new ideas and become everything it ought to be, and while what’s here right now is at least still a fun time, it's also a bigger step backward for the series than we're accustomed to when a new age dawns." -- <em>Leana Hafer</em> [<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Eurogamer -- 40</h2><p>"Civilization VII is pretty and detailed and sounds fine (I caught that one tune from Colonization!). AI turns are perhaps the fastest I've ever seen, and its UI has enough potential to make some of my complaints feel patchable. Its design broadly works, and a certain kind of city-optimizing fan may even love it. But its lack of character is endemic, the extent of its annoying habits and oversights shocking for a series of such pedigree. It's a dull, contradictory game, and instead of showing everyone how it's done, it's felt since hour one like a game that leaves the 4X throne empty." -- <em>Sin Vega</em> [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p>

		<p>Elliot Page, the star of Beyond: Two Souls, has had his Pageboy Productions company acquire the rights to create a TV show based on the game.</p>
<p>The series is now in early development and will follow Jodie, a young woman tied to a mysterious ghostly entity called Aiden, who gives the pair supernatural powers. The show will follow the game’s non-linear narrative, jumping through different periods of Jodie’s life from early days where she first encounters Aiden, to encounters with the military and other forces.</p>


<p>The game starred Page and veteran actor Willian Defoe who played Nathan Dawkins, a scientist specialising in paranormal activity. He works with his associate Cole Freeman and tries to understand Jodie’s powers while also acting as a surrogate father figure.</p>
<p><iframe title="BEYOND: TWO SOULS OFFICIAL PC TRAILER [EN]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uYxM0ULt2Js?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Filming the game was one of the most challenging and fulfilling acting experiences of my career,” Page said. “The story’s rich narrative and emotional depth offer us a fantastic foundation. We want to create a unique vision of the characters and their journeys that resonates with fans and newcomers.”</p>

<p>“This adaptation will honour the game’s legacy while inviting fresh perspectives,” Pageboy’s Head of Development and Production Matt Jordan Smith said. “Delving into questions of survival and how split-second decisions can alter not just our lives, but the lives of others, are key to telling the story.”</p>
<p>“We are absolutely thrilled to collaborate again with Elliot Page on this project,” adds Beyond: Two Souls writer and director, David Cage. “I was blown away by his acting performance in the game, and I couldn’t think of anyone else to tell this story with the same passion on another medium.<em>&nbsp;Beyond: Two Souls&nbsp;</em>is a very special game for millions of players around the world who were moved by the story of Jodie and Aiden, and their journey in life and beyond. I know that Elliot has all the talent and instinct to make it something really unique on TV.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-co-founder-dan-houser-teases-his-new-game-with-cast-of-characters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>To tease an upcoming game in such a way is a very strange way to do it, but this is something that Rockstar has done before. It makes perfect sense that Dan Houser would go on to leave Rockstar Games to work on his own title and then tease it in the same way. He has been working on his new title at his own studio, Absurd Ventures, for a couple of years. Thus far, not many details have been released, other than a fever dream video in 2023 and 12 episodes of a narrative podcast to help set the scene for the debut title.</p>
<p>Before this announcement, Dan Houser originally announced two unique pieces of content over a year ago, named <a href="https://wccftech.com/american-caper-a-better-paradise-gta-creator-dan-houser-absurd-ventures/">American Caper and A Better Paradise</a>. These weren't games but were instead a graphic novel and audio fiction series, respectively.</p>
<p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/absurdaverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Absurd Ventures</a> finally gave those who were interested a glimpse into what is being named the Absurdaverse, which is artwork that shows off 20 characters that will be making an appearance in the universe. There is a wide range of characters, with there being angsty teens, a man dressed as a magician, and even a Viking. It has that same style that is used in Grand Theft Auto, and also kind of provides a feeling similar to that of the TV show Archer. The artwork came with the caption, "Prepare to meet some new kinds of heroes (and watch them suffer)."</p>
<p>It's said that the new IP will be introduced with "animation projects" that will be released later on this year. Alongside that, the studio is working on an "original story-driven action-comedy adventure game" that will also be taking place in the Absurdaverse, but no further details regarding this project were shared.</p>
<p>Dan Houser co-founded Rockstar in 1998 with his brother Sam Houser and made the decision to leave the company in February 2020 after taking an extended break shortly after the launch of Red Dead Redemption 2. Since its inception, Rockstar Games has gone on to make some of the most iconic titles in gaming, such as Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and other successful titles such as Bully, Manhunt, and L.A. Noire. Before his exit, Dan Houser was the lead writer on both Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
<p>After he left, he then announced the opening of his new gaming studio, Absurd Ventures, in 2023, where he plans to "create new IP across all platforms and for all formats."</p>
<p>If the storytelling in Grand Theft Auto is anything to go by, it means that this new Absurdaverse will be equally as wacky and psychedelic as Grand Theft Auto 5 was.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>There was a moment in gaming history when it looked like all games would succumb to the dullest colours imaginable: brown and grey. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war">Gears Of War</a> - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY-UoqYPbPk">Clive Barker's Jericho</a>, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called "the piss filter" and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there's at least one developer who is reviving "smeared dirt" as an art direction. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/as-time-surrenders">As Time Surrenders</a> is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain">Metal Gear Solid V</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"A man journeys through a desolate landscape, carrying a mysterious canister," says the game's website. "He is driven by a purpose only he understands. Crawl, crouch, sneak and shoot your way through the end of the world in this stealth-action game."</p>
<p>What that translates to is something that looks a lot like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes">MGSV: Ground Zeroes</a>. You'll be able to crouch-dive into the mud in a moment of panic, and tag enemies with thermal goggles. It's still early days, judging by the developer's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/merlinogames.bsky.social/post/3lh2jajlsws2l">various social media posts</a>. But there is some footage that puts together the prototypical movement and scouting you'll be doing. </p>

<p>As for all that brown, you can see some of the inspiration for the colour palette in <a href="https://x.com/merlino_games/status/1846926799269200252">a selection of retro games</a> posted by developer Merlino Games (aka Antonio Freyre) including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/max-payne-2-the-fall-of-max-payne">Max Payne 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-shadows-of-the-empire">Star Wars: Shadows Of The Empire</a>.</p><p>Freyre has made a handful of other games, mostly cheap and cheerful "minimalist stealth games" including the retro ragdoll punchin' of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1493970/The_Chameleon/">The Chameleon</a>, as well as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2202470/No_Sun_To_Worship/?curator_clanid=41492342">No Sun To Worship</a>, another moody stealtho that looks like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> but is really, we're told, all "about the importance of art". It's certainly got some very crunchy pixel textures. Mmmmm.</p>
<p>No clue when this latest sneaky endeavour is due to be released. As Time Surrenders doesn't even have its own Steam page yet - it's that early in development. For stealth fans, it will probably be beaten to the punch by Konami remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta</a>, but hey, it's not a race. It's a procure-on-site infiltration mission.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A recent Fortnite leak has revealed which Jujutsu Kaisen characters will be featured in the upcoming Wave 2 skins collection.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1885794070682910998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, the Fortnite x Jujutsu Kaisen collaboration will feature three new skins for players to try out, including Ryomen Sukuna, Mahito and Toji Fushiguro. Sukuna is a no-brainer, one of the series’s most popular characters, and players will be excited to see this skin arrive. Toji Fushigiro is a new favourite from the anime series’ second season, and you can see the comment section of this post already raving about his arrival. Mahito, on the other hand, was one of the series’ main antagonists till the end of season 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the leaks are correct, Fortnite’s collaboration with Jujutsu Kaisen will provide players with new skins and cosmetics themed around season 2. The Wave 1 collaboration featured season 1’s Yuji Itadori, Satoru Gojo, Nobara Kugisaki, and Megumi Fushigiro as skins. Fortnite also featured some popular moves from the series as Mythics: Hollow Purple and Straw Doll Technique, which makes players wonder if the next collaboration will introduce new mythics or see the return of the existing JJK mythics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ShiinaBR has also provided an <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1885409443933741111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">updated list</a> of collaborations for Fortnite, which features much more than Jujutsu Kaisen. In this update or upcoming ones, players might see Disney’s Avatar, a new Ironman skin, Off-White cosmetics, an AC Milan Collaboration, a Demon Slayer collaboration, a Pixar Cars collaboration, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite will receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-get-more-dc-collabs-after-multiversus-shutdown-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more DC collabs after the Multiversus shutdown</a>, according to a new claim. Also, the game is seemingly receiving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-receive-red-hulk-falcon-and-superman-skins-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Hulk, Falcon and Superman skins</a>.

"When there are threats to harm it's crossing the line. I hope that you can take a step back and realize that this is an extremely sad time for the team," Huynh said. "I am in deep mourning for the game. Nobody wanted this outcome and it wasn't from lack of caring or effort."</p><p>The developer added, "While I'm sad about the outcome, I will forever be grateful for the opportunity given to us by Warner Bros. Games and to each and every developer on the Player First Games and WB Games teams." Hunyh also thanked every IP holder for entrusting the studio with their respective franchises and characters.</p><p>Huynh also thanked the developers at Player First Games and fans themselves who played MultiVersus. "Thank you for sending us all the great fan art, character ideas, and personal stories. They were the highlight of every day and always excited the team. I’m sorry if we couldn’t get to your favorite character. I do think Aquaman and Lola are really cool and I hope you all check them out," Huynh said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1052930998" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

saying it comes down to "a bunch of things." These include "development time, listening to what the community wants, working with IP holders and approvals, if there is a cross-marketing opportunity available to support, and of course if the team is inspired to make the character."</p><p>The Banana Guard character, from Adventure Time, came into existence because the developers were enthusiastic and created the first cut of the character in a single weekend.</p><p>"When inspiration and enthusiasm spark we want to reward that and we got Banana Guard because of that. It wasn't at the expense of another character. It was because the team was excited about making the character," Huynh said.</p><p>Finally, Huynh said they hope fans enjoy Season 5--which is the final season--and that fans of MultiVersus direct their time and money to other fighting games to support the genre overall.</p><p>"Thank you for allowing this dream to become a reality even if for a briefer time than we would have wanted. I don't know what the future holds for any of all of us, but I just wanted to say thank you. It has been an honor to work alongside the team at PFG to serve our community and players," Huynh said.</p><p>MultiVersus, a platformer brawler similar to Super Smash Bros., first launched into open beta in 2022 and was then taken down for a period of time after a year. It then came back fully released in 2024 with new content. It features characters from across various WB properties, including DC, Looney Tunes, and Cartoon Network.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/multiversus-review-a-super-smash-hit/1900-6417930/" data-ref-id="1900-6417930">MultiVersus review,</a> we scored the game an 8/10 and said, "Warner Bros' all-star battle proves to be a worthy contender to the platform fighter throne."</p><p>A free-to-play game, MultiVersus reached an <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">all-time peak concurrent player figure of more than 150,000 on Steam</a>, but has dropped off substantially, reaching a peak of fewer than 700 players on Steam in the past 24 hours. MultiVersus is also available on console for Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p>The game will be playable after May via an offline mode that supports local multiplayer or multiplayer against AI opponents. As for Player First Games, as Huynh said, there is no word yet as to what may happen to the studio and its developers. Warner Bros. Games owns the studio, which has no upcoming projects that have been announced and <a href="https://www.playerfirstgames.com/careers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">no open positions on its careers page.</a></p><p>Warner Bros. Games did not disclose a reason for closing MultiVersus. The announcement came just after longtime Warner Bros. gaming boss David Haddad <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced his exit from the company after more than a decade.</a> That move was preceded by the announcement from Warner Bros. that it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-boss-says-it-has-the-best-cookies-talks-about-milking-them/1100-6526460/" data-ref-id="1100-6526460">focus only on a small group of mega-franchises for its gaming division</a> in a bid to have the best chance to make the most money.</p><p>MultiVersus is just the latest live-service game to come to a close <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-live-service-game-bubble-looks-ready-to-burst/1100-6511171/" data-ref-id="1100-6511171">as the bubble bursts</a>.

Even as games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> dominate the market, Epic Games still </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/fortnite-delivers-biggest-day-in-history-amid-layoffs-at-epic-games">laid off workers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. And teams like Surgent Studios have learned the hard way that you can release a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tales of Kenzara</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to positive reviews, and still not earn enough money to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-surgent-studios-is-cutting-jobs">keep your team employed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These and other challenges have sent many publishers scrambling for new audiences in the world of UGC games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-sees-webgpu-is-a-growing-market-for-game-development">ripening</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> field of browser-based games built on WebGPU, or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/five-takeaways-for-game-developers-from-matthew-ball-s-state-of-gaming-data">the growing PC market emerging in China</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "Why," they might ask "should we take big bets on the saturated PC and console markets?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Well some still are—like Kepler Interactive, the British publisher whose portfolio ranges from driving survival game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, to soccer sim </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rematch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, to the colorful Metroid-inspired </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultros</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to the upcoming French-inspired fantasy game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's an eccentric portfolio for the publisher that started out with the martial arts action title </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sifu</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, one only united by the idea that somewhere out there, there is an audience of interested players out there in the deeply-stuffed marketplace.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/did-you-know-the-car-in-pacific-drive-has-a-soul-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Did you know the car in Pacific Drive has a 'soul?'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kepler Interactive senior portfolio manager Matthew Handrahan (a former comrade in the world of B2B games journalism) has looked at the market numbers, and admits they paint a "pretty frightening picture." But he argues the focus on high interest in older games obscures a key fact driving his work: "The relatively small percentage of people that buy new games, I do think actually buy quite a lot of new games each year," he said in a recent chat with Game Developer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That audience might not be purchasing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>all</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of Kepler's games. But the publisher's bet, he said, is that there are different pockets of players with different interests who make those purchasing decisions. He thinks developers should know that even in hard times, those audiences are worth chasing, especially if you have a unique game worth making.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="In search of &quot;real specificity&quot;">In search of "real specificity"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Handrahan, Kepler Interactive's overall publishing strategy runs on something of a "gut feeling" approach. The strategy, he said, is to look for games that folks inside the publisher are excited about and will advocate for. While the team still considers traditional publisher needs like budgets and production viability, there's a sense that if someone at Kepler is really passionate about the game, there will be an audience out there who will feel as equally excited and will want to play it. Having staffers with different tastes helps the team cast a wide net and diversify its portfolio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Devs wanting to catch the attention of Handrahan and his peers should know that they're looking for what he calls "a real specificity." "Take </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sifu</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for example," he said. "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sifu</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could very easily be a 2D side-scrolling pixel art game, right? It has a similar structure to many of those games...but what Sloclap really [wanted] to do there was to emulate a certain style of Hong Kong action cinema. Not just the martial arts moves, but also the way the camera moves and the editing."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Calling that vision "specific," he said it's the main reason the game stood out from similar titles on the market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He nodded to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as two other games with "specific" visions. "It's a case of starting with an experience they wanted to create and then working [their] way to the gameplay that's going to deliver that. I see a lot of pitches each year, and I get the impression that a lot of pitches go the other way around. They start in a genre and work towards the theme and you just end up in a place that that's quite simple."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want our games to genuinely situate themselves more broadly in culture, not just video games."</span></p><p>Image via Sandfall Interactive/Kepler Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're the data-driven type who bristles at the gut-feeling approach Handrahand decides—that's fair. "It does sound simplistic," he admitted. "But actually I feel like any other approach is just as easy to pick apart." He nodded to market-driven publishing strategies that encourage developers to iterate on popular genres. "What is the market going to be in two years time or three years time? I think there is a danger in looking at what's there today and then signing a game on the basis of that because you 20 other companies might have done exactly the same thing, and by the time you come to market, everything's saturated."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Devs do still need a sense of realism">Devs do still need a sense of realism</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Handrahand still hedged some bets about Kepler's "gut feel" strategy, seeming to acknowledge that the realities of the market still can trump an incredible vision. He namechecked three genres—Metroidvanias, first-person narrative games, and 2.5 sidescrollers—as spaces so saturated that developers could only bet on success with low budgets and small teams.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a message he sometimes has to deliver to developers with great pitches he runs into when out at events. He seemed a bit sheepish—saying he's not a "blunt" person and that it can be hard to give that kind of feedback.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But he's trying to be more comfortable communicating that difficulty, and encouraging developers to explore if their vision can be adjusted to match the market. He said it's worth doing because "if it's something you can see they're really passionate about, then try to steer them towards something you legitimately feel could [be] more interesting to publishers at large."</span></p><p>Image via Ironwood Studios/Kepler Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And if you're pitching Kepler right now, you'd do well to come with one hell of a pitch deck and first playable. The team still believes in visions, but with the "buyer's market" for publishers at the moment, the bar for what developers are bringing to the table is higher than ever. Kepler's advice differed from the likes we've heard from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-finji-ceo-bekah-saltsman-would-update-about-her-gdc-talk-on-indie-pitching">Finji CEO Bekah Saltsman</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, so be sure to practice due diligence on what the folks you're talking to are looking for in a pitch deck.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Handrahand said he looks for dense pitch decks alongside a first playable that lays out high level game ideas, and works through core aspects of a game like progression, systems, and narrative (if those are key pillars in your game). Calling himself a "freak," he said he doesn't like the idea that developers aren't supposed to overwhelm publishers with long slide decks. "That might just be because I'm a [former] journalist, and I'm used to reading lots of things, but I think...you don't want to leave too many question marks, because you shouldn't assume you'll get the opportunity for those questions to be answered at any point."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, you don't need to open your pitch with the 20 page long lore document explaining the unique game world you're in. He suggested developers producing lean decks produce appendices and supplemental documents they can hand over to interested parties.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those documents should have some kind of sense of the game's budget, partly because Handrahand and his colleagues need to know if it's the kind of budget Kepler can even support. It's unfortunately a bit of a goldilocks situation—your budget can't be too big or too small, but somehow just right.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Searching for video game stars">Searching for video game stars</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fact Kepler still sees fertile ground in the traditional PC an console markets isn't a panacea for all of the game industry's woes. The company can only publish so many games, and while similar outfits like Raw Fury, Fellow Traveler, and Hooded Horse are equally focused on the market, there just isn't enough cash to go around—and not every game these groups publish will find its audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Kepler's business bet (that's already paid dividends) is that those audiences are, in one way or another, out there. That attitude is a quiet pushback against some of the emerging wisdom around the video game industry contraction of the last few years. It's getting tiring going on LinkedIn and reading a random executive slagging the conventional games market and insisting developers start crunching on games for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is wisdom in looking for fresh players—but with the right strategy, publishers and developers alike can find those players where they already are.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvelous-story-of-seasons-leadership-change<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marvelous, the studio behind franchises like&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons&nbsp;</em>(formerly&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>) and&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory</em>, has announced a change in leadership owing to its poor financial performance over the last nine months.</p>

<p>Per an Automaton Media <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/rune-factory-developer-marvelous-announces-change-in-leadership-and-executive-pay-cuts-due-to-companys-recent-weak-performance/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the studio recently published its financial results for the first three quarters of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and sales and net profit are both down (by 4.8% and 12.4% respectively) when compared to the same period last year.</p>

<p>As a result, current CEO Sato Suminobu will step down from his position in March, although he'll remain a director at the company. He'll be replaced as company CEO by Shinichi Terui, who's currently serving as an executive director at Marvelous.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvelous-leadership-change-poor-performance-farmagia.jpg?itok=lLnr2z0q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvelous-leadership-change-poor-performance-farmagia.jpg?itok=FshC_X8D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games like November's&nbsp;<em>Farmagia&nbsp;</em>failed to make enough of a dent to improve Marvelous' finances, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>In the <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/400065" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gamebiz</a> report that Automaton cites (for which we're using machine translation), it also sounds as though both Sato and Terui will receive 10% pay cuts, although Automaton says these cuts will apply to "two full-time executives" rather than the two named employees.</p>

<p>As Automaton points out, Marvelous released two major projects in the nine-month period between April and December 2024, namely farming RPG&nbsp;<em>Farmagia&nbsp;</em>and a re-release of the remake of&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town</em>.</p>

<p>The latter, according to Marvelous, performed "steadily", but there's no indication as to how the former did. Given the change in leadership and&nbsp;<em>Farmagia</em>'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2508770/Farmagia/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">terminally low Steam review count</a>, however, it's unlikely the game sold particularly well.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that a new&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>game,&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date" rel="nofollow">coming in May</a>, but since Marvelous' financial year ends in March, the game won't be released in time for it to affect the studio's 2024-25 fiscals.</p>

Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Marvelous.</p>

Walking through the halls of the studio, I saw not only the legacy of its games but its employees, too, some of whom have children who work or worked at Firaxis, including Meier’s own son. It’s no wonder, then, that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24224489/civilization-7-hands-on-demo-impressions-firaxis-games"><em>Civilization VII</em> is a game about legacy</a> and all the ways it leaves a mark on history and contributes to the future.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224532/civilization-7-release-date-february-2025"><em>Civilization VII</em></a> is a strategy game in which you shepherd a country or people plucked from throughout world history through the ages of time. As their leader, often a famous ruler or notable historical figure, your job is to grow your empire to become the preeminent society of the world either through conquest, commerce, culture, or scientific advancement. As time progresses, you must make choices and take actions for your civilization that determine how it develops into a world power. You must acquire resources, choose systems of government and social policy, research technologies to improve your civilization, defend it from threats, and keep your citizenry happy.</p><p>One way legacy manifests in <em><em>Civilization</em> VII</em> is through the game’s new civ and leader system. In previous games, choosing a leader locked you into a particular civilization. Now, a civ and a leader are chosen independently of one another. Caesar Augustus is no longer tied to Rome but can now be the pharaoh of Egypt or the king of Spain. Since the Roman Empire is my Roman Empire, I really enjoy this change. Augustus ruled an empire that encompassed Europe and North Africa, so it makes historical and narrative sense that he can lead the civilizations of those geographic locations. </p><p>But beyond the little thrill my historian heart gets from pairing Augustus with Gaul… err <em>France</em>, the new system is simply a way to give players more flexibility. You don’t have to abandon a favored leader just because you don’t want to play as their civ for the umpteenth time, and the game even has a recommendation system that matches leaders with civs that synergize with their abilities.</p><p>Perhaps the most profound example of legacy in <em><em><em>Civilization</em> VII</em></em> is the way civilizations transition between historical ages. Whereas a player’s civilization stayed the same throughout a game before, now, as you move between antiquity to the exploration age and the exploration age to the modern age, your civilization changes as well, evolving with history. Like Augustus and Egypt, it makes sense. Civilizations rise, fall, and change with the march of time. Depending on the choices you make and policies you pursue, yours will, too.</p><p>I started my game playing as the Mississippi empire of North America. Throughout the game, I had the choice of pursuing the goals of one of four advisers, each with their own sphere of influence: economic, military, culture, or science. They gave me quests to complete, like establish a certain number of cities or acquire different luxury resources. Since the Mississippi is a commerce and trade-focused civ, I chose the economic quests, and when it was time to transition to a new age, that choice unlocked more advanced economic-focused civilizations. It’s a really interesting, game mechanic version of that one <em>Gladiator</em> quote, “What we do now, echoes in eternity.” My Mississippi empire fell away and the Majapahit emerged in its place.</p><p>But legacy can also be complicated and difficult to navigate if you don’t understand the history it comes from. (Yes, I’m stretching this metaphor, but indulge me.) <em>Civilization V</em> is the only <em>Civ</em> I’ve played logging hundreds of hours, and going into <em>VII</em>, I’m kinda lost on some things. There’s an entire system that runs concurrently to the overall game, in which I have to figure out optimal building placement in my cities, taking into consideration things like “adjacency bonuses” and “specialist allocation” that I just do not understand after 20 hours. Reading the game’s prolific Civilopedia helps a little, but even that is so confusingly worded (and wordy!) that I’ve given up on trying to make sense of it. There are a lot of times when I make a choice with no strategy behind it because I simply have not figured out what’s going on. I get the feeling the whole system was put in place for players who like to min / max the hell out of their civs for competitive play, but I am a simple girl. I want to watch numbers go up and buy off my enemies with my massive piles of gold. </p><p>That’s worked out well for me. My civ is very wealthy and very well liked by my AI opponents, despite not totally understanding everything going on. There’s a level of satisfaction in slowly overcoming that learning curve that keeps me playing for “one more turn.” In a game of <em>Civilization VII,</em> some players will leave a legacy of conquest — others of inspiring cultural works. But the legacy I leave behind will be one of excellent civil engineering.</p><p><em>Civilization VII</em> launches on February 11th on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A known Fortnite insider has claimed that DC collabs for Fortnite will increase after Multiversus has been shut down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ShiinaBR, known for Fortnite leaks and rumours, <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1885376822830932335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke about</a> Warner Bros.’s “new tactic” for DC in gaming after Multiversus was discontinued. The insider revealed that due to Multiversus, DC had stopped collaborating with other games. However, since the title has announced its shutdown, its new strategy is to “double down on collabs with other games again,” this list includes Epic’s popular battle royale, Fortnite.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite has always had DC skins, but the collaboration is nowhere near how they have partnered with Marvel, with the latter getting new skins with each new movie or series. Fortnite already has some iconic DC skins, such as the Joker, Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman (multiple variants of him), and other heroes and villains. However, players would like to see a Fortnite season themed around the DC universe, especially with James Gunn and Peter Safran’s new DCEU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Multiversus <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-is-officially-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its official shutdown last week, with the game’s fifth season serving as the final update for the game. The last time to play Multiversus online will be May 30. After that, the game can only be accessed through the local gameplay mode, which allows you to fight solo against AI opponents or with up to three friends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite Festival is seemingly bringing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-sabrina-carpenter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter</a> next season. Also, the game might receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-receive-red-hulk-falcon-and-superman-skins-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Hulk, Falcon, and Superman skins</a> next. What are your thoughts on Fortnite receiving more DC content after Multiversus is shutting down?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>There’s a lot of talk of cozy games these days, and Civilization is definitely my personal cozy game. It’s relaxing to get lost in a flow state, making “<a href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1015756/Interesting">a series of interesting decisions</a>” for “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnRrTEFZs60">one more turn</a>,” then another, late into the evening.</p>
<p>Change is almost definitionally not cozy, though, and <em>Civilization VII</em> changes quite a lot —especially about the game’s overall structure.</p>
<p>Frankly, I’ve long felt the series peaked with <em>Civilization IV</em>, at least for me. But after playing <em>VII</em> for a couple of dozen hours, there’s a chance it’s at least as good as <em>Civilization V</em>, and it has the potential to even match <em>IV</em> with just a little more refinement.</p>
<p>In this review, we’ll explore all the major changes, assess whether they are worth any trade-offs, and talk about why <em>VII</em> has the potential to be the best Civ game in recent memory.</p>

<h2>A specific kind of Civ player</h2>
<p>Civilization is a franchise that caters to a broad range of players, and different people want different things from the games. It makes sense to clarify what kind of Civilization player I am so you know where I’m coming from and what kind of filter to run my take through.</p>
<p>I’ve played at least a few games of Civilization a year since <em>Civilization II</em> came out. All told, I probably have a cumulative 2,000 hours in the franchise. I skipped <em>Civilization III</em>, and I played the most in the <em>Civilization IV</em> era, when I played weekly hotseat games with my friends in college. I frequently played the 1,000 AD scenario solo. I continued to play <em>Civilization V</em>, but a little less than <em>IV</em>. When <em>Civilization VI</em> came out, I wasn’t as big a fan. I’ve played maybe two full games a year after an initial 50 or so hours when it first arrived.</p>
<p>I’ve usually played on low to mid difficulty levels and have enjoyed the inevitable march to victory. I did work my way up through the difficulty levels in <em>V</em> while Steam achievement-hunting, but I didn’t enjoy it as much as taking a relaxed approach.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>I’ve spent comparatively little time playing other 4X games. I had a couple of weeks where I got really into <em>Endless Legend</em>, but it didn’t stick long-term. I played a lot of <em>Master of Orion II</em> back in the day, but I’ve only played a couple dozen hours of <em>Stellaris</em>. I did, however, obsessively play <em>Alpha Centauri</em>. I also love <em>The Battle of Polytopia</em>.</p>
<p>If <em>VI</em> was your favorite Civ game, if you always play on Deity, or if you’re a hardcore player who plays 5,000 hours a year, just know that I’m coming at this from a different place than you are. I hope you can still filter through that and find the information you need here, though.</p>
<p>This review is based on two full-length playthroughs of all three ages of <em>Civilization VII</em>, plus a little extra dabbling—a total of about 35 hours. I mostly played on a Windows PC, but I also tested the game briefly on a Steam Deck. The Mac, Linux, and console versions were not made available to me.</p>
<p>Let’s dig in.</p>
<h2>The ages of civilization</h2>
<p><em>Civilization VII</em> overhauls the structure of a Civilization game more radically than we’ve ever seen. Whereas previous games had “eras” (Ancient, Classical, Medieval, Renaissance, Industrial, Modern, Atomic, Information, and Future in <em>VI</em>) that acted as a soft structure for how the game progressed, <em>VII</em> cuts everything down to just three and names them “ages”—Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern.</p>
<p>(This is not to be confused with the boom/bust system of the dark and golden ages in <em>VI</em>.)</p>

      As in earlier titles, exploring with scouts plays a big role in the first age.

      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>But unlike the eras of yore, <em>VII</em>’s ages are presented and play almost as distinct games. Ages do not just mark the passage of time; transitioning from one to another involves significant changes to the map and objectives in the game, with a summary screen displayed during each transition.</p>
<p>Each age has its own tech and culture trees, buildings and units, and even unique victory conditions and game systems. For example, the system of spreading religions around the globe with missionaries and tracking the religious makeup of cities is exclusive to Exploration, even though there are some more basic applications of religion in Antiquity.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<h3>Legacy paths</h3>
<p>Each age has its own “legacy paths” corresponding to the different victory types: economic, military, science, and culture. These paths include a sequence of objectives that must be fulfilled to gain points that are tallied at the end of the age to determine rankings and decide which options you have for bonuses to start with if you continue to the next age.</p>
<p>For example, the science legacy path in Exploration involves using specialists (urban population who build up the yields of tiles that have already been developed) to optimize city districts with very high yields, whereas the path in Modern involves using city production to build major flight and spaceflight projects.</p>
<p>All players transition from one age to another at once when enough progress has accumulated (either in just one path or all of them). The final legacy path, for Modern, is the path to the game’s ultimate win conditions.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>Legacy paths map to victory conditions and give you a linear series of objectives with which you can gain points that assist you in starting the next age with an advantage.</span>
                    <span>
                      Samuel Axon
                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>

<p>As an age nears its end, a “crisis” can happen that affects everyone. In one example, the plague begins to spread around the world toward the end of Exploration. Each crisis has some unique gameplay elements, including “crisis cards,” which force you to pick between some negative effects for your civilization to face as you tackle the problem.</p>
<p>After an age is complete, the crisis ends, a recap screen is shown, and you get to spend “legacy points” (which you accumulated by following the legacy paths) to gain bonuses or choose specializations for your civilization that apply when you start the next age.</p>
<p>You also pick a new civilization for the next age, which brings us to the other major overhaul to the game’s formula.</p>
<h3>Leaders and civilizations</h3>
<p>As in all prior titles, you select a leader to play as when you start a new game, and that leader has unique bonuses or mechanics that affect how you would optimally play the game.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But whereas leaders were tied to specific civilizations before, now they’re not. You can play as Benjamin Franklin, King of Persia. Those concerned with historical accuracy won’t love this change, though the developer clearly designed the leaders to have some mechanical synergy with historically appropriate civilizations; these pairings are even given special labeling in the civilization-selection screen.</p>
<p>When an age transition happens, though, you have to pick a completely new civilization—but not just any. Several factors contribute to the list of options. The civilization you picked and which things you accomplished in the previous age make up the bulk of those factors. Again, the game nudges you toward civs that make loose sense historically (I went from Isabella leading Rome in Antiquity to Isabella leading Spain in Exploration), but it’s possible in some cases to do something different.</p>


<p>This fits a general theme in <em>Civilization VII</em> of modeling the way cultures and cities in our own world are built in layers. For example, London was a Roman city before the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings built their own settlements on top of it.</p>
<p>To that point, you can "overbuild" buildings relevant in later ages to replace ones that were specific to an earlier age, which not-so-coincidentally helps solve the problem from <em>VI </em>of having to work around legacy decisions when working on optimizing your districts.</p>

<h3>Does it work, and is it still Civ?</h3>
<p>This controversial change to civilizations allows the game’s designers to better fine-tune civilizations’ bonuses, units, and buildings. Since they can be age-specific, they can tie deeply into mechanics that are endemic to a specific age. It also addresses the franchise’s long-standing balance problem of certain civilizations having an advantage in one part of a game’s trajectory but being weak in another.</p>
<p>Likewise, putting strong guardrails around each of the three ages allows the designers to better refine and balance certain gameplay systems to interact with each other better. It’s much easier to design a system that only has to be fun in a certain context than it is to produce one that needs to stay relevant and interesting throughout every phase of the game.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>It also acts as a catch-up or rubber-banding device. Civilization has long been criticized for the tendency of its games to snowball early. Establishing a lead in the first few eras could sometimes all but guarantee the final outcome, making the back half of the game seem like a pointless exercise to some.</p>
<p>Since the age transitions in <em>VII</em> put all civs on relatively equal footing with regard to tech trees and so on, that’s less of a problem. Of course, there are still the era points to spend to make your successes or failures earlier on more meaningful—they're just not as game-defining.</p>
<p>There are some downsides besides pedantry about historical accuracy, too. Most notably, the last 15 or so turns of an age can be a bit of a bummer.</p>
<p>That’s because buildings and units late in an age’s tech or culture trees end up being mostly irrelevant as a result of the hard reset that happens so soon after you acquire them. I also found myself incentivized to slow my civilization’s progress to delay age transitions to get things optimally set up for the start of the next one, which feels unnatural and unintended.</p>
<h2>RIP busywork</h2>
<p>Amid a number of changes to the civilization formula, another one stands out: workers (called builders in <em>VI</em>) are no more. Instead of directing a unit to build improvements, you do so directly from the city view each time the city grows.</p>
<p>On one hand, this is a simplification at a time when a lot of people want their grand strategy games to get deeper and more complex. But I feel that it’s a good change. Workers always became unwieldy as the scale of your empire grew, and many players just ended up automating them by the later eras.</p>
<p>The change also allows building rural improvements to integrate more neatly with the urban district system introduced in <em>VI</em> and refined here.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>Worker units have been replaced by a centralized city management screen.</span>
                    <span>
                      Samuel Axon
                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>

<p>There are other refinements that reduce unit-based busywork, too. One of the reasons <em>IV</em> is my favorite game in the series is that it’s the last one with “stacks of death,” where you’d pile multiple military units onto one tile and move them as a group.</p>
<p>When stacks of death were replaced by a one-unit-of-each-type-per-hex approach in <em>V</em>, I felt it made moving armies in the late game an infuriatingly tedious process that wasn’t worth the added tactical complexity.</p>
<p>Firaxis has struck an ideal middle ground in <em>VII</em>. You can now pack up to five units into a single-hex-occupying group with a military commander unit. You then just have to move that one unit to the front line before deploying everyone and commanding them individually in battle.</p>
<p>It’s a great change! (Rivers are also fully navigable by naval units, by the way—another change that makes getting around a lot easier.)</p>
<h2>Small town, big city</h2>
<p>I mentioned that you now manage hex improvements via the city view. There are some other changes to cities to cover. First off, newly founded settlements start as towns, not cities. Towns can’t produce buildings or units normally, but you can purchase a subset of options with gold.</p>
<p>They grow by similar rules to cities, and they have multiple specialization options that customize how they benefit your wider civilization. You can spend gold to convert them to cities, and it costs less gold to do so the more they grow. There are pros and cons to each classification, and you’ll almost always end up going with a balance, regardless of the age.</p>
<p>There’s a settlement limit that is affected by ages, civics, and technologies. Capturing or founding towns or cities beyond that limit comes with big penalties and is almost never worth it.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>City tiles sprawl out across the map. In this case, we have a Los Angeles-like situation where a sort of megalopolis has formed out of several cities growing into each other.</span>
                    <span>
                      Samuel Axon
                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>

<p>All told, I liked these systems. They’re big changes, but they feel natural. I wouldn’t tweak much about them.</p>
<p>This “towns” classification is also relevant to what used to be known as city-states. Barbarians and city-states have merged into one concept, called independents. These are single-settlement AI civs that are either hostile or friendly. I really enjoyed this system, as it allowed me to gradually befriend independents, convert them into towns I control through diplomacy, and ultimately upgrade them to cities within my civilization. It’s a satisfying progression.</p>
<p>You court independent settlements by spending a new yield called influence, which is the foundation of a significant overhaul of how diplomacy and espionage work in the game.</p>

<h2>How to win friends and influence people</h2>
<p>I hated the way diplomacy and war weariness worked in <em>VI</em>, especially at launch. I felt that the AI was hyper-focused on baiting me into wars, and if I ever responded in kind, it was too difficult to avoid all the AI leaders turning on me because they didn’t like what I was doing. Often, I would just ignore diplomacy and end up at war with almost everyone rather than engage with the systems the game had in place for managing all that.</p>
<p><em>VII</em>’s approach is much more straightforward. As noted, there’s a new yield called influence, and it sits alongside gold, science, and so on. It’s produced passively by certain buildings and the like. It has multiple uses, but all of them relate to affecting your relationships with other powers on the map.</p>
<p>You can use it to build favor with independent cities, levy their troops, or ultimately bring them into your civilization. You can use it to offer trade deals to or denounce other rulers. It’s also the resource used for espionage, like stealing technologies or sabotaging space race production.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>That’s not where it stops, though. When other leaders offer you a deal of some kind, you’re given the option to spend a small amount of influence to prevent the deal from happening, no influence to accept the deal on terms that are slightly more beneficial for them, or a larger amount of influence to shift the terms of the deal to be significantly better for both of you.</p>


<p>Most critically, it plays a role in a system of war support. When a war occurs between two civilizations, every leader in the game (not just those two) can spend influence to support one side or another. The side with the most support suffers significantly less war weariness and fewer diplomatic consequences for the continuation of the war.</p>
<p>If you have high influence yields and pour it all into supporting a war that’s important to you strategically, you can put yourself in a much better position.</p>
<p>It works extremely well, and it simplifies a lot of disparate systems that have been tried in Civ over the years into one coherent thing that’s much easier to understand and manage than ever before.</p>
<p>Of all the major additions in <em>Civilization VII</em>, this is my favorite. For the first time, I find diplomacy fun instead of a chore.</p>
<h2>Grab bag: Steam Deck, minor gripes, and hopes for the future</h2>
<p>Those are the big categories of changes in <em>VII</em>, but there are a few things of note that don’t neatly fit into any of these buckets, so let’s rapid-fire through a few.</p>
<h3>Steam Deck, consoles, and controller support</h3>
<p>Consoles have always been a footnote in the Civilization franchise’s storied history. There was <em>Civilization Revolution</em>, a stripped-down version of the game that came out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. (It was better than you’d think if you approached it on its own terms, but it wasn’t the desktop PC Civ experience by any stretch.)</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><em>Civilization VI</em> got ports for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Switch, but the ports were not very good at all. The game was playable, but the ports were definitely an afterthought.</p>
<p>So it’s interesting that <em>Civilization VII</em> will have PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch versions launching the same day as the PC, Mac, and Linux ones. Along with that, the game is Steam Deck Verified—which wasn’t even a concept when the last Civ game came out.</p>
<p>I wasn’t given access to the console versions during this review period, but I was able to try it out on Steam Deck, which gave me a sense of how it plays with a controller interface.</p>
<p>The left stick moves between tiles to select, while the right stick moves the camera and changes the zone the left stick effects. You tap A to select something and B to back out, while the left and right triggers can be used to zoom in and out. Pressing the right bumper brings up a radial menu that gives you access to everything from the tech tree to different leaders with whom you can engage in diplomacy. The remaining buttons are direct shortcuts to commonly used features, like mini-map options (yields and so on).</p>

<p>It works pretty well! It’s not as natural as using a mouse, of course, but it’s a big improvement on the mess that the console versions of <em>VI</em> presented you.</p>

<p>The game seemed to perform OK most of the time on low settings and the native 1280×800 resolution on the Steam Deck, but the exception was zooming in on large, sprawling cities in the late game. I saw some stutters and framerate chugging in that situation. That’s not a game-breaking problem in a turn-based game, but it's annoying. It's possible that more performance optimization will come later.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The performance is inconsistent enough to give me pause about recommending playing on Steam Deck; you’re probably better off using your laptop to play when you’re traveling. That said, the controller configuration (which is also an option on PC, by the way) is good enough that I’m optimistic about the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions. It's hard to imagine the game running well on the Switch, though, given that the much more powerful Steam Deck barely squeaks through.</p>
<h3>UI bugs aplenty at launch</h3>
<p>I believe the version I’m playing right now is the day-one release version (or close to it), so it’s worth mentioning I’ve run into some annoying UI bugs.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have to click several times to get it to register, or sometimes deselect and re-select the unit, to make ranged military units fire on units in other hexes.</li>
<li>In one game, I just could not create trade routes. I'd select the merchant, click on the target city, and nothing would happen. It's possible this was not a bug and that there was instead some reason in the game's mechanics for why I couldn't do it at this stage that I didn't understand, but there was no feedback about why it wasn't working.</li>
<li>There are some instances (like in the religion panel) where mouse wheel scrolling simultaneously scrolled the list in the panel while also zooming the map view behind it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the sort of stuff that will almost surely be fixed quickly, but it’s good to be aware if you’re planning on playing on launch day.</p>
<h3>Some of the balance is a little wonky</h3>
<p>As is the case for all games like this, there are a few systems that will need some post-launch refinement. Most notably, the balance between building units or buildings with gold versus production feels way off. By around the middle of the Exploration Age, I found myself using gold to purchase things far more than I bothered waiting on production. You just have too much gold in the late game. I imagine Firaxis will rein this in.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h3>Launch content is light</h3>
<p><em>Civilization VII</em> offers arguably the most complexity, depth, and breadth of systems of any Civilization game pre-expansion. That’s great! Yeah, there are some standards missing I imagine might come in expansions later, like the World Congress or nukes. But compared to earlier games, there’s more here on day one than usual.</p>
<p>That said, the actual content is pretty bare-bones. There aren’t a ton of leaders right now—though many more are planned within just a few months, according to Firaxis’ roadmap.</p>
<p>More critically, there are no scenarios at all, and there’s no mention of scenarios in the roadmap. Scenarios were always some of my favorite experiences in prior games, so that’s a disappointment. I hope Firaxis announces some plans on this front soon and that we won’t have to wait for a paid expansion to get something that has usually been part of the core of earlier titles.</p>
<p>There are some additions in this iteration that weren't there before to make the game stickier and reward long-term play, though. For example, completing an age with a specific leader levels them up, granting access to modifier cards you can use on future games with that leader. These aren't enough to make them radically more powerful; they're more like small extra tweaks to make it worth revisiting them. There's also a large library of challenges to complete.</p>

      You can earn mementos by leveling your leaders up while playing; these can be used to grant modest gameplay modifiers for future games or ages.

<p>Also, multiplayer is pretty bare-bones feature-wise at launch, but Firaxis says it's planning on addressing that within a few weeks.</p>
<h3>You can’t rename your cities</h3>
<p>I am afraid to even write this out because it seems like such a glaringly obvious omission that I almost assume I’m just an idiot and haven’t been able to find the right thing to click. But I’ve looked and looked, and I’m pretty sure you can’t rename cities at all. That’s very perplexing.</p>

<h2>A new age</h2>
<p>Change might not be cozy, but some of these changes have made a meaningful difference in countering Civilization's longest-standing frustrations—late-game fatigue, snowballing, and frustrating diplomacy, among other things.</p>
<p>If you're coming to Civilization with historical accuracy in mind, the divorce between leaders and civilizations will bug you. I will remind you, though, that this is a game infamous for Gandhi warmongering with nuclear weapons, so that's not new. (Notably, Gandhi is not a leader in <em>Civilization VII</em>, though I had an amusingly similar situation with Harriet Tubman taking a violent, scorched-earth approach to diplomacy.)</p>
<p>It's worth it, though, because it expands the strategic depth of the game while also addressing some classic balance problems.</p>
<p>Firaxis has added significantly more structure to Civilization here. The game is not as sandbox-y as previous versions of the game, as objectives within ages are much more clearly articulated. Fortunately, it drops the arbitrary objectives that dominated <em>VI</em> in that game's eureka and dark/golden age systems, so I feel it's a happy medium.</p>
<p>It was always going to be a challenge to make yet another Civilization game while retaining the guts that have been around for 34 years. Even though the structural changes are arguably radical, I believe they have more justification and upside than the ones we saw in <em>VI</em>, making <em>VII</em> feel like a return to form.</p>
<p>Systems-wise, <em>Civilization VII</em> is the most complete pre-expansion package we've seen in a long time. There are plenty of refinements and additions I'd like to see, but my general impressions are positive. This is still the best recent 4X game out there.</p>
<p>Let's see if future expansions and mod support have the potential to make it the best Civilization yet. It's not there yet, but there's ample reason to hope.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>The ages system helps to solve many longstanding problems with the overall arc of a Civilization game</li>
<li>Influence yield makes diplomacy better than it's ever been</li>
<li>Tweaks and additions turn building city districts into the full realization of what <em>VI</em> was hinting at but never achieved</li>
<li>The visual presentation is excellent, with sprawling, intricate cities and detailed leaders</li>
<li>Several additions streamline annoying busywork the franchise is known for without curtailing depth</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Content is light even though systems are robust; there are no scenarios at all</li>
<li>The final few turns of an age end up feeling wonky</li>
<li>You can't rename your cities for some reason</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some launch-window bugs and other issues might make it worth waiting a few weeks before digging in</li>
</ul>
