That's a 22% price drop from its original $150 MSRP and the best price we've ever seen for an officially licensed 1TB Xbox expansion card. In fact, it's lower than the Amazon Prime Day deal, which was easily our top selling item for the entire event. The C50 is one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssds-for-xbox-series-xs">best SSDs for the Xbox</a>, which isn't surprising since your options are pretty limited.</p><h2>WD Black C50 1TB Expansion Card for Xbox for $117</h2><div id="188326" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>WD C50 1TB Expansion Card For Xbox Series XS</h3></p></div><p>The WD Black C50 expansion card is essentially a 1TB NVME SSD encased in a specialized Xbox-compatible shell. Unlike the more complex PS5 SSD installation process, which involves opening up the PS5 to access the SSD slot, the WD expansion card simply plugs into its dedicated port on the back of the Xbox. This expansion card offers the same speed as the internal SSD, ensuring that you won't sacrifice performance or encounter extended load times as you might with a regular USB drive. With a 1TB expansion card, you can double the storage on your Xbox Series X console and triple the storage on your (white) Xbox Series S console.</p><p>If you're looking for an officially licensed storage solution (which we strongly recommend), your options are limited to either the WD or Seagate expansion cards, underscoring the importance of seizing a good deal when you find one.</p><p><em>Looking for more Xbox accessories?

<p>With so many players enjoying the fight against the Tyranids, a few bugs and glitches will undoubtedly crop up occasionally. A few already have, and we’ve covered some previously. But there’s a new one making the rounds. A black screen on startup in Space Marine 2 is plaguing the game for many, and it’s a troublemaker. But we have a few potential fixes!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-fix-a-black-screen-on-startup-in-space-marine-2">How to Fix a Black Screen on Startup in Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>When you boot up the game, you might notice the intro video begins to lag until it inevitably stops working, and then you’re left with nothing but a black screen on startup in Space Marine 2. It’s a pain, considering how much you spent on the game, along with the insane hype levels surrounding the overall experience. Here are a few potential fixes that may help you move past the black screen bug:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Restart</strong>! If your game doesn’t work because it’s stuck on a black screen, but this isn’t usual, then attempt to restart your Steam, Epic Games, console, or PC. </li>



<li><strong>System Requirements</strong>! Check to ensure your computer meets <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/here-are-the-space-marine-2-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s minimum system requirements</a>. If you don’t, there’s a good chance the game is a bit too powerful for you to run on your current system. If that’s the case, upgrading components is the only surefire fix, but it’s costly and time-consuming.</li>



<li><strong>Corrupted</strong> <strong>files</strong>! Check your game for corrupted or missing files by verifying its integrity. You can do so by right-clicking Space Marine 2 in your Steam Library, selecting <strong>Properties</strong>, <strong>Installed Files</strong>, and <strong>Verify Integrity of Game Files</strong>.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Update</strong>! You may need to update the game or your graphics drivers. To do so, close out of the game and your launcher (Steam, Epic Games, etc.). Once you relaunch, if there’s an available update, it should automatically begin downloading and installing. Alternatively, verify the game’s files using the method mentioned above. For your graphics driver, check the associated app that comes pre-installed with your system, such as Nvidia GeForce, to check for a recent update.</li>



<li><strong>Reinstall</strong>! It’s certainly not the go-to fix, as redownloading the entirety of Space Marine 2 doesn’t sound entertaining (It’s a big game!), but sometimes it’s a last resort. Alternatively, you can reinstall Easy Anti-Cheat, which can resolve some launch issues, too.</li>
</ul>

However, while they are indeed Astro Bot related, they were originally made for the PSVR game Astro Bot Rescue Mission, rather than the new Astro Bot game that launched on PS5 last week. That said, the shirts simply mention Astro Bot, so they look like official merch for the new PS5 exclusive. Ripple Junction added these to Amazon in May of this year, likely to capitalize on the new game's popularity. Nevertheless, they all feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-face-of-playstation-and-the-technomagic-behind-astro-bot/1100-6526261/">PlayStation's newest platforming mascot</a>, and are an affordable way to add some official Astro Bot merch to your collection.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">If you haven't checked out Astro Bot on PS5 yet, you probably should.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-drop-another-7-shareholders-concerned/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft Stock Prices have dropped another 7% as shareholders are uncertain about the company's future and worry that it isn't performing well enough. This year, several major Ubisoft releases have been released on rocky ground. The most recent game to be published by Ubisoft is Star Wars Outlaws. While it was well-reviewed by critics on Metacritic, it wasn't as well-received by Star Wars fans.&nbsp; With the release of Star Wars Outlaws, shares fell to a new 10-year low, and now the shares have fallen a further 7%, which isn't spelling out anything good for Ubisoft.</p>
<p>The stock price fall happened after a request from a "significant minority shareholder" at the company pressured Ubisoft into making the company go private or use the French minority law to collect enough shareholders to start a proxy fight and begin a sale process.</p>
<p>In addition to the demand to make Ubisoft go private, the <a href="https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor has also requested</a> that the current management be replaced by a new CEO who will "optimize the cost and studio structure for a more agile and competitive company as Ubisoft should be."</p>
<p>Even though Ubisoft has launched a couple of great games in recent years, such as Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, it, unfortunately, doesn't come close to the negativity and player reviews for their more recent games, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-is-reportedly-the-fastest-ubisoft-game-to-reach-1-million-players/">XDefiant</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-director-admits-review-score-disappointment/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. In addition to the falling Ubisoft stock prices, XDefiant is now at risk of losing post-launch support, as player numbers have continued to fall, a game that previously contributed to the financial success of Ubisoft.</p>
<p>However, if the player count doesn't increase by season 3 of XDefiant, the game will lose the needed post-launch support that makes it more playable for those who are still dedicating time to it.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Ubisoft Entertainment SA shares are worth 13.67 euros, roughly $15.09. In total, Ubisoft shares have decreased by 7.13% today alone, reaching a low of 13.31 euros, which is $14.69.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In their open letter, shareholders AJ Investments argue that Ubisoft is an undervalued company whose stock prices should be worth 40-45 euros per share. Unfortunately, Ubisoft is not coming close to hitting the mark. AJ Investments suggests they go private "with Tencent as a significant partner and shareholder to progress the company." To accompany that statement, they also want Ubisoft to "implement a comprehensive cost reduction and optimize staffing levels to be more comparable with industry leaders."</p>
<p>If Ubisoft takes note of its words and follows through on its actions, the industry can expect to see more layoffs, all to benefit shareholders.</p>

		<p>ZzzzzZzzzzz. That's me, the guy who was standing in a wedding this weekend, which means he was part of late night events on both Saturday and Sunday. I'm happy for one of my oldest friends, but it's one of those days where you wake up and go "god, I can't wait to go back to sleep tonight." (Related, this is also how I felt when the Bears, showing off their flashy new QB, had scored basically zero points at halftime. <em>Pain.</em>) But we've got another busy week at Remap, which has already kicked off as you read this—Remap Hotline is already in podcast feeds.</p><p>-pk, who is excited his deluxe <em>Godzilla Minus One</em> disc is coming in the mail today</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>We published the latest edition of Remap Hotline, where we start off by considering Rob's enormous slate of devices, and whether it's time for him to get another one. But in all seriousness, it's a lot of discussion about the role different devices play in our lives, and how it's frustrating when you can't make one thing work for everything. We answer a lot more than that, too.</li><li><strong>TUESDAY: </strong>After talking over what's expected to be the announcement of a PlayStation 5 Pro, we'll record another episode of HOA. We've gotten really behind on reader questions, so we're going to make that the focus, but, uh, I recently discovered my front door frame was falling apart, so...yeah. Doors! You'll hear that podcast next week. In the afternoon, we'll squad up as a trio to check out <em>Space Marine 2</em>.</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY:</strong> Because of our GeForce Now streams, we're moving Remap Radio recording to Wednesday. So, we'll get that in the bag. There's plenty of games we didn't end up having time for last week.</li><li><strong>THURSDAY: </strong>The wheel must turn, and it falls on us to turn it.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY: </strong>We'll publish Remap Radio, and most likely, another letter series between Rob and I. We're trying to make these something for every Friday. Next week, I think, we'll do our next Nextlander x Remap team up, too. <br></li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/wow-war-within-review-expansion-is-it-good-1851643832<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em> has a lot to live up to. The first in a trilogy of expansions Blizzard has dubbed The Worldsoul Saga and the followup to the stellar previous expansion in <em>Dragonflight</em>, it’s easy to imagine it crumbling under lofty expectations. Luckily, however, <em>The War Within</em> builds wonderfully on the best aspects of its predecessors while adding worthwhile new ways to play, even if it plays it a bit safe while building the foundation of what is billed as the biggest story in the game’s twenty-year history. </p><p><em>The War Within</em> doesn’t mess around in its opening moments. Following a warning from the soul of the planet Azeroth herself, we find ourselves in imminent conflict with the menacing void known as Xal’atath. This harbinger of the void is puppeteering various factions throughout Khaz Algar, the expansion’s new continent. Like the best <em>WoW</em> villains, Xal’atath shows up in each zone of the expansion, making her feel dangerous as she schemes and manipulates vulnerable minds to achieve her dark aspirations.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="dc60d40a98fd5074fa874d615e3cb0dd" data-recommend-id="image://dc60d40a98fd5074fa874d615e3cb0dd" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An armored Earthen, a dwarf who appears carved out of rock, stands proudly in a city environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An armored Earthen, a dwarf who appears carved out of rock, stands proudly in a city environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc60d40a98fd5074fa874d615e3cb0dd" data-recommend-id="image://dc60d40a98fd5074fa874d615e3cb0dd" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An armored Earthen, a dwarf who appears carved out of rock, stands proudly in a city environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I love how <em>The War Within</em> succeeds in introducing entirely new factions, fleshing them out, and tying them to the sprawling established lore in very cool ways. The first group we meet are the Titan-forged proto-dwarves known as the Earthen. Protectors of The Isle of Dorn, on which we’ve disastrously crashed, the Earthen become our central allies throughout the expansion. Because they follow ancient edicts, we outsiders aren’t exactly welcome, but out of necessity, we have to wedge our way into their strict society. Our interference causes many Earthen to struggle between adhering to the ancient edicts they are programmed to follow and adapting and embracing the potential new allies who have crash-landed on their doorstep. From there, we travel underground, where the rest of the expansion resides.<br></p><p>Khaz Algar is expertly crafted, and something unlike Blizzard has created before. Sure, <em>World of Warcraft</em> has had underground zones in the past, but nothing as vast and as interesting as what’s been created for <em>The War Within</em>. The Isle of Dorn and the zones beneath feel like a cohesive place that exists naturally, rather than a handful of disparate biomes that happen to border one another. And with the return of <em>Dragonflight</em>’s excellent Dragonriding mechanic, now known as Skyriding, which has been expanded to just about everywhere in the game, you can explore these new zones (as well as familiar ones) in the best way possible. It’s a blast navigating <em>The War Within</em>’s areas on dragonback, or whichever flying mount you’d like, soaring down the cavern in the center of the Earthen city of Dornogal down to the Ringing Deeps, taking a sharp left into the radiant Hallowfall next door, and continuing into the depths of Azj-Kahet where the creepy crawly Nerubians reside.</p><figure id="" data-id="4310056be9342af8d8622bd8463f57a9" data-recommend-id="image://4310056be9342af8d8622bd8463f57a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The region of Hallowfall, with a massive glowing crystal hanging down from above." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The region of Hallowfall, with a massive glowing crystal hanging down from above." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4310056be9342af8d8622bd8463f57a9" data-recommend-id="image://4310056be9342af8d8622bd8463f57a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The region of Hallowfall, with a massive glowing crystal hanging down from above." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>My favorite of these zones is the hauntingly beautiful Hallowfall, which, despite being deep below the surface, is unexpectedly open and bright. A mysterious crystal protrudes from its ceiling, illuminating the area like a surrogate sun. Despite being deep below the surface, Hallowfall is unexpectedly open and bright. Here, we meet the Arathi, a faction making its debut in <em>The War Within</em>. While they come from the other side of the globe, they share ties to the humans and elves from our hemisphere of Azeroth. Stranded for years after being teleported to Hallowfall, the Arathi are in a constant struggle to keep their holy fires burning and, in so doing, to keep the insect-like Nerubian invaders from even deeper below at bay. On top of that, the large shining shard in the sky keeps shifting to an ominous void-y glow, empowering the evil hordes flooding from the darkness. With its impeccable art direction, fascinating story, and lore implications, Hallowfall is instantly iconic and easily my favorite zone Blizzard has created in years.<br></p><p><em>The War Within</em>’s story expands the existing <em>Warcraft </em>mythos in meaningful ways, and there’s plenty to look forward to regarding long-running storylines with characters like Anduin Wrynn and Magi Bronzebeard. Unfortunately, without getting into specifics, some of the more powerful story beats often pull their punches, defanging the situations in which characters find themselves. I’d be much more invested in the coming patches and the next expansion if some of these moments didn’t cheapen the threat Xal’atath truly poses to our heroes throughout the mainline quests.<br></p><p><em>The War Within</em>’s main narrative questline can be breezed through much faster than those in previous expansions, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t plenty to do and see. Each zone only has about three central questlines that get to the meat of <em>The War Within</em>, but the abundance of side quests adds wonderful detail to the outlines the main story lays down. Some of the most interesting quests and storylines are found off the beaten path, and I’m happy I took the time to play through them. For instance, after being saved by a new race called the Harronir that seems to be the missing link between Night Elves and Dark Trolls, you’ll be rewarded with a cool series of quests that involve corrupting yourself with blood from an Old God to fight Eldritch horror hallucinations, but only if you make an effort to seek them out. Much of the expansion’s best stuff is in its side content, and it shouldn’t be skipped if you’re a sucker for some of that sweet, sweet lore.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="427edf3acb8f9f5d3ef98f2114561d52" data-recommend-id="image://427edf3acb8f9f5d3ef98f2114561d52" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu of Hero Talents is pictured, with a skill tree called Elune's Chosen and one called Keeper of the Grove displayed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu of Hero Talents is pictured, with a skill tree called Elune's Chosen and one called Keeper of the Grove displayed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="427edf3acb8f9f5d3ef98f2114561d52" data-recommend-id="image://427edf3acb8f9f5d3ef98f2114561d52" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu of Hero Talents is pictured, with a skill tree called Elune's Chosen and one called Keeper of the Grove displayed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Outside of the story, <em>The War Within</em> introduces a handful of great new features. First, in lieu of expanding the existing talent trees that were re-established in <em>Dragonflight</em>, it brings us Hero Talents. Taking inspiration from the class artifact weapons from <em>Legion</em>, Hero Talents provide you with new choices about how to play your character, which pays off in spades in enhancing and realizing class identity. Each class has a handful of Hero Talent paths to choose from, with two accessible paths available for each specialization. While leveling my Protection Paladin, I initially took on the talents of the Lightsmith, allowing me to imbue my weapon and armor with the power of the holy light while spreading those benefits to my allies. Alternatively, I could choose the Templar route, giving me access to more holy hammers to drop from the sky to melt my foes. Either way, I feel like I’m playing a different type of Protection Paladin than ever before and both ooze flavor.<br></p><p>While it officially rolled into the game earlier this year, <em>The War Within</em> is the first expansion in which Follower Dungeons are available throughout the leveling experience. Instead of having to wait in a dungeon queue or having to deal with random people who you may not vibe with, Follower Dungeons team you up with NPCs to fill the missing roles in your party and let you play through a given dungeon at your own pace. Conceptually, it’s a wonderful addition to the game, especially for new players still learning the ropes and their roles in a group. Even someone like myself, who has hundreds of hours in the game, finds it to be a very useful tool to ease myself into learning how to tank without the social pressures of impatient teammates.<br></p><p>Also leaning into solo and small group play is a new activity called Delves. Reworking the blueprint of Torghast, a roguelike tower from back in Shadowlands, Delves have so far fixed my biggest gripes of its previous iteration, which were often time-consuming when running alone and frustratingly mandatory to progress in collecting gear in the end game. Instead, Delves offer a succinct optional activity that doesn’t eat up a significant chunk of time to complete but are still a viable way to collect powerful loot.<br></p><p>Delves can be found in a variety of locations, with each serving a handful of objectives that alternate upon each entry, giving some much-needed variety to what something like Torghast once offered. In this first season of Delves, you’re joined by <em>WoW</em>’s ambitious and prolific adventurer, Brann Bronzebeard. Brann levels up throughout Delve runs and can be equipped with various abilities to support your playstyle best. I haven’t really had any issues with Brann pulling his weight in our brief partnership, although I also haven’t had much of a problem completing Delves to begin with. Only three levels of difficulty were available at the time of this review, none of which were all that hard to work through. At worst Delves have been a little boring, but I see the promise of the concept, and expect them to pick up when I can grind my way up the difficulty ladder when they’re implemented.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="0ef12ff645349eba0e2342dd6b189bbf" data-recommend-id="image://0ef12ff645349eba0e2342dd6b189bbf" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Warbands screen shows four World of Warcraft characters gathered around a campfire, each with their names and levels displayed above them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Warbands screen shows four World of Warcraft characters gathered around a campfire, each with their names and levels displayed above them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0ef12ff645349eba0e2342dd6b189bbf" data-recommend-id="image://0ef12ff645349eba0e2342dd6b189bbf" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Warbands screen shows four World of Warcraft characters gathered around a campfire, each with their names and levels displayed above them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Finally, Warbands are a new feature with <em>The War Within</em>, but they’re a little more nebulous of a concept than Delves and Hero Talents. However, they are no less important and exciting for the long-term health of <em>World of Warcraft</em>. Warbands is Blizzard’s way of tearing down walls between the characters you have on your account. Combined with a reworked character select screen, Warbands let you share things like bank space, collected gear transmogs, currency, achievements, quest progression, and faction reputation across all of your characters. No more having to grind the same content again and again on alts if you don’t want to. It was liberating switching to my Mage after completing <em>The War Within</em>’s main story and skipping it entirely, not having to relive those exact moments yet again a few short hours after experiencing them and letting me level in whatever way I see fit. While it’s certainly not the flashiest thing Blizzard has put in the game, I’m thankful for the huge quality-of-life improvements Warbands have already afforded me.<br></p><p>I can confidently say <em>WoW</em> is back. Well, it was back in <em>Dragonflight</em>, but it’s extra back now. Not only does <em>The War Within</em> make the player experience better with great additions like Warbands and Follower Dungeons, but it also demonstrates that Blizzard isn’t afraid to keep refining good ideas like Hero Talents or reworking those that may have failed previously and molded them into nuggets of fun and flavor like Delves. If this is just the start of what to expect with <em>Warcraft</em> in the era of The Worldsoul Saga, then I’m eager to stick around and see where these new adventures on Azeroth take us next.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The basic white suit version will be included in the base game. The chef outfit variant will be available free to KFC rewards members. And finally, if you want to unlock and use the mech suit variant of Colonel Sanders (a real man who once walked this Earth), you’ll need 250 KFC reward points. That’s about $25 worth of chicken.</p><p>I’d make a joke at this point about how Sanders is spinning in his grave, but the dude’s likely used to it by now.

            <p>
Developer Mojang has unveiled changes to Minecraft's content release schedule that'll see the blockbusting sandbox adventure trade its traditional single summer update for multiple content drops throughout the year. And that's on top of plans for a native PS5 release and more.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-future-of-minecrafts-development">blog post</a> outlining the future of Minecraft's development, Mojang said its new release model is designed to satisfying players' desires for "new Minecraft content more often", and will see content drops of varying sizes releasing "more frequently" each year. It also revealed it's been trialing the approach for a while, pointing to a December 2023 update that turned pots into functional storage containers and made visual changes to bats, as well as this April's Armored Paws update, which introduced armadillos, wolf variations, and wolf armour.
</p>
<p>
Alongside more regular content releases for Minecraft, Mojang said it's been focusing on "long-term initiatives to ensure we can continue to evolve [the game] long into the future". And that's alongside confirmation a native PS5 release for Minecraft is on the way. There's no word on when this might arrive, but the studio added it plans to explore ways to improve Minecraft’s multiplayer experience over the coming year, making it easier to find and connect with friends.

<p>
Something else set to receive a bit of a shake-up is Minecraft Live - Mojang's livestream celebration of Minecraft. This is shifting from an annual event to a twice-yearly stream, with both shows detailing "the latest features we're working on, what's coming into testing, and the newest news from across the Minecraft franchise". Mojang is also retiring Minecraft Live's increasingly controversial mob vote.
</p>
<p>
"We are excited for a future of Minecraft in which we get to share more features with you more regularly," the studio concluded, "and in which your suggestions continue to become a reality. We hope you'll join us for another fifteen years – and hopefully, even more."
</p>

In other news, Warner Bros. Pictures recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">shared</a> a first - and not especially promising - look at its live-action movie adaptation of Minecraft, due to arrive in cinemas on 4th April next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft stock prices have fallen another 7% amid shareholder uncertainty that the company isn’t performing well enough.</p>



<p>The stock price fall comes following a request from a “significant minority shareholder” at the company who has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-being-pressured-to-go-private-as-share-prices-continue-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pressured Ubisoft to make the company go private</a> or will use French minority law to collect enough shareholders to start a proxy fight and initiate a sale process.</p>



<p>Just last week,<span> Insider Gaming reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/">XDefiant was at risk of losing its much-needed post-launch support</a> after dwindling player numbers and following the release of a mild Star Wars: Outlaws launch,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-tanks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;</a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-tanks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Ubisoft’s stock price </span>fell to a near 10-year low</a>. At the time of writing, its share price stands at 13.67 euros,&nbsp;a 51% decrease from this time last year.</p>



<p>The demand from the investor also requests a change of current management, including the request to hire a new CEO who will “optimise the cost and studio structure for more agile and competitive company as Ubisoft should be”.</p>



<p>Time and again, Ubisoft has continued to have “misses” with its launches these past few years. Despite incredible games like Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, player sentiment toward the publisher has seemingly been so tainted that fantastic games are not getting the sales they need to turn the company’s fortunes around. </p>



<p>Ubisoft currently employs around 20,000 developers and is now valued at 1.89 billion.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ubisoft’s continuing stock price drops? Do you think the company can turn things around, or should it sell up? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

<p>Ubisoft is facing pressure from an investor to take the company private as its shares continued to fall on the London Stock Exchange. </p>



<p>Less than a week after shares of Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-tanks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fell to a 10-year low due to the reception</a> of Star Wars Outlaws, an investor in the company is making a public push for the company to be taken private. This has led to shares falling even further down to €13.66 as of the close of trading on Monday. </p>







<p>In a <a href="https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">publicly released letter</a>, AJ Investments is says that Ubisoft is an undervalued company and should be worth up to €40-€45 per share. The hedge fund says it has concerns about the future of Ubisoft as well as its current management. </p>



<p>“Ubisoft at current state is mismanaged and shareholders are hostages of Guillemot family members and Tencent who take advantage of them,” the letter said. “Management is focused on pleasing investors with beating quarterly results and not focusing on long-term strategy to provide exceptional experience for the gamers. Our company has extensive knowledge about the gaming industry and we were longterm shareholder in Activision Blizzard and we started our Ubisoft position couple weeks ago and still adding to it.”</p>



<p>The company suggests that the company goes private “with Tencent as a significant partner and shareholder”. In addition to that, it wants Ubisoft to “implement a comprehensive cost reduction program and optimize staffing levels to be more comparable with industry leaders.”</p>



<p>“This will involve difficult decisions but is necessary to ensure long-term viability and competitiveness,” they say while also mentioned that they are aware of the layoffs Ubisoft has made in “recent years”.</p>



<p>Lastly, the fund suggests making management changes, including the hiring of a new CEO to replace Yves Guillemot.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has yet to respond to the letter or requests for comment. For what it’s worth, AJ Investments holds less than a 1% share in Ubisoft, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/ubisoft-shares-slump-after-investor-urges-assassins-creed-maker-to-go-private-c602603d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">per the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>

The clip opens with the accused perfectly timing a jump to avoid an unseen Lightning Ball before opening fire immediately upon a wall where their opponents emerge from.</p><p>This is a classic symptom of an aim bot mod, a cheat which automatically targets enemies even before they're visible to the player. This was even more evident when the focus switched to sniping character Vindicta.</p><p>Her crosshair of her gun was lined up directly through a wall in front of her, with no players visible, yet the bullets would hit them regardless. "She's just pulled a Wanted," one of the players commentating said, as the clip was paused to show the bullet changing direction in mid air.</p><p>Reddit users in the comments insisted on the importance of reporting these cheaters, though MintDoe noted the direct reporting feature available in Deadlock doesn't actually let players choose cheating as an option. It can instead only be done through the official Deadlock Discord channel.</p><p>Deadlock is a six versus six, third-person hero shooter with a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) twist, taking inspiration from genre classics such as Leage of Legends, Dota 2, and Heroes of the Storm.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Valve seemingly looked to keep it a secret for weeks despite data showing that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deadlock-valves-new-hero-shooter-is-quietly-amassing-thousands-of-playtesters">thousands of players were already online</a>, but has now acknowledged its existence proper with an official Steam page.

<p>As recently as a week ago, a new disc copy of Sony's team-based shooter <em>Concord</em> on the PlayStation 5 would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240805123255/https://www.bestbuy.com/site/concord-playstation-5/6586164.p?skuId=6586164">set you back about $40 at most retailers</a>. Now that Sony has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/two-weeks-after-launch-sony-shooter-concord-goes-offline-and-offers-refunds/">shut off the game's servers after just two weeks</a>, you might think those now-useless discs would be practically worthless.</p>
<p>Instead, the physical version of <em>Concord</em> on PS5 has become a surprise collector's item. An Ars analysis of nearly 300 eBay listings completed between September 3–8 shows new copies of the now-defunct game selling for a median price of $100 since the game's shutdown. That going rate peaked at a median of $118 on September 5, up from $89.50 on September 3, before settling at $110 for eBay sales made on September 8.</p>
<h2>Supply and demand</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/meet-the-man-who-got-100000-for-a-copy-of-super-mario-bros/">usual</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/hard-to-find-nes-classic-edition-sees-200-ebay-price-markup-at-launch/">gaming collectibles</a>, the price increase has less to do with playability and more to do with rarity. GameDiscoverCo analyst Simon Carless <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">told IGN last month</a> that he estimated an underwhelming 25,000 total sales for <em>Concord</em> across PS5 and PC. Even if we assume 80 percent of those sales were on the PS5, most of those console sales probably came as purely digital downloads, given <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/alan-wake-2-and-the-death-of-disc-based-video-games">long-running industry trends</a> and the game's focus on online play.
</p><p>That means the total number of PS5 <em>Concord</em> discs in the wild could number in the single-digit thousands, easily making it one of the rarest physical first-party games Sony has ever released. And with Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">officially halting <em>Concord</em> sales as of September 3</a>, that number isn't going to go up anytime soon.</p>
<p>Sony encouraged players who purchased a physical copy of <em>Concord</em> to "please refer to the refund process of the retailer you purchased it from to obtain your refund." Players who followed that advice missed out on the opportunity to make a pretty quick return on their investment through eBay reselling, though. A couple of lucky eBay sellers even pulled in nearly $500 for sealed copies of the game sold on September 5.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/concorddiscs.png" data-height="500" data-width="375" alt="One eBay seller seemed to have a lot of <em>Concord</em> discs ready to flip."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/concorddiscs.png" data-height="500" data-width="375">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> One eBay seller seemed to have a lot of <em>Concord</em> discs ready to flip.</p><p>eBay</p></figcaption></figure><p>Even without those kinds of outliers, though, most eBay sellers have been able to get between $87 (20th percentile) and $120 (80th percentile) for new disc copies of the game since it was discontinued. That's an easy 100 to 200 percent return on a $40 investment in well under a month. And the photos on some of those eBay listings suggest a few sellers were looking to cash in by reselling dozens of copies in individual lots.</p>
<p>The collector's mania for <em>Concord</em> has seemingly extended to a limited edition-themed controller that <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller-concord-limited-edition">Sony was selling for $85</a> as well. Completed eBay listings for that controller went for a median price of $252.50 on September 8, up from just $132 on September 3. Unlike the game they're based on, though, those controllers have the benefit of still working with PS5 hardware well into the future.</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>The <em>Concord</em>-themed DualSense controller at least still works now that the game has been discontinued.</p><p>Sony</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the moment, it's hard to tell how long these pricing trends will last. If there's a wider market of PlayStation collectors looking for a rare piece of Sony history, <em>Concord</em> could become the modern equivalent of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/nintendo-world-championship-cart-attracts-suspiciously-high-auction-price/">the NES' <em>Stadium Events</em></a>—a rare but forgettable game that collectors still value. But if speculators are driving the current mania—hoping to quickly resell it for more to the next person in line—the pricing bubble could burst just as quickly as it inflated.
</p><p>All that speculation could also come crashing down if Sony decides to relaunch <em>Concord</em> sales in the future. In the game's shutdown announcement, Sony said it was "explor[ing] options, including those that will better reach our players." Already, there is <a href="https://www.change.org/p/we-were-all-busy-that-week-please-release-concord-again-04ef42c3-345e-4357-a7c4-88f127979675">a tongue-in-cheek petition effort</a> to convince Sony to do just that, with nearly 2,000 signatories to its name. "We were all busy that week," the petition's title reads. "Please release <em>Concord</em> again."</p>

                <p>AMD is reportedly stepping back from directly competing with Nvidia in the pursuit of the flagship consumer GPU. As the company continues on its quest to gain more market share overall, it believes that scale is the answer and not having the outright fastest card on the market.</p><p>That's according to Jack Huynh, AMD's senior vice president, who spoke with <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-deprioritizing-flagship-gaming-gpus-jack-hyunh-talks-new-strategy-for-gaming-market" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom's Hardware</a> at IFA 2024. With rumors regarding the upcoming RX-8000 series of AMD GPUs potentially dropping flagship models (which AMD hasn't officially confirmed), Huynh was pressed to comment on the company's long-term strategy for consumers and how it might differ to that of Nvidia. The answer seems to be something similar to what AMD attempted five years ago--surrendering the flagship fight to Nvidia while attempting to gain market share where most consumers are spending their money: in mid- to budget-ranged GPU offerings.</p><p>"...But my priority right now is to build scale for AMD", replied Huynh, in response to being asked if AMD would not pursue a flagship GPU. "Because without scale right now, I can't get the developers. If I tell developers, 'I'm just going for 10% of the market share,' they just say, 'Jack, I wish you well, but we have to go with Nvidia.' So, I have to show them a plan that says, 'Hey, we can get to 40% market share with this strategy.' Then they say, 'I'm with you now, Jack. Now I’ll optimize on AMD.' Once we get that, then we can go after the top."</p><p>Earlier in the interview, Huynh referenced AMD's partnership with both Sony and Microsoft with regards to powering both the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ps5/" data-ref-id="5005-128">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/xbox-series-x/" data-ref-id="5005-129">Xbox Series X</a> consoles, citing it as an example of how lower-cost products can yield the market share figures it is pursuing. Nvidia currently supplies its Tegra ARM-based SoC to Nintendo for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch/" data-ref-id="5005-124">Nintendo Switch</a>, but has not featured in a Microsoft or Sony manufactured console yet.</p><p>"We have this debate quite a bit at AMD, right? So the question I ask is, the PlayStation 5, do you think that’s hurting us? It’s $499. So, I ask, is it fun to go King of the Hill? Again, I'm looking for scale. Because when we get scale, then I bring developers with us," concluded Huynh.</p><p>It's too early to conclude if this means AMD already has new consoles from both Microsoft and Sony on its long-term roadmap, but it does seem more certain that RX-8000 series GPUs, expected later this year, won't attempt to go blow-for-blow with Nvidia's own upcoming RTX-50 series. AMD is committed to scale, however, which will continue with its mid-range and budget offerings, as well as the continued sale of PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. Its also making a name for itself in the blossoming portable PC market, with the company's next-generation Z2 Extreme chip expected in 2025.</p>
