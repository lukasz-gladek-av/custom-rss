		<p>Gearbox and Sony have announced that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> gameplay deep dive State of Play will stream tomorrow, 30th April, through the official PlayStation Twitch and YouTube channels.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to tune in from 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST / 11pm CEST to see over 20 minutes of developer-led gameplay to show what’s new, old and a bit different about this latest game in the hit looter shooter series.</p>


<p>In a further surprise, Borderlands 4’s release date is now set for 12th September across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and PC – this is actually earlier than was announced in February’s State of Play by two weeks. Since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/embracer-sells-off-gearbox-to-take-two-for-460-million/">Gearbox is now owned by Take-Two Interactive</a>, and Take-Two’s constantly said that GTA 6 will launch in late 2025, perhaps there’s a bit of insider knowledge as the company looks to make as much money as possible?</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s showcase will be hosted by Creative Director Graeme Timms and Senior Project Producer Anthony Nicholson. This will see the duo walk us through some of the missions we’ll see as you rampage across Kairos and take down the Timekeeper, the new weapons that can be generated, new and returning characters and Action Skills.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/evil-dead-the-game-vanishes-from-epic-and-playstation-stores.1176588/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/evil-dead-game-delisted-playstation-epic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eagle-eyed fans have noticed that&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>appears to have been delisted from two major storefronts, prompting worries that the game may be about to be shut down.</p>

<p>Over on the game's official subreddit, user ThePatMan117 (who has quite the flair, by the way) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EvilDeadTheGame/comments/1ka4d44/update_evil_dead_the_games_epic_games_store/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">spotted</a> that&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>has disappeared from both the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/evil-dead-the-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> and the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/evil-dead-the-game/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>. The listing for the game is now a dead link in both cases.</p>

<p>Strangely enough,&nbsp;the game is still available on both the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/evil-dead-the-game/9pd4jfnzcz90/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1493750/Evil_Dead_The_Game/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, so it is, of course, entirely possible that the PlayStation and Epic delistings are just a mistake and that normal service will resume soon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/evil-dead-the-game-delisting-car.jpg?itok=tm5fM0hA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/evil-dead-the-game-delisting-car.jpg?itok=WLGl3Jj1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>could be on the way out.</figcaption></figure><p>I fired up my PS5 to check whether the game is still available via the console's storefront and I didn't see it while searching, so it looks like you can't buy it via either the web interface or the PS5's store.</p>

<p>At time of writing, there's been no official word from developer Saber Interactive, and the&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>X account hasn't posted anything for a number of months. We've reached out to Saber to ask whether the game's delisting is a mistake or intentional.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game</em>, it's an <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/evil-dead-game" rel="nofollow">asymmetrical multiplayer horror game</a> along the lines of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-by-daylight" rel="nofollow">Dead by Daylight</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Friday the 13th</em><em>: The Game</em>, although as the name suggests, it's based around the&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>You can choose to play either as the forces of good, led by Ash Williams, or the Kandarian Demon and its Deadite followers, and as you'd expect, the action can get pretty gory and violent at its most outre.</p>




<p>A quick glance at&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1493750/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam numbers</a> might suggest a reason for its potential delisting; the game currently has just 31 players online, with a 39-player peak over the last 24 hours. Of course, it's available on consoles and other storefronts too, but that's not an encouraging figure.</p>

<p>It does, however, prove that servers for&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>haven't been shut down yet, although that may change in the near future. We'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

We have all ridden the emotional rollercoaster of thinking that we're smart and patient enough to play a dedicated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> game, then realising that we're inept and bored and just want to bonk things with a big axe. Still, I'm moderately enthused by this here release date trailer for The Siege And The Sandfox, a 2D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> in which you clamber steadily out of a huge, opulent dungeon.</p>
<p>It launches on 20th May, and puts me in mind of Prince Of Persia, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>, Vagante and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>.

You are the Sandfox, obviously - a "notorious assassin" and royal protector - and that's your own desert city that's under Siege. As the game begins, the Sandfox catches the city's Queen murdering the King. She promptly throws him into a big hole. Left for dead, you must journey upward through a realm of caves, mausoleums and decrepit yet majestic architecture, making a few friends and avoiding quite a lot of guards and area-specific ne'er-do-wells with distinct capabilities. The aesthetic isn't startling but it is enveloping: a generous, greasy cut of 16-bit orientalism, with lots of baroque backdrops and light seeping through the pixels.
</p>
<p>
You will make use of parkour techniques such as pole-swinging, together with devious, underhand gambits such as politely closing doors behind you. Along the way you will encounter an ancient evil. Something tells me that the ancient evil will ultimately prove more important than getting vengeance on the Queen. Wouldn't be surprised if the Queen was the goodie, actually. Wouldn't be surprised if she butchered the King to keep said ancient evil in check somehow. But enough of my soothsaying.

Developers <a href="https://cardboardsword.co.uk/">Cardboard Sword</a> are "an AAA-experienced multi-talented team with over 160 years of combined experience". I hate self-promotion that weirdly slops together the lifeforce of team members. I'm spitefully picturing one stooped and spindly programmer with a long white beard, surrounded by a crowd of shrieking eight-year-old designers and artists. Their other games include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/509950/Transmission/">Transmission</a>, which is "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator">Euro Truck Simulator</a> meets <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jalopy">Jalopy</a> on a rainy summer night in 1986".

As you play this open-world racing adventure, you’ll unlock a smorgasbord of cosmetics you can equip, giving you plenty of reasons to update your character’s look throughout the game. </p><p>Unfortunately, you can’t customize your character just anywhere in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>. Instead, you’ll need to head to specific places on the map that grant you access to this menu option.

Now <strong>you can change your character’s gender, identity, and voice, as well as equip them with any of the clothing items or full outfits you’ve unlocked</strong>. Some cosmetics are locked behind progression or wheel spins, while others can be purchased using credits.

It’s one of the least surprising games I’ve ever played, holding so much in common with its inspirations that they’re almost comically indistinguishable. For preview purposes, this is a very good thing:  If you enjoy other games about scavenging goods while avoiding PvE foes and robbing PvP humans, you’re probably going to like ARC Raiders. If you don’t, then there’s likely nothing new here to tempt you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a game so unabashedly tied to its progenitors that the hero’s default melee weapon is a pickaxe, the same weapon Fortnite metaverse heroes dropping off the Battle Bus lug into combat. That’s a cute enough homage, but it's only the tip of the iceberg for the ways ARC Raiders will be instantly comprehensible to those who play Battle Royale, tree-punching survival games, or extraction. There’s very little that feels truly original, but the components bolted together from other successful live service games click together predictably and produce a satisfying result. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">ARC Raiders - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The goal each round is simple: go to the surface and then get back underground alive with better loot than you started with. Two forces stand in the way of that goal. The first are the ARC, AI-controlled battle robots that wander the map searching for any sign of organic life. The ARC are no trifling threat. Even the smallest bots can prove surprisingly dangerous, especially in groups. The little spider-like scurriers are downright upsetting for an arachnophobe like me, and the large crawlers do not mess around. ARC wander the map listening for the sounds of search or battle and swarm any humans they find. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ARC are especially dangerous in numbers, and there are plenty of subtle little traps set where clusters of different ARC with complementary abilities are placed near one another, sometimes hidden in indoor areas where one can literally trip into them. I met my fate more than once when I got overconfident around ARC. One crawling monstrosity literally spun into the air with its legs like some cyclops spider helicopter. Take down an ARC, though, and the rewards can be worth your trouble. They generally contain ammo and weapon components. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arc Raiders - Screenshots and GIFs</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The second and more deadly threat are your fellow raiders. If you choose to play ARC Raiders, you’d best enjoy watching your back, because to quote Casablanca, “this place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere.” It’s often more efficient to fall upon a fully-loaded player who isn’t paying attention than to risk a half hour of bracing open doors in a nearby warehouse, or to lurk near an extraction point and cut down somebody when they’re about to escape. Of course, every other raider is likely looking to do the same to you. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you choose to play ARC Raiders, you’d best enjoy watching your back, because to quote Casablanca, “this place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is competent enough to be satisfying. Your third-person avatar moves and controls like most other third-person avatars in modern shooters, with no real irregularities or surprises in the controls. Bullets mostly go where you want them to, depending on the capabilities of your chosen weapon, and melee attack power is substantial. Firearms feel right: SMGs are springy and difficult to control, assault rifles steady and heavy, sniper rifles punch like artillery. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing in teams of three adds a bit of depth to the battle, as you and your companions can search and cover for each other much more systematically than is possible with a single raider. Firefights between teams develop a sense of strategy, as coordinating squads deploy flanking tactics and ambushes against groups of foes. Whether calling out directions, overhearing sounds, covering all windows in a room, your three-person squad will find plenty of tension waiting in most buildings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cleverly-designed maps draw the characters in. The most lucrative resource hubs are clearly marked, and players flock to the richest areas looking for loot, or hover between the treasures and the extraction areas, waiting to dispossess the luckiest foragers of their well-won gains. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The environments are passable, with the usual collection of rusty warehouses, abandoned apartment buildings, and overgrown vacant lots you’ll find in a lot of post-apocalyptic shooters. Everything is serviceable, but it all kinda feels like they gave Fortnite a coat of Day Z grime and moved on. It’s a boring enough world that it certainly took me out of any chance of getting into the lore. But I don’t really think lore is the big draw here anyway. ARC Raiders is meat loaf without much plate presentation, but the meat loaf is tasty if a little cold. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>ARC Raiders is meat loaf without much plate presentation, but the meat loaf is tasty if a little cold. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Every drawer and cabinet is a potential source of wealth: crafting components, ammunition, shields, healing items, and weapons. Ammunition is properly segmented enough to keep you hungry as you scavenge and construct guns. Light, medium, heavy, and shotgun ammo variants are available early on to locate in the overworld, craft in your lair, or purchase underground. Materials have the usual, predictable levels of rarity corresponding to color, with certain colors granting the ability to develop more useful or rare items. A single special pocket in your inventory allows you to keep one special discovered item safe even in the event of your death, so that you can haul your rarest finds home even when you die.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some containers take time to open and generate quite a bit of noise when manipulated, which is a delightful tension-raising mechanic that I really appreciated. Opening one of these was especially harrowing when playing solo... you can really feel the vulnerability with your camera locked forward, not knowing what passing robot or player might discover you as you make an ugly racket jimmying a door. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You spend your time between rounds underground, where you convert your ill-gotten gains into an ever-escalating series of crafting tables allowing for the creation of ever-more-elaborate gear. You can also choose to straight liquidate materials and finds for cash, and purchase fully-created items at in-game stores. There’s also some part of crafting that involves a live rooster. I never figured that out. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you explore the world above, you gain experience which opens up access to a series of Skill Trees. Selecting various branches can help you optimize your avatar to your playstyle, increasing combat ability, mobility, or stealth. The different abilities are clearly labeled, and most are useful enough that every step feels like real progress. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Character design with default options is pretty rough, but a number of better textures and outfits open up when you apply premium currency. I deliberately made my guy look as bleak and sad as possible using only default options, but my multiplayer partner had this whole ZZ Top Man With No Name vibe going on... I was envious. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">ARC Raiders previews pretty well, perhaps because its design conservatism makes it so instantly familiar. There’s absolutely nothing here to challenge what came before, but sometimes, that’s okay. Overall, the ARC Raiders loop seems pretty well tuned to satisfy: make it to the surface to loot and kill, bring your goods and experience back underground to improve your abilities, head back up stronger to find stronger gear, and repeat. There are worse ways to spend an afternoon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jared Petty is a former IGN editor who likes writing about how wonderful and silly video games are.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-breakout-success-is-kicking-up-tired-arguments-over-turn-based-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the topics in constant rotation in role-playing discussions and forums, few have come up as often as turn-based games. The classic gameplay style of many RPGs has contended with more action-oriented systems for some time, and now Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is restarting discussion over the direction of some genre titans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 went live last week and is, by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">both IGN's</a> and <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/18026/clair-obscur-expedition-33" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many other accounts</a>, an excellent RPG. It is unabashedly clear about its inspirations. There's a turn order, Pictos to equip and master, zoned-out "dungeons" to crawl, and even an overworld map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/17041-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-celebrating-turn-based-games-classic-rpg-influences-in-making-something-new" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RPGsite</a>, producer Francois Meurisse said Clair Obscur was conceived as a turn-based game from the start, and pointed to Final Fantasy VIII, IX, and X in particular. Of course, there's also Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which is where Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's turn-based action takes after both FromSoftware's games and the likes of Mario &amp; Luigi: using quick-time events on attacks, and parrying / dodging on defense.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is a turn-based game that feels like a traditional turn-based game when you're inputting attacks and crafting your strategy each turn, then like a more action-oriented game when you're doing damage or defending against it. It's a fascinating system that has, predictably, stirred up discourse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Namely, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/expedition-33s-sublime-success-sparks-chatter-about-final-fantasys-future" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media users have taken the opportunity</a> to point out Clair Obscur's success as a counter-argument to long-held grudges over positions on turn-based games; namely, from the Final Fantasy series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An easy example: Naoki Yoshida, while on the media tour for Final Fantasy XVI, talked about why Final Fantasy and RPGs have taken on more action-based mechanics over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’m from a generation that grew up with command and turn-based RPGs," Yoshida told Famitsu (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/final-fantasy-16-ditched-turn-based-combat-to-appeal-to-younger-generations-producer-says/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>). “I think I understand how interesting and immersive it can be. On the other hand, for the past decade or so, I’ve seen quite a number of opinions saying 'I don’t understand the attraction of selecting commands in video games.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This opinion is only increasing, particularly with younger audiences who do not typically play RPGs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This thinking is reflected in the series, as Final Fantasy XV, XVI, and the VII remake series have all opted for more action-driven systems. Each has garnered their own share of fans and detractors.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And comments about turn-based games, and whether they connect with players, often come up in those moments. It's easy to see how stalwarts might read Yoshida's comments and hold a grudge, and now feel vindicated by Clair Obscur's status as the hottest game on the block. Here is a turn-based RPG, inspired by the greats, wearing its inspirations on its sleeve, and thriving.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Any truth is, as always, a little more nuanced than just that. It's certainly a little more nuanced than just, "Final Fantasy should do this."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, Square Enix might have seen its Final Fantasy series head in a more action-oriented direction, but it certainly hasn't dumped turn-based games wholesale. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/octopath-traveler-ii">Octopath Traveler 2</a> was, in this writer's opinion, one of the better role-playing games in the last few years, and the publisher has continued to roll out more turn-based RPGs, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/saga-emerald-beyond">SaGa Emerald Beyond</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">upcoming Bravely Default remaster</a> for Switch 2. While Final Fantasy may not be as turn-based as its SNES or PlayStation 1 days, it's not like Square has done away with the format.</p><div id="best-mainline-final-fantasy-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3><h3>Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And if the question is whether Final Fantasy should imitate Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, or whether this is "Final Fantasy if it was good" or not, well, <a href="https://x.com/GenePark/status/1915893483061055725" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I'd have to agree with everyone</a> replying with a resolute "nope." Final Fantasy has its own aesthetic drives and iconography that a simple "replace X with Y" can't really account for. While some comparisons between Clair Obscur and Final Fantasy are obvious, it's also easy to note the differences. Reducing Clair Obscur down to "Final France-tasy" is fun wordplay, but it does a disservice to both what's made Final Fantasy an enduring series, and what Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has done to elevate itself above mere imitation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is, funny enough, not the first time we've done this. Those with some tingling soreness in their lower backs <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/i2v43i/lost_odyssey_was_the_true_final_fantasy_successor/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">might recall discussions about Lost Odyssey</a> and whether it was the "true" successor to Final Fantasy, over the series' direction going into Final Fantasy XIII. Go back even further, and you can probably dig up conversations about whether Final Fantasy VII is truly better than Final Fantasy VI or not. As long as there have been two Final Fantasy fans on the internet, there have been arguments about Final Fantasy on the internet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">None of this is accounting for sales either, which were a driver for Yoshida's aforementioned comments to Famitsu on Final Fantasy XVI's direction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As I said, I believe I know the fun of command system RPGs, and I want to continue developing them, but I thought about the expected sales of Final Fantasy XVI and the impact that we have to deliver," said Yoshida. The Final Fantasy XVI producer did not even rule out the possibility that the next Final Fantasy could use a command system; just that, at the time of the studio making it, Final Fantasy XVI was going to be the game it became.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's an interesting point to watch, as time goes on. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has certainly been a breakout success for Sandfall Interactive and Kepler, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hit-rpg-clair-obscur-expedition-33-tops-1-million-sales-in-just-3-days">garnering 1 million sales over three days</a>. It's a strong start, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-16-and-7-rebirth-profits-did-not-meet-our-expectations">Square Enix's expectations for Final Fantasy are usually a bit higher</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most tired part, still worth noting, is the idea that turn-based games might struggle to see success. We have seen breakout hits in the space; notably, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>. While it's easy to point at the tip of the iceberg to make a point, it is worth noting that we've seen these RPGs — which each take after classic role-playing elements in their own way — have garnered both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2023-winners-the-full-list">acclaim</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-has-already-sold-1-million-copies-and-its-only-been-out-a-day">financial success</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, ultimately, Clair Obscur's success means a lot for the team behind it. It's an encouraging project that, even as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we get into discussions on its team size</a> compared to what you expect, feels like a return of the scoped, scaled, mid-budget RPG alongside the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/visions-of-mana">Visions of Mana</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ruined-kings-a-league-of-legends-story">Ruined King</a>. Whether its momentum carries it on higher, to the heights of something like a Baldur's Gate 3 or Disco Elysium, is yet to be seen, but you can't ask for a better start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for whether it signals some radical shift is necessary for Final Fantasy, I'm less confident. While Square Enix has said recent entries like Final Fantasy XVI and FF7 Rebirth's profits <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-16-and-7-rebirth-profits-did-not-meet-our-expectations">did not meet expectations</a>, that feels like a struggle shaped as much by broad shifts in the gaming landscape, as the cost of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/major-publishers-report-aaa-franchises-can-cost-over-a-billion-to-make">making major entries in huge franchises has not been a cheap endeavor</a>. They're taking a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-victim-long-development-time-playstation">long time to make</a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If anything, the lesson to take away is to be unapologetically authentic. Projects that imitate can struggle to break out from the shadows. It's why I stressed earlier that for all the ways Clair Obscur wears its inspirations on its sleeve, it's not wholly defined by its predecessors; its clever combat systems, incredible soundtrack, thoughtful world-building and scene direction all come from within, from the studio's drives. To put it better, here's Larian CEO Swen Vincke, recently discussing the "single-player games are dead" discourse that also pops up quite often:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think we've proven with [Baldur's Gate 3] that you can put in a pretty high budget and expect pretty high results," Vincke told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9ss" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameSpot</a>. As Vincke has stated several times over, you just have to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boss-of-baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-says-single-player-games-arent-dead-they-just-have-to-be-good">make a good game</a>, one that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-reveals-what-he-wanted-to-say-at-the-game-awards-2023">your creative team is excited to make</a>. That seems like a constructive way forward for everyone, and one that doesn't feel like reheating the leftovers of old internet discourse all over again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tejo-valorants-newest-agent-has-been-revealed/">Valorant</a> is set to celebrate its five-year anniversary on June 2, 2025, which is why a key focus to Act III will be celebrating the game's biggest moments in the last five years.</p>
<p>Act III and the new battle pass will be live tomorrow, April 30, 2025, featuring a special series of anniversary cards that are meant to highlight Valorant's history, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">5 Years: Duelists Card</span></li>
<li><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">5 Years: Cypher's Revenge Card</span></li>
<li><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">5 Years: Can't Slow Me Down Card</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Riot's lead for Valorant, <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/">Anna Donlon</a>, spoke about the changes the game has gone through in the last five years and the state of the world when Riot first started to launch Valorant and get players into the game.</p>
<p>She also talked about how the Valorant team at Riot is working to fix some of the longstanding issues the game has faced in the last five years, and that more information regarding those fixes will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if those fixes result in any major changes for the game. Some live service games, like Apex Legends, have been through tumultuous changes in recent years as Respawn has tried to satisfy a player base that was growing increasingly unsatisfied with the state of the game. Those same big swings might not happen here, but the potential is there, as Donlon specifically calls out balancing abilities, which could have a huge impact for a hero shooter.</p>

This is according to a video posted by Randy Pitchford, CEO of<em> Borderlands</em> developer Gearbox Interactive, that was ironically deleted and reposted because it went up too early.</p><p>“I wanted to be the one to tell you the launch date is changing,” Pitchford said in the video. He reassured players that development was going well, in fact, so well that it was determined the game should be released earlier. But when the news was announced (officially at 11AM) gamers and press immediately started speculating that the bumped up release date has nothing to do with how well development is going. Instead, Gearbox may be simply trying to get <em>Borderlands 4 </em>in as many hands as it can before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23987993/gta-6-news-trailers-rockstar-games"><em>GTA VI</em> </a>tears a big ole’ hole in the video game market.</p><p><em>GTA VI</em> doesn’t have a set release date yet, and we’ve only been given <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">the nebulous timing of Fall 2025</a>. Well, September is technically fall in the US, and big AAA games like<em> Borderlands </em>don’t move up their release dates on a whim. Given that<em> GTA VI </em>and <em>Borderlands 4</em> share a publisher in Take-Two Interactive, it seems even more likely that the new release date is merely getting out of the way of a late September launch window for<em> GTA VI.</em> </p><p>However, if what you want is more info on <em>Borderlands 4</em>, Pitchford closed his video by sharing that Sony will present <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/29/watch-the-borderlands-4-gameplay-deep-dive-state-of-play-on-april-30/"> a 20-minute State of Play presentation</a> on April 30th at 2PM PT/ 5PM ET.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of the quieter, more recent trends I've been enjoying is goofy extraction games. Whether <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> is directly responsible for that trend, or everyone that spent countless hours playing games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead-2">Left 4 Dead 2</a> as teenagers just kind of all ended up taking similar interpretations, I couldn't tell you. But I'm quite fond of games like it and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a>, and obviously even more recently there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/repo">Repo</a> added to the list, horrendous key art notwithstanding. Now, as revealed in a new trailer, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mycopunk">Mycopunk</a>, another one of those kinds of games where you're a robot nobody wanted.
</p>

<p>
As a rejected robot, you are hired by a corporation to head down onto a planet full of fungus that very much wants to kill you. This fungus has taken over the planet, which could be a natural disaster if you believe said corporation, or there could be something else going on (I'm betting on the latter). Throughout all of this, you have to collect up resources to bring back with you, survive against hordes of fungi, and update and improve your robot to be better equipped for future missions.

There's even a space motel you can hang out in between missions, complete with alien cockroach person Roachard Cox, who talks exactly like a commentator at a horse race in the American south. This hangoutability is what really sells me on this almost micro-genre of games, and as dirty and grimey as Mycopunk looks, I'm into the vibes it's putting out.

Mycopunk doesn't have a release date just yet, but it does actually have a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3247750/Mycopunk/">demo you can check out on Steam right now</a>.

With a bevy of cars to find and drive, an absolutely killer soundtrack, and an endlessly replayable online component, there’s no shortage of fun to be had in this exciting entry in the beloved racing franchise. But if you’re curious about the game’s overall length as a PlayStation gamer, here’s how long it takes to beat <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195371" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="109" data-playlist="195371,195840,196163" data-current="195371"><div><p>Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20829.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h982"><a id=""></a>How long will it take you to finish <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>?</h2><p>There are so many things vying for your attention between <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>'s main races that it’s hard to say exactly how long it’ll take each person to beat the base campaign. But <strong>if you’re just looking to mainline the core experience, expect to spend about 20 hours</strong> <strong>doing so</strong>.</p><p>There’s simply so much to do in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, though, that <strong>dedicated players can easily squeeze 50-100 hours out of the game</strong> finding every car, completing all side races and stories, and smashing through every billboard. </p><p>Trophy and achievement hunters might stretch things even further in their effort to max out the game, as they’ll have to engage in some additional tasks that aren’t necessary for in-game completion, such as taking unique pictures, winning online races, and more.</p><p>Of course, if you’re looking for even more adventures through Mexico, <strong>you can score another combined 20-30 hours of fun out of the game’s <em>Rally Adventure</em> and <em>Hot Wheels</em> expansions</strong>. They’ll need to be purchased separately or as part of the Premium Edition of the game. But given the size and scope of them, they’re certainly worthwhile add-ons for racing enthusiasts.</p><p>And it goes without saying that the online component of <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> ensures that social gamers can continue enjoying the game well after they’ve crossed everything off the map. If you ever see my Drivatar driving around out there, though, please don’t make fun of me. I know I suck. I cry myself to sleep about it every night, you know.</p><hr><p><em>Forza Horizon 5</em> is available on Xbox Series X/S, Windows PCs, and is coming to PS5 in Spring 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-an-earlier-release-date-as-accidentally-revealed-by-randy-pitchford<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>First-person "comedy" shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> will be released sooner than previously expected, according to a video accidentally tweeted too early by Randy Pitchford. The original date of September 23rd is being shifted in some sort of bizarre anti-delay. "Everything is going kinda the best case scenario," says the Gearbox CEO, "and so the launch date for Borderlands 4 is changing. We're moving it forward." </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The new date is September 12th, said Pitchford in the video, and there's going to be more of the looter shooter on show during the upcoming PlayStation State of Play. But Pitchford posted the video early by accident, it seems, quickly deleting it as soon as he realised his error. A follow-up post reads: "Oops - time zones… Reposting momentarily". But it's too late, Randy, the news is out. The video was saved and reposted by other users. Noted industry rumourmonger Wario64 has <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1917223361622508015">a copy</a>, if you'd like to watch a studio executive do a weirdly breathless piece to camera. </p>
<p>Despite the Gearbox boss' excitement in this video, and his assurances that the team are "cooking", the date change may not simply be down to speedy development and executive confidence. When extraction shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>  recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-is-real-looks-ridiculously-stylish-has-a-release-date-and-is-getting-a-closed-alpha-this-month">announced their release date</a> too, Bungie did an interesting thing: they chose the same day as Borderlands 4 had already planned: September 23rd. </p>
<p>In business terms, it might seem weird to place yourself aggressively next to another shooter in autumn, but there is a weird logic to it if you step back. Borderlands 4 is published by Take-Two, and that previous release date was the one day Bungie and Sony could reasonably guess would be spaced far away from the release date for Take-Two's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-borderlands-4-release-date-gives-us-a-clue-about-grand-theft-auto-6s-arrival">other big hitter</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. They were essentially stepping into the elevator with a gassy teenager to avoid the other elevator coming down that <em>might</em> contain the obnoxious startup bro. Or at least this is what it looks like through my fun speculation specs. Who knows, it could all just be coincidence. </p>
<p>I don't know if any more release date chicken will continue now that Borderlands 4 has shifted its weight slightly to the left and disappeared in a green cloud of farts, but we'll see what happens.

I gave them plenty of chances.</p><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> endlessly defies what you expect it to be about. Sandfall Interactive’s favorite thing, other than making you sad with one of the most gut-wrenching RPG premises it could concoct, is twisting the knife and showing you nothing is as you believed. The game starts with the titular expedition group journeying beyond their island home in Lumière to defeat a god-like entity called the Paintress. Every year, she paints a number on a monolith visible from the island, and anyone of that age is “gommaged” from the world, disappearing in a cloud of petals. The knowledge that lives have a guaranteed expiration date has shaped the culture of this world. When people approach their final year, they join an expedition to hopefully stop the Paintress, or at least lay down the foundation for the next expedition to succeed. This has been going on for decades, and time is running out for the citizens of Lumière as the Paintress etches a “33” on the monolith. That’s where <em>Clair Obscur </em>starts, but I couldn’t have anticipated where it would end.</p><p>All three of <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s acts are punctuated with a game-shifting turn. At the end of the first act, Gustave, the grieving swordsman and gunslinger protagonist, is killed in cold blood. An incomprehensively old man named Renoir, who has somehow survived in a world where the life expectancy dwindles each year, is protecting the Paintress, and to do that, he kills your main character! The reins of this expedition are then handed to Verso, a man who is revealed to be the son of Renoir.. But this family drama goes far beyond a son trying to stop his father from killing expeditioners, and the consequences of this shift the entire world of <em>Clair Obscur </em>on its axis.</p><figure id="" data-id="2fedee88c865b45d2497d683e30fdce5" data-recommend-id="image://2fedee88c865b45d2497d683e30fdce5" data-format="jpg" data-width="3839" data-height="1599" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2fedee88c865b45d2497d683e30fdce5" data-recommend-id="image://2fedee88c865b45d2497d683e30fdce5" data-format="jpg" data-width="3839" data-height="1599" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ever more layers to this universe are revealed, and by the end of Act II, the scope widens to show you just how much bigger this tale is than the opening gambit of an expedition to stop the Paintress. It turns out the Paintress isn’t quite a god, but a woman who uses her family’s magic to “paint” worlds onto canvases that can bring whatever’s painted on them to life. She, her husband, and her children all wield this power and have created and explored different worlds inside these canvases throughout their lifetimes. This world, the one the expedition is trying to save, is the lone creation of the Paintress’ son, who died in a fire that left his sister scarred and the family broken. This world is all she has left of her son, and her unrelenting need to preserve it is consuming her.</p><p>Meanwhile, her husband (the real Renoir, on whom the fictional man who has been killing expeditioners is based) is trying to destroy this canvas so his family can try to move on. He wants his wife to be set free from this magical world of their son’s imagination, in which she is losing herself. The numbers the Paintress brushes on the monolith aren’t a signifier of the people she’s Thanos-snapping out of existence, but a warning that her power to defend the general populace is waning, and that as she loses her strength in this decades-long battle with her husband to preserve her son’s memory, the eldest among them will be the next to disappear.</p><p>This twist has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/review/563522/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-ps5-pc-xbox&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/review/563522/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-ps5-pc-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">understandably divisive</a></span>. Any time a story presents itself as one thing and reveals itself to be something else entirely, you run the risk of losing people brought in by the initial premise. However, I’m glad to report that at this point, I was more on board than ever. I’d already been locked in by <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s meditations on grieving a life you know you’ll never get to live. Grief is a cultural touchstone of this universe, and to find that it was all born of a mother’s loss of her child was an incredible new lens through which to view it. It’s revealed that all of this loss was not inevitable, and that the expedition’s fictional nature means that if they defeat Renoir and put an end to his gommage, they could potentially bring back everyone they lost. This adds new layers of nuance about how we keep someone’s memory alive when they’re gone, and how a creative work, even if it’s mostly a child’s fantasy, is one way to remember those we’ve lost. But again, this is <em>Clair Obscur</em>, and it always has another devastating trick up its sleeve.</p><p>The game’s final act lets you head right for the point of no return, to face Renoir, loosen his grip on this world, and bring back all the people he has gommaged over the past 67 years. By this point, you’ve learned that Verso is the fictional facsimile of the Paintress’ dead son. You’ve also found out that another of your party members, Maelle, is the Paintress’ real-life daughter, who entered the painting to find her missing parents, and instead found a new life in which she’s no longer debilitated by the damage from the fire. Verso now wants to tear down the canvas, so he can stop living as a puppet propping up his family’s memory of a son and brother long gone. However, Maelle wants to bring everyone back and live out her life in her brother’s creation. So it’s up to you, the player, to choose who to play as in one final battle and determine the fate of Verso’s canvas.</p><figure id="" data-id="4234e4cc7fef370f76ed405d0d32872d" data-recommend-id="image://4234e4cc7fef370f76ed405d0d32872d" data-format="jpg" data-width="3836" data-height="1599" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle and Verso face each other in front of a distorted painting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maelle and Verso face each other in front of a distorted painting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4234e4cc7fef370f76ed405d0d32872d" data-recommend-id="image://4234e4cc7fef370f76ed405d0d32872d" data-format="jpg" data-width="3836" data-height="1599" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle and Verso face each other in front of a distorted painting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This was a decision so agonizing I had to put down my controller and make food, so I could give it proper thought. I was swayed to Verso’s side, until I returned and picked up the controller, when somehow my instincts took over, and I played as Maelle. Only, the ending I picked wasn’t quite what I envisioned. Rather than a bittersweet moment of Maelle bringing back all her brother’s creations and living happily ever after, what I experienced was more of a horror story. In this scenario, Maelle had trapped Verso in this world, forcing him to play piano for her and the rest of the revived Lumière.</p><p>I hadn’t perceived the game as setting up Maelle’s wishes to be a selfish path. I’d bought into the idea that saving the canvas and Verso’s memory was a noble choice worthy of the themes <em>Clair Obscur </em>had been operating within. But maybe that was me getting swept away by an idealistic view of this entire conflict. One of the only things that’s just as embedded in <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s DNA as grief is misdirection.</p><p>It’s been a few days since I finished <em>Clair Obscur</em>. I’ve been talking with others who have finished the game, and we’re all wrestling with the same questions of whether or not Sandfall Interactive truly stuck the landing. There are throughlines of grief in every new path it takes, but as the game shifts its themes, what it has to say about the process, the good and bad ways we deal with grief, and who was actually “right” in the surprising metatexual conflict, seems to shift as quickly as its inconsistent dodging windows. I’ve chewed on every possibility for days now, and part of me wonders if that dissatisfaction is just part of the process.</p><figure id="" data-id="2ac0c160fdec88b332781dedad592424" data-recommend-id="image://2ac0c160fdec88b332781dedad592424" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle with distortion across her face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maelle with distortion across her face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2ac0c160fdec88b332781dedad592424" data-recommend-id="image://2ac0c160fdec88b332781dedad592424" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle with distortion across her face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Maybe I’m grieving the happy ending I thought I was fighting for. Perhaps, after all the death and despair I saw in <em>Clair Obscur</em>, it was foolish to have been looking for one in the first place. Grief isn’t just mourning the loss of a person, it’s lamenting a life you imagined you’d have. Sometimes I wonder if coming out of the grieving process is in fact delusion. We have to explain to ourselves how something as senseless as death has meaning, or reassure one another that we’ll see those we’ve lost in whatever comes next. We tell ourselves whatever is necessary in order to feel somewhat okay again, even if it doesn’t quite make sense. But no matter how we bandage the wound, grief never entirely goes away. We just come up with whatever explanation helps us go on about our day. I feel like that’s where I’m at with <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. I’ve decided that its ending, my dissatisfaction with parts of it, and all the ways the conclusion subverted what I hoped for, was probably the point. I can stay in the denial phase a little bit longer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Borderlands 4's release date is changing.</p>
<p>A video shared and then removed by Gearbox's Randy Pitchford revealed that the game - originally slated for release on 23rd September - will now launch a tad earlier, on 12th September.</p>
<p>"Holy, holy, what? This never happens," Pitchford said in the video. So, why is it happening at all? Well, Pitchford says things are simply going very smoothly on the development side of things, but call me Clouseau, I reckon it could also be to do with a little game you may have heard of: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>.</p>

<p>GTA 6 still lacks a release date, of course, but since Borderlands is published by 2K the company likely has a better idea of when GTA 6 will arrive than the rest of us, thanks to 2K also being part of Take-Two, the shared  parent company of Rockstar.</p>
<p>Take-Two and Rockstar are yet to announce a firm release date for GTA 6, easily one of the most anticipated games right now, but has said it will debut some time this autumn. As of February this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">the companies remain confident of that release window</a>, and it seems more than likely that Gearbox and 2K won't want Borderlands 4 being in any direct release date competition with GTA 6 when the time comes. Others are already saying the same thing. In February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">EA CEO Andrew Wilson confirmed the publisher would be willing to delay its next Battlefield</a> - currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">expected to release before April 2026</a> - if "some things happening in the year" meant that "wasn't a great window for us". So, that'll be GTA 6.</p>
<p>So, given all this, could we be getting GTA 6 at the end of September or early October? That would be around the time Borderlands 4 was initially set for release. I mean, I obviously can't say for certain, but it's a theory.</p>
<p>As I've been writing all this, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/29/watch-the-borderlands-4-gameplay-deep-dive-state-of-play-on-april-30/">Sony has announced a Borderlands 4-focused State of Play</a>, set for 30th April (that's tomorrow) so, tune in with us to find out more. </p> <div>

<p>In March, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick revealed<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-date-is-still-secret-because-take-two-boss-wants-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-excitement"> why the publisher was keeping Grand Theft Auto 6's release date such a closely guarded secret</a>, saying it prefers to "maintain the anticipation and excitement".</p>
<p>As for Borderlands 4, it's set to be released across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-is-bringing-borderlands-4-to-steam-as-pitchford-admits-hopes-for-epic-were-misplaced">Steam and the Epic Games Store at the same time</a>). </p>
<p>Borderlands 4 will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-borderlands-4-featuring-a-brand-new-planet-and-four-new-vault-hunters">introduce four new Vault Hunters</a> on its release, alongside a new horde known as the Rippers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Borderlands 4 will launch two weeks earlier than originally announced, Gearbox Software's Randy Pitchford confirmed today.</p>
<p>In a now-deleted video, which was saved and shared again on X by <a href="https://x.com/Wario64">Wario64</a>, Gearbox's CEO confirmed that the game's development is going incredibly well, so much so that it will now be released on September 12th instead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-to-release-on-september-23rd-on-pc-and-consoles-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">September 23rd</a>. Randy Pitchford added at the end of the video that the previously announced State of Play presentation focused on the game is also coming "imminently," so an official announcement shouldn't be too far away. [<strong>UPDATE</strong> - The State of Play presentation will air tomorrow, April 30th, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">(Randy Pitchford jumpscare) Borderlands 4 is moving its release date up to September 12th (though he deleted this video/post because it went up too early apparently) <a href="https://t.co/ILuijVDcaL">pic.twitter.com/ILuijVDcaL</a></p>
<p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1917223361622508015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While the news of Borderlands 4 launching earlier than anticipated is, by itself, excellent news, it is also great news for Grand Theft Auto VI. Publisher Take-Two Interactive previously confirmed that the sixth entry in the Rockstar Games series would launch after Gearbox Software's game, so there's a good chance Borderlands 4's release date has been moved forward in preparation for the Fall 2024 launch of what is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated games of all time. If this is the case, there's a very good chance that another Grand Theft Auto VI trailer will be shown soon, though a former Rockstar Games developer thinks <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-to-release-on-september-23rd-on-pc-and-consoles-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">it wouldn't be necessary</a>, as the surprise factor could make the game's release even more successful.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on September 12th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-open-beta-kicks-off-in-may.1176441/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-open-beta-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced that the open beta for portal-based first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will be starting next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release, you'll be able to head into the world of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>on May 22nd, and the beta will be available across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, with full crossplay also being enabled between all three platforms.</p>

<p>There's no time period listed in the press release, which seems to indicate that the open beta for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will be closer in spirit to an Early Access release rather than a limited-time stress test.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-2-open-beta-date-portal-shooting.jpg?itok=YfTfEvrY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-2-open-beta-date-portal-shooting.jpg?itok=4WUwVmb2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to try out&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>on May 22nd.</figcaption></figure><p>Tons of stuff will be available for you to try out when&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s open beta lands in May. You'll have access to over 15 maps, including "two new massive 24-player Onslaught maps" in the form of Drought and Fracture.</p>

<p>Over 25 weapons will be available for you to try out, including&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s new Borealis energy carbine, and 10-plus modes will be available at launch as well, including the "fan favorite" Takedown mode.</p>

<p>Rather tantalizingly, 1047 also says&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will feature something called "infinite" maps, over footage of what looks rather like a level editor, so perhaps you'll be able to make your own mind-bending portal levels as well.</p>

<p>It's all accompanied by a rather brief, but nonetheless exciting, teaser trailer that shows off some of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s frantic action. You can check out that (admittedly very short) trailer right here.</p>




<p>First announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-announced" rel="nofollow">in July last year</a>, <i>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</i>is the sequel to 2022's&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>. Developer 1047 Games is putting all of its eggs into the sequel's basket, too; at the same time that it announced the sequel, the studio also revealed it would cease future development on the original game.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s open beta when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate-2/9pf5q1b0fhsl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> on May 22nd.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-release-date-apparently-moving-forward-per-randy-pitchford.1176438/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-forward-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>might be coming out sooner than you think, if a now-deleted post on X by Gearbox head honcho Randy Pitchford is anything to go by.</p>

<p>The post, which was <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1917223361622508015" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">handily salvaged</a> by Wario64, shows Pitchford excitedly claiming that development on&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is going great; in fact, he says that where the team is at with the game right now is "the best-case scenario".</p>

<p>As a result, Pitchford says the&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>release date is being moved forward to September 12th. He also reiterates that there will be a&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>-focused PlayStation State of Play show "imminently", with PlayStation subsequently <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/29/watch-the-borderlands-4-gameplay-deep-dive-state-of-play-on-april-30/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirming that show for tomorrow</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-up-shooting.jpg?itok=UmCwTRJP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-up-shooting.jpg?itok=wcEW7tx0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is coming sooner than you think.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, Pitchford is framing&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s sooner release as a positive for Gearbox, but it's equally likely that the team has moved the release date forward to avoid clashing with some big games that are due out this fall.</p>

<p>There's Sony's&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">due to arrive on PS5 in October</a>, as is Paradox and The Chinese Room's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">long-awaited&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>&nbsp;</em>(at time of writing, at least).</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest elephant in the room, however, is&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, which Rockstar (and Gearbox) parent company Take-Two says is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall" rel="nofollow">still on track to arrive sometime this fall</a>. No release date has been revealed yet, of course, but it is possible&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>was moved to avoid clashing with&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>, it's the fourth mainline entry in the&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>series (although not the fourth overall, thanks to the existence of games like&nbsp;<em>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel</em>).</p>

<p>The game features four all-new Vault Hunters with new abilities and skills to master, plus lots and lots of new weapons to collect. According to its narrative director,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director" rel="nofollow">feature less "toilet humor"</a> than its predecessors.</p>

<p>Assuming Pitchford's deleted post was accurate,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will launch on September 12th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also coming to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Borderlands-4-2792057.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>

And because both games are published by companies owned by Take-Two Interactive (Rockstar Games and 2K), that meant a lot of people (myself included) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006">speculated that the original late September release was picked to avoid <em>GTA 6</em>'s rumored October launch</a></span> as much as possible while still giving Gearbox plenty of runway to finish their game. </p><p>Now that <em>Borderlands 4</em> is launching <em>earlier</em>, what does that mean for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/dice-cards-ruler-earthbound-vivrato&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/dice-cards-ruler-earthbound-vivrato" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GTA 6</em></a></span>? It’s possible that it means nothing. It could be that <em>GTA 6</em>'s internal date is still the same and Gearbox is just shipping its game a bit earlier because its development is going so smoothly that they can afford to do that. It’s also possible <em>GTA 6</em>'s release date has moved up and that has forced Take-Two to push other games up, too, in order to avoid <em>GTA 6</em>. </p><p>I’ll be curious to see if <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-old-country-release-date-revealed-steam/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-old-country-release-date-revealed-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set to launch in late August</a></span>, stays there or if it also gets moved up. Or potentially even gets delayed until after <em>GTA 6, </em>though that seems like it would be a death sentence for <em>Mafia</em>, as it’s likely to be, similar to past entries, a crime-focused open-world action game directly competing with <em>GTA 6</em>. In any case, things are getting interesting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
