<p>There‚Äôs a new teaser available online that showcases the impending Fortnite x Fallout crossover coming to the popular battle royale game next season. It lasts just two seconds and reveals exactly how this integration will work, with a squad of Brotherhood of Steel members in T-60 Power Armor suits walking across a battlefield with an array of weapons.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-they-re-little">But They‚Äôre Little</h2>



<p>My biggest gripe with the uber-short teaser trailer is that it shows the characters in the T-60 Power Armor to be far too small. There‚Äôs something impressive and daunting about a suit of Power Armor, one of the most recognisable elements from the Fallout franchise, but Fortnite (understandably) slims them down for this collaboration.</p>



<p>In the two-second trailer (below), we see five suits of Power Armor, all of which boast a unique aesthetic. It‚Äôs hard to see at first blush, but it looks as though there are no custom weapon skins ‚Äì or weapons ‚Äì to celebrate the crossover event. It‚Äôs just the Power Armor skins.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>More may be revealed soon as the new season comes closer ‚Äì there‚Äôs no way this crossover event is restricted to a two-second teaser trailer, especially given the recent success and popularity of the Fallout franchise in general.</p>



<p>We‚Äôll report more when we know it.</p>

<p>According to claims in a new report <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/days-of-play-2024-les-promotions-playstation-arriveraient-tres-bientot-51203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Dealabs</a>, Sony is planning another Days of Play event for May 29, 2024, and will ‚Äúlast until June 12, 2024.‚Äù The event does usually last about that long.</p>



<p>Reliable leaker billbil-kun also mentioned details about the potential offers coming to the new Days of Play. They expect the likely return of a PS Plus promotion across multiple tiers, possibly repeating the same discount from last year.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>üö® UPCOMING EVENT üö®</p><p>Here is when we think Days of Play 2024 event from Sony should start</p><p>You can find also a preview of expected promotional offers that should hit local retailers &amp; PlayStation Direct<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlayStation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PlayStation</a> <a href="https://t.co/wgdnWpcqOL">https://t.co/wgdnWpcqOL</a></p></div>‚Äî billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1793240436514967605?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Dealabs further claims that ‚ÄúPS5, PlayStation VR2 consoles as well as DualSense‚Äù will be among the hardware sales. The report projects some of the pricing in Europe, such as DualSense Controllers being available for 49.99 euros. </p>



<p>Last week, Sony released a financial report confirming that PlayStation 5 sales <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-sales-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped 29% YoY</a>. Further, Sony even expects console sales to continue declining.</p>



<p>Dealabs could not confirm many games coming to Sony‚Äôs Days of Play event. However, it did mention the event should feature God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn for just 9.99 euros.</p>



<p>Fans are currently waiting for Sony to announce a God of War PC version. Fortunately, Dealabs also made claims earlier this month suggesting that something official is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-announcement-coming-soon-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming this month</a>. It could very well appear at the rumored PlayStation showcase expected in May 2024.</p>



<p>Dealabs has successfully leaked a variety of previous announcements and details, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-death-stranding-2-news-imminent-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2 announcements</a> in January.</p>



<p>At this time, Sony has not officially confirmed anything regarding the new Days of Play event or promotions.</p>

        <p>Company founder Johan Pilestedt remains chief creative officer and chairman</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>Arrowhead Games Studios has named Shams Jorjani as its new CEO, replacing company founder Johan Pilestedt in the role.</p>
<p>Pilestedt will remain chief creative officer and chairman. The move follows the smash hit success of Helldivers 2, which has <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-full-year-revenues-rise-to-275-billion-but-narrowly-misses-ps5-sales-target">sold 12 million copies since it launched on PS5 and PC in February.</a></p>
<p>Jorjani is a games business veteran and spent 12 years in senior leadership roles at Paradox Interactive. He‚Äôs also served as chairman of indie publisher Hooded Horse, and acts as a senior adviser for various games businesses.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, Pilestedt explains that hiring a dedicated CEO will give him more time to focus on his love for game creation, while giving the company the structure and leadership it needs.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about the journey ahead for Arrowhead, the future games we‚Äôre going to be making, and running the organisation beyond the 120 or so developers we have currently,‚Äù he tells us. ‚ÄúI realised that running an organisation of over 100 people to however large it is going to get‚Ä¶ it means I will [have to choose] between deepening my love for game creation, or the business track.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOver the last year going to launch of Helldivers 2, I‚Äôve been pulled more towards the business side of things, and not able to focus as much on the creative side. That made me realise I needed to make some decisions, both for the success of the business but also myself.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo I reached out to Shams. We had a lunch, and we asked him that if I was to reconsider running Arrowhead for the next decade, and I needed to hire a new CEO, would he be interested?</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter some contemplation and deep anxiety on how things are going to pan out, I finally came to the proper conclusion that I will have to follow my heart. It‚Äôs not only right for me, but it‚Äôs also right for the organisation. Having a reluctant CEO is not something that will turn out that well, I think.‚Äù</p>
<p>Jorjani adds: ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre talking to creatives like Johan, it‚Äôs not like he wants to retire. Helldivers 2 isn‚Äôt the highlight of his career. Hopefully it‚Äôs the fourth best game he ever makes. So the question is how do we set Johan and the team up to get to that in a more consistent manner, rather than skill plus luck plus happenstance‚Ä¶ all the things that led us here.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôll be bringing to the table is organisation and leadership. What I did at Paradox, where I joined as the 23rd person and then helped grow the company into the behemoth it was‚Ä¶ it was about organisation, leadership and business focus. It‚Äôs a lot of the, frankly, boring business administration stuff that is a necessary part of running a company, which is hard to do when you‚Äôre also juggling the chairman‚Äôs hat and the creative director‚Äôs hat and also being the one who is in the trenches doing a lot of the designing that Johan has been doing over the years.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBethesda has Todd Howard, Kojima Productions has Kojima, Remedy has Sam Lake‚Ä¶ but when you ask who is running these companies, who is the CEO or managing director‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt name the humble servant [laughs] behind the scenes.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs the set-up. How do we enable Johan to make more Helldivers, and what I bring is a structure around that.‚Äù</p>

            <p>Nobody expected the success of Helldivers 2.</p>
<p>The co-op third-person shooter, which was published by PlayStation and developed by Arrowhead Games, was released in February and has gone on to sell 12 million copies in three months. It is now PlayStation's fastest-selling game ‚Äì bigger than God of War, or Spider-Man or Uncharted.</p>
<p>"Depending on who you are, you‚Äôll always point to different things [as to why it was successful]," says Arrowhead's chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt. "If you‚Äôre a business exec at a major publisher, you‚Äôd say it is the live service element that keeps players coming back, and the cheaper price point. If you‚Äôre a game designer, you‚Äôll point to the systematic nature of the game. If you‚Äôre an artist, you‚Äôll talk about the day and night cycle, the destructible environments and the beautiful worlds. It‚Äôs the balance between all these elements.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Johan Pilestedt, Arrowhead</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"But speaking personally, I would say it‚Äôs the fact that we‚Äôre doing something with Helldivers that is outside of the inflection point that the games industry is heading towards. What you‚Äôre seeing through these cycles in the industry is people taking inspiration from each other, and building upon that. But that means people are building towards a single point, because you lose something through each iteration.</p>
<p>"With Helldivers, we made the strong decision that we‚Äôre not going to go with the status quo. We‚Äôre going to place ourselves outside of that by making a lot of mechanics that are generally not seen in games. We have friendly fire on, always. I think people are surprised that we make games this way. They‚Äôre surprised that the responsibility to not blow up your friends is on you."</p>
<p>For Pilestedt personally, the success of Helldivers 2 was the realisation of a dream he has had since he was eight years-old.</p>
<p>"I asked my dad ‚Äòhow do I make a video game company?‚Äô And he said ‚ÄòGet really good grades‚Äô. Of course, that was a lie," he laughs.</p>
<p>The problem with realising a dream (albeit a good problem), is working out what to do next.</p>
<blockquote>"We pride ourself on being an independent studio." <cite>Johan Pilestedt, Arrowhead</cite></blockquote>
<p>"Helldivers 2 put me into a strange mode of contemplation," he admits. "Because the problem with achieving such wild success, achieving your calling, is you have to choose your next chapter. It doesn‚Äôt come from within like knowing what you wanted to do since you were eight."</p>
<p>This led Pilestedt to Shams Jorjani. Jorjani's history with Arrowhead stretches back to the start. He was one of the organisers of the Swedish Game Awards, which Arrowhead won with its game Magicka. Jorjani then joined Paradox Interactive, which had just signed the game, and he was assigned to the project. He helped launch that and then Arrowhead's second (and significantly less successful) game, The Showdown Effect.</p>
<p>"We then had an intense negotiation over Magicka 2, which was finally resolved in an Icelandic hotel room overnight," Jorjani said. "Both of us were drunk at the time and we decided that ‚Äòno, we won‚Äôt do that project‚Äô."</p>
<p>But the two stayed in touch. And then in 2021, Jorjani left Paradox.</p>
<p>"I had a bit of ‚Äòbig company PTSD‚Äô," he continues. "Paradox was 800 people, ten studios in six countries and a public company. After leaving Paradox, I came to Johan and said ‚Äòlet‚Äôs do something together. We might end up killing each other, but we‚Äôll have fun‚Äô. And Johan, as wise as he is, told me to 'f off', because he had a game to ship."</p>
<p>That game was Helldivers 2. Eventually, Jorjani did start advising Arrowhead and then, with Helldivers 2 out the door,<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo"> Pilestedt asked him to become CEO.</a></p>
<p>The move means Jorjani will take over the day-to-day running of the business, allowing Pilestedt to focus on game creation.</p>
<p>"We were both at a stage where we‚Äôre wondering what‚Äôs next in our careers," Jorjani says. "And we realised we probably couldn‚Äôt quite get to those places if we didn‚Äôt have the other one to help us get there."</p>
<p>Pilestedt adds: "When it comes to the overall direction of the organisation, I am still the chairman. So me and Shams are still going to have strategic conversations on how are we going to take Arrowhead into the future."</p>
<p>Jorjani again: "My job is to enable him and the other creative people to be able to do more games. And that‚Äôs also what matters to the players. I play Helldivers and I hear my friends ask‚Ä¶ ‚Äòare we going to get more stuff?‚Äô And I‚Äôm like ‚Äòyes, soon, because Johan will have more time to do it‚Äô. ‚ÄòWe want more enemies!‚Äô I‚Äôll tell Johan."</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/helldivers2_Yk9zYyw.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Helldivers 2 is PlayStation's fastest selling game of all time</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Part of Jorjani's role will be to help Arrowhead navigate the impact of Helldivers 2's success. The firm was a successful developer already. The first Helldivers game sold four million copies, while Magicka was also a breakout hit. "They were all massive games in their genres," Pilestedt observes.</p>
<p>But Helldivers 2 is on a different level. And right from the start, the team has had to contend with a series of issues, beginning with "the servers burning to a crisp".</p>
<p>"We tried to fan that‚Ä¶ but you shouldn't fan flames," Pilestedt says. "I told people to not buy the game until we can manage the servers‚Ä¶ but that actually increased the amount of users, unfortunately."</p>
<p>Then there was the issue around adding the need to log-in to PlayStation Network to play the game, which resulted in a backlash from fans and Helldivers 2 becoming unavailable in certain markets. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-psn-log-in-requirement">Sony eventually backtracked on the requirement.</a></p>
<p>Plus, there are other general live-service issues, too, such as concerns around game balancing.</p>
<p>"This is something the organisation has seen before," Pilestedt tells us. "We had the horrible launch of Magicka, which was really buggy, and me and Shams recognised that we had to interact with the community, talk to them in an honest way, and tell them what‚Äôs going on as much as we could. And then take action immediately to resolve the issues. So we‚Äôve seen and been through it before, albeit at a much smaller scale. It is higher stakes this time."</p>
<blockquote>"The big difference is the amount of threats and rude behaviour that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community"<cite>Johan Pilestedt, Arrowhead</cite> </blockquote>
<p>He adds: "When we look at the challenge ahead of us, we feel like Frodo and Sam going towards Mordor. The oblivious approach of ‚Äòwe‚Äôll take one step at a time, and then we will solve the issues as they come‚Äô. The strength of Arrowhead is the camaraderie that we share amongst the team, and the desire to help each other. We know that whatever we‚Äôre going through, we‚Äôre there for each other and we will be able to take on any challenge, almost, and come out stronger on the other side."</p>
<p>Pilestedt says that the experience so far has been "extremely enjoyable and a little bit daunting". Helldivers was inspired by Dragons &amp; Demons (Sweden's answer to Dungeons &amp; Dragons), and the team has enjoyed playing the game master role with its community.</p>
<p>"Our game design is about transitioning our love for pen and paper RPGs into games that don‚Äôt necessarily have dice rolls and stats. A lot of these pen and paper sessions are based on a serious premise, which dissolves into farce. We‚Äôre seeing this with how the community interacts with Helldivers 2, but also how we interact with them."</p>
<p>But with 12 million fans, there's been some challenges with the community that the team hasn't experienced much before.</p>
<p>"The big difference now, which is horrifying, is the amount of threats and rude behaviour that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community," Pilestedt says. "That‚Äôs something new we have to deal with."</p>
<p>Pilestedt says that frustration is part of the essence of the Helldivers: "If you don't have those lows, you can't get those highs." And although this is something that is understood by more hardcore players, when you're reaching 12 million people, it's not something everyone is going to appreciate.</p>

<p>"Arrowhead‚Äôs philosophy has always been 'a game for everyone is a game for no-one'," Jorjani explains. "That is the company slogan. It‚Äôs how our games are designed. You can feel it in every feature. I think it‚Äôs one of the big reasons that Helldivers 2 has been so successful. It feels fresh because it does a lot of unpopular stuff.</p>
<p>"When you hit this big, much bigger than anyone thought ‚Äì Sony, us, everyone ‚Äì what happens is the game finds an audience outside of that niche fan group. So you get this amplification of different voices. Almost all games have a bit of toxicity in the community, but with these big numbers you just get so many, so we need to work with the community to get them to self-moderate, give people the tools to speak with each other in a positive fashion, so we can keep talking to the players openly. The more voices being added to the choir does add complexity."</p>
<blockquote><p>"We will see growth, but growth as a means to an ends, not as an end itself"</p><cite>Shams Jorjani, Arrowhead</cite></blockquote>
<p>He continues: "Valve is supposedly launching a new PVP game, and I am sure they‚Äôve put in hundreds, if not thousands of hours into how to handle toxic players, because they have that experience from DOTA and Counter-Strike. It‚Äôs ingrained into their product development and they can just lift those systems. All of that investment and process we‚Äôre learning painfully now will carry through to the next thing, whatever that may be."</p>
<p>It's something that's also a bit of a learning process for PlayStation. Sony isn't the most experienced publisher when it comes to live service products, although it's starting to invest in this area through new games and acquisitions of companies like Bungie.</p>
<p>"It‚Äôs been a great partnership and we‚Äôre learning together, and they‚Äôre recognising that Arrowhead can be the spearhead in learning how to do [live service] better in the future," Jorjani says. "It‚Äôs just great to have somebody there with you as you figure this out."</p>
<p>Pilestedt adds: "We‚Äôre always chasing our tail in one way or another. We have to lay the tracks as the train moves forward. There are optimisations and workflow improvements we can make. We‚Äôre going in and tuning the organisation to have the team work at a reasonable rate. Because, right now, to some degree, we‚Äôre burning the candle at both ends. And we want to get to the point where we‚Äôre producing as much candle as we are burning."</p>
<p>The focus today is on Helldivers 2 and getting that balance right. But the studio is feeling confident, it is a strong financial position, it has strengthened its leadership team, and is now looking ahead to what's next.</p>
<p>"We feel there we have so much more to give, and so many more games we want to make," Pilestedt says. "The ambition level and appetite of the organisation has grown significantly. We now have a taste of blood, and we want more."</p>

<figcaption>The first Helldivers was very different, but still sold four million copies</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But that doesn't necessarily mean growing its headcount exponentially, or being acquired, or going public. For Pilestedt and Jorjani, it's all about what's needed to make the games they want to create.</p>
<p>"We pride ourselves on being an independent studio," Pilestedt says. "We have to see what the future holds, but there‚Äôs nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody. I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realise that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard."</p>
<p>Jorjani adds: "The goal of the studio is to make really great co-op games. We really want to turn Arrowhead into a flagship studio, where people who want to make these kind-of games say to themselves: ‚ÄòI want to work at Arrowhead‚Äô. When we were growing up, we really wanted to work at Blizzard, it was one of the bucket list places to work at. I think Arrowhead has the potential to be that.</p>
<p>"But that doesn‚Äôt mean we have to be a 500-person company. In fact, a 500-person company is quite painful in a lot of ways. We will see growth, but growth as a means to an ends, not as an end itself. We don‚Äôt have plans to go public. None of those shenanigans. Measured growth that allows us to make amazing game and be a good place to work.</p>
<p>Pilestedt concludes: "We don‚Äôt run the business for monetary gain. The humbleness and the desire to just make great games is the only reason we exist."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-best-tac-50-loadout/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiant-best-tac-50-loadout<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="292" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-xdefiant-weapons-and-how-to-unlock-them/">weapon choice</a> is of importance in <em>XDefiant</em>, how you use those weapons matters. Both the technique as well as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-acr-6-8-loadout-and-class-setup-in-xdefiant/">your loadout</a> play a huge part in whether each gunfight is won or lost by you. Given the rather daunting nature of loadouts however, you might want a little help here and there. </p> <p data-characters="49" data-current-count="49" data-injectable="false">Here‚Äôs the best Tac-50 loadout in <em>XDefiant</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-attachments-and-gear-for-the-tac-50-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">The best attachments and gear for the Tac-50 in XDefiant</h2> <figure data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="490" data-current-count="839" data-injectable="true">The Tac-50 is similar to the AWP in Counter-Strike in that it enforces a high-risk, high-reward playstyle. It‚Äôs a one-shot kill to the body but features slow ADS time, low mobility, and a ton of recoil. If you‚Äôre good at hitting your shots it‚Äôs an absolute beast, but those who miss will find it tough to get enjoyment out of it. This loadout helps to reinforce that playstyle and give it a bit of assistance. For your attachments, you‚Äôll want to take the following:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Compensator</li> <li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Rapid Fire</li> <li><strong>Optics:</strong> Variable Zoom</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong> Grip Tape</li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Padded Stock</li> </ul> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">Many of these attachments lower the ADS Speed considerably, but trade that with Fire Rate, Recoil Control, and Recoil Recovery. The Variable Zoom is added in since the default 12x zoom isn‚Äôt the most convenient. You‚Äôre also forced to use a scope anyway, so you may as well improve it.</p>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">For your Secondary Weapon, you‚Äôre best running the <strong>M1911</strong> since it provides good firepower and is great for those close-range encounters when you get surprise attacked. Slap a Compensator, Quick or Fast Mag, and Fabric Rear Grip on it, and it‚Äôll be great in a pinch. A <strong>Proximity Mine</strong> goes very well with this playstyle to help cover a crucial flank.</p> <h2 id="h-which-faction-pairs-best-with-the-tac-50" data-injectable="false">Which faction pairs best with the Tac-50?</h2> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">As for the best faction, you‚Äôre looking at either running a <strong>Phantom with Mag Barrier or Echelon with the Digital Ghillie Suit</strong> since they can both give some cover as you take your potshots at enemies across the map. Cleaners are a decent option as well with either ability but they don‚Äôt synergize quite as well.</p>

<p data-characters="316" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In <em>XDefiant</em>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-acr-6-8-loadout-and-class-setup-in-xdefiant/">weapon choice</a> is only half the battle. You also need to consider the attachments, gadgets, and sidearms to bring along for the ride. This is a lot of choices to make with plenty of tweaking to be done, so it can help to have some assistance to get there. Here‚Äôs the best AK-47 loadout in <em>XDefiant</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-loadout-when-using-the-ak-47-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">The best loadout when using the AK-47 in XDefiant</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true">The AK-47 is a mid-range <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-xdefiant-weapons-and-how-to-unlock-them/">powerhouse</a> that offers high damage with a low rate of fire. It‚Äôs perfect for lasering targets, though falls off at longer ranges with some rough recoil and especially tough handling in full auto. As such, we want attachments that help reinforce its position at mid-range, while also giving it some help for those longer ranges. With those goals in mind, you should choose the following attachments:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Recon</li> <li><strong>Front Rail: </strong>Angled Grip</li> <li><strong>Optics: </strong>Reflex</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong> Heavy Grip</li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Padded Stock</li> </ul> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">If you feel comfortable with the Iron Sights, then you can <strong>swap the Reflex Optic out for the Quick Mag</strong> in the Magazine slot. Otherwise, this build adds a ton of Horizontal Recoil Control that should make its recoil more predictable and easy to account for. Some ADS bonuses are added in so you can strengthen the mid-range gunfights the weapon is known for.</p>
 <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">Moving over to the Secondary Weapon, we‚Äôre looking to take <strong>the iconic M1911</strong> to help with those short-range encounters thanks to its firepower. A Quick Mag for the Magazine and the Fabric Rear Grip assist this thanks to the improved ADS and Reload Speed. Finally, we want to round things out with an <strong>EMP Grenade</strong> for any Shields from the Phantoms.</p> <h2 id="h-which-faction-is-best-with-the-ak-47" data-injectable="false">Which faction is best with the AK-47?</h2> <figure data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="false">The best factions for this playstyle are easily the <strong>Cleaners and Libertad</strong>. The Cleaners can provide some extra damage in a pinch with the Firebomb especially, while the Libertad‚Äôs BioVida Boost will save you in a pinch. If you‚Äôre more intel-oriented, the Echelon with the Intel Suit ability can help you orient your surroundings too. It‚Äôs just more meant for the start of fights rather than in the spur of the moment.</p>

			<p>Sony's annual PlayStation promotions for this year - Days of Play 2024 - is expected to kick off next week on May 29.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-days-of-play-2023-ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous years</a>, Sony will be kicking off special PlayStation promotions, and <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/days-of-play-2024-les-promotions-playstation-arriveraient-tres-bientot-51203" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to</a> renowned deals leaker 'Billbil-kun', this year's Days of Play will start next week and is expected to last between 10 to 14 days. For reference, last year's Days of Play promotions lasted for ten days across PlayStation Plus, PlayStation Gear, direct.playstation.com, and PlayStation Store, along with additional offerings available at participating retailers. Official details about this year's deals haven't been shared just yet, but the leaker did <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1793247331313148222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manage to find</a> the new logo for Days of Play 2024. You can find this image at the top of this article.</p>
<p>As said, no official details have been shared just yet, but it's expected that Sony will be offering discounts on all PS Plus tiers of around 25%. "If the promotion valid during the Days of Play 2023 is repeated this time,&nbsp;the annual subscription&nbsp;should have an&nbsp;immediate discount of around -25% which would concern all Essential, Extra, and Premium/Deluxe tiers", the leaker writes.</p>
<p>Other deals include savings on PS5 consoles, PS5 DualSense controllers, and select software titles. The following deals are to be expected (in Europe):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>50 euros reduction on&nbsp;PS5 Slim Standard consoles, for a&nbsp;final price of 499 euros.</em></li>
<li><em>50 euros reduction on&nbsp;PS5 Slim Digital&nbsp;consoles&nbsp;(without disc drive), i.e. a&nbsp;final price of 399 euros.</em></li>
<li><em>100 euros reduction on&nbsp;PS VR2 consoles, for a&nbsp;final price of 499 euros.</em></li>
<li><em>All&nbsp;DualSense controllers at 49.99 euros.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If true, Sony will likely officially announce this year's Days of Play promotions in the coming days. We'll update you as soon as more information comes in. What kind of deals would you be interested in this year? Will you be picking up a new PS5 slim console with a discount? And what about the more recent PS5 titles?

                <p>Basketball legend LeBron James is widely considered to be the greatest player to ever step into the court, but just how well would he fare against one of the mightiest Pokemon of all time? <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stephen-a-smith-chooses-his-starter-pokemon/1100-6520630/">Pokemon starter expert</a> and sports commentator Stephen A. Smith was asked who he'd pick to win in a basketball game between LeBron and Mewtwo, and the TV personality believes that the genetically engineered Pokemon would actually stand a good chance of beating the NBA MVP in a game of 21.</p><p>"He's shorter than LeBron but he weighs more," Smith said in a serious analysis of Mewtwo's stats. "He can anticipate moves and stuff like that. Yeah, maybe he could pull it off. From the looks of him, he might scare LeBron. LeBron might want to shoot more jump-shots, might not want to come near him. That long tail, you never know. Might trip him. I'm not saying it definitely would happen, but it's possible. It's possible, let's go with that."</p><p>As Smith noted, Mewtwo is pretty tall, and as a Psychic-type, Pokemon he has several advantages. As demonstrated in the first Pokemon movie, Mewtwo probably wouldn't have a hard time taking control of the ball, predicting what LeBron would do next, or reflecting on the contest with <a href="https://youtu.be/UQoGyeeT2pw" rel="nofollow ">Shakespearian eloquence</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/total-war-star-wars/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>When <em>Dualshockers </em>reported that Creative Assembly is developing a <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-works-at-creative-assembly/?ref=remapradio.com"><u><em>Star Wars </em>version of their <em>Total War </em>series</u></a>, the most common reaction I saw was one of skepticism. At first glance, <em>Star Wars</em> does not seem to lend itself to the combat of massed armies and close, linear formations that has been <em>Total War‚Äôs</em> bread-and-butter since its inception.</p><p>At a glance, <em>Star Wars </em>appears to be a setting where warfare is analogous to World War 2 combat: soldiers carry automatic or semi-automatic blasters, walkers function like tanks, starfighters are basically WW2 airplanes and a lot of them are carried aboard capital ships that act like aircraft carriers. By contrast, the <em>Total War </em>series has always handled pre-gunpowder armies best, and its forays into the 18th and 19th centuries have been uneven. (Why that is the case is a topic for another day.)</p><figure><figcaption><span>That's just a catapult! </span><i><em>Total War </em></i><span>can handle a catapult. Which is more than can be said for the Droid Army.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The more <em>Star Wars </em>battles we have gotten to see, however, the less they fit that ‚ÄúWorld War 2 in Space‚Äù paradigm. Throughout the <em>Clone Wars </em>cartoon, ground combat between the Separatist Droid Army and the Grand Army of the Republic is defined by massed formations exchanging laser fire at close range. Is this in large part dictated by the limitations of the cartoon‚Äôs animation capabilities? Almost certainly, but it is also following the template Lucas established in <em>Phantom Menance </em>and <em>Attack of the Clones</em>, where the former is basically a battle of Roman legionary armies, and the latter is a point-blank melee as masses of droids try and shatter walls of clones and Jedi defenders. </p><!--members-only--><p>Hoth, likewise, doesn‚Äôt much resemble a World War 2 battle so much as a World War 1 battle or perhaps something even earlier. The AT-AT walkers are more capable than World War 1‚Äôs first tanks, but they share similar drawbacks: they are devastatingly effective at shattering an enemy line but also slow and unmaneuverable. (Their performance gets even less impressive if you read Danger Room‚Äôs <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/02/battle-of-hoth/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>analysis of Rebel defensive tactics on Hoth</u></a>, or this piece <a href="https://cimsec.org/re-fighting-the-battle-of-hoth-an-engineers-perspective/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>re-imagining how the Rebels could have deployed the same resources</u></a> to keep the Imperials at bay, which is coincidentally a good primer on how armies evolved tactics to mitigate the threat of armored breakthroughs.) The biggest ground battle we get in the original trilogy is an assault on a besieged fortress, frankly the kind that happened a lot more <em>before </em>the World Wars than after.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Ralph McQuarrie's concept painting for the Hoth Battle, displayed at Disney World</span></figcaption></figure><p>If there is any one battle that looks different from what Total War is usually about, it‚Äôs the Umbara campaign in <em>The Clone Wars. </em> Perhaps the most impressive depiction of battle in the entire series, the landings on Umbara resembled a combination of the paratroopers going into Normandy and helicopter-led US air assault tactics in Vietnam.&nbsp;</p><p>The Umbarans rely heavily on area-denial weapons, plus disruptive long range firepower that inflicted major losses on the Clone Army before they can get into small-arms range of Umbaran forces.  When the clones finally get into range of those forces, the Umbarans are piloting advanced vehicles with no support.  Effectively, it's a mechanized monster fight‚Äîand we've seen lots of monster fights in the <em>Total War: Warhammer </em>series. </p><p>(Plus, the Republic‚Äôs tactics were hindered in this battle by the fact that the Jedi in command was a turncoat. Did our glimpse of the Umbaran campaign look so different from other battles because it was truly a different tactical paradigm, or was it just that the commanding general was intentionally inflicting attrition on his forces?)</p><figure><figcaption><span>Diagram of a shipboard mass driver cannon in </span><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/672347/star-wars-battles-that-changed-the-galaxy-by-cole-horton-jason-fry-amy-ratcliffe-chris-kempshall/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><span>Battles That Changed the Galaxy</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>What of space? That‚Äôs a little harder to make guesses about. Naval warfare is something the <em>Total War </em>series has struggled with over the years, but if it could be said to have worked at all it was with games like <em>Empire </em>and <em>Fall of the Samurai</em>, where you‚Äôre basically dealing with the 18th and 19th century naval tactics‚Äî<em>Master and Commander </em>type stuff. </p><p>The thing is, that‚Äôs basically what we see in the largest naval battle in the <em>Star Wars </em>films. Lando Calrissian‚Äôs solution to the ambush at Endor is to have Ackbar bring his capital ships into point-blank range with the Imperial Star Destroyers surrounding the Second Death Star, while he and his strike craft fly cover until they can attack the Death Star itself. Unlike in real-world history, the development of strike aircraft didn‚Äôt render the battleship obsolete, and so most naval battles appear to be decided by the presence of capital ships fighting well inside visual range of one another using actual cannons with heavy artillery shells like warships used from the 16th through the 20th centuries. The biggest naval battles we see in the prequel trilogy follow similar logic, and the glimpses we get of the Imperial Navy on the fringes of the Empire in <em>Andor </em>and <em>Rebels</em> indicate that the fleet is predominated by small patrol craft and light carriers, and that the almost-invulnerable Imperial Star Destroyer is as scarce as a sight as a Ship of the Line on the far frontiers of 18th century empires.</p><figure><figcaption><span>A naval battle diagram for the Battle of Endor of the kind that is very familiar to anyone who appreciates the age of fighting sail.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The final thing I would note is that Jedi, Sith, Force Witches, and even the types of special units that emerge from within the conventional armies of <em>Star Wars</em>‚Äîlike the coldly competent Tactical Droids, elite combat commanders like Rex and his badass buddy Fives‚Äîare basically hero units and both <em>Total War: Warhammer </em>and <em>Three Kingdoms </em>showed that Creative Assembly is capable of putting special units like that into game system without making it fall apart. Personally, I think the way it approached hero units in <em>Three Kingdoms </em>is a bit more in keeping with <em>Star Wars</em> (there‚Äôs only one Anakin Skywalker just like there‚Äôs only one Lu Bu) but you can see it working a few different ways.</p><p>So it isn‚Äôt hard to imagine Creative Assembly depicting battles that feel authentically <em>Star Wars</em>. The films have never been particularly interested in convincing military tactics as much as they have privileged packing a frame with scenes of awesome combat. The <em>Total War </em>series has always been similar: its battles look like movies or military paintings more than actual combat as related by participants, where war is always harder to perceive and understand in the confusion of battle. You can very easily imagine a lot of typical <em>Total War </em>battles unfolding with the types of armies we see throughout <em>Star Wars </em>films and television.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Like this has never happened to you in a Total War game.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The more doubtful thing, at this stage in Creative Assembly‚Äôs life as a studio, is whether it can make a game that feels authentic and interesting with the wildly varied source material of <em>Star Wars</em>. The studio‚Äôs model has increasingly shifted to DLC‚Äîto the point that a lot of folks have come to believe <em>Total War </em>can only work if a setting can support dozens of factions‚Äîand it isn‚Äôt hard to imagine a Star Wars game that feels like a thinly reskinned Total War game of the type we‚Äôve seen countless times before, with variation coming via fanciful DLC packs that start to resemble the goofy <em>Star Wars </em>action figures and playsets of the past. I think if this comes to fruition we have every chance of seeing a surprisingly good <em>Star Wars </em>game at launch‚Ä¶ and then two years later playing an increasingly poorly-balanced and buggy version of the same game as we try out the new Hutts of Hoth Expansion and await <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/blog/message-from-total-war-leadership-dec-2023/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>the inevitable blog post</u></a> titled ‚ÄúAn Apology and a Roadmap for the Hutts of Hoth‚Äù.</p><p><em>P.S. Because some folks are going to miss the link in the caption: the stills throughout this piece are from </em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/672347/star-wars-battles-that-changed-the-galaxy-by-cole-horton-jason-fry-amy-ratcliffe-chris-kempshall/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>Star Wars Battles That Changed the Galaxy</em></a><em>, which is quite a lot of fun as a work of fictional military history, in the form of </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Battles-World-War-I/dp/B000KT4W7I?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>exactly the kind of history book</em></a><em> that set me on course to be whatever the hell I am today.</em></p>

Smash Bros.-style brawler launches proper on May 28 after it was brought offline following what is now called the open beta period.</p><p>In a <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Player First Games said returning players who log in by June 11 get the Season 1 premium battle pass for free. This means they also get playable character Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th for free.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/jason-1920-1080-1536x864-1716374436634.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Warner Bros. Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Player First Games revealed a first look at the battle pass interface, which gives off strong Fortnite vibes. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve increased the number of high-value items in both the free and premium tiers by adding more ringouts, character variants, taunts, and currency,‚Äù Player First Games said.</p><p>You can now earn the premium currency (Gleamium) through both tiers, which can be used to buy various in-game items, whether it‚Äôs for new characters or saving to use towards the next season‚Äôs premium battle pass.</p><p>Jason Voorhees is part of the premium battle pass, as are more variants, ringouts, taunts, and currency. The premium battle pass also lets you earn enough Gleamium to get the next premium battle pass, Player First Games confirmed. Jason Voorhees will also be available via character tokens or in-game currency when the pass is over.</p><p>At launch, the Season 1 battle pass will last for eight weeks, and the final tier of the pass will be repeatable, so you can keep playing and earning rewards even if you reach the end of it early.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/image-63-1536x842-1716374462561.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Warner Bros. Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Returning players who already have existing character tokens in their inventory can still use them to unlock characters, but MultiVersus will not offer new character tokens from launch. Neither will it offer new battle pass tokens, but if you already have some you can still use them to unlock the premium battle pass tier.</p><p>Player First Games has introduced new replacement currencies ‚Äúto focus more on specific reward types.‚Äù Fighter currency can be earned in-game and used to obtain fighters. ‚ÄúKeep in mind, Fighter currency is different from character tokens, and it cannot be exchanged for character tokens,‚Äù Player First Games warned. Players can also try out new characters through the weekly free character rotation, which will work the same way as it did during the open beta.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Meanwhile, there is a separate Perk currency you can use to get perks. And there‚Äôs a Prestige currency that ‚Äúrewards players for all of the items and cosmetics they collect for their favorite fighters.‚Äù Each cosmetic item you get awards its own Prestige currency value based on type and rarity. Eventually, you‚Äôll use your Prestige currency to unlock Prestige cosmetics, which represent the rarest cosmetics in the game, Player First Games explained. These items can only be unlocked using Prestige currency. </p><p>‚ÄúWhen we launch, all returning players will receive an allotment of Prestige currency based on the number of cosmetics they acquired during the open beta as a reward for all previous purchases and unlocks,‚Äù the developer added.</p><p>That‚Äôs four separate virtual currencies for the free-to-play brawler. It‚Äôs all a bit confusing, so hopefully the below image adds some clarity:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/mvs-currency-redux-5-1536x864-1716374479417.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Warner Bros. Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The Gold currency previously available is no more. Player First Games said it will dish out commemorative cosmetics that correlate to a player‚Äôs Gold earned during the open beta. These are exclusive items that can‚Äôt be earned any other way.</p><p>And finally, Player First Games will reset all perks from the open beta. As mentioned, perks are now unlocked using the Perk currency, attainable through playing the game, and all players will receive an allotment that correlates to the number of perks unlocked from the open beta. Player and account mastery tracks will be set to level one at launch. ‚ÄúMastery tracks are a great way to give you both short-term and long-term goals when starting out, and ultimately, we want to give all players the chance to earn lots of items,‚Äù Player First Games said.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-jason-voorhees-from-friday-the-13th-and-agent-smith-from-the-matrix">Warner Bros. revealed two new playable characters for MultiVersus</a>: the aforementioned Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th and Agent Smith from The Matrix. Jason Voorhees and Agent Smith join the MultiVersus roster alongside DC Super-Villain The Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill) as part of Season 1: Puns &amp; Villainy. Jason Voorhees is available at launch, while Agent Smith will release later in the season.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

 <p data-characters="557" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">They were finally booted from the game on May 21, which they consider a ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù since <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>‚Äòs netcode apparently wasn‚Äôt very good; they even describe it as the worst of any Wii U game. In <a href="https://x.com/xc_omoroid/status/1792896287068848518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a follow-up post</a>, they said they also managed to beat all the online exclusive content, assuring they‚Äôll forever have a truly complete save file. Honestly, this reminds me how I never got round to playing <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> myself and, even though the servers are gone, I‚Äôm half tempted to dig out my old copy.</p>
 <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">I have to imagine the remaining three players won‚Äôt stay connected to their respective games for much longer. Then again, I would‚Äôve thought that one week after the servers shut down and yet they‚Äôve lasted for over a month. At this rate, they could make it well into June. Whatever the case, they will be booted eventually, and then it will truly be an end of an era.</p>

            <p>Sony has shared a new job vacancy for a Mobile Platform Architect at PlayStation Global.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentglobal/jobs/5078757004">listing</a>, which was spotted by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/98435/sony-developing-playstation-mobile-platform/index.html">TweakTown</a>, shows the company is looking for an engineer to design a PlayStation platform which will focus on "developing, publishing, and operating free-to-play mobile games".</p>
<p>Among the responsibilities, the successful candidate will be expected to assist the platform's engineering team with "technical leadership and guidance", contribute to the mobile platform's roadmap, establish "pipelines and processes to facilitate the delivery of high-quality software" and track" technical innovations, changes, and trends affecting mobile game development".</p>

<p>"An individual in this role will spearhead the design and implementation of this platform; work in partnership with internal teams to connect mobile games to PlayStation services; and ensure that all mobile games meet PlayStation's quality standards," the listing states.</p>
<p>Sony has previously dabbled with the mobile gaming market, publishing the likes of the PlayStation app, the PS Remote Play app, endless-runner <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/run-sackboy-run-review">Run Sackboy! Run!</a> (pictured below), top-down puzzle game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-free-to-play-uncharted-mobile-app-unlocks-exclusive-uncharted-4-multiplayer-rewards">Uncharted: Fortune Hunter</a> (above), and AR app God of War: Mimir's Vision.</p>
<p>However, these forays have never met the heights of other mobile releases, such as Genshin Impact and Pok√©mon Go. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-fortune-hunter-is-shutting-down">Uncharted: Fortune Hunter was shut down by developer Naughty Dog</a>. While it never specified why it was retiring its mobile spinoff, low player numbers were likely a factor.</p>
<p>
However, it appears the company is still set on reversing its fortunes in the future, with mobile undoubtedly being an important part of the market to crack. </p>

            <p>
Deadlock, the unannounced but previously-leaked hero shooter from Half-Life maker Valve, has been spotted again in a fresh leak. And, this time, we can now see gameplay footage of Deadlock in action.
</p>
<p>
Leaked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/images-leak-of-valves-next-game-and-its-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter">details of Deadlock sprung onto the internet last week</a> via images posted to social media and a report from longterm Valve reporter Tyler McVicker, which claimed that Deadlock was currently in closed testing. 
</p>
<p>
It's from this ongoing test that gameplay footage has now also leaked - showing off Deadlock's training mode, more hero characters, and the existence of BioShock Infinite-style skyrails you can hook onto and ride around on.
</p>

<p>
Even Deadlock's setting looks rather BioShock Infinite-like, with period advertising for brands of cigarettes and wide open town squares. 
</p>
<p>
The leaked footage shows off a number of training modes in which the player can acclimitise to the game's controls, test character movement and abilities, and then learn Deadlock's lane system. 
</p>
<p>
Heroes shown include the imp-like winged Ivy, who can slow and stun enemies while buffing allies, dapper fire demon Infernus who can deal fire damage over time, sneaky robot Haze and gothic sniper Vindicta. Several heroes are labelled as "great for new players!", presumably to get newbies started.

<p>
Previous reporting suggested Deadlock was Valve's next "major" project, and that it has been in development in one form or other since 2018. There's no word yet on when it'll be formally revealed.
</p>
<p>Deadlock isn't the only game due soon with a BioShock Infinite vibe.  Wasteland 3 developer InXile's upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inxiles-clockwork-revolution-is-a-time-bending-rpg-which-owes-a-lot-to-bioshock-infinite">Clockwork Revolution appears so visually similar</a> that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-infinite-trailer-producer-highlights-similarities-with-clockwork-revolution">publisher Microsoft had to issue a statement</a> clarifying "any similarities are unintentional".</p>

<p>Kingmakers is shaping up very nicely, if the latest trailer is anything to go by. In the ‚ÄòWreak Havoc‚Äô trailer, Kingmakers‚Äô destructive capabilities are laid out for all to see, with viewers witnessing a hulking tank smashing effortlessly through medieval buildings from the 13th century. There are shots of a dirtbike-riding soldier blasting through a crowd indiscriminately with an AK-47, and the same character wielding a shotgun and taking down horseback warriors.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kingmakers-is-wild">Kingmakers is Wild</h2>



<p>In our recent interview <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingmakers-interview-ultimate-medieval/">with the developers behind Kingmakers</a>, we learnt that this ambitious title has been dubbed ‚Äòthe ultimate medieval fantasy game‚Äô. It‚Äôs a mix of third-person action and RTS elements, with players assuming control of a character sent back in time to alter history by topping ancient rulers in their stalwart castles.</p>



<p>The latest trailer revealed a little more about how players will accomplish those goals. Mostly, they‚Äôll be wielding modern weaponry and slaying out against waves of medieval soldiers desperately trying to survive with swords, shields, bows, and spears. This new trailer perfectly showcased the most destructive elements of Kingmakers, showing how players can fully collapse a building with a well-placed shot from a grenade launcher, or by driving a main battle tank clean through the side of the thing.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Despite featuring elements that border on the bizarre, Kingmakers is a legitimate title that takes itself seriously, and it has been in development for several years. It doesn‚Äôt have a release date, but it‚Äôs fast becoming one of the most wanted games on Steam.</p>

            <p>
MultiVersus beta players will be given a free premium battle pass for the fighting game's first season.
</p>
<p>
Last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">open beta was shut down until the game's full launch</a>, with no refunds given to players, although progress and content will carry over.

</p>
<p>
Now, in a <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes">new blog post</a>, developer Player First Games has revealed returning players from the beta will receive access to the season one premium battle pass for free - provided they log in to MultiVersus by 11th June.
</p>

</figure>
<p>

In addition, any returning players will receive a special edition Snow Suit Finn character variant, a special edition Rising Stars ringout, and a special edition Banana Guard announcer pack.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of Banana Guard, players who complete the game's new tutorial - a seven-day reward calendar - will receive the character for free. Completing all seven days will add the Lady Banana Guard variant.
</p>
<p>
So what's included in the premium battle pass? The big draw is playable character <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-adds-the-matrixs-agent-smith-jason-voorhees">Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th, revealed earlier this week</a>.

</p>
<p>
Player First Games has increased the number of high-value items in both the free and premium tiers. Premium currency - Gleamium - is available in both tiers, with the premium tier including enough currency to get the next battle pass. Each season of the battle pass will last eight weeks and the final tier will be repeatable for those who reach it early and wish to keep earning rewards.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
It's unknown how much the premium battle pass will cost, though as above it's free for returning players.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the blog post details the four different currencies and how to acquire them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Perk currency - used to unlock in-game perks, gained through gameplay and the battle pass</li>
<li>Fighter currency - used to unlock characters, gained through gameplay and the battle pass</li>
<li>Prestige currency - used to unlock exclusive cosmetics, gained by acquiring cosmetics</li>
<li>Gleamium - used to unlock cosmetics, emotes, battle passes and more, gained in events, the battle pass, or direct purchase</li>
</ul>

<p>
Currencies from the beta no longer included here will still be usable. Gold will be swapped for commemorative cosmetics.

</figure>
<p>
MultiVersus launches on 28th May across PC (Steam and Epic), PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, with cross-platform and cross-progression play.
</p>
<p>
"Characterful fighters, a good skill ceiling, and a co-op emphasis with real depth makes Warner Bros. MultiVersus a very pleasant surprise," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-review-more-than-just-another-super-smash-bros-clone">Eurogamer MultiVersus open beta review from last year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alongside the previous entries in the series, Kingdom Hearts 4 may release on Nintendo Switch 2, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking on X/Twitter, reliable insider Midori discussed the fourth entry in the series, revealing that it may be <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1792956511435526341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released on the next Nintendo hardware</a> alongside its predecessors. As only<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-switch-outrageous-prices/"> cloud versions</a> have been released on the original Switch, it would definitely be great to have native ports of the entire series on the upcoming console.</p>
<p>Midori also revealed other <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1792956382884278387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1792956382884278387%7Ctwgr%5E27bffc5c203bb2be18bde81cc84daa2b4a49e58f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffinalweapon.net%2F2024%2F05%2F21%2Fkingdom-hearts-iv-reportedly-has-online-features-might-come-to-switch-2%2F">interesting tidbits</a> about Kingdom Hearts 4. Apparently, the game, codenamed Quattro (four in Italian), looks very different from the reveal trailer and will have some small online features. More outside IP collaborations are also being planned for the series in the future.</p>
<p>While Midori has proven to be extremely reliable in the past, especially regarding SEGA and Atlus leaks, we have to take what has been revealed on Kingdom Hearts 4 with a grain of salt. With Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth now out, the fourth entry in the series is Square Enix's next major release, so hopefully, we won't have to wait long to see more of it.</p>
<p>The latest main entry in the series is Kingdom Hearts III, now available on PC and consoles. You can learn more about it in Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-hearts-iii-the-end-has-come/">review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-story-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The First Descendant was revealed in 2022, and by today, prospective fans are still waiting for a confirmed release date. It‚Äôs expected to drop in 2024, and Nexon is hard at work polishing the highly anticipated title ahead of the impending launch. Recently, Nexon released a deep dive into the game‚Äôs story, revealing the key concepts of the setting, outlining some of the game‚Äôs lore, and explaining what makes The First Descendant so unique.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-becoming-the-first-descendant">Becoming The First Descendant</h2>



<p>The First Descendant is being pieced together by a South Korean studio, and it has been in development for a few years. It‚Äôs poised to be an epic, Unreal Engine 5-driven game that incorporates elements of the looter-shooter genre and traditional RPG titles. In the latest video uploaded to showcase the game, Nexon‚Äôs representatives outlined the core concept of The First Descendant:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Humanity has embraced the destiny left by their predecessors, the ‚ÄòAncestors‚Äô, and have become the Descendants. The Vulgus (an alien race) started a war to fulfill the will of their predecessors, the survival of their species. The mission of the Colossi (large beings) cannot be revealed, but they consider it a curse.</p>



<p>The First Descendant‚Äôs universe begins with the clash of those who inherited the fate of their predecessors. Whether this tragic fate can be severed in this generation, or will be passed on to the next generation, all depends on the Descendant, who will become the player‚Äôs avatar.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It‚Äôs a lofty and ambitious concept that has the makings of a fantastic story, but from what we‚Äôve seen so far in terms of gameplay isn‚Äôt turning heads too dramatically. In some ways, it looks like a typical third-person shooter that‚Äôs even reminiscent of titles like Gears of War at times. In The First Descendant, players will control ‚Äòthe ultimate and most powerful tactical force of humanity,‚Äô using a series of unique abilities to overcome some immense enemies, and various play styles and approaches to missions are encouraged.</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs the full video:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>One gripe that prospective fans have with The First Descendant is that it‚Äôs an ‚Äòalways online‚Äô game, despite there being solo gameplay elements present in the title. It‚Äôs an adventure that can be played cooperatively, but playing solo won‚Äôt switch off those always online requirements.</p>

<p data-characters="161" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It‚Äôs not just Steam that <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is coming to, as according to prominent leaker MbKKssTBhz5, a special crossover is also set to arrive in <em>Fortnite</em>. </p> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">When discussing the news that the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-games-make-steam-debut-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series will launch on Steam</a> on June 13, MbKKssTBhz5 revealed that they believe a new platform isn‚Äôt the only place we‚Äôll see <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> this year, suggesting that not only could it come to Nintendo hardware, but to other games too, specifically mentioning that <em>Fortnite</em> was ‚Äúpart of this initiative.‚Äù</p> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, they don‚Äôt have any more information about what it could include or when it could happen, but my mind immediately goes to a Sora character skin, and a Keyblade harvesting tool. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I heard Fortnite was part of this initiative. But I didn‚Äôt have any other information on collaboration or date for the collaboration.</p>‚Äî „Åø„Å©„Çä (@MbKKssTBhz5) <a href="https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1792975164684063118?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true">Of course, the idea of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> arriving in <em>Fortnite</em> makes a ton of sense. <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is all about Disney characters, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-persistent-universe-connected-to-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney now owns a $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games</a>. What better way to maximize your revenue than to create a crossover with a property you already control, rather than working with an outside identity on licensing agreements or revenue shares?</p>
 <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">As for when this crossover could happen, it would make a lot of sense to do it around the release of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> on Steam, but that is just three weeks away, and we would usually see more concrete rumors about a potential crossover by now if that were to be the case. </p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">The other suggestion is that it could be around the release of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-4-release-date-characters-and-everything-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts IV</a></em>, but with it not scheduled to launch until 2025, that seems like a long time to wait. We may get new trailers this year though, which may be a better time to drop some themed cosmetics in <em>Fortnite</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">Remember though, this is a leak and is definitely not confirmed, so make sure to take it with a hefty pinch of salt. In the meantime, we still have a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnites-new-fallout-content-is-more-salt-in-the-wound-for-fallout-76-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fallout</em> crossover</a> event to enjoy in <em>Fortnite</em>, so there are plenty of opportunities to spend your V-Bucks in the future. </p>

Smash Bros. fighters have an almost equal chance of winning a match, creator Masahiro Sakurai has said.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/masahiro-sakurai-launches-new-youtube-channel-on-game-development">Sakurai's YouTube series is still going strong</a>, with his latest video discussing balance in fighting games - something the Smash Bros. games have seen their fair share of controversy around.
</p>
<p>
The video includes win rate data from across the globe, revealing the highest win rate is 51.43 percent and the lowest win rate is 47.18 percent. It means all 87 characters sit within this win/loss ratio, hovering around an equal 50 percent chance of winning.

<p>
Sakurai doesn't reveal which characters are at the top and bottom of this scale - this remains top secret - but, in his words, "any fighter has a shot at winning".
</p>
<p>
As he explains in the video, creating fighters is a balance between uniqueness and competitive balance. Should all characters be too similarly balanced, the game would be boring. "Average and mediocre are the same thing," says Sakurai. Equally, too much uniqueness means "you'll naturally end up with mixed reception".
</p>
<p>
"If you balance purely based on fighter strength, their abilities quickly start to level out," says Sakurai. "Hence, I advise our team to keep fighters unique by amplifying shortcomings to offset advantages."
</p>

<p>
Smash Bros. has certainly been accused of imbalance in the past. GameCube title Melee included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meta-knight-return-confirmed-for-super-smash-bros-wii-u-and-3ds">Kirby character Meta Knight</a>, who was deemed too powerful and banned from professional tournaments.

</p>
<p>
Similarly, when sassy witch Bayonetta was introduced in Super Smash Bros. on Wii U and 3DS, many found her to be overpowered.
</p>
<p>
Still, Sakurai notes the internet can be "an echo chamber of sorts" that perpetuates opinion. "If people want to prove their point, they're best off settling it in an actual match," he says.
</p>
<p>
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the latest game in the series, released on Switch back in 2018. It's the third highest-selling game on the system, behind Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

            <p>XDefiant, Ubisoft's free-to-play Call of Duty-like arena shooter, launched yesterday. However, the game has already faced its share of issues, with matchmaking being shot (pun not intended) leaving many unable to access it at all.</p>
<p>As users reported being met with an <a href="https://x.com/WHOH/status/1792971353534148865">"Unable to Find Match"</a> alert, Ubisoft acknowledged players were struggling to join a game, stating: "Please bear with us while we look into servers and matchmaking!"</p>
<p>Things got so bad, developer Mark Rubin - who previously worked on the Call of Duty series prior to his role as XDefiant's executive producer - shared a post on social media last night, showing a hamster clinging on desperately to an out of control wheel. "Matchmaking servers go boom!" he wrote.</p>

</figure>
<p>Rubin additionally assured his followers that the team was "working on it", and the <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1793044381076685170">most recent update over on the XDefiant account</a> is that Ubisoft is "seeing progress on the matchmaking servers".</p>
<p>"We will continue to monitor the situation and keep you updated," it said.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>XDefiant has walked quite an uneven path to launch. The game was initially revealed as Tom Clancy's XDefiant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-ghost-recon-and-the-division-merge-in-ubis-6v6-free-to-play-fps-xdefiant">back in 2021</a>, but Ubisoft later announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-drops-tom-clancys-name-from-xdefiant">dropping the prefix</a> following criticism from Tom Clancy fans. Essentially, the Tom Clancy fanbase felt the XDefiant announcement strayed too far from the franchise's serious military themes and formula.</p>
<p>With the Tom Clancy name dropped, XDefiant went on to have a number of tests, but not always very successfully. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-may-extend-xdefiant-closed-beta-over-horrible-server-experience">one beta was described as having a "horrible" server experience</a> by Rubin himself.</p>
<p>XDefiant then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-free-to-play-shooter-xdefiant-delayed-due-to-console-certification-issues">missed a planned launch</a> last year due to console certification issues. It subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delays-free-to-play-shooter-xdefiant-again">received another delay</a> in October, this time because of "inconsistencies in the game experience".</p>

            <p>We just got a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date">Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> story trailer yesterday. As is their druthers, FromSoft have at once made the events it depicts feel of earth-shattering importance while providing basically no concrete information. A lot of people will be putting out gargantuan theory posts right now, rambling on about Miquella, the Crucible, the Golden Order blah blah. This is all a distraction. Anyone with eyes can tell you that the primary movers and shakers of this final chapter in the Lands Between are a secret faction of hitherto secret spear people. You're likely confused, and that's understandable. As the foremost authority <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-kind-of-pot-is-elden-rings-pot-boy-we-asked-an-expert">on ephemeral nonsense</a> in Elden Ring, I‚Äôm the only one who has your back here.</p>

<p>The first ill omen portenting toward the encroaching spear-mageddon that threatens to consume <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>‚Äôs world is cleverly disguised as just ‚Äòa bunch of blokes with spears‚Äô. If you look closely, you‚Äôll notice single bloke with an axe. This is what tipped me off, you see. If everyone had spears, I wouldn‚Äôt be so suspicious, but this this single axe feels like a such a fat carp hastily painted red and herring-shaped. It‚Äôs meant to convince us the spear people aren‚Äôt taking over, but I know better.</p>
<p>After a close-up shot of another soldier pulling his - you guessed it - spear from a corpse. We‚Äôre treated to this telling shot:</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/elden-spears-2.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>FromSoftware</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre not even trying to hide it anymore! Look at the corpse! Also, look at how uniform the formation is. If you trace each spear point to its opposite point, you might begin to notice a sort of sigil-code taking shape. In spear-ish, this code translates to: Look at all these spears! Which is a sort of bullish rallying cry meant to reinforce notions of spear-iority. Truly fiendish. Here‚Äôs the next shot:</p>

<p>Yes, Messmer, the DLC‚Äôs new antagonist, I know, I know. But what‚Äôs that he‚Äôs got clutched in his hand? It‚Äôs spears all the way down! Spear-oboros! I‚Äôm honestly too overcome with revelations for words, so I will leave the shot-by-shot analysis here, partly to leave the remaining spears for you to discover, but mostly because this shitpost had run its course by the second paragraph. I hope this was of use to you intrepid lore hunters, but if it wasn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm keen to highlight that my headline has the words ‚ÄòElden Ring‚Äô and ‚Äòrated‚Äô in the title, which I assume is how my writing will be judged from here on out.</p>

			<p>Next month's planned Xbox Showcase will be interesting for fans of the Xbox 360-era JRPGs, it's been claimed.</p>
<p>That's what Xbox Era co-founder @Shpeshal_Nick shared on X/Twitter some hours ago. "If what I‚Äôve heard is true, fans of Xbox 360-era JRPGs will have something to look forward to at the showcase", the insider <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1793113945018105857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X. No additional details have been shared, but Xbox boss Phil Spencer has openly been talking about bringing more games to Xbox from Japanese developers. JRPGs that spring to mind include Mistwalker's excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-odyssey-available-xbox-one-bc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-dragon-available-xbox-one-bc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Dragon</a>, Eternal Sonata, Enchanted Arms, but also the Last Remnant, and several others. Back in January of this year, the insider was <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-january-31st/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right on the money</a> regarding the PlayStation State of Play broadcast.</p>
<p>The upcoming Xbox showcase has yet to be detailed, but Microsoft has confirmed that it will be showing off several upcoming first-party titles. Recent rumors suggest <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-will-be-shown-next-month-recent-rumors-might-have-been-outdated-says-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot will be present during the event</a>.&nbsp; "Like our double-feature last year with Starfield Direct, immediately following the Showcase we‚Äôll be airing a special deep-dive into the next installment of a beloved franchise", Microsoft announced last month. "We can‚Äôt say much, so for now we‚Äôll call it the Xbox Games Showcase followed by&nbsp;<mark>[REDACTED]</mark>&nbsp;Direct."</p>
<p>"This will also be our first Showcase featuring games from our portfolio of studios across Activision, Blizzard, Bethesda and Xbox Game Studios, in addition to titles from our third-party partners."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/events/xbox-games-showcase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> will air on June 9 at 10 am PT. The showcase will be followed by a special "Direct" broadcast.</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about the Xbox showcase.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multiversus-season-1%E2%80%99s-battle-pass-and-playable-jason-are-free-for-returning-players.878073/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-season-1s-battle-pass-and-playable-jason-are-free-for-returning-players/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=multiversus-season-1s-battle-pass-and-playable-jason-are-free-for-returning-players<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="384" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>MultiVersus</em> is doing a lot to win over not just new fans, but all the old players from the game‚Äôs open beta. Multiple new characters, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/jason-voorhees-and-agent-smith-are-joining-the-joker-in-multiversus-first-proper-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as Jason Voorhees and Agent Smith</a>, have been confirmed for its first proper season, alongside a PvE mode, and now developer Player First Games has revealed how returning players can claim a bunch of free content, including the battle pass.</p> <p data-characters="669" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">Like similar free-to-play games, <em>MultiVersus</em> has two kinds of battle passes: a free one for all players and a premium pass you need to pay for that offers additional rewards. According to <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official website</a>, if you played the original beta, you‚Äôll automatically unlock the premium battle pass, which means you‚Äôll also get access to the game‚Äôs <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-fans-are-split-on-jasons-ridiculously-chunky-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incredibly chunky Jason</a>. It sounds like a good deal to me, especially since Player First Games is promising it has bumped up the number of high value rewards in both battle passes. However, you will need to log into <em>MultiVersus</em> by June 11, two weeks after its May 28 launch, to take advantage of the offer.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Player First Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="837" data-injectable="true">Player First Games is also offering returning players a few other special pieces of content‚Äîa Snow Suit Finn variant, a Rising Stars ringout, and a Banana Guard announcer pack‚Äîand these ones aren‚Äôt under any time limit; you‚Äôll get them whenever you log in for the first time. In addition, there‚Äôll be a seven-day reward calendar for any players who beat the tutorial, with the final unlock being a playable Banana Guard from <em>Adventure Time</em>. I‚Äôll let you decide whether that‚Äôs a worthwhile reward or not.</p>
 <p data-characters="649" data-current-count="649" data-injectable="true">Speaking of rewards, Player First Games has decided to give its in-game economy something of an overhaul. There are still too many types of currency in my opinion‚Äîfour of them to be exact‚Äîbut the premium currency, Gleamium, will now be included in both the free and premium battle passes. Originally, Gleamium had to be bought with real money, and a significant number of unlockables could only be purchased with Gleamium. During the beta, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/it-costs-255-to-unlock-everything-in-multiversus-that-cant-be-earned-by-playing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> deduced that it would cost roughly $250 / ¬£200 to acquire everything the game had to offer at the time. Sure, <em>MultiVersus</em> is free-to-play so it needs to earn money somehow, but this just felt extreme.</p>
 <p data-characters="678" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="false">With Gleamium now obtainable through play, this should mean players won‚Äôt feel as pressured to spend more and more money on certain unlockables. Plus, completing the premium battle pass will ensure you have enough Gleamium to purchase the next season‚Äôs battle pass, so that‚Äôs already an improvement. However, we don‚Äôt know how much unlockables will cost or how much grinding will need to be done to acquire characters, costumes, and the like if you don‚Äôt want to spend money. <em>MultiVersus</em> seems to be doing everything right to rejuvenate interest, but a demanding grind and obnoxiously high prices for items could very easily push people away again.</p>

  <p id="uZrQA6"><strong>Chapter 5 Season 3</strong> of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide"><em>Fortnite</em></a>, formally called <strong>Wrecked</strong>, appears to be focused on using huge vehicles to get around a desert wasteland.</p>
<p id="ssQdms">Hot on the w-heels of a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide/24097617/chapter-5-season-2-battle-pass-skins-list-c5s2">Greek methology-themed season</a>, <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 3 will also feature a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24159107/fallout-fortnite-epic-games-bethesda-softworks">Fallout crossover</a>.</p>
<p id="2JSekB">We‚Äôll break down the expected <strong>release times</strong> for <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 3 (based on your time zone) and explain <strong>when Fortnite downtime is supposed to end</strong>. You‚Äôll also get a summary of what to expect from the new <em>Fortnite</em> season.</p>
<hr id="JwdP9P">
<h2 id="7GPqID"><strong>What time does Fortnite downtime end and Chapter 5 Season 3 release in your time zone?</strong></h2>
<p id="CsgMrl"><em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 3 is set to launch on <strong>Friday, May 24</strong>, at the same time around the world. Based on the launch times of previous seasons, we can make a strong educated guess for when <em>Fortnite</em> will go down and come back up again.</p>
<p id="uG3CVn">Server downtime typically starts around 2 or 3 a.m. EDT and<strong> typically last about four hours, </strong>give or take. That means we can reasonably expect <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 3 to go live at the following times depending on your time zone:</p>
<ul>
<li id="hRirtL">
<strong>1 a.m. - 4 a.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="Prdg5A">
<strong>4 a.m. - 7 a.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="ifpyl6">
<strong>9 a.m. - 12 p.m. BST</strong> for the U.K.</li>
<li id="BZSPRs">
<strong>10 a.m. - 1 p.m. CEST</strong> for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="TI0AFn">
<strong>5 p.m. - 8 p.m. JST</strong> on Japan/Tokyo</li>

<hr id="Vt4bPg">
<h2 id="HwO1KL"><strong>What to expect in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3</strong></h2>
<p id="2Z0gDJ">So far, the known quantities for <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 3 are the name (‚ÄúWrecked‚Äù) and the much-ballyhooed Fallout collaboration, which will see you get your hands on some Power Armor. Whether this is an item or a skin is yet to be confirmed, but you can briefly see it in action in the following embedded post on X:</p>

<p id="S51BT1">Elsewhere, an official teaser trailer suggests a sandstorm will bring about an apocalyptic desert theme:</p>
<div id="JTlulA"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZEBEWByhvwk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="3G8mjH">Meanwhile, the <em>Fortnite</em> X account teased the possibility of a new bus, replete with video footage of a (real) monster truck jumping over a (real?) bus. This dovetails with what longtime <em>Fortnite</em> leaker ShiinaBR (who has a sturdy track record for this sort of thing) <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1791879277278847265">said on X</a>: that monster trucks are coming to <em>Fortnite</em> as of Chapter 5 Season 3.</p>

<p id="ALK5r8">Tying into all of the above, datamines from the <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1790029042264997986">HYPEX account on X</a> suggest ‚Äúsand landmarks‚Äù or a dedicated desert biome, as well as a steam train makeover for the map‚Äôs snaking locomotive.</p>
<p id="5ra1Sb">There‚Äôs also the suggestion of collaborations with Metallica, Fall Guys, and Pirates of the Caribbean. That said, based on the game‚Äôs track record, take these tie-ins with a pinch of salt ‚Äî and if they do appear, could be in non-battle royale modes, and / or will appear later in the season.</p>
<div id="9J7KrF">
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>SEASON 3 INFO &amp; LEAKS SO FAR  </p><p>‚Ä¢ THEME &amp; DATE: Post-Apocalyptic / May 24th<br>‚Ä¢ COLLABS: Metallica, Fall Guys, Pirates of the Caribbean &amp; More..<br>‚Ä¢ UI UPDATES: Each item in the shop will have its own timer<br>‚Ä¢ Lead-up Mini Event with a huge sandstorm &amp; lightning<br>‚Ä¢ Sand Landmarks‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/r40pYAPMnV">pic.twitter.com/r40pYAPMnV</a></p></div>‚Äî HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1790029042264997986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2024</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="pKLwhX">There‚Äôs plenty to look forward to then. The other thing of note ‚Äî and this is pure speculation on our part ‚Äî is the season launches day-in-date with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa</em></a>, making it primed for a possible Mad Max crossover. There has been no indication of that so far (from developer Epic Games or otherwise) but we‚Äôd be surprised if that doesn‚Äôt appear at <em>some</em> point.</p>

			<p>It's been nearly three years since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-leak-lists-final-fantasy-vii-ix-remake-half-life-2-remastered-mgs2-hd-and-lots-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memorable GeForce NOW leak</a> confirmed the existence of a Final Fantasy IX Remake. While most of the games included in NVIDIA's list ended up being announced, some of them never were.</p>
<p>This includes the remake of the ninth mainline entry in Square Enix's Final Fantasy series. However, rumors have persisted despite the lack of any official announcement. In early June 2023, a leaker on ResetEra suggested Final Fantasy IX Remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-playstation-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would be a PlayStation exclusive</a> featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-traditional-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional gameplay</a> instead of the action combat used for the Final Fantasy VII Remake. That same leaker <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-ready-release-prettier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the game was almost ready to be released and would sport updated models and prettier graphics, although it was not a big-budget remake like Final Fantasy VII. Around two months ago, another leaker <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that he heard the same - it will be a faithful remake with a relatively modest budget.</p>
<p>Yesterday, leaked Midori joined the chorus, <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1792748529418682523" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirming</a> that Final Fantasy IX Remake is indeed in development at Square Enix. However, the Final Fantasy X Remake is not, at least for now.</p>
<p>Midori first gained credit <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-games-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a SEGA leaker</a>, but recently also <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-botw-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> about Nintendo possibly making a new version of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the upcoming Switch 2 console. This is the first time Midori provided a Square Enix leak.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Final Fantasy IX originally launched in 2000 for Sony's PlayStation 2 console. It returned the franchise to a medieval setting called Gaia, following the futuristic worlds seen in the previous installments. In the story, players follow a thief named Zidane Tribal, who kidnaps Princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII as part of a ploy by the neighboring nation of Lindblum. He joins Garnet and a growing cast of characters on a quest to bring down her mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria, who started the war.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy IX Remake could debut at the next PlayStation Showcase, which is expected to air sometime next week.</p>

<p>"I'm thrilled to join Amazon Games at a time when the team is actively building across an exciting roadmap," said Pana.</p>
<p>"I've built and led outstanding teams in the past and I know this area of Europe is a hot spot for some of the very best talent in gaming."</p>

			<p>INGAME STUDIOS announced that its 'organized crime shooter' Crime Boss: Rockay City will land <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933080/Crime_Boss_Rockay_City/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> on June 18 after around fifteen months of Epic Games Store exclusivity on PC.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new DLC called Cagnali‚Äôs Order will drop on all platforms (PC and consoles). The expansion pack includes four dystopian missions in which the Rockay City Police Department is joined by an evil mega-corporation's robotic police squad. Bursting with new enemies, a new boss, and playable characters, Cagnali‚Äôs Order forms the backbone of the expansion package (which also includes a reworked gaming system, levels, weapons packs, heists, and more).</p>

<p>As I <a href="https://wccftech.com/crime-boss-rockay-city-feels-like-a-half-baked-rushed-heist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> when the game first launched in late March 2023, Crime Boss: Rockay City felt very rushed at the time. However, INGAME STUDIOS has since released many free updates that improved the game. Jarek Kol√°≈ô, Head of Development at INGAME Studios, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We are so thankful to the growing community for sticking with Crime Boss as we work tirelessly to improve and build upon the game. Crime Boss: Rockay City coming to Steam is another huge leap forward for the game, and we welcome people to revisit Rockay with fresh eyes. We‚Äôre so excited for the future of Crime Boss.</em></p>
<p>There's also a special offer for Steam users: for a limited time, Cagnali's Order and the previous DLCs (Dragon‚Äôs Gold Cup, Heavy Hitters Weapon Pack, and Tactical Weapon Pack) will be available for free.</p>
<p>The developers have also promised to release more content throughout this year and the next. There's even a roadmap available <a href="https://visitrockaycity.com/roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>. Update 10, titled Baker's Angels, is said to add unique boss skins and more, while Update 11 (Legends) will introduce new characters, among other things. Update 12 (Nightmare) will add a Horde mode to Crime Boss: Rockay City. Lastly, Q1 2025 will see the release of a new multiplayer missions and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-shows-off-impressive-unreal-engine-5-black-hawk-down-campaign-teaser/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tencent's Team Jade (formerly known as TiMi Studio Group) has released a brief Summer Game Fest teaser for its upcoming tactical first-person shooter Delta Force: Hawk Ops. A special stream event is scheduled for June 7th at 14:00 PDT, and the game will be playable during Summer Game Fest Play Days from June 8th to June 10th.</p>
<p>The video teaser is focused on the game's 'Black Hawk Down' campaign mode, which is being developed with Unreal Engine 5. Weirdly enough, that won't be true for the other two modes available in Delta Force: Hawk Ops, which will presumably be made in Unreal Engine 4 instead.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Large-Scale PvP Mode - Havoc Warfare:</strong> Compete as part of a large team on massive maps, featuring authentic terrains and including military vehicles, tanks and helicopters in a grand war.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Extraction Mode - Hazard Operations:</strong> Squad up and take on other teams or AI-controlled mercenaries and royal guards in the Hazard Operations, the most tactical take on the popular extraction genre to date. Random events across massive maps will keep players engaged, as well as selecting challenging PvE-focused missions as part of the experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>While Delta Force: Hawk Ops is scheduled to launch as a free-to-play game on PC, consoles, and mobile, the Black Hawk Down campaign mode will be only available on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>On PC, NVIDIA RTX owners <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-coming-to-project-mugen-delta-force-hawk-ops-out-now-in-fort-solis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can look forward to DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation support</a>.</p>
