            <p>
Nintendo will no longer launch its Alarmo alarm clock to the general public this January within Japan, the company has said, blaming its "production and inventory situation".
</p>
<p>
Alarmo has been available for several months here in Europe, and in America, but only to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. In Japan, the popularity of the product - and the lack of stock - led Nintendo to open a lottery for subscribers to get a chance of obtaining one.
</p>
<p>
A wider launch for Alarmo had been set for January worldwide, but Nintendo has now <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2024/1204.html">said</a> this won't happen - at least in Japan. Eurogamer has asked Nintendo UK whether there has been any similar impact to the company's European plans.

<p>
There's no word yet on when Alarmo's postponed public launch will actually occur in Japan. As it is, Nintendo Switch Online subscribers in the country who pre-order an Alarmo from mid-December face a wait for delivery until February 2025.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's stock issues come as the company quietly prepares for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. Nintendo is yet to make any comment on the device's manufacturing or production schedule, but has said it will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">publicly unveil the console before the end of March 2025</a>.  Last month, an analyst told Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">the "ship had sailed" on Nintendo lifting the lid this year</a>.
</p>
<p>
After a couple of weeks waking up to Alarmo each morning, I ultimately decided its fun probably wasn't worth the £99 price tag, despite an array of tunes themed around <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a>, Mario, Zelda and other top franchises.</p>
<p>
  "Alarmo's clever motion sensor is the star of the show in this pricey Nintendo-coated lifestyle gadget that otherwise skimps on the fun," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-review-marios-charm-cant-justify-alarm-clocks-90-price-tag">Eurogamer's Nintendo Alarmo review</a>.

					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch</span>

			<p>Since Hironobu Sakaguchi left Square Enix to create his own development studio, Mistwalker, the Final Fantasy series has never been the same. Although debating the quality of individual titles past the ninth entry in the series, the last the franchise's creator worked on, has never produced an actual consensus, there's no denying that the little spark that made Final Fantasy one of the most loved Japanese role-playing game series ever made went away together with the series creator.</p>
<p>This has been made painfully clear by <a href="https://wccftech.com/fantasian-neo-dimension-launches-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FANTASIAN</a>, Mistwalker's return to a classic JRPG formula after a while. Originally released in two parts for the Apple Arcade service, the game is effectively a Final Fantasy game in all but name, featuring an engaging turn-based combat system with a very peculiar twist that is very reminiscent of the amazing Chrono Trigger, another legendary game Sakaguchi-san contributed to make in the late 90s, a unique visual style which employs hand-made dioramas for the locations, a clear callback to the PlayStation entries in the Final Fantasy series with their pre-rendered backgrounds, charming characters and a beautiful soundtrack created by Nobuo Uematsu, the man behind the soundtrack of the vast majority of Final Fantasy games.</p>
<p>All the above contributed to making FANTASIAN the best JRPG that only a few played due to the fact that it has stayed as an Apple Arcade exclusive up until the release of <a href="https://fantasianneodimension.square-enix-games.com/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FANTASIAN Neo Dimension</a>, an enhanced port that is a worthwhile purchase for both JRPG fans and those few who already experienced the original Apple Arcade release, thanks to some welcome additions and tweaks over the original.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241119111309_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The world of FANTASIAN Neo Dimension is far from a world at peace. A deathly mechanical infection called Mechteria, which robs humans of their emotions before taking their lives, is spreading at an alarming rate all over the world, and there's little humanity can do to prevent it from spreading any further. The only one who has the chance to save the world is the young amnesiac boy called Leo, who begins the adventure in a strange land filled with machines. Narrowingly making his escape from the machines that wanted him dead, Leo finds himself back into the world of humans with no recollection of his past.</p>
<p>After a fortuitous encounter, the young protagonist starts understanding that his past is way more complicated than that of any regular boy and that his destiny is deeply intertwined with the Mechteria infection and the mysterious being known as Vam, the Malevolent. By traveling the world together with the companions he will meet on almost every step of his journey, Leo not only gets to remember his past and understand his destiny but will also embark on yet another journey spanning multiple dimensions to get rid of an evil that threatens to swallow all.</p>
<p>FANTASIAN Neo Dimension's story is among the most JRPG stories we have seen in modern games, featuring almost every single trope the genre has featured up until this point. Despite this, Mistwalker made it rather endearing, with some solid writing that brings about some extremely emotional moments here and there. These emotional moments are mostly confined to memories, special events featuring beautiful hand-drawn sequences that cover events that happened before the story began, but they do an excellent job rounding up the tone of the adventure, which is generally on the lighthearted side.</p>
<p>While ultimately, the FANTASIAN Neo Dimension story treads some very familiar ground, it's the characters that truly elevate the experience. Every member of the cast is rather likable, and their interactions help develop them considerably. Cheryl's interactions with Leo, for example, are quite good and give both characters a little more depth beyond the tropes of the headstrong princess and amnesiac adventurer they wholly embrace.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241120113805_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Besides going full-in with tropes, albeit in a compelling way, Mistwalker did not shy away from going full-in with references to the Final Fantasy series in FANTASIAN Neo Dimension as well. Listing all of them would take a long time, but just in the first few hours of the adventure, you will get to understand how Leo is not all that different from thieves like Locke and Zidane, although he isn't as likable as either of them, how Kina is Aerith in not-so-effective disguise (their color pattern is essentially the same as well), how the short battle against Sebastian is a clear callback to the legendary battle between Edward and Tellah only lacking a spoony bard and so on. As a long-time fan of the Square Enix series and Hironobu Saguchi, I really enjoyed spotting these references, which made the adventure even more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Even in regards to gameplay, FANTASIAN Neo Dimension doesn't exactly push the boundaries of the genre. On the contrary, it fully embraces them, only providing some twists that make the experience feel instantly familiar yet engaging. The first half of the adventure sees a linear story progression that brings Leo and his companions from one place to another, but this is completely shaken up in the second half with the introduction of non-linear progression reminiscent of the second half of Final Fantasy VI. Players can technically go whenever they want but have to look out for very powerful enemies and bosses, as the challenge level increases considerably over the first half.&nbsp; The story is told in a slightly different manner and has a slightly increased focus on the characters and their personal journeys, but overall, the experience holds itself up pretty well, although those who prefer a tighter pacing will inevitably feel a little more disappointed.</p>
<p>Regarding actual exploration of the game's many locations rendered with the aforementioned gorgeous hand-made dioramas, FANTASIAN Neo Dimension doesn't do anything different than the PlayStation-era Final Fantasy games have done. Both towns and dungeons are generally on the small side, which is not surprising given the mobile origins of the game, and feature the usual selection of treasure chests, some of them requiring keys to open and simple puzzles. Unlike the aforementioned Final Fantasy games, however, the camera is way more dynamic on the field, which allowed the developers to add more secrets inside locations</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241122180357_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Just like a classic JRPG, FANTASIAN Neo Dimension features random enemy encounters but with a twist that gives players control over when to fight. Shortly after the beginning of the adventure, the Dimengeon system will be unlocked, allowing Leo to send enemies that haven't been encountered for the first time to a parallel dimension where they are stored until defeated. As the Dimengeon system features a limited capacity, there will always come a time when enemies must be fought, so it is not possible to use the system to completely get rid of random enemy encounters. However, it is always a good idea to take advantage of this unique game mechanic, as it is in these Dimengeon battles against huge enemy numbers that the turn-based combat system shines.</p>
<p>The one mechanic that defines the FANTASIAN Neo Dimension combat system is the ability to aim certain skills to hit multiple enemies. Spells like Holy or Ice, for example, can also be curved using the upper and lower boundaries of combat arenas to hit multiple enemies or targets that sometimes wouldn't be possible. This system, which is somewhat reminiscent of Chrono Trigger with skills having different ranges and areas of effect, truly shines in Dimengeon battles not only due to the massive amount of enemies but also because it is possible to destroy some special objects that randomly appear on the battlefield that grant a variety of beneficial effects, such as an increased attack, getting an additional turn and so on. This way, it is possible to manipulate the turn order somewhat and make these battles more manageable and, ultimately, more fun. For boss battles, it is not possible to use the Dimengeon system, and they must be fought with no option to escape or postpone the confrontation. These battles are generally well put together, challenging the player's knowledge of the game mechanics in plenty of different ways. Unfortunately, they become a little stale as the adventure proceeds due to the excessive use of the "Mode Change" mechanics that power the bosses up briefly and force a more defensive approach, but the challenge level they usually present still makes them engaging.</p>
<p>While the combat system wasn't changed in FANTASIAN Neo Dimension over the original Apple Arcade release, I feel the new version of the game will be more enjoyable than the original for the vast majority of players thanks to the introduction of multiple difficulty options. The original game was a rather challenging experience, but in Neo Dimension, the challenge level has been toned down with the introduction of a Normal, more manageable difficulty setting, relegating the original balance to the Hard difficulty setting. No matter the difficulty setting, the game still offers a decent level of challenge, so things are never a walk in the park, especially in boss battles in the more open-ended second half of the game, where they become more like puzzles than actual battles. In the original Apple Arcade release, these battles were way too difficult, but with the new difficulty setting, they are more manageable without too much grinding with the proper building of characters</p>
<p>Character building and progression in FANTASIAN Neo Dimension follows the same trajectory of the story. In the first half, the only customization options are granted by equipment and jewels that can grant a variety of passive skills. Later on, the character-building options expand a lot with the introduction of the Growth Maps granted by Divine Artifacts. These big skill trees feature a lot of different nodes containing a variety of skills that allow for the creation of more specialized builds to take on the challenge Leo and his companions will have to overcome after reaching the Chaos Realm. The game incentivizes experimentation by allowing players to reset each Growth Map at no cost straight from the menu. So, if any boss battle proves to be too much, it is possible to try out different strategies with different character builds with little to no hassle.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241127190422_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The jump from iOS devices to PC and consoles hasn't changed FANTASIAN Neo Dimension's presentation in any significant way, for better or worse. While the dioramas continue to look stunning at every resolution, the character models, while personable and detailed enough, do look on the simple side, bringing to mind the models used for characters in JRPG from a couple of console generations back. The interface hasn't seen any major change over the original release, although it remains functional even with regular controls, including mouse and keyboard controls on PC that work surprisingly well, especially in battle, as aiming skills with the mouse pointer feel way better than doing the same with any controller.</p>
<p>Being a remaster of a mobile game, FANTASIAN Neo Dimension should run well on the vast majority of system configurations. The machine used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080 GPU, 32 GB RAM) was overkill for the game, considering the official recommended specs, so it had no trouble running the game at 4K resolution, High Graphics Quality preset and locked 120 FPS. The graphics options available are limited so there's not much room for tweaking, but this is hardly surprising, considering the type of visuals involved.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241128111220_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Besides a new gameplay balance and 4K resolution support on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X, the vast majority of changes introduced in FANTASIAN Neo Dimension over the original Apple Arcade release pertain to the audio experience. While there is no real reason not to listen to the amazing soundtrack created by Nobuo Uematsu, the new version of the game allows players to change the battle music with tracks lifted from other entries in the series, including Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth, the Pixel Remasters, Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy XIV expansions Endwalker and Dawntrail. Tracks can even be changed during battles themselves, giving players great flexibility. The remaster also introduces new English and Japanese voiceovers that are well done and enhance the story presentation quite a bit.</p>
<p>Instead of attempting to do away with the tropes that have dominated the genre for a very long time, FANTASIAN Neo Dimension fully embraces them to deliver a compelling experience that feels markedly "Final Fantasy" without being an actual part of the&nbsp;series. The story, as a whole, may not be anything special, but the little interactions between the characters, some emotional moments, and the solid combat system, which only improves as the adventure proceeds and the challenge level increases, make for one of the best JRPGs released in the past few years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24312363/fantasian-xbox-ps5-switch-pc-launch-hironobu-sakaguchi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fantasian</em> was an easy game to recommend <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad">when it launched in 2021</a>. Developed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"><em>Final Fantasy</em> creator Hironobu Sakaguchi’s Mistwalker studio</a>, <em>Fantasian</em> was an approachable old-school roleplaying game that had a lot of clever ideas, along with an adorable aesthetic thanks to its world made out of hand-crafted dioramas. There was just one problem: it was exclusive to Apple Arcade, so anyone who wasn’t a subscriber missed out. Now, that has finally changed as the game launches this week on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and the Switch.</p><p>The new port is called <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>, but it’s mostly identical to the Apple Arcade version, aside from the very welcome addition of voice acting. (In a nice bit of circular storytelling, <em>Neo Dimension</em> is being published by <em>Final Fantasy</em> maker Square Enix.) In many ways, <em>Fantasian</em> is classic <em>Final Fantasy</em> in all but name. It stars a hero named Leo, who — with the help of a tough princess, a mysterious magic wielder, and a grizzled ship captain — gets pulled into a quest that spans multiple realms, as they attempt to thwart a mechanical infestation led by a tall, dark, and dangerous villain.</p><p>There’s plenty that <em>Final Fantasy</em> fans will recognize: the amnesiac lead character, the playful love triangle, a world that blends fantasy and sci-fi, similar spells and items, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586744/fantasian-soundtrack-apple-music-nobuo-uematsu">a beautiful soundtrack from famed composer Nobuo Uematsu</a>. Hell, there’s even <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_EU/news/final-fantasy-cid">a character named Sid</a>. The basis of <em>Fantasian</em> is Sakaguchi and his team working with the framework they know but building on top of it in interesting ways. So you’re left with a rock-solid RPG that makes some nice tweaks to the formula.</p><p>The most obvious difference is the visual style, which is like a hand-crafted take on the old prerendered backgrounds from PlayStation-era <em>Final Fantasy</em>. It lends the game a very tactile aesthetic, and it’s surprisingly flexible; there are warm and cozy forests and cabins but also cold mechanical areas made of metal and old circuit boards. And while the game has its origins on mobile, it still looks sharp and clear on console. I’ve been replaying it on the Switch, and the only issue has been the occasionally long load time before a battle.</p><p><em>Fantasian</em> also makes some tweaks to the turn-based RPG formula that make it both more approachable and less frustrating. The first is a fun twist on combat that lets you aim many of your attacks, which can be incredibly satisfying when you line things up <em>just right</em> and hit a whole bunch of enemies in one shot.</p><p>Even more useful is the awkwardly named feature Dimengeon — a portmanteau of dungeon and dimension — which takes the sting out of random battles. When you have it switched on, those pesky monsters are zapped to another dimension, where you can battle them at your leisure. The twist is that they accumulate. So when the device fills up and you have to finally fight them, you can get into a battle against a whole bunch of bad guys at once. These fights have a strategic, almost puzzle-like feel.</p><p>Those seemingly subtle tweaks are more than enough to make <em>Fantasian</em> an easy recommendation if you’re looking for a classic RPG. Much like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">the recent remake of <em>Dragon Quest III</em></a>, a large part of the appeal of <em>Fantasian</em> is how traditional it is, while smoothing out the rough edges that can make the genre feel clunky and tedious. And as <em>Final Fantasy</em> itself <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5">continues to expand</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5">in different ways</a>, <em>Fantasian</em> is a comforting look back at how things used to be.</p><p><small>Fantasian Neo Dimension <em>launches on December 5th on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and the Switch.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-about-xdefiant-closure-and-the-future-of-ubisoft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closure of XDefiant and its studios</a>, Yves Guillemet sent an internal memo to Ubisoft employees about its future.</p>



<p>The internal memo reads,</p>



<p>“Hello everyone, </p>



<p>It has been some time since I last spoke to you, and I apologize for this silence, especially as the past months have been challenging and unsettling for Ubisoft and likely for each of you. </p>



<p>The announcement by Marie-Sophie regarding the discontinuation of XDefiant, the closure of the San Francisco and Osaka studios, and the ramp down of the Sydney production site is among the difficult decisions we’ve had to make. </p>



<p>I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the tremendous work done by the XDefiant’s teams. Their goal was to challenge the best shooter on the market, but despite the intensity of their efforts, it was not enough. </p>



<p>To everyone leaving Ubisoft, I want to express my deepest gratitude for the work you have accomplished and the contributions you have made. We will do everything possible to provide you with the best support during this transition phase. </p>



<p>We wanted to take a firm and clear decision to enable us to concentrate our investments and forces on more profitable projects. </p>



<p>I am well aware that, given the current context, such announcements may worry you, and that’s understandable. The entire industry is facing similar difficult decisions, yet often the scale of the impact is much larger. Our organization has allowed us to limit the impact of these kinds of decisions and make more targeted restructurings, and all our efforts are focused on trying to maintain this course and philosophy. We will continue working on evolving our organization to adapt it to market changes, and with a long-term perspective in mind. </p>



<p>Over the past few weeks, I’ve had the chance to read the results of the Ubisoft XP 2024 survey. The vast majority of you participated: the response rate was over 86%, and you’ve shared your questions and concerns about the future of Ubisoft via more than 55,000 comments.</p>



<p> I would like to sincerely thank you for your commitment, the quality of your feedback, and your collective intelligence. It’s very impressive. We are compelled to take your critiques to heart, live up to your expectations, and be accountable to you and your needs. </p>



<p>I want you to know that all my energy is focused on finding the means to guide Ubisoft through these turbulent times. I am working tirelessly with my team to identify the best solutions so we can maintain control of our destiny. </p>



<p>This company – the incredible gem we’ve built together over the past 38 years – means everything to me. It’s a part of who I am, it’s in my core. </p>



<p>I’m doing everything I can to help us regain momentum, so that we can continue to make Ubisoft a key player in our industry, a creator known for its unique and exceptional video games. </p>



<p>In the coming days, some members of the Executive Committee will reach out to you. Cécile Russeil will share new initiatives aimed at addressing some of the questions raised by Ubisoft XP. Marie-Sophie de Waubert will present initiatives to bring back a daily focus on creation, ensuring fewer unnecessary processes and more time dedicated to what truly matters to each of us: making the best games possible. Alain Corre will provide updates on the launch of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, progress made in strengthening our relationship with gamers, particularly regarding The Crew Motorfest and Star Wars Outlaws. </p>



<p>Thank you sincerely for your daily commitment and the quality of your work. The greatest strength of Ubisoft is its people. That strength is you. Thank you. </p>



<p>Yves”</p>







<p>Yves’ email came following the internal announcement from Marie-Sophie de Waubert that XDefiant and some of its studios would be closing. XDefiant’s closure will see 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney.</p>



<p>You can read Marie-Sophie de Waubert’s internal memo below:</p>



<p>Marie-Sophie</p>



<p>Hello all, Today, I wanted to share with you that we’ve made the difficult decision to discontinue development on XDefiant. </p>



<p>Despite an encouraging start, the team’s passionate work, and a committed fan base, we’ve not been able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market. As a result, the game is too far away from reaching the results required to enable further significant investment, and we are announcing that we will be sunsetting it. </p>



<p>Concretely, that means that as of today, new downloads, player registrations and purchases will no longer be available. Season 3 will still launch, and the servers will remain active until June 3, 2025, out of appreciation for both our dev teams who worked on it and for XDefiant’s active players. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the discontinuation of XDefiant brings difficult consequences for the teams working on this game. Even if almost half of the XDefiant team worldwide will be transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft, this decision also leads to the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney. To those team members leaving Ubisoft, I want to express my deepest gratitude for your work and contributions. Please know that we are committed to supporting you during this transition. </p>



<p>Developing Games-as-a-Service experiences remains a pillar of our strategy, and we’ve achieved significant successes, like Rainbow Six, The Crew, and For Honor, among others. It’s a highly competitive market, and we will apply the lessons learned with XDefiant to our future live titles. </p>



<p>Globally, we are determined to take the necessary steps to put the company back on a path to growth, innovation and creativity and make sure we can set you up for success. This means continuing to radically evolve our mindset for Production and Business practices, which we will share more about soon, and doing targeted restructuring when necessary. I know that the situation brings questions and expectations, and we will share regular and transparent updates. </p>



<p>My sincere thanks for your continued dedication as we navigate these trying times together. </p>



<p>Marie-Sophie”</p>

<p>UFL is finally making its way to the pitch with a full Trophies and Achievements list. The free-to-play soccer title is looking to rival the best in the business, and while competing on the pitch, you also need to be as adept off it if you want every UFL Achievement and Trophy.</p>



<p>Multiple betas and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ufl-launch-delayed-strikerz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushbacks</a> later, and it’s time for UFL to make its mark. The new kid on the block wants to disrupt an established market dominated by the same two names—EA FC and eFootball. Using the last few years of the Premier League as an example, EA FC is Manchester City, and eFootball is Liverpool—which hurts to say as a Liverpool fan. The point is that few others have laid down a creditable title challenge, and this is where UFL steps in.</p>



<p>With high-profile investors on board—including Cristiano Ronaldo—UFL is looking to shake things up, and its Achievements and Trophies list is sure to appeal to many.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-trophies-amp-achievements-in-ufl">How Many Trophies &amp; Achievements in UFL?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Many matches come down to the wire. Credit to Strikerz Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>UFL has 25 Xbox Achievements and a further 26 PlayStation Trophies to obtain in the soccer simulation title.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re on PlayStation, you get an extra intangible award thanks to the Platinum Trophy. This is awarded once you complete the other 25 Trophies on the list. Xbox players simply get to pat themself on the back once they bag the 25th and final Achievement!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-ufl-achievement-amp-trophy">Every UFL Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<p>Many of the UFL Trophies and Achievements are standard objectives for what you’d find in a game like this. Completing Ranked Matches, changing tactics, and being active in the transfer market all reward you with Achievements and Trophies.</p>



<p>Check out the full UFL list in its entirety—thanks to <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/UFL/achievements#:~:text=Here%20is%20the%20full%20list%20of%20all%2025,squad.%20Add%20your%20squad%27s%20third%20kit%20in%20Customization." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TrueAchievements</a>.</p>

            <p>Walton Goggins has slipped back into his Ghoulish guise to start filming the second season of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the actor - who also starred in the Alicia Vikander-fronted Tomb Raider film - shared a close up of the show's prosthetic team applying the Ghoul's leathery, nuclear worn skin on Instagram.</p>
<p>"Back in the saddle," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDIoolhy1wl/?igsh=MTRhNGhlNXE1ZXV1dg%3D%3D">Goggins</a> accompanied the post. "Gatdamn it feels good to slip on this skin. I do this shit for the love of the Game."</p>

<p>When promoting Fallout's first season earlier this year, Goggins revealed it took about nine months to get the Ghoul's prosthetics right for the show. Then, when the team eventually landed on the look they wanted, the initial application took five hours. Eventually, however, Fallout's special effects artist Jake Garber managed to cut this down to an hour and 45 minutes.</p>
<p>"I couldn't close my eyes. I had to sit in one place the whole time. So I just would put on a Western and just did research," <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/fallout-ghoul-explained-walton-goggins-interview/">Goggins</a> said in April, when discussing his Ghoulish ensemble.</p>

<p>Fallout was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">renewed for a second season</a> in April, with showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner later stating the team was "going to be pedal to the metal to get season two out as fast as humanly possible".</p>
<p>"We've got a lot of heavy lifting from season one already done.

<p>It was recently revealed that Home Alone's Macaulay Culkin had joined the cast for season two of Fallout, in a recurring role. Further details on his part remain slim for now, however <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-series-second-season-lands-home-alone-star">Culkin is said to be playing "a crazy genius-type character"</a> when the show's second season rolls around.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Given the accolades and sales of FromSoftware’s Elden Ring you may have assumed that a sequel would be on the cards, but that is not the case. At the PlayStation Partner Awards 2024 Japan Asia, Elden Ring director and FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki was asked if a second game was being planned.</p>
<p>“We’re not really considering developments such as an Elden Ring 2,” said Miyazaki, but then acknowledge that they may work on the sequel in the future. He also suggested the franchise could continue in another form such as a movie or animated series.</p>


<p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was released this year, a massive expansion to the original game. We reviewed and found it slightly lacking, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/">scoring it 7/10.</a></p>
<p>“I find myself wishing Shadow of the Erdtree had a continuation from one of the endings of Elden Ring, or ventured back to explore the Shattering itself,” said self proclaimed Elden Ring fan Jason. “Instead, it feels like a filler episode in Naruto. Sure, the fights are cool, and there’s a new progression system to work through, but what is the point if nobody is going to acknowledge it again for the rest of the series. But hey, at least the Convergence Mod team will have a field day with all of this new stuff to play with.”</p>
<p>The expansion is so big that this years The Game Awards have decided that it’s not DLC and in fact a new game, and is a contender for this years Game of the Year award.&nbsp; This year’s event takes place on December 13th 2024 with Astro Bot leading the nominations with seven nods.</p>

<p>A<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/elden-ring-patch-1-14-decreases-shadow-of-the-erdtree-final-boss-stats/"> patch released</a> for the game addressed issues players raised about the difficulty of the final boss in Shadow of the Erdtree, nerfing their attack damage, attack stamina, and attack range.</p>

            <p>Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-30th-anniversary">week-long coverage of PlayStation's 30th anniversary</a> continues today with the concluding half of our special Shawn Layden interview, this time discussing the future of PlayStation and video game consoles as we know them today.
</p>
<p>Where will PlayStation be in another 30 years? The end of consoles has long been prophesised, but at a time of spiralling AAA game budgets, £700 premium upgrades and an audience leaving for TikTok, the thought of us sitting here in 2054 celebrating PS9 seems increasingly unlikely. </p>
<p>So where does the console games industry go from here? How do you counter those enormous budgets? How can games change? And have we got to the point where, to a large extent, the hardware we play on doesn't matter? Read on for more insight from Shawn Layden, former chairman of PlayStation Worldwide Studios, and a definitive response on whether he thinks PlayStation will ever launch games on Xbox. </p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about the video game industry currently? You've mentioned not seeing innovative new games like PaRappa the Rapper anymore. Where are the new genres?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> I guess you get new genre activity at the indies level, where there's more risk tolerance. You have got to take the risk, otherwise you're not gonna get anywhere. But I'm afraid that the current cost of game development, with AAA console titles costing in the hundreds of millions, squeezes risk tolerance out of the room. </p>
<blockquote>'Show me how the trend line is going to be exactly like Grand Theft Auto'</blockquote>
<p>If you're looking at something that's going to clock in at $160m to produce, the immediate reaction of the finance guys is, 'okay, what is that comparable to? How are you going to make me feel better? Can you show me how the trend line is going to be exactly like Grand Theft Auto, so then I can feel fine putting money behind it?' It results in a lot of copycats, a lot of sequels. 'Give me GTA 7, because I know how to plot that course.'</p>
<p>It's squeezing, I think, creativity out at the high end and that's a problem. On PS1 and PS2, one unit of hardware could sell 25 games. With PS3 and PS4, largely due to the network effect of people getting online, it's much lower. Once you're in your online world with your online friends, you don't leave. I have a son and I don't think FIFA ever leaves his machine. I think it's permanently embedded inside his PS5. And if you go down the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> rabbit hole or the Warzone rabbit hole, you don't play a lot of other games. So I'm concerned about that lack of breadth.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>There's been discussion recently around how console generations aren't growing over time, either. Is it enough to keep selling to the same sized audience?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> So yes, if you stack it up and look at all the things that were around during the PS1 era, whether it's Saturn and N64, or the PS2 and Xbox era, no generation seems to get over 250m units of hardware, aggregate. The one time it popped is when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wii-fit">Wii Fit</a> came out and a bunch of people thought they could lose weight by buying a Nintendo [Wii]. There's that momentary Christmas, 'oh, let's lose weight' thing which shot up the console number, but then it fell back down again. </p>
<blockquote>We're not growing the next generation. We're losing the next generation to TikTok</blockquote>
<p>Even when you hear that gaming revenue went up 23 percent during the pandemic, it wasn't from new people, necessarily. It was more money from the <em>same </em>people, and this is the existential threat I talk about when I'm meeting with developers and publishers - that you're just getting more money off the same people. It's a business model I understand, and you understand, and that's fine. But we're not growing the next generation. We're losing the next generation to TikTok. The competition for gaming isn't Xbox and Nintendo. It's everything else in the freaking zeitgeist that can take your time away from your gaming activity.</p>
<p>The pandemic gave us an unnatural pop for gaming, where we thought, 'oh my god, gaming is the biggest thing in the world'. Yeah, when you're locked down, it is the biggest thing in the world. But in a regular world scenario, you've got to combat against all the other distractions that are available to young people. And I'm afraid that we're not facing that threat head on as an industry.</p>
<p><strong>So then, how do we face that threat head on as an industry?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> We need to address two or three things specifically. One thing is the exploding cost of game development. Every generation it costs twice as much to build a game. What costs $1m on PS1, then costs two, then four, then 16. It goes exponentially. The PS4 generation, which was the last I was associated with, game dev was 150m if you want to be top of the line, and that's before marketing. So by that math, PS5 games should eventually reach $300m to $400m - and that is just outright not sustainable.</p>
<blockquote>I'm afraid we've built AAA gaming into a kind of cathedral business, and it just can't grow any further</blockquote>
<p>It's like we're at the end of the 18th century, and we're realising that building cathedrals is really expensive. Can we continue to build these massive edifices to God for this incredible amount of labour and time? Or should we just build four walls and a roof, and that's a church, right? I'm afraid we've built AAA gaming into a kind of cathedral business, and it just can't grow any further. In fact, it's probably grown too far already.</p>
<p>How do we cap that? How do we bring that back? I think part of that answer is - and it sounds simplistic, but hear me out - I think games are too long. I haven't even opened <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, because I don't have 90 hours. And I'm retired and I don't have 90 hours. For the longest time, we kept banging on about '100 hours of gameplay'. 'This is going to be awesome. It's 100 hours of gameplay!' Like that's the most important thing to know. That was a metric in the early years, when the average gamer was 18 to 23. And when you're 18 to 23, you're time rich and money poor. But as the average age of the gamer moved into the late 20s, the early 30s - well, it's the opposite, right? Maybe you aren't money rich, but you're definitely time poor. So I think our approach is a mismatch to that market, to reality. </p><p>I've made a bunch of games that were 80, 90 hours long so I'll be the first to say those weren't always 100 percent quality hours. There were a lot of moments in there where I really felt 'am I running across this same field again?' I would like to see a world where you can get back to 18 to 23 hours of gameplay, but with gameplay so compelling you don't want to put the controller down. I want the entire game to be like that moment in Resident Evil where the freaking dogs come through the window and you drop your controller out of fear. I want more of those kinds of game moments, if we can bring down the scale and scope.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>It feels like each generation is getting lumbered with ever higher production costs, production values, and we're seeing a smaller selection of games as a result - at least on consoles.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> Yeah, rendering at 480p was not very expensive, but doing 4K at 60fps, that's a lot of people, a lot of time. Let's look at our obsession with photorealism, chasing that uncanny valley. From what I've seen, it's non-traversable. Don't chase that. I think a photorealistic Mario would be kind of off-putting, frankly. Or when they did that first Sonic draft for the Sonic movie with teeth.</p>
<blockquote>What would Coppola do if you walked out halfway through his movie? Is this a good use of resources?</blockquote>
<p>On PS1, our expectation walking down the street in a game was that you couldn't open every door. Now the expectation is you can go in every house, open every drawer and everything is destructible. And that's nice, but it's expensive to make that happen. We have to look at that. If only 50 percent of players see the end of your game, what about all those millions you spend on the final level, for only half the people to see it. There's so much money being put into making huge game experiences and people aren't seeing it. What would Coppola do if you walked out halfway through his movie? We have to understand - is this a good use of resources? I want a movement that gets more people to finish games, where we make it so compelling they just want to see it, and where it's not so onerous they don't have to spend three months doing it.</p>

<p><strong>Can consoles continue to exist, long-term? Xbox is already publishing to multiple platforms, and now rival consoles. Will PlayStation survive another 30 years just publishing on its own consoles and PC? Will Nintendo?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> Let's put Nintendo aside for a second, because they live in their Own Private Idaho, where the laws of physics apply in different sorts of ways. But with Xbox versus PlayStation, the Ali versus Frazier fight... Frankly, we have to start interrogating what the purpose is of a proprietary console, and whether that can continue to be true.</p>
<blockquote>We're getting to the realm, frankly, where only dogs can hear the difference</blockquote>
<p>If you look at it from my lens, which is of course the PlayStation lens, the leap from PS1 to PS2 was dramatic. I remember seeing the PS2 demo for Gran Turismo and not believing this could happen in a home console, but it did. The jump from PS2 to PS3 was also remarkable. We got to an HD standard. We got - not all, but a lot of - 60fps gameplay. It had a network capability, nascent though it was. Then PS3 to PS4 was just, like, getting the network thing done right. Then to PS5, which is a fantastic piece of kit, but the actual difference in performance... we're getting to the realm, frankly, where only dogs can hear the difference now. You're not going to see another PS1 to PS2 jump in performance - we have sort of maxed out there. If we're talking about teraflops and ray-tracing, we're already off the sheet that most people begin to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Consoles are never getting a big leap in power again?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> I don't think so. I mean, what would that leap look like? It would be perfectly-realised human actors in a game that you completely control. That could happen one day. I don't think it's going to happen in my lifetime. We're at a point now where the innovation curve on the hardware is starting to plateau, or top out. At the same time, the commoditisation of the silicon means that when you open up an Xbox or Playstation, it's really pretty much the same chipset. It's all built by AMD. Each company has their own OS and proprietary secret sauce, but in essence [it's the same]. I think we're pretty much close to final spec for what a console could be.</p>
<p><strong>It almost sounds like you're calling a truce to the console wars.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> Well... You're not as old as I am, obviously, but you've read stories about something called VHS versus Betamax, right?</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p><strong>My dad had a Betamax at home when I was growing up, and as I'm saying this I realise this is going to make you feel old. [For our younger readers, Betamax was Sony's less successful answer to VHS.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> [Laughs] Thanks to your dad. So, one of the first jobs I had when I joined Sony in 1987 was in the PR department in Tokyo, and one of the first things I had to write was a corporate statement about why Sony was going to start building VHS recorders and how we weren't abandoning Betamax. We were just 'expanding our offerings to our consumers to fit their lifestyle needs'. But that's what happened. And my whole life has now gone full circle, because when you have competing formats, competing platforms, competing technologies, there comes a time when we all declare the war is over.</p>
<blockquote>Content should be the competition for publishers, not which hardware you get behind</blockquote>
<p>This is why, after the VHS vs Betamax fight, you saw industry consortiums come together for things like compact discs and then DVDs. 'This is the technology we're going to land on. These are the specs around that tech that we're going to agree to.' You might compete on price points and its aesthetics - do you want it in wood or black or orange? - but the real competition will be on its content. And content should be the competition for publishers, not which hardware you get behind. I think we're at a point where the console becomes irrelevant in the next... if not the next generation then the next <em>next </em>generation definitely.</p>
<p><strong>Consoles are now getting mid-gen upgrades, which I feel further erodes those big generational steps. You've said in the past that chasing teraflops has diminishing returns, but are they something of a niche worth investing in?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> The first time Sony really did a mid-range upgrade was PlayStation 4 Pro - because up until then new versions of its consoles usually were where we brought the cost down. We used fewer parts, you got a better, more compact footprint. It was smaller and cheaper. PS4 Pro was the first time we said 'OK, instead of continuing to reduce the size and the cost of the standard model, we have some tech here. We have some abilities to take the current PS4 game library and juice it up'. I think it worked really well on PS4. I think there was also some market pricing that made it an easier transition from your standard PS4 to get a Pro three years later. But again, now we're all chasing that diminishing returns point where I'm unsure if people can really tell the difference. </p>
<blockquote>It's a connoisseur market, shall we say</blockquote>
<p>If you're playing your game with your curtains open and the sunlight is hitting against your OLED, you're not seeing any ray-tracing in real-world scenarios. It's really hard to get the full impact of some of these innovations without having the perfect viewing experience. We're going into the mid-gen now with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> at a robust price point, so to speak, and it remains to be seen who the market is for that. I think it's a connoisseur market, shall we say.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of competing for content, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">PlayStation and Kadokawa Corporation look ready to tie the knot</a>, meaning Sony likely owns FromSoftware and could decide exclusivity for the next Elden Ring. What are your thoughts there?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> The two companies have always been close. The FromSoftware association goes back to the early days of PlayStation, they were one of the launch partners, coming out with games back then. And then if you look at the board of directors, historically there's been a number of Sony people who've served on boards at Kadokawa, that type of thing. They're not strangers, that's for sure. I don't know what the timeline is on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> 2, I'm sure it's a bit down the pike.</p>

<p><strong>If console hardware becomes somewhat irrelevant, does competing on content see Sony putting PlayStation games on Xbox, as Microsoft has done on PlayStation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> I don't know what the business imperative would be to do that.</p>
<p>Playstation has been the leader for almost every generation it's been in. You talk about Xbox 360 being a huge competitor with PS3 and, for a while... they got out the gate sooner, they grew a large market. But in the end PlayStation fought to a tie in America and the UK. With Xbox 360 we look at a global footprint and PlayStation is far and away the global leader, because it is the leading platform in 170 countries around the world. Microsoft never had that kind of global reach, so they could never build a global market to the scale that PlayStation does.</p>
<blockquote>You know the Sony fanbase gets really upset whenever a game comes out on PC</blockquote>
<p>So the question you're asking is: should PlayStation, with that huge market lead and the momentum, apparently, going forward, should they build versions of their games to run on a competing platform of much smaller size and scale? As the saying goes, I don't know if the juice is worth the squeeze. How many additional sales would they get versus the brand impact, all the aggro? You know the Sony fanbase gets really upset whenever a game comes out on PC, 18 months after the original release on PlayStation. I never understood that aggro but, you know, it's there. And if that's what they're going to say about a PC release, just imagine what the market would say about Xbox releases from PlayStation Studios.</p>
<p><strong>How about PlayStation games on Nintendo, then? We've just seen Lego Horizon Adventures arrive there, which was a first.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> Historically, PlayStation and Nintendo platforms have lived happily side by side in living rooms across the world. It's almost like a natural pairing.</p>
<p><strong>It sounds like Sony might have finally forgiven Nintendo for leaving them at the altar.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layden:</strong> You know, success is the best revenge.</p>

			<p>GSC Game World has released a new patch for STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. Update 1.0.3 continues with the crash and bug fixes, following the initial fixes introduced with <a href="https://wccftech.com/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-heart-of-chornobyl-receives-two-patches-focused-on-bug-fixes-optimizations-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updates 1.0.1 and 1.0.2</a>. Take a look at the full changelog below:</p>

<p><em>Additionally, default values of mouse sensitivity were updated to allow a predictable default experience for our players with new values of two parameters mentioned below:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Camera sensitivity: 25%.</em></li>
<li><em>Aim sensitivity: 15%.</em></li>
</ul>

<ul>

</ul>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over a million units, though it is unclear how much it needs to sell to recoup its many years of development. By the way, our full review is now available <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>

			<p>Just two days before the game's official launch (the full version is scheduled for December 9, but owners of the Premium Edition can start playing on December 6), MachineGames has revealed the official PC system requirements for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>
<p>The game runs on the id Tech engine, which usually means a high frame rate for everyone. However, it is clear that this game's goal is different, probably due to its cinematic nature and<a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-a-spiritual-successor-to-classic-adventure-game-fate-of-atlantis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> its focus on adventure rather than shooting</a>. The system requirements are rather heavy as a whole, and they request hardware ray tracing support - the first time any triple-A game has demanded that your GPU includes this feature.</p>
<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-support-nvidia-dlss-3-5-and-full-ray-tracing-path-tracing-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew</a> the game would include full-fledged path tracing, like CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077 and Remedy's Alan Wake 2. However, its ultra PT requirements are even more demanding than those titles. Gamers will need the best CPU and GPU combination money can buy, and DLSS Frame Generation will have to be coupled with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-header">
  

        <p>Games as a service "remains a pillar of our strategy"</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft have discontinued their PvP shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a> and laid off roughly 277 employees at the studios who worked on the multiplayer game. "[We’ve] not been able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market," said Ubisoft executive Marie-Sophie de Waubert in a statement to workers that was later posted <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant">on Ubisoft's website</a>. Over half the team who worked on the game will lose their jobs at Ubi studios in San Francisco, Osaka, and Sydney. The remaining workers are "transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft." </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The multiplayer servers will stay up until June, said de Waubert, and the latest season will still be added to the game. But you won't be able to download the game and register to play, nor buy anything in-game if you currently have the shooter installed. Anything players have bought in the last 30 days will also be refunded. </p>
<p>"[This] decision also leads to the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney," says de Waubert in the post, using the soft verb "departing" to refer to her company's axing of roles, as if these people are simply stepping on a plane of their own volition. I'll add it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">the list</a>.</p>
<p>Despite increasingly clear signs that the games-as-a-service business model is risky (and for some of us <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">deeply tiring</a>), the Ubichief claims the company's focus on that won't change. She cites past support for games that struggled before becoming sustainable, such as tactical shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> and 3v3 ahistorical brawler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>.</p>
<p>"Developing Games-as-a-Service experiences remains a pillar of our strategy," says de Waubert. "It’s a highly competitive market, and we will apply the lessons learned with XDefiant to our future live titles."</p>

<p>None of that will be much comfort to the people who are out of work, I imagine. Although it is possible this is not a surprise either. Back in September <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/">a report by Insider Gaming</a> claimed management was unhappy with the game and already considering putting a bullet in it. In response to these rumours, executive producer Mark Rubin insisted XDefiant was "not dying" in an official blog post. </p><p>"No, the game is absolutely not dying," said Rubin just months ago. "We know there are things we need to improve... but the game is doing well. We just want it to do better. And we do that by addressing the concerns of our community which has always been the plan. Ubisoft is very much behind us and has allocated more resources to the team in order for us to do that.”</p>
<p>That has not proven to be the case. Ubisoft's support of the game - and its workers - lasted just over six months. Rubin's rebuttal of those early reports of discontent has since been scrubbed from Ubisoft's website, replaced with yesterday's closure news. But you can get the gist from <a href="https://kotaku.com/xdefiant-call-of-duty-fps-ubisoft-dying-rubin-road-map-1851651645">this Kotaku report</a> or see the update using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241007190908/https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/5uIKnSBuGp6nEszPe9NlfG/year-1-update">the Wayback machine</a>. </p>
<p>"Ubisoft's arena shooter XDefiant needs to do more to stand out from the crowd," said our Ollie after playing a preview build and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xdefiant-preview">walking away unconvinced</a>. It's not impossible to imagine improvements and redesigns might have seen the shooter eventually prosper. As Ubisoft themselves remind us, they have done it before with Rainbow Six Siege and For Honor. But it appears Ubisoft management no longer hope for such turnarounds. The result is clear: nearly 300 people now have to find new jobs. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> right on the cusp of release, MachineGames has revealed what you need to run the game on PC, confirming the Minimum specs as well as what their Recommended and Ultra PC builds look like.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is built on id Tech 7, the latest version of id Software’s excellent game engine, as previously seen in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-review/">Doom Eternal</a>. It’s a fully featured engine that incorporates the latest ray tracing techniques, upscaling, and more.</p>


<p>MachineGames has provided three performance targets, with Minimum aiming for 1080p60 native at the ‘Low’ preset, Recommended aiming for 1440p60 native at the “High” preset, and Ultra targeting a full 4K at 60FPS with the “Ultra” preset.</p>
<p>The main requirement to be aware of is that the game now requires a GPU with ray tracing compatibility, which means the GeForce 20 series, Radeon 6000 series and Intel’s Arc A series. It will also need at least 8GB of VRAM.</p>
<p>Here’s the full official breakdown</p>

<p>Full ray tracing is also coming to Nvidia’s 40 series, with the same graphical preset, resolution and performance targets, just with fully path traced lighting throughout the game. Everything about the system requirements remains the same outside of the GPU, which will be an RTX 4070 for Low, RTX 4080 for High and RTX 4090 for Ultra.</p>
<p>The caveat is that full ray tracing at those targets requires the use of DLSS 3 with Frame Generation and the use of Super Resolution upscaling. Path tracing is heavy work!</p>

<p>Indiana Jones is out on 9th December across PC, Xbox Series X|S and through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> with ‘day one’ access (PC Games Pass and Game Pass Ultimate). However, there’s an early access window for pre-orders coming later this week on 6th December.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft has announced that they are shutting down their free-to-play shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xdefiant">XDefiant</a>, starting the process of sunsetting the game last night with a server shutdown coming in June 2025. This announcement comes just half a year after XDefiant’s launch, though Season 3 will still happen for those who stick around.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> As a consequence of the shutdown, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant">Ubisoft is laying off 277 people</a> from their San Francisco, Osaka and Sydney teams. Around half of the global team is able to be moved on to other projects, but these three studio locations are being closed in San Francisco and Osaka, and Sydney is scaling back.</p>


<p>Here’s the timeline for the shutdown</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3rd December 2024</strong> – XDefiant delisted from digital stores, new player registrations are blocked, and players can no longer purchase any content.</li>
<li><strong>3rd June 2025</strong> – XDefiant servers will go offline, but existing players will have full access to the game and any upcoming content until this date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players who purchased the Ultimate Founder’s Pack will receive a full refund, and any purchases made within the last 30 days will also be fully refunded. This will happen within the next 8 weeks by 28th January 2025 – <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/xdefiant-our-message-to-players">see the FAQ for more details</a>.</p>
<p>Executive Producer Mark Rubin gave the following message:</p>

<p>I am, of course, heartbroken to have to be writing this post. Yes, this game has been a personal passion for me for years and yes, I know that not all challenges lead to victory, but I also want to recognize all of the developers who are being affected by this closure. Each and every one of them is a real person with a real life separate from our own and they have all put so much of their own passion into making this game. And I hope that they can be proud of what they did achieve. I know that I will always be proud and grateful to have worked with such a great team! A team that really punched above its weight class.</p>
<p>And what they achieved is truly remarkable. The early response from players when XDefiant launched was amazing—we broke internal records for the fastest game to surpass 5 million users and in the end we had over 15 million players play our game! That is something to be extremely proud of, especially considering how tough this genre is. So, thank you to all of the developers who put their passion into making this game!</p>
<p>If there’s one thing, I hope we can all take away from this experience, it’s the importance of open, honest communication between developers and players. This “player-first” mentality along with respectful, non-toxic conversations between developers and players has been one of the standout differences that made XDefiant so special. From my very first post about XDefiant, this was the vision I wanted to champion, and I hope it leaves a positive mark on how the game industry treats its players and communities.</p>
<p>To our players, THANK YOU! From the bottom of my heart, I want to express my deepest gratitude for the incredible community that has grown around XDefiant. Your passion, creativity, and dedication have inspired us every step of the way.</p>
<p>The announcement comes just half a year after the game’s launch on 21st May, with Ubisoft’s latest crack at a live service game mashing together all their Tom Clancy franchises into an arcade-y first person shooter. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/01/is-xdefiant-a-cod-killer/">At the time we said</a>, “Exactly how much stopping power XDefiant gains will depend largely on its future roadmap. Thankfully, Ubisoft is no stranger when it comes to running a successful live service, with Rainbow Six Siege making a dramatic turnaround in its first year to become one of the biggest FPS games of all time.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Ubisoft San Francisco team, it soon became clear that XDefiant strike the kind of overwhelmingly positive buzz from critics and streamers, or gain a large enough community to survive the long haul – yes, it had 5 million downloads at launch, but how many stuck around? By August, concurrent player counts were down to below 20,000. Ubisoft repeatedly waved away questions over the game’s future in the last few months, but clearly reached the conclusion that it wasn’t sustainable.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/msi%E2%80%99s-upgraded-claw-ai-handhelds-are-available-now-but-they%E2%80%99re-expensive.1051371/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/msi-claw-ai-devices-available-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>MSI has released the souped-up Claw AI+ handheld units, unveiling in full the Claw 8 AI+ and the Claw 7 AI+. As the latest entrants into the handheld market, the AI+ devices boast several key innovations that’ll have gamers considering securing one over a close competitor, like the ASUS ROG Ally X.</p>



<p>The larger unit – the Claw 8 AI+ – will cost you a pretty penny, though. MSI has advised that the RRP for this device is $899.</p>



<p>Read on to learn what MSI is doing to make that price point seem worthwhile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-msi-claw-ai-is-on-the-market">MSI Claw AI+ Is On The Market</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-s-New-Claw-8-AI----Claw-7-AI--Handheld-with-Powerful-Performance-and-Low-Power-Consumption--Available-Now--145096?utm_source=msi-news-feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=msi-news&amp;utm_content=MSI%27s%20New%20Claw%208%20AI%2B%20%26%20Claw%207%20AI%2B%20Handheld%20with%20Powerful%20Performance%20and%20Low%20Power%20Consumption-%20Available%20Now%21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new MSI Claw AI+ handhelds</a> utilise Intel Core Ultra 7 processors and Arc graphics, and by all accounts, they boast some of the sharpest handheld gaming experiences available right now.</p>



<p>It might seem like a mid-generation refresh, but the MSI Claw AI+ range is much more.</p>



<p>The Claw 8 AI+ is the pick of the bunch, boasting an 8-inch 1080p 120Hz IPS display that offers crisp visuals and a smooth refresh rate. MSI has claimed that the Claw 8 AI+ offers around 20% better performance than competing devices, like the ROG Ally X. </p>



<p>The Claw 8 AI+ is riddled with tech, that’s for sure. It features Thunderbolt 4 ports for fast charging, which means the 80Wh battery will go from flat to full in no time at all. It now features hall-effect triggers and the on-board software has received a significant upgrade from MSI.</p>



<p>With 32 GB of RAM, the MSI Claw AI+ range outpaces the ROG Ally X, which totes just 24 GB of RAM.</p>



<p>Between the two devices (Claw 8 and Claw 7), there are some major differences. The larger device has a much more powerful battery, and it has better WiFi capabilities – it also weighs 120g more. </p>



<p>MSI has promised a more optimised experience with the in-built AI capabilities of the Claw 8 and Claw 7 devices. They’re built with power consumption, visuals, and ergonomics in mind, it’s just up to you if those enhancements are worth the $899 price tag.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-ceo-ai-human-game-development/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98the-human-touch-will-be-crucial%E2%80%99-playstation%E2%80%99s-ceo-on-ai-in-game-development.1051362/</guid>

<p>Hermen Hulst, one of PlayStation’s CEOs, has spoken to the BBC during the brand’s 30th anniversary. Before diving into the history of the company, Hulst was doorstepped with a question about AI in game development. It has been a sore spot for a while, with some developers leaning much more into AI, sometimes at the cost of human employees.</p>



<p>Hulst assured that while AI has the potential to revolutionise game development, ‘preserving the human touch’ is still of the utmost importance.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-authenticity">Authenticity</h2>



<p>In an interview with the BBC, Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino, the co-CEOs of PlayStation, spoke about the past, present, and future of the brand.</p>



<p>To open <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpz291z59o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the interview</a>, Hermen Hulst spoke about AI in game development, given that he oversees software at Sony’s gaming giant, while Nishino focuses more on hardware development.</p>



<p>Hulst explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I suspect there will be a dual demand in gaming: one for AI-driven innovative experiences and another for handcrafted, thoughtful content</p>



<p>Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In many ways, AI is allowing for extraordinary leaps in the development process, allowing for procedural generation, the likes of which were previously unobtainable. AI is also being used to automate laborious, repetitive, or operationally impactful tasks that might have traditionally slowed down the development workflow.</p>



<p>In others, it’s putting jobs at risk, ‘stealing identities’, and putting fear into industry workers the world over.</p>



<p>As the interview unfolded, Hulst and Nishino explored the success of Astro Bot, recent leaps into live-action adaptations, and the origins of PlayStation. Nishino laid out a neat anecdote, recalling his mother’s toy store and how he would demo gaming devices for unaware shoppers when the technology was just starting to emerge.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s a world where AI and human-based game development can exist in sheer harmony? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The production of the second season of Fallout is well underway, and recently, Walton Goggins—who plays The Ghoul—appeared on social media to share a brief message. His post went hand-in-hand with a new image showing him in the makeup department having his ‘ghoul skin’ applied.</p>



<p>In Fallout, the live-action adaptation of the post-apocalyptic series that aired in April 2024, Goggins plays Cooper ‘The Ghoul’ Howard. He stars alongside Ella Purnell and Aaron Moten, and his performance in the show’s opening season was nothing short of stellar.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-feo-fuerte-y-formal">Feo Fuerte y Formal</h2>



<p>To celebrate his return to the character of The Ghoul, Walton Goggins posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It feels good to slip back into this skin. I do this shit for the love of the game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He was referencing a line his character utters in the show, and the image that accompanied the post showed him having a thick layer of prosthetics applied to portray a Fallout ‘ghoul’, a character warped by radiation.</p>



<p>In April, Fallout debuted on Prime, and it became the biggest launch the platform had ever seen. From there, things skyrocketed for the Fallout franchise. Across the entire suite of games, player counts and investment soared, and titles like Fallout 76 reached new heights, several years after being released.</p>



<p>It was recently suggested that the production for the second season of Fallout is moving ahead of schedule, but it’s still likely it won’t surface until 2026. These days, almost every show has a two-year gap between seasons, much to the chagrin of viewers.</p>



<p>For instance, the first season of The Last of Us was released in January 2023, and the second season isn’t expected to drop until a few months into 2025. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/behind-monster-hunter-wilds-surprising-skill-and-weapon-changes-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent behind-closed-doors demo, we played a section of Monster Hunter Wilds and asked the developers about changes made to weapons and other systems, the biggest being the separation of Equipment Skills between weapons and armor. Read on for more details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I played the demo, I realized major changes have been made to the Skills system, where damage-increasing skills and weapon-specific skills like Attack Up and Focus can only be found on or applied to the weapons themselves – a pretty impactful change. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Watch new gameplay of Monster Hunter Wilds above, including footage of Seikret and camp customization.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the new Equipment Skill system. In interviews, the dev team referred to skills for your weapons casually as Weapon Skills. Running with that unofficial terminology, let’s call equipment skills for weapons Weapon Skills, and equipment skills for armor Armor Skills. This means that equipment skills in Wilds are split up into these two categories. Weapon Skills generally include skills that affect actions and damage output, while Armor Skills assist in other ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Armor Skills include support skills like Speed Eating and Divine Blessing. This new system also affects slots, and the devs confirmed that weapons can only use decorations with skills categorized as Weapon Skills, while armor can only use decorations with skills categorized as Armor Skills.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/04/weapon-equipment-skills-1733278360038.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">You can see this bow has the built-in Equipment Skill "Focus." </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This really opens up a lot of new ideas. I asked director Yuya Tokuda about his intentions here, and he replied, “Only armor had [built-in] equipment skills until now, but when a piece of armor had a type of skill only effective when used with a certain weapon type, that meant you would have to choose the corresponding weapon. This led to an unavoidable situation where it was harder for people to use those kinds of armor pieces.” The new system solves that issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds now lets you take two weapons with you on a hunt, which must have been another reason behind the change. Since you can now swap to a sub-weapon mid-hunt, it's great to be able to keep on hunting while maintaining the skills you need to increase your damage to a suitable level or handle your weapon better.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/04/armor-equipment-skills-1733278376038.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">You can see the Hope Armor Set includes the built-in Equipment Skills "Divine Blessing" and "Stun Resistance." </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There is one thing I'm still curious about. While I was able to confirm that skills like Guard are indeed on weapons that can block, I'm still not sure which type of equipment utilizes skills like Evade and Evade Distance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Weapon Balance</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up is weapon balancing. Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto confirmed that there will be significant weapon balance changes in Wilds. He told me, “There will be major changes not just after what we saw in the open beta, but also in the form of changes we had always intended to add to the final product.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda said, “In particular, we plan on putting quite a lot of work into the Lance, Switch Axe, Insect Glaive, and Sword and Shield based on feedback from the open beta.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued, “We've tweaked values across the board relating to weapon damage and overall balance, including balance regarding endgame content.” In addition to these numerical changes, the four aforementioned weapon types have (quote) “plenty of work put into how they feel to use."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the development side is certainly listening to the voices of the players, they were already taking a proactive stance toward weapon balance changes, and it seems that a proper announcement about the topic will come at a later date. Seeing their attitude put me at ease; the game is clearly in good hands. We’ll see how their intentions pan out when the final game is released in February 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, the team told me about the direction and concept of the Switch Axe and the Insect Glaive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Insect Glaive Changes and the Return of Vaulting Dance</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Insect Glaive is one of my main weapons, and my very first impression was that there were fewer aerial attacks available. It made me wonder if the concept was to reduce the relative number of aerial attacks and make it a primarily grounded weapon. I brought this up with Tokuda, and he began by revealing to me that Vaulting Dance is making a return! This is one of the actions that was so important to opening up possibilities for aerial combat with an Insect Glaive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As to why it wasn't there before, Tokuda said, "We were concerned that putting it in this time around would cause players to use nothing but existing movements, rather than focus on the new parts of the game. That's why we decided to remove Vaulting Dance for a time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the reason it was brought back, he replied, "Many players at gamescom and Tokyo Game Show told us that it's not about how strong or weak it is, but that Vaulting Dance is part of the Insect Glaive's very identity. We realized that we weren't on the same page as our players there, and so we immediately decided to bring Vaulting Dance back while balancing the ability."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was happy to hear about this balance decision as an Insect Glaive user. That said, I did have difficulty during the open beta with the controls for its new charge attack, and I'm hoping that they'll make it easier to use as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Updating the Switch Axe to be More Attractive to Players</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I then asked about what direction they want to take with the Switch Axe. Tokuda told me the concept of the Switch Axe had not fully gotten across to players, and that the dev team is balancing it in order to convey what makes it a good weapon. Specifically, he said, “The Full Release Slash that comes at the very end of an attack didn't fully stand out, both in terms of feel and numbers, making it less attractive when compared to similarly positioned attacks for other weapons. We'll be sure to address that." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After hearing about the developers' plans to balance the Switch Axe to make it a more attractive weapon, it's clear to me that it's being properly discussed. Their process to come to the decision to make changes to the Switch Axe backs that up even more, so I don't think that should be a point of concern any longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm sorry to admit that I can't go into as much depth on the Switch Axe as with the Insect Glaive, as it isn't one of my main weapons, but other media outlets were also present at this hands-on session, and I’m sure some of them include players who go hard on the Lance, the Gunlance, the Bow, the Long Sword and more, so keep an eye out online for more information on your favorite weapon!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Translated by Ko Ransom.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-studio-closure-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stop me if you’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard this one before</a>: A major publisher launched a live-service game intended to compete with one of a small handful of industry-eclipsing giants. It did not immediately succeed to the tune of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Now studios are shutting down and workers are getting laid off. Just another Tuesday in the video game industry.&nbsp;</p><p>The latest victim of what’s effectively become a cycle is Ubisoft’s <em>XDefiant </em>– or rather, the people who made the recently-released game and, in doing so, followed management’s ill-advised edict to swipe a slice of pie from <em>Call of Duty</em>’s endlessly mashing maw. By many measures, the free-to-play shooter, which featured factions from a veritable <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-franchises-ip-sony-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rainbow of wrung-dry IPs</a> like <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>The Division</em>, and <em>Watch Dogs</em>, was solid, a "perfect antidote to those tired of <em>Call of Duty</em>’s modern-day bloat," <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/behind-its-identikit-theme-and-terrible-name-xdefiant-is-the-perfect-antidote-to-those-tired-of-call-of-dutys-modern-day-bloat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to PC Gamer</a>. But as we’ve seen time and time again, “solid” doesn’t convince millions of people to abandon habits and communities they’ve spent years building up in whichever game rules the roost.&nbsp;</p><p>“Solid,” at best, inspires brief curiosity, which is why executive producer Mark Rubin was <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1864090964748321266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">today able to boast</a> that “we broke internal records for the fastest game to surpass 5 million users and in the end we had over 15 million players play our game” while the Ubisoft mothership declared that it’s pulling the plug on the game, shutting down studios in San Francisco and Osaka, planning to “ramp down” another studio in Sydney, and potentially lay off hundreds of workers.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the discontinuation of <em>XDefiant </em>brings difficult consequences for the teams working on this game," Ubisoft chief studios and portfolio officer Marie-Sophie de Waubert wrote in <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post on the company's official site</a>. "Even if almost half of the <em>XDefiant </em>team worldwide will be transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft, this decision also leads to the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney. To those team members leaving Ubisoft, I want to express my deepest gratitude for your work and contributions. Please know that we are committed to supporting you during this transition."</p><p>This masterpiece in refusing to name the parties responsible – Where are the “difficult consequences for teams working on the game” coming from, de Waubert? Who is making these decisions? Certainly not the workers themselves – harks back to similarly grim ends met by <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Concord</em></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Redfall</em></a>, as well as unannounced games from companies like <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-25/microsoft-cancels-big-new-blizzard-game-after-six-years-of-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-studios-head-confirms-projects-cancelled-in-wake-of-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony</a> that never even got the chance to launch and face off against their genre’s respective entrenched boogeymen.&nbsp;</p><p>The triple-A strategy of trying to muscle in on the turf of giants with just a brand portfolio and a dream, only to throw up your hands when you don’t strike gold after a few months, is a dead end. The Ubisofts of the world cannot keep doing this. And yet:</p><p>“Developing games-as-a-service experiences remains a pillar of our strategy,” wrote de Waubert, citing successful series like<em> Rainbow Six</em>, <em>The Crew</em>, and <em>For Honor</em>, the most recent of which began in 2017, all of which arguably tried to do something unique, and all of which were given actual time to find their footing. “It’s a highly competitive market, and we will apply the lessons learned with <em>XDefiant </em>to our future live titles.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As part of the shutdown, the publisher plans to shut down its production studios in San Francisco and Osaka while ramping down its site in Sydney, with up to 277 employees losing their jobs. Roughly half of the XDefiant team will be assigned roles elsewhere.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Chief Studios and Portfolio Officer Marie-Sophie de Waubert revealed the news in an email sent to Ubisoft employees that was subsequently posted online, saying that the shooter was "not able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The full message can be found below.</p><blockquote>Today, I wanted to share with you that we’ve made the difficult decision to discontinue development on XDefiant.</blockquote><blockquote>Despite an encouraging start, the team’s passionate work, and a committed fan base, we’ve not been able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market. As a result, the game is too far away from reaching the results required to enable further significant investment, and we are announcing that we will be sunsetting it.</blockquote><blockquote>Concretely, that means that as of today, new downloads, player registrations and purchases will no longer be available. Season 3 will still launch, and the servers will remain active until June 3, 2025, out of appreciation for both our dev teams who worked on it and for XDefiant’s active players.</blockquote><blockquote>Unfortunately, the discontinuation of XDefiant brings difficult consequences for the teams working on this game. Even if almost half of the XDefiant team worldwide will be transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft, this decision also leads to the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney.

It’s a highly competitive market, and we will apply the lessons learned with XDefiant to our future live titles.</blockquote><blockquote>Globally, we are determined to take the necessary steps to put the company back on a path to growth, innovation and creativity and make sure we can set you up for success. This means continuing to radically evolve our mindset for Production and Business practices, which we will share more about soon, and doing targeted restructuring when necessary. I know that the situation brings questions and expectations, and we will share regular and transparent updates.</blockquote><blockquote>My sincere thanks for your continued dedication as we navigate these trying times together.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">XDefiant Executive Producer Mark Rubin also shared a message thanking fans and saying he was "heartbroken." He also shared refund details, saying that any purchases made within the last 30 days will be fully refunded and that those who purchases the Ultimate Founder's Pack will also get their money back. Refunds should happen automatically with 8 weeks, he said.</p><blockquote>I am unfortunately here today to announce that XDefiant will be shutting down. Starting today (December 3, 2024), new downloads and player registrations will no longer be available. We will still release our Season 3 content in the near future (exact date TBD) and the servers will remain active until June 3, 2025.<p>For those who purchased the Ultimate Founder’s Pack, you’ll receive a full refund.

It was from the start, an incredible challenge. Not only were we trying to shake up the genre by removing Skill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM) while bringing back a more “old-school” arcade shooter experience, but we were also diving into the high-risk, high-reward realm of free-to-play. And for that I want to applaud not only the Dev team but also Ubisoft leadership for taking that chance!</p><p>Free-to-play, in particular, is a long journey. Many free-to-play games take a long time to find their footing and become profitable. It’s a long journey that Ubisoft and the teams working on the game were prepared to make until very recently. But unfortunately, the journey became too much to sensibly continue.</p><p>I am, of course, heartbroken to have to be writing this post.  Yes, this game has been a personal passion for me for years and yes, I know that not all challenges lead to victory, but I also want to recognize all of the developers who are being affected by this closure. Each and every one of them is a real person with a real life separate from our own and they have all put so much of their own passion into making this game. And I hope that they can be proud of what they did achieve. I know that I will always be proud and grateful to have worked with such a great team! A team that really punched above its weight class.</p><p>And what they achieved is truly remarkable. The early response from players when XDefiant launched was amazing—we broke internal records for the fastest game to surpass 5 million users and in the end we had over 15 million players play our game! That is something to be extremely proud of, especially considering how tough this genre is. So, thank you to all of the developers who put their passion into making this game!</p><p>If there’s one thing, I hope we can all take away from this experience, it’s the importance of open, honest communication between developers and players. This “player-first” mentality along with respectful, non-toxic conversations between developers and players has been one of the standout differences that made XDefiant so special. From my very first post about XDefiant, this was the vision I wanted to champion, and I hope it leaves a positive mark on how the game industry treats its players and communities.</p><p>To our players, THANK YOU! From the bottom of my heart, I want to express my deepest gratitude for the incredible community that has grown around XDefiant. Your passion, creativity, and dedication have inspired us every step of the way.</p><p>With the utmost of love and respect,</p><p>Mark</p></blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">XDefiant joins Concord <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">as the latest service game to abruptly shutter</a> not long after launch.

Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/27/22904775/ubisoft-hyper-scape-cancelled-battle-royale"><em>Hyper Scape</em></a> before it, <em>XDefiant</em> had high expectations, with Ubisoft touting more than 1 million players in its closed beta last year. Now, it will disappear quickly, as it’s no longer accepting new players as of today and is <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fxdefiant-our-message-to-players">scheduled to shut off the servers</a> entirely next June.</p><p>Despite a delayed launch, Ubisoft said that <em>XDefiant </em>had reached more than 10 million players in its first two weeks and “outperformed expectations thanks to acquisition and strong average revenue per session day.” However, it couldn’t maintain that momentum, and by this fall, rumors of trouble surfaced, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a> reporting that concurrent player numbers across all platforms had fallen below 20,000.</p><p>Ubisoft states, “The game will remain available to all players who joined <em>XDefiant </em>before December 3rd, 2024. All functionalities, including progression, events, rewards, and achievements, will continue to be available until June 3rd, 2025.” The planned Season 3 content will still launch, and the company is refunding anyone who bought the Ultimate Founders Pack, as well as players who bought VC and DLC in the last month.</p><p>Like with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc"><em>Concord</em></a> developer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">Firewalk Studios</a>, this shutdown comes with job losses. According to Ubisoft, “difficult consequences” are leading to “the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Starting today (December 3, 2024), new downloads and player registrations will no longer be available. We will still release our Season 3 content in the near future (exact date to be determined) and the servers will remain active until June 3, 2025.</p><p>For those who purchased the Ultimate Founder’s Pack, you’ll receive a full refund. Players who made any purchases within the last 30 days will also be fully refunded. Those refunds should happen automatically within 8 weeks of today and you can find more details on our official website, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/xdefiant-our-message-to-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>XDefiant</em>.com</a>.</p><p>A few years ago, Ubisoft and the [San Francisco] development team embarked on a bold <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,901 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> to develop a new <a title="Genres > Arcade [65 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade</a> <a title="Genres > Shooter [3,942 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> called <em>XDefiant</em>. It was from the start, an incredible challenge. Not only were we trying to shake up the genre by removing Skill-Based Matchmaking while bringing back a more “old-school” arcade shooter experience, but we were also diving into the high-risk, high-reward realm of free-to-play. And for that I want to applaud not only the development team but also Ubisoft leadership for taking that chance!</p><p>Free-to-play, in particular, is a long journey. Many <a title="Genres > Free-to-Play [340 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/free-to-play">free-to-play games</a> take a long time to find their footing and become profitable. It’s a long journey that Ubisoft and the teams working on the game were prepared to make until very recently. But unfortunately, the journey became too much to sensibly continue.</p><p>I am, of course, heartbroken to have to be writing this post. Yes, this game has been a personal passion for me for years and yes, I know that not all challenges lead to victory, but I also want to recognize all of the developers who are being affected by this closure. Each and every one of them is a real person with a real life separate from our own and they have all put so much of their own passion into making this game. And I hope that they can be proud of what they did achieve. I know that I will always be proud and grateful to have worked with such a great team! A team that really punched above its weight class.</p><p>And what they achieved is truly remarkable. The early response from players when <em>XDefiant</em> launched was amazing—we broke internal records for the fastest game to surpass five million users and in the end we had over 15 million players play our game! That is something to be extremely proud of, especially considering how tough this genre is. So, thank you to all of the developers who put their passion into making this game!</p><p>If there’s one thing, I hope we can all take away from this experience, it’s the importance of open, honest communication between developers and players. This “player-first” mentality along with respectful, non-toxic conversations between developers and players has been one of the standout differences that made <em>XDefiant</em> so special. From my very first post about <em>XDefiant</em>, this was the vision I wanted to champion, and I hope it leaves a positive mark on how the game industry treats its players and communities.</p><p>To our players, THANK YOU! From the bottom of my heart, I want to express my deepest gratitude for the incredible community that has grown around <em>XDefiant</em>. Your passion, creativity, and dedication have inspired us every step of the way.</p><p>With the utmost of love and respect,<br>Mark Rubin, Executive Producer</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A month and a half after denying reports it was poised to pull the plug on its free-to-play live-service shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a> - which launched back in May - Ubisoft has confirmed it's doing just that, resulting in the closure of three production studios and 277 employees losing their jobs.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's chief Studios and portfolio officer Marie-Sophie de Waubert <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant">announced the end of XDefiant's development in a post on the company's website</a>. "Despite an encouraging start," de Waubert explained, "the team's passionate work, and a committed fan base, we've not been able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market."
</p>
<p>
"The game is too far away from reaching the results required to enable further significant investment," de Waubert continued, "and we are announcing that we will be sunsetting it." As such, new downloads, player registrations, and purchases will no longer be available from today, but Season 3 will launch as planned and servers will remain online until 3rd June, 2025.

<p>
Unfortunately, the news doesn't end with XDefiant's cancellation. Ubisoft has also confirmed it's closing its San Francisco and Osaka production studios, and will "ramp down" its Sydney production site. As a result, 277 employees across all three units will lose their jobs. This equates to a little over half of the XDefiant team worldwide, with Ubisoft noting other employees working on the project will transition elsewhere within the company.
</p>
<p>
"To those team members leaving Ubisoft," de Waubert continued in her statement. "I want to express my deepest gratitude for your work and contributions. Please know that we are committed to supporting you during this transition."
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/2wPUTEuXKpVoCvINTcxvGR/xdefiant-a-message-to-our-community">message</a> to the XDefiant community, executive producer Mark Rubin - who in October insisted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xdefiant-will-not-shut-down-after-season-four-executive-producer-insists">there were "no plans" to shut down the game</a> - wrote, "Free-to-play, in particular, is a long journey. Many free-to-play games take a long time to find their footing and become profitable. It's a long journey that Ubisoft and the teams working on the game were prepared to make until very recently. But unfortunately, the journey became too much to sensibly continue."
</p><p>
The announcement comes at a turbulent time for Ubisoft, which has been dogged by underperforming titles, delays, and project cancellations over the last few years. In an emergency investor call held at the start of 2023, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-again">announced considerably lower-than-expected earnings</a>, leading to the cancellation of three unannounced projects and a programme of "targeted restructuring" that resulted in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">series of layoffs</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, the publisher has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-free-to-play-shooter-the-division-heartland-cancelled-three-years-after-being-announced">cancelled The Division: Heartland</a> after more than three years of work, and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows' release into next year</a> following a "softer than expected launch" for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.

			<p>Realistically, this news doesn't come as a surprise to anyone. Considering the huge amount of hot water Ubisoft is in right now, with the troubles only seeming to continue in quantity and significance, it's not too much of a surprise that XDefiant is officially closing down. Several sources have revealed this information to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, which is where it was first reported. The news came in an internal all-hands meeting that took place today. Ubisoft has decided to shut down the game because of poor player numbers and a lack of player spending. This is something that Ubisoft has commented on multiple times themselves, especially in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-drop-another-7-shareholders-concerned/">their financial reports</a>. Times for Ubisoft have been particularly difficult as of late, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-funnels-more-money-into-star-wars-outlaws-marketing-than-any-other-game/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> didn't launch the way they were hoping and didn't bring in as much revenue as they lied. In addition to that, they now have XDefiant as a sinking ship, with a lot of people being very uncertain about Assassin's Creed Shadows, which was delayed to next year.</p>
<p>Due to XDefiant closing down, it's said that there will be a significant number of employees laid off from the San Francisco studio as well as supporting studios, with some of the staff already receiving their severance information. Ubisoft is set to experience another wave of layoffs in February, as the San Francisco studio will be closing its doors completely. It's not said whether the staff working there will be relocated to work elsewhere within the company or if they've been let go completely.</p>
<p>Season 3 of XDefiant will be the last full season of the game, with a skeleton crew continuing to work on the game until June 2025, which is when the game will be sunsetted.</p>
<p>Mark Rubin, Executive Producer on XDefiant made a <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1864090964748321266" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lengthy statement on X</a> today, announcing that the servers for the game will remain active until June 3, 2025. Any players who purchased the Ultimate Founder's Pack will be refunded. Additionally, any players who made any sort of purchase in the game within the last 30 days will also be fully refunded and this will happen automatically within 8 weeks.</p>
<p>As of today, new downloads and player registrations will no longer be available, and the game will only be available to those who were previously playing it and had registered or downloaded the game prior. All information about the closure is listed on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/xdefiant-our-message-to-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official XDefiant website</a>.</p>
