<p>Just Cause first surfaced on the PlayStation 2 in 2006, emerging as an ambitious open-world game with one of the largest explorable environments gamers had ever seen. It was an explosive title featuring acrobatic movement mechanics, intense combat sequences, and a thrilling story that saw players assume control of the enigmatic, charismatic hero, Rico Rodriguez. </p>



<p>In 2010, a follow-up title was released, with a third dropping in 2015. In 2018, Just Cause 4 – the most recent game in the series – was released, but sadly it was the worst-received game in the franchise thus far. </p>



<p>Now, it has been confirmed that after almost twenty years on the market, Just Cause is getting a live-action adaptation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-rico">Enter Rico</h2>



<p>Rico Rodriguez is one of the most capable characters in gaming history. Armed with innovative gadgets including a grapple hook, jetpack, wingsuit, and portable rocket thrusters – among many other things – Rodriguez swings, soars, and shoots his way across a different theatre of war in every game. He’s what I’d affectionately call a ‘toppler’ charged with freeing nations from tyrannical dictators, usually working hand-in-hand with rebels and revolutionaries.</p>



<p>It was recently confirmed <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/just-cause-movie-in-the-works-1235910913/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by The Hollywood Reporter</a> that a Just Cause movie is in production – but it has been trying to gain traction for more than a decade. The license has changed hands numerous times, finally landing in the lap of Universal Pictures and getting propelled forward with much more urgency, given the recent success of live-action adaptations of video games.</p>



<p>Reportedly, Kelly McCormick and David Leitch (<em>The Fall Guy) </em>are on hand to produce the movie, working hand-in-hand with Dmitri Johnson, Mike Goldberg, and Timothy Stevenson, who combined have worked on Tomb Raider and Sonic the Hedgehog. It’ll be directed by Ángel Manuel Soto, who was recently credited for heading up <em>Blue Bee<strong>tle</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>The big question is: who can play Rico Rodriguez? Some names have been lobbied in the past, from Javier Bardem to Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, and from Pedro Pascal to Diego Luna. To be honest, it’ll probably go to Chris Pratt.</p>

		<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown will launch on 12th September 2024 across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC in 2024, Nacon and KT Racing have confirmed. Early access will be able from 5th September for pre-orders. Check out the new release date trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/whwba2H7nNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/07/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-announced-release-date-consoles/">Announced way back in 2020</a>, it’s been a long wait for fans of earlier games in the series – the last of which arrived in the early 2010s for PS3 and Xbox 360 – to have a true confirmation of when Solar Crown will be released. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/07/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-announced-release-date-consoles/">First planned for September 2022</a>, KT Racing has been afforded a further two years to bring their vision for Test Drive Unlimited to fruition.</p>
<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown will take players to Hong Kong Island, featuring a full-sized recreation of reality, with a blend of built up cities and the thick wilderness. There will be plenty of high speed racing to be found within this game and setting, and players will choose between the Sharp and Street clans that vie for supremacy on Hong Kong’s roads, but TDU has always been about celebrating cars and car culture, as much as the racing itself. The intention is for this to be more of a social driving MMO, in contrast to the car bonanza of other open world racers.</p>
<p>Prior to the release date trailer, Nacon released a trio of gameplay trailers that dug into the different styles of driving and racing that will be found in Solar Crown. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/29/explore-off-road-in-test-drive-unlimited-solar-crowns-latest-trailer/">The Explorer</a> went off road and into the hills of the island, following on from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bDjhsshRZY&amp;t">The Cruiser</a>, for more sedate driving around town, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04AkO7LJI2A&amp;ab_channel=Nacon">The Racer</a>, for the more competitive among us.</p>
<p>We went hands on with TDU Solar Crown at Gamescom last year, sampling its unique blend of more social driving and racing. “Yes, it’s a game in which you drive and race around Hong Kong,” I wrote in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/01/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-is-a-car-mmo-thats-about-more-than-just-racing/">our preview</a>, “but it’s also a game that will be best when you engage and actively share that space with other players. It’s not always about being first, it’s not always about racing rivalries, sometimes it’s nice to just hang out and drive together.”</p>

            <p>Readers, I appear to have locked myself in self-referential language matrix trying to describe the feeling of playing top-down <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z718S9mxdSXm7N4CWUSaY2to4JWZQaNxyXlbDzrDap8/edit#gid=0">action</a> shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kickback">Kickback</a>. You can only move through the recoil from shooting, you see, which means facing the opposite way to where you want to go. It’s both  very counterintuitive and very fun. To call something both counterintuitive and fun seems, well, counterintuitive. But also: fun. Which, as a concept is very fun to think about. But, also, quite counterintuitive. Writing such a incredibly redundant paragraph is quite fun, even though I’m just repeating myself. Counterintuitive, right? I’m going to try to escape this paragraph now. if I manage it, I’ll see you in the one below.</p>

<p>Phew, that was close. The last time something like that happened, I had to stop watching Lamb Chop for good. So, Kickback. The clue’s in the name you see. That kickback, caused when you fire either the shotgun or pistol you start with in its demo, is your only method of locomotion, or more accurately, propulsion. Oh, you may be driven forward internally by the banging Mick Gordon-esque soundtrack, all power chords and chunky electro pads. But we can’t run a horrific biopunk economy on <em>vibes</em> now, can we? Vibes won’t keep me in shell casings and supplementary limbs. Nor will they help me avoid the horrible spiked corners, like a bouncing DVD logo afeared for its, uh, life?</p>

<p>A few extra twists keep things spicy. You do damage on colliding with an enemy, but if they survive, they do damage back. But! You can get some of that health back by doing a kill. To aid you on your secret mission to fire a very loud shotgun continuously, you can hold down the button after shooting to ride the wave of recoil like a murder surfer. Google just told me there’s a surfer named Brendan Gibbens, which means I can write Brendan GIBbens and feel clever. Does this whip-smart wit extend to my Kickback skills? Not in the slightest. But I would like to get better. Thank you, Kickback, for inspiring me to something tentatively orbiting competency.

            <p>
Sony has called the PlayStation 5 its "most profitable generation to date".
</p>
<p>
During this morning's business segment meeting and <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf">investor presentation</a>, the company revealed its PS5 generation had hit $106bn in sales. It is close to catching up with its predecessor the PS4, which generated a total of $107bn sales for the company.

<p>
Operating income for the PlayStation 5 generation, meanwhile, has surpassed that of the PS4, having now reached $10bn. To compare, the PS4 is sitting at $9bn.

</figure>
<p>
Further in the presentation, Sony shared some statistics from its consoles' user base. 
</p>
<p>
It noted the PS5 had "established a significant install base" four years into its cycle, and currently makes up half of its monthly active console users. The PS5 and PS4 both have 49 million users per month, as of 30th April. 
</p>
<p>
Engagement on PlayStation 5 in terms of gameplay hours is higher with Sony's most recent console, however. Of the 3.8bn hours played, 2.4bn of those were on PS5. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/image-(163).png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>

Meanwhile, PS5 users are spending 176 percent more on add-on content, 57 percent more on services and 34 percent more on peripherals than the previous generation of console did in the first four years of its cycle. 
</p>
<p>
PS5 users are also spending 12 percent less on full game content than those on PS4 did.
</p>

</figure>
<p>Earlier this month, PlayStation announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino were to replace Jim Ryan as the company's new CEOs</a>. Ryan left PlayStation in March, soon after the exec announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">company-wide layoffs equating to eight percent of its workforce</a>. </p>
<p>
Next, Sony is hosting its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-broadcast-announced-for-this-week">State of Play broadcast</a>. Scheduled for later today, the show is set to run for around 30 minutes, and will cover updates on PS5 and PS VR2 titles, as well as a look at PlayStation Studios games arriving later this year.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-wants-pc-players-to-play-playstation-single-player-narrative-games-on-a-playstation-console.884613/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-wants-to-pc-players-to-play-playstation-single-player-narrative-games-on-a-playstation-console/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation live-service titles will release day and date on both PlayStation 5 and PC, PlayStation's upcoming (co)CEO Hermen Hulst has said.</p>
<p>Hulst said as much during an interview as part of <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's Business Segment Meeting 2024 for its Game &amp; Network Services Segment</a>. While live-service titles (GAAS) from Sony's first-party studios will be released simultaneously on PC and console, this won't be the case for single-player narrative titles, according to the current PlayStation Studios head. As mentioned (<a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1795966798942158935" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via</a> Tom Warren) by Hulst in the interview, Sony wants to tempt PC players to purchase and play sequels to single-player narrative games on a PlayStation console.</p>
<p>A rather 'interesting' strategy' as this would require PC players to purchase a console (if they don't own it already) to play a certain sequel to a game they liked. We're not entirely sure how this strategy will pan out, but we guess only time will tell.</p>
<p>As part of the PlayStation business segment meeting, Hulst also revealed that the current console generation (PS5) is the most profitable generation to date. While the monthly active split between PS4 and PS5 is identical, total gameplay hours on Sony's current-gen console are substantially higher. "PlayStation 5 has established a significant installed base four years into the cycle, and has increased to half of Monthly Active Consoles with higher engagement by gameplay hours", the accompanied<a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> sheets read</a>.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this? Releasing GAAS titles simultaneously on PS5 and PC seems to be the right route for Sony, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially given the tremendous success of Arrowhead's Helldivers 2</a>. What are your thoughts about Sony wanting to entice PC players to play certain sequels on a PlayStation console? Would you rather wait for the game to be released on PC instead of getting a console? Hit the comments below, but as always, play nicely.</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as more information about PlayStation's business strategy comes in.</p>

The actual reasons, though, are clear: OpenAI is making deals like this (they've recently reached similar agreements with News Corp, AP and the Financial Times) to head off future lawsuits,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> like the one the New York Times is currently engaged in</a>, while Vox and The Atlantic's owners are also happy to contribute to their own ultimate demise by taking any money they can, even if it's from (<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/under-legal-assault-elon-musk-others-media-matters-cuts-staff-1904305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the many</a>) parties with a vested interest in killing them off.</p><p>It's grim! There's no way to see this as anything other than a huge win for OpenAI,<a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/ai-keeps-going-wrong-what-if-it-can-t-be-fixed-20240422-p5flo7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a company that keeps raising billions of dollars by promising things its machine-learning platform can't actually do</a>, and hoodwinking entire swathes of the economy in the process. To see journalism outlets--one of the few places we should expect serious examination of, if not outright resistance to, OpenAI's business model--roll over like this is extremely depressing.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This agreement recognizes the value of our work and intellectual property, while opening it up to new audiences and better informing the public.</p>— Vox Media (@voxmedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/voxmedia/status/1795830109238424058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Putting aside the money here for a second--while Vox's figures weren't revealed,<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/openai-news-corp-strike-deal-23f186ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the News Corp deal is worth a reported <em>$250 million</em></a>--what does this mean to the people doing the actual work at these outlets?

I know people at The Verge and other Vox sites who do great work, and a deal like this will hopefully at least help keep them employed while so many other media jobs are flushed down the toilet. No matter what those individuals think of the arrangement though, or even what they write about it (The Atlantic's Damon Beres has since <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/05/a-devils-bargain-with-openai/678537/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a pretty critical piece on the deal, calling it a "Devil's Bargain"!</a>), every time a journalist at any website with one of these contracts goes to write about AI, we'll be picturing Sam Altman standing behind them with a big novelty cheque. That's how ethics and the optics of ethics--often the same thing--work!</p><p>It sounds pathetically dramatic to say this, I know, but it's also true: this undermines everything the websites do from here on out, and cuts their good reporters and critics and video people off at the knees. It's a public signal that the human work of these people means jack shit to their owners, who are more interested in rolling over for the latest Silicon Valley snake oil salesman than making any real investment in journalism.</p><p>But this is the future.<a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-journalism-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> This is the only road corporate-owned media have left to stumble down</a>.

In the presentation, Sony revealed that the PS5 generation has brought in $106 billion in sales since launch, outpacing every past console at the same point in its generation.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/most-profitable-generation-to-date-1717025772665.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>PlayStation says the current generation is its most profitable to date.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Let's stick some asterisks on that figure really quick, though. First off, Sony reports that the PS4 generation brought in a total of $107 billion in sales, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But the PS4 generation is taken as whole, from fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2019, and includes three more years than the PS5 generation (which spans from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023). Four years into the PS4's lifecycle, it was still well behind where the PS5 is now, and the PS5 is on pace to easily pass the PS4 generation's total sales sometime this year.</p><p>It's also worth noting that these dollar amounts are total sales over the course of a console generation, not a reflection of specific hardware or game sales. The "PS5 generation" encompasses not just the PS5 itself, but everything the business is doing during this generation, including PS4 sales and game releases during this period. So take it all with the grain of salt it merits.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/most-profitable-generation-to-date-2-1717025772664.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>PlayStation is claming a stronger life-to-date spend for the PS5.</figcaption></figure></output><p>But it's not shocking that the PS5 generation has been so lucrative for Sony. Even with all the asterisks above, the PS5 has sold 56 million units to date. Though the PS4 has outsold it significantly (117 million at last count), the PS5 was more expensive at launch than the PS4. And continued software spend throughout the shared lifecycle of both has helped Sony's current console generation only grow in dollar sales even if console adoption is a little slow; Sony reports both the PS4 and the PS5 currently boast 49 million active consoles per month. </p><p>The presentation also points out that even with half the unit sales, PS5 life-to-date spend is significantly higher than life-to-date spend on PS4. DLC content, services, and peripheral spend is up, but full-game content spend is down a little on PS5 compared to the PS4.</p><p>All this is to say, if there was any doubt at all, the PlayStation 5 is doing pretty well. Unit sales are a helpful way to gauge player interest, but they don't tell the full story of how a company measures a console's success. Amid ongoing rumors that a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-everything-we-know">PS5 Pro may be on the horizon</a>, we may not be far off from seeing Sony attempt to capitalize on its current generation in yet another new, more expensive way.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/homeworld-3-pc-review-impressions-blackbird-steam-rts<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's very strange to be sitting down in 2024 to play a brand new <em>Homeworld </em>game.</p><p>The first entry in the pioneering space strategy series, <em>Homeworld</em>, was released back in 1999. A whole other century! A spin-off, <em>Cataclysm</em>, came out in 2000, and <em>Homeworld 2</em> dropped in 2003. Since then--and that's<em> 21 years</em> for those not counting along at home--there has been a <em>single </em>new <em>Homeworld </em>game released, the ground-based prequel <em>Deserts of Kharak</em>.</p><p>Now, in 2024, we've got a whole new <em>Homeworld</em>. Not a spin-off or an adjacent release, but a brand new game in the series, continuing the main storyline, set in space, featuring big-ass motherships, the works. And after being very excited about it for a very long time, I've just finished the singleplayer campaign and have many, many thoughts.</p><p>The first three games--the original especially--have gone down as classics for a number of reasons. Firstly, they lifted the RTS genre off the ground and took it into the stars, asking the player to control units in a full 3D space, which was revolutionary at the time. And kinda still is! Despite being decades old, no other game (not even its successors/competitors like <em>Sins of a Solar Empire</em>) has let you fight a deep space battle quite as easily or elegantly as <em>Homeworld </em>did.</p><p>Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it was <em>cool as hell</em>. The ship designs for the original <em>Homeworld</em>--a game released in 1999--still look better than almost anything any sci-fi game, TV show or movie has managed in the decades since. Inspired by the classic sci-fi art of guys like Chris Foss, but adding in their own modern twists, Relic's artists (led by Rob Cunningham, who is now head of Blackbird, <em>Homeworld 3's</em> developers) created a universe of designs (and a slick user interface to boot) that have stood the test of time.</p><figure></figure><p>How do you hope to follow a legacy like that all these years later? In <em>Homeworld 3's</em> case, you don't. Well, you don't quite. While many fans would consider the older games almost perfect, it's been 25 years since the original's release, so there's definitely an argument that the formula could do with an update.</p><p>Blackbird's approach is to hedge their bets. There's still a lot of classic <em>Homeworld </em>here, and I still love it, but there are also new ideas for a new age, like some slightly different approaches to level design and a between-mission narrative that I don't love as much.</p><p>When you first boot up <em>Homeworld 3</em> and assume control of a fleet, the old magic is still there. The iconic art style, the control scheme, the map screen, comms chatter, building menu–you could jump straight from <em>Homeworld 2 </em>to <em>Homeworld 3</em> and be completely at home. At first, anyway. When you start running into land in the middle of this space game, you'll notice something's up: perhaps as a result of frustrations with previous mission scripting in a fully 3D space, perhaps just because it looks cool, <em>Homeworld 3's </em>levels nearly all have huge chunks of rock, ice and space station in the middle of them.</p><p>It's true, they look cool! And give each level their own identity and flair, which is nice. Their looming presence throughout missions means you can send your units <em>to </em>them, instead of just to positions in 3D space, and sometimes even attach to them, which sounds fun but in practice makes controlling your fleet in the midst of battle hugely annoying. Some objects are so big they've got tunnels you can send fleets through, to outmanoeuvre an enemy or lay an ambush, something which sounds strategic but which you also almost never end up bothering to do.</p><p>You can tell how much these new objects fuck with <em>Homeworld's </em>control scheme because the game actually has two setups you can switch between, one based on the originals and one modified to be more contemporary. Neither works that well, and the use of terrain in battles rarely feels like it gives the player what the designers were hoping for. The intent was clearly to make space battles more interesting, but it mostly just make a hard job even harder, especially when some missions <em>require </em>you to interact with ravines or space stations. It's a huge pain in the ass to just traverse around and over them, let alone make use of them in particularly cunning ways.</p><p>Another addition that's weird and that I feel bad for saying I don't really like, since it's something I'm normally crying out for more of in my strategy games: a fuller storyline and 3D cutscenes. From Relic's earliest days through to Blackbird's <em>Deserts of Kharak</em>, one of the series'<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW4jkQdmjI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> most beloved trademarks were its wonderfully restrained 2D cutscenes; whatever they lacked in animation they made up for with detail and atmosphere</a>.</p><figure></figure><p><em>Homeworld's</em> story, told as sparsely as it was, felt as cold as its deep space setting, a perfect match for the action taking place outside of it. By keeping things so brief, it let me imagine the details, and kept the game's focus on what it did best: its beautiful ships and galactic vistas. <em>Homeworld 3</em>, on the other hand, opts for a fully cinematic approach to its story, with actual characters and a plot, and I'm sorry but it's all just a bit...dull. This is a universe whose focus used to be as broad as the stars themselves; yanking the camera down to ground level where we really only meet four characters robs <em>Homeworld 3</em>'s story of some grandeur.</p><p>Everything else is mostly the same old <em>Homeworld</em>, and that's as good as good news gets. It's visually stunning, striking the perfect balance between maintaining the series' traditional style while clearly introducing new ships and ideas, and as annoying as the game's terrain is to play, it's nothing short of gorgeous to look at, adding an even greater sense of scale to its missions, <a href="https://aftermath.site/paul-chadeisson-solstice-5-short" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which were already one of the masters of depicting "very big stuff in space"</a>.</p><p>I'm glad each unit's little radio chatter is still there, the sweeping space contrails behind each unit is still there, and that none of the immense joy I feel setting a fleet of ships into formation, siccing them on a target then watching them majestically blast everything to hell has been lost. <em>Homeworld </em>has always been, and remains, the closest any of us will get to feeling like a bonafide Space Admiral.</p><p>Also great: the singleplayer campaign mission design. A defining memory of the originals was constantly restarting levels because of their cruel scripting (you'd think you had a mission beat then BAM, more enemies emerge where you can't get to them and suddenly it's mission over), whereas here, I'll remember the visuals and a score of memorable set pieces, like playing a giant game of<em> Frogge</em>r in an asteroid belt and--in a rare win for the terrain system--a covert stealth mission through icy ravines flooded by nebula clouds. <em>Homeworld 3's </em>campaign keeps things fresh throughout, and all things considered, I had a real good time working my way through to the final (very mild spoilers) boss fight.</p><p>There are things I don't like here, sure, probably more than I could point to in any previous game in the series, and at times they threaten to turn this into something <em>else</em>. But no matter the changes or their frustrations, this is still <em>Homeworld</em>. It's not quite the <em>Homeworld </em>I used to know, but that's OK; I have my memories of those games already. This one at least <em>tried</em> something different, and even though it couldn't quite pull it off, there's enough of the old spirit here to make me glad I got to experience one more journey across the stars with a Hiigaran mothership. Even if it took 21 years to get here.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-gameplay-trailer-release-date/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Like previous entries in the series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mortal-kombat-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mortal Kombat 1</a> is rolling out plenty of DLC fighters, with the game’s first “Kombat Pack” so far serving up&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/mortal-kombat-1-guide-omni-man-fatalities-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omni-Man from Invincible</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/mortal-kombat-1-guide-quan-chi-fatalities-stategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quan Chi</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/mortal-kombat-1-guide-peacemaker-fatalities-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peacemaker from Suicide Squad</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-trailer-ermac-mavado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ermac</a>. We already got a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-teaser-voice-not-right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick (and icky) peek at The Boys’ Homelander</a>, but now NetherRealm has rolled out a full gameplay trailer for the big guy. The trailer also provides a fresh peek at upcoming Kameo fighter, Ferra.</p>
<p>As you would expect, Homelander looks to rely heavily on his ability to fly and his heat vision, and overall, looks to be a fairly quick rushdown character. We also get a peek at Homelander’s Fatalities, including one involving a jumbo jet that definitely feels on-brand. You can check the trailer out for yourself, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1 - Official Homelander Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_ABmX4Rj4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As some may have noted, Homelander TV actor Antony Starr won’t be lending his pipes Mortal Kombat 1, but otherwise, NetherRealm seems to have got the character right.</p>
<p><em>“Homelander is the most powerful being on the planet and the leader of The Seven, the elite superhero team owned and managed by Vought International. In a world where “Supes” are made, he’s the strongest of them all. Homelander presents himself as the ultimate patriot and protector, but don’t let his movie star good looks or high approval rating fool you. He is a murderous, narcissistic sociopath with an insatiable need for validation, love, and power. </em></p>
<p><em>Homelander’s destruction of enemies and lust for power does not end with his world. Challengers from other realms will also face his wrath. As seen in the new video, Homelander asserts dominance over opponents through his super strength, aerial attacks, and capacity to laser enemies with his eyes.”&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>Homelander is available as part of Mortal Kombat 1’s first Kombat Pack, which will set you back $40. In addition to Homelander, and the already-released, Omni-Man, Quan Chi, Peacemaker, and Ermac, the pack will also Takahashi Takeda. You can find Wccftech’s Fatality/strategy guides for the already-released Kombat Pack fighters <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mortal-kombat-1-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right here</a>.</p>
<p>Mortal Kombat 1 can be played on PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Switch. Kombat Pack owners can play as Homelander on June 4 or you can buy the character a la carte starting on July 11. Ferra will be added to the game sometime later in June.</p>

<p data-characters="409" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>The Final Shape</em> is nearly upon us, and a 10-year saga is set to conclude. Though the future of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a></em> as a whole is uncertain, what is certain is that we’re going to have all kinds of fun new Exotics to play with in the meantime. I’ve compiled a list of everything shown, from Bungie’s announcements to those who’ve been able to toy around with the new Exotics. Let’s dive in.</p> <h2 id="h-the-final-shape-exotic-armor" data-injectable="false">The Final Shape Exotic Armor</h2> <h3 id="h-balance-of-power-hunter" data-injectable="false">Balance of Power (Hunter)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-the-final-shape-exotic-armor-hunter-balance-of-power.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Double Down (Perk)</strong>: Your Threaded Specter has increased duration and durability, and damaging it releases additional Threadlings.

 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>The Gift of Certainty (Perk)</strong>: Activating Ascension or Tempest Strike throws bouncing explosives at nearby targets that jolt and damage them. Jolting nearby targets grants you damage resistance.</li> </ul> <h3 id="h-hazardous-propulsion-titan" data-injectable="false">Hazardous Propulsion (Titan)</h3> <figure data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-the-final-shape-exotic-armor-titan-hazardous-propulsion.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Danger Close (Perk)</strong>: Weapon precision hits or final blows have a chance to load a Kinetic Exodus rocket.

Defeating suspended targets grants melee energy. Your Arcane Needles are strong against Barrier Champions.</li> </ul> <h3 id="h-speaker-s-sight-warlock" data-injectable="false">Speaker’s Sight (Warlock)</h3> <figure data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-the-final-shape-exotic-armor-warlock-speakers-sight.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>The Lost Voice (Perk)</strong>: Healing grenades spawn a Restorative Turret.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/2024/5/29/24167458/wildermyth-final-expansion-game-ending<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="vw8X1W"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/22832995/wildermyth-is-the-video-game-miracle-of-2021"><em>Wildermyth</em> is an incredible procedurally generated RPG</a> that leads players through a series of narrative quests. As you build bases, battle foes, and learn more about the world, you’re able to build up your cast with new decisions and sacrifices. A hero might die, marry another party member and have children, or turn into an increasingly feral beast. It’s a tremendously cozy, satisfying RPG experience. </p>
<p id="ejdafi"><em>Wildermyth</em> has a core campaign, and additional adventurers that introduce new stories and new enemy factions. The game’s first DLC pack was focused around new cosmetic skins and armors for heroes, whereas the upcoming <em>Omenroad</em> expansion includes a roguelike-style challenge mode and a new story campaign called Walk in the Unlight. While <em>Omenroad</em> brings lots of new bosses and challenging fights, it also represents an end to development for <em>Wildermyth</em>. Worldwalker Games announced the conclusion on May 29 on the game’s official X account.</p>
<p id="hQML1T">“We will continue to support the game and fix critical bugs, but don’t expect new content going forward,” co-owner Nate Austin wrote. “We will be saying farewell to many of our team members. Worldwalker Games is going into hibernation for now.”</p>

<p id="KQqpRQ">Austin clarifies that the team still intends to port <em>Wildermyth</em> to other platforms, and the hibernation does not affect that “in any way.” He also commits to continuing <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/candycomposer/wildermyth-ost">a Kickstarter that will record the game’s music live</a> and integrate it into the game, French and Spanish translations for <em>Omenroad</em>, and to maintain the game’s Discord, <a href="https://wildermyth.com/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a>, support email, <a href="https://worldwalker-games.myshopify.com/">merch store</a>, and social media.</p>
<p id="hkAEgF">“<em>Wildermyth</em> has been wonderful, but nothing goes on forever,” wrote Austin. “We wanted to ship <em>Omenroad</em>, and having done that, we’re ready to move on. This was the plan, and it doesn’t have anything to do with how well <em>Omenroad</em> is doing. (It’s doing well! We’re extremely proud of it.)”</p>
<p id="mAuIE9">He added, “I’m pretty sure we’ll eventually find something else to pour our passion into, and we’ll let you know about it when the time comes.”</p>
<p id="Fz4CoH">It’s sad to see an end to <em>Wildermyth</em>, which has become one of my staples when I want to play a narrative RPG adventure. But it’s also a tremendous game, and it’s good to see the studio end on a high note and walk away from the project of their own choice. While we may never see another title from the Worldwalker team, I’ll treasure <em>Wildermyth</em> and the stories it effortlessly spins for years to come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-leak-hints-at-new-weapons-and-return-of-gobblegums/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=call-of-duty-black-ops-6-leak-hints-at-new-weapons-and-return-of-gobblegums<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="201" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 leaks start to come thick and fast, rumors suggest that the Locus sniper rifle, Saug 9mm SMG, and Gobblegums could all be returning from previous <em>Black Ops</em> series entries. </p> <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false"><em>Call of Duty</em> leaker Soup leaked images of bonuses that players get from pre-ordering the Black Ops 6 vault edition. In the first <a href="https://x.com/Soupsilly_/status/1795876344561090885" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image</a>, one of the rewards is what appears to be a collection of Gobblegums. And in the second <a href="https://x.com/Soupsilly_/status/1795876534231658567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">picture</a>, two of the weapons resemble the Saug 9mm from <em>Black Ops 4</em>, and the Locus from <em>Black Ops 3</em> and <em>4</em>. </p> <figure data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">Gobblegums were a controversial feature in <em>Black Ops 3 Zombies</em> that gave players special abilities such as instantly teleporting to a random location or having zombies chase you instead of your teammates. The temporary consumables added an extra layer of strategy to the game mode, as teams could save up money and take a chance at the machine. </p> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="747" data-injectable="true">Despite providing unique benefits, Gobblegum also drew criticism as the machine was expensive in <em>Black Ops 3</em>, and forced players to spend hours and in-game currency spinning in an effort to get the ability they wanted. This could be an issue in <em>Black Ops 6</em>, if they put the temporary power ups behind a pay wall and make players pull out their wallets if they want to use the fun abilities in Zombies. </p>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">The weapon designs resemble the Locus and Saug 9mm, but it’s hard to tell for sure with the zombie-themed camos on them. <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> has regularly added old weapons back such as the MORS, BAl-27, and Kar98k, so it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise to see classic <em>Black Ops</em> weapons return in the next title. </p>

The game is also now verified on Steam Deck, too. </p><p>In an included FAQ, EA makes it clear that if you are playing <em>It Takes Two </em>through<em> </em>Steam, the game now uses Steam Cloud for backing up saves. But what if you were using the EA App’s cloud saves? Well, those are gone now. And if you didn’t have your saves backed up on your PC, you’ve lost all your progress in <em>It Takes Two.</em><br></p><figure id="" data-id="8c6fed8220e718d65c5f1fe24725c000" data-recommend-id="image://8c6fed8220e718d65c5f1fe24725c000" data-format="png" data-width="731" data-height="351" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the FAQ.

Download that, drop it in a specific folder—as listed by EA—and then boot up the game, select the chapter you and your friend were playing, and there you go.</p><p>As far as I can tell EA didn’t give any real advanced heads-up for this change. I contacted EA about this and asked if they sent players any type of warning that the EA App’s cloud saves for<em> It Takes Two</em> would suddenly stop working but didn’t hear back before publication. </p><p>While I’m happy to see a Steam game ditch a third-party launcher, it’s a bit odd to see a massive video game publisher sharing a save game as a solution for players losing progress. Better than nothing, I guess?</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Alongside the new season's start, a series of leaks revealed various items coming to the game, such as the iconic Beam Saber from the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-and-modern-warfare-3-season-4-will-see-a-gundam-crossover/1100-6523564/"> Gundam universe</a>, new skins, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to the<a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL" rel="nofollow "> official Charlie INTEL X/Twitter account</a>, we now know how many of these cosmetics and weapons will look in action. The Beam Saber is arguably the most eye-catching of them all. Not only does the aesthetic of the weapon stay true to the anime, but it could also easily double as a purple lightsaber.</p><p>Those who purchase the game's Vault Edition for Black Ops 6 will also receive five exclusive weapon skins. What's notable about these skins is that they all appear to be inspired by the Dark Aether, a key location in the game's Zombie mode.</p><p>In addition to the Vault Edition weapons, we also know that the Black Ops 6 operator bonus will include three Frank Woods skins. The first will be his classic outfit, while another will have you playing as a zombified version of him.

                <p>Joy-Con are among the most expensive first-party controllers on the market, carrying a regular retail price of $80 for a pair. They also rarely see discounts, as Nintendo is well-known for keeping items at list price throughout most of the year. However, right now is one of the rare times you'll find Joy-Con at a discount, with a variety of styles currently seeing a price cut at Amazon and Walmart.</p><p>One of the most enticing deals is for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7DXMHBB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pastel Pink and Pastel Yellow Joy-Con</a>, as they're down to just $66. They're also sold and shipped by Amazon, with Prime members eligible for one-day shipping in select locations. These are your standard Nintendo Switch Joy-Con, offering HD rumble, two black wrist straps, and support for both the original Switch and OLED model.</p><p>Beyond this deal, several third-party sellers are discounting Joy-Con at Walmart.

They do, however, come with free 30-day returns, so you can shop with confidence.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-superi-46-loadout-for-mw3-and-warzone/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-superi-46-loadout-for-mw3-and-warzone<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="320" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Similar to the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kar98k-loadout-in-mw3-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KAR98K</a>, the Superi 46 is steadily climbing the meta ladder. It’s a weapon that caters to mobility enthusiasts, but its potential can be further unlocked with the right attachments. To help you make the most of this unique weapon, we’ve compiled the best Superi 46 loadouts for <em>MW3</em> and <em>Warzone</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-best-superi-46-loadout-for-mw3" data-injectable="false">Best Superi 46 loadout for MW3</h2> <p data-characters="167" data-current-count="167" data-injectable="false">Whether you play <em>MW3 </em>Multiplayer or <em>Warzone</em>, Superi 46 can thrive on almost any map. But if you want the best experience for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-and-mw3-players-question-not-banning-ranked-play-cheaters-completely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a></em>, equip these attachments:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Magazine: </strong>40 Round Mag</li> <li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> 4.6MM Overpressured +P</li> <li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>DR-6 Handstop</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong> Sakin ZX Grip</li> <li><strong>Stock: </strong>Rescue-9 Stock</li> </ul> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="true">Since SMGs aren’t as damaging as Marksman and Sniper Rifles, I always like to add a little kick to them with an Ammunition attachment. The 4.6MM Overpressured +P works best for this since it helps increase the Damage rate without lessening other stats. You should also extend the Superi 46’s magazine to 40 Rounds in case you need a few extra bullets.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true"><em>MW3’s </em>Multiplayer rounds primarily showcase small to medium, so improving Mobility and Handling is essential. Use the DR-6 Handstop Underbarrel to improve this, improving speed altogether. The Superi 46 can also sometimes be challenging to wield with its Recoil Control, so equip the Sakin ZX Grip for better handling. Additionally, the Rescue-9 Stock boosts Recoil Control and Mobility but with a slight decrease in Accuracy.</p>
 <h2 id="h-best-superi-46-loadout-for-warzone" data-injectable="false">Best Superi 46 loadout for Warzone</h2> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">In <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-call-of-duty-warzone-rewards-and-how-to-complete-challenges-in-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone’s</a></em> larger maps, enhancing the Superi 46’s range is crucial for those long-distance shots. However, the same Ammunition and Magazine upgrades that work well in <em>MW3</em>‘s version<em> </em>remain suitable options all around. For a complete loadout, select these items:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Optic:</strong> SZ Sigma-IV Optic</li> <li><strong>Magazine: </strong>40 Round Mag</li> <li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> 4.6MM Overpressured +P</li> <li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Bore 99 Short Barrel</li> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>ZEHMN35 Compensated Flash Hider</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">To improve the Superi 46’s Accuracy, equip the SZ Sigma-IV Optic. The Bore 99 Short Barrel also covers this feature, improving Accuracy, Mobility, and Handling. Then, you can maximize the gun’s Recoil Control by placing the ZEHMN35 Compensated Flash Hider. With this attachment, I find it much more accessible to get any kind of shot, both close and long-range.</p> <figure data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false">Given that the Superi 46 is an SMG, there’s little you can do about its short range. However, it still holds up as a standout gun for Season 4, especially when the gas circle has closed out most of the <em>Warzone</em> maps.</p>

The sharp polygonal graphics of the era don’t do the memorable story and characters justice today for many audiences, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></a> was a refreshing first attempt at modernizing it. </p><p><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong></em> — the second game in the planned trilogy — has been out on PlayStation 5 for a few months now, and it’s worth continuing the journey, especially with a $15 discount that brings it down to $54.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Rebirth-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CGXZQ4CD?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmlYSTLzAP8">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Ffinal-fantasy-vii-rebirth---playstation-5%2F404626.html&amp;u1=vergebreakout052924">GameStop</a>.</p><div><p>The middle game in a three-part trilogy, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> continues the reimagining of the classic PS1 RPG with modern visuals, an expansive open world, new gameplay elements, and even better character development than the original. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5">Read our review</a>.</p></div><p><em>Rebirth</em> picks up right where the original left off, with Cloud Strife leading his comrades on a search for Sephiroth across an expansive open world. The latter proposes a selfish, humanity-threatening method of stopping the malevolent and careless Shinra corporation from stripping the planet of its natural energy, which obviously won’t fly for a band of wholesome protagonists.</p><p>Compared to the PS1 original, Square Enix expanded the cities surrounding Midgar (the megalopolis that’s the de facto lifeblood of the region) so broadly that many iconic locations are now represented with a richness and depth that wasn’t possible decades ago. </p><p>There’s a ton to do in the world, too, thanks to a healthy helping of side content and minigames including card battling, Chocobo racing, and your occasional puzzle. Some may find it a little <em>too</em> much, as Andrew Webster did in his run-through for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5"><em>The Verge</em>’s review</a>, but much of it is largely skippable if you’re only interested in running through the main plot. I have yet to sink my teeth into it since I’m still savoring the 2020 remake, but I’ve heard from quite a few enthusiasts whose taste I trust, and they swear <em>Rebirth</em> has a strong chance to contend for game of the year.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, one night about two years back, we came to an impasse until one of us jokingly tossed out, “Let’s just play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-mario-games-galaxy-world-64-sunshine-kart-odyssey-1851325267&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-mario-games-galaxy-world-64-sunshine-kart-odyssey-1851325267"><em>Mario Kart</em></a></span>.” Within minutes, we had all grabbed our Nintendo Switches, jumped in a call, and booted up the game. We didn’t set it down for about another five hours.</p><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196646,196452" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Stories about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-the-kotaku-review-1794746789&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-the-kotaku-review-1794746789"><em>Mario Kart 8</em></a></span><em> </em>tend to follow that formula. It is either the first or last game a group will settle on playing, but because it’s so reliably great, it’s just about the only game any group needs once it’s been decided upon. I’ve found <em>Mario Kart 8 </em>endlessly rewarding as both a participant and a spectator since it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-the-kotaku-review-1576700883&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-the-kotaku-review-1576700883">launched ten years ago</a></span>, and I reckon it’s still got another ten years in it if we’re being honest.</p><p>When it was released in 2014, <em>Mario Kart 8 </em>was the biggest deal on the least incredible platform.

New items like the boomerang and the super horn were crowd-pleasing additions, and <em>Mario Kart 8 </em>even adapted to the times and threw in DLC, and <em>a lot </em>of it. By the time its servers were shut down on the Wii U, <em>Mario Kart 8</em> had become the best-selling game on the console, topping out at about 8.5 million copies sold. Despite the numerous laps it made there, though, it would shine even brighter a few years later as <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>on the Nintendo Switch, where it has <em>also</em> gone on to become the console’s best-selling game, moving an astonishing 61.97 million copies and counting.</p><p>In the ten years since it first released, <em>Mario Kart 8 </em>has taken over the damn world.</p><p>Every now and then, a game breaks containment. You know a game is big when people who don’t typically play or follow games know about it and play it. <em>Mario Kart 8 </em>is one such game. Hell, it’s arguably a cultural touchstone. If I’m at a party, there’s a good chance the host has a Switch set up with <em>MK8D </em>ready to go. For the first several years of the Switch’s lifetime, anywhere that gamers gathered, you were bound to see clusters of people crowded around a Switch or two playing <em>MK8D</em>. I never actually played my Switch on the move (as was often touted in Switch commercials) but when I first got my hands on <em>MK8D</em>, you’re damn right I played it everywhere I went.</p><p><em>MK8D </em>isn’t just enthralling, though; it’s become part of the lexicon. I can’t tell you the amount of dating profiles I’ve swiped past where girls are openly challenging potential suitors like me, the drift king, to play them in <em>Mario Kart. </em>As video games have become more culturally acceptable and significant, <em>MK8D </em>was there alongside the likes of <em>Fortnite </em>leading the charge on casual and competitive games. It is the avatar of all kart racers and easily one of the most ubiquitous games ever. <em>Mario Kart </em>games certainly enjoyed acclaim, high sales, and fan fervor before, but <em>MK8</em>, and specifically <em>MK8D</em>, earned something above that: prestige and a place in all our lives.</p><p>It’s become so huge that Nintendo doubled down on <em>MK8 </em>even after porting it, with all its existing DLC, to the Switch. Though <em>MK8D</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/instead-of-announcing-mario-kart-9-nintendo-reveals-mor-1848510647&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/instead-of-announcing-mario-kart-9-nintendo-reveals-mor-1848510647">Booster Course Pass</a></span> was a controversial announcement at the time, it has also added an undeniable wealth of value to one of the most stacked games ever. Over the course of a year and a half, Nintendo added 48 race tracks to the game, as well as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-dlc-booster-pack-6-1850980293&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-dlc-booster-pack-6-1850980293">eight characters</a></span> and several smaller fixes and changes. Most of the tracks are remastered from previous games, but some are entirely new, and regardless, <em>MK8D </em>has enjoyed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8s-next-wave-adds-even-more-characters-to-ga-1850560006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8s-next-wave-adds-even-more-characters-to-ga-1850560006">more support</a></span> and content than most long running-service titles.</p><p>Is it selfish and maybe even a little dumb of me to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-fy-2022-mario-kart-8-9-booster-course-p-1848904808&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-fy-2022-mario-kart-8-9-booster-course-p-1848904808">never want it to stop</a></span>?</p><p>The move to continue supporting <em>MK8D </em>to this extent has brought into question whether or not there’s even a need for another <em>Mario Kart </em>game. There will most assuredly be one, but trying to imagine where Nintendo goes from here is a little difficult. <em>MK8 </em>and <em>MK8D </em>have been such decisive and easy wins for the company, I wouldn’t fault Nintendo for just releasing it again on the Switch’s successor, though it’ll almost certainly be backwards compatible. Why not just continue pouring everything into this already quintessential game rather than start from scratch? In a world of games as platforms that are constantly evolving, why not just turn the foundation of this perfect game into the basis for a long, uncomplicated future for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-mario-kart-games-worst-to-best-1842892038&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-mario-kart-games-worst-to-best-1842892038"><em>Mario Kart </em>games</a></span>?</p><p>For all its countless strengths and legendary titles, Nintendo hasn’t really enjoyed a success quite like <em>MK8D</em> before, and I don’t see any reason why it shouldn’t become the company’s <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, which has seemingly haunted every console to ever exist after its release. Much as you never need to give it to a company, I’ve <em>got </em>to give it to Nintendo: it made one of the greatest games ever and accidentally turned it into <em>the</em> most enduring title of the past several generations.</p><p>All I’m saying is that 8 is already a symbol synonymous with the concept of the infinity, so it’s all teed up for Nintendo to keep playing this tune forever…and maybe even cut me a check for the idea. I don’t know of any other game I’ve been playing for ten years. I don’t know many other games that I think I’ll still be playing in another ten. If I had to pick one though, I’m all in on <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, and even if you don’t know it yet, you probably are too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For now, at least. Austin says that since the studio is independent and not beholden to investors, Worldwalker isn’t shutting down, but is essentially on a hiatus until the next project comes around. In the meantime, Austin says this won’t affect plans to port <em>Wildermyth</em> to other platforms, follow through on its soundtrack Kickstarter, and provide French and Spanish translations for the <em>Omenroad</em> DLC, and the team will continue to maintain its social media, support emails, and merch.</p><p>I only played a little bit of <em>Wildermyth</em>, but it was enough to know that the game is something special. In it, you create multiple characters for what is essentially a <em>D&amp;D</em> campaign that dramatically shifts based on your choices and relationships. Its writing is excellent and the fact that it is as reactive to your choices makes that all the more impressive because there’s such a clarity to its storytelling regardless of the path you choose. On top of the narrative strides, it has some really cool spins on fantasy combat, such as a magic system that pretty much makes your mages <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avatar-last-airbender-netflix-review-live-action-1851279574&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-last-airbender-netflix-review-live-action-1851279574">the Avatar</a></span>, controlling elements based on their surroundings rather than just conjuring fire spells from thin air. It’s a cool worldbuilding element but it also plays directly into how you handle combat encounters. <em>Wildermyth</em> has got some neat ideas.</p><p>My respect for the game is what made my stomach drop when I saw a big wall of text shared on Worldwaker’s socials, because that’s been the typical vehicle for the video game industry to deliver bad news.

Though Worldwalker’s announcement does mean the studio isn’t doing anything right now, it also means there’s still a future to look forward to one day. In the face of so much bad news coming out of video games in 2024, I’ll take a little solace in that and maybe boot up <em>Wildermyth</em> for another campaign tonight.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="230" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Modern Warfare 3</em> and <em>Warzone</em> Season 4 re-introduces the Kar98k, and it’s poised to dominate both battle royale and multiplayer matches. Here is everything you need to know about creating a class setup for either experience. </p> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Previously, the MORS was considered the best sniper rifle in <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> and <em>Warzone</em> because of its incredible mobility, aim-down sight speed, and ability to one-shot kill from any range. However, the Kar98k boasts better characteristics across the board and has all the makings of being the new best weapon in both titles. Let’s jump right into everything you need to know. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Kar98k loadout in <em>Modern Warfare 3</em></h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3389-1.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="471" data-current-count="471" data-injectable="true">In 2021’s&nbsp;<em>Warzone</em>&nbsp;Pacific, the Kar98k was regarded as one of the best, if not the best, weapons for Caldera. This time around, the rifle is just as good in <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> and <em>Warzone</em>. The new iteration of the Kar98k is capable of one-shot kills in multiplayer made to the upper torso or higher from any range. Meanwhile, the base weapon can one-shot headshot down an enemy up to 63 meters, but that distance is extended even further with the right attachments. </p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Bryson Carbine-S Barrel</li> <li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>DR-6 Handstop </li> <li><strong>Laser:</strong> SL Razorhawk Laser Light </li> <li><strong>Optic:</strong> Glassless Optic</li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> No Stock:</li> </ul> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">Forget everything you know about making a usual marksman rifle loadout when choosing attachments for the Kar98k in multiplayer. Instead of improving damage range and fire rate as we would tend to do in <em>Warzone</em>, this <em>MW3</em> class setup solely focuses on making mobility better. As a result, you can fly around 6v6 maps and easily take down enemies from any range before they even know what hit them. </p>
 <h2 id="h-best-kar98k-loadout-in-warzone" data-injectable="false">Best Kar98k loadout in <em>Warzone</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid </figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Sonic Suppressor L </li> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Prazisiongewher 762 Long Barrel </li> <li><strong>Optic: </strong>SP-X 80 6.6x </li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> No Stock </li> <li><strong>Ammunition: </strong>7.92 High Grain Rounds </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false">With the <strong>Sonic Suppressor L</strong> and <strong>Prazisiongewher 762 Long Barrel</strong> equipped, the 63-meter one-shot headshot kill distance gets extended to 86. In addition, the <strong>No Stock </strong>improves the Kar98k’s aim-down sight time to 377 milliseconds, which shatters the best possible MORS aim-down sight time of 524. </p> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="false">Finally<strong>, 7.92 High Grain Rounds</strong> increase the sniper rifle’s bullet velocity to 985 meters per second, which beats out the best possible MORS bullet velocity of 792. Given all of these benefits, it’s hard to make a case to still use the MORS over the Kar98k. </p>

  <p id="NryXiI">It’s been 10 years since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/9/10/6124747/the-sims-4-review-skin-deep"><em>The Sims 4</em></a> was released, and there hasn’t really been anything else like it since. The Sims games have only really competed with each other — but that could change. Several Sims-like games are in active development, announced within the past several years: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23433566/sims-5-project-rene-paralives-life-sim"><em>Paralives</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23657952/life-by-you-paradox-sim-game-rod-humble"><em>Life By You</em></a> (<a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-life-by-you-release-date.1680458/">now delayed</a>), <em>inZOI</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24155607/the-sims-midsummer-studios-jake-solomon-xcom">an unnamed life simulator from Midsummer Studios</a>. (We can’t forget Project Rene, which is the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23404750/sims-5-project-rene-announcement">codename for Electronic Arts and Maxis’ <em>The Sims 5</em></a>.) While <em>The Sims 4</em> has been a paragon of emergent player stories, this recent wave of life simulators may have been inspired by something else: Roblox, <em>Fortnite</em>, and <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>, perhaps.</p>
<p id="jJkPAU">Though it’s been popularized in recent years, “emergent narrative” <a href="http://algorithmancy.8kindsoffun.com/">was coined by game designer Marc LeBlanc</a> at the Game Developers Conference in 2000, but it’s taken on new life in recent years with the popularity of games like battle royales <em>PUBG</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>, sandbox game <em>Minecraft</em>, and hyper-focused sims on Roblox, like <em>Laundry Simulator</em>. As LeBlanc defined it, “emergent narrative” refers to stories that come out of game events. “A game’s <em>fantasy</em> gives meaning to the narrative,” he wrote on a <a href="http://algorithmancy.8kindsoffun.com/">PowerPoint slide of the GDC presentation</a>. The emergent narrative “occurs as short vignettes,” he added. With the spotlight on these buzzy new games, people began to notice players creating their own compelling, engaging stories — building something themselves around what’s happening in-game on their own terms, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2152617878">outside of what was intended</a>. </p>

<p id="qszjU4">It’s an obvious thing to expect from a game like <em>The Sims 4</em>, which lets players create characters and live out unique stories in a set environment. It’s a little more surprising to see these sorts of stories emerge from games like <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>PUBG</em>, which can be misunderstood as nothing else but shooter games. The reality is that, even in these stricter environments, stories emerge as players interact with each other: An ongoing story about the <em>Fortnite</em> island is happening as it shifts and changes, but each of its players is creating their own stories in the moments between and within battles. The objective — winning a battle royale, for instance — is always the same, but each player will reach that objective in their own way. It’s a similar experience with <em>Minecraft</em>: The first goal is simply to survive, but the game builds out so much more from there — eventually, your goal may be to wrangle villagers into a community <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/3/13/14909266/pokemon-red-built-in-minecraft-video">or to build a working Game Boy</a>. Anything can happen.</p>
<p id="ONrXn1">It might sound like a wild idea, but the next wave of life sims could pull some inspiration from the likes of <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> PUBG</em> and their emergent narratives. Even Epic Games itself is going the way of bringing this kind of storytelling out of <em>Fortnite</em> and into other worlds. The special kind of player-driven storytelling that <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>PUBG</em> offer may be what makes the next generation of life sims games a way to stand out — by adding more parameters, there’s room for greater creativity.</p>
<p id="UurnQn">Jake Solomon, Midsummer Studios co-founder and former XCOM design lead, announced the new studio and its unnamed project earlier this year — right in the midst of the life sims boom that saw several others in the genre announced over the past few years. “I felt pretty clever about a year ago when I wanted to make a life sim,” Solomon told Polygon via email. “Now there are 3 or 4 really compelling games in development that are doing exactly that. But I don’t believe games are ever a zero sum environment, in fact I think having more life sims will actually help revitalize a big, arguably underserved audience. Gamers are used to having choice, and that makes us as developers better.”</p>
<p id="YWJD1H">Emergent narrative is the big buzzword around the game: It’s the studio’s “specialization” that’ll help it stand apart, Solomon said. It’s pulling from the greats — the likes of <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>The Sims 4</em> — to provide some guidelines for players to build out from. Sometimes, those guidelines are created by the developer itself; in <em>The Sims 4</em>, for instance, that’s keeping up with your Sims’ needs, i.e., making sure they don’t pee themselves in public. (Or, on the flip side, guaranteeing they do.) Other times, <em>The Sims 4</em> players are building those guidelines into the game themselves, like with the 100 Baby Challenge: <a href="https://kelseydangerous.fandom.com/wiki/100_Baby_Challenge_Rules#The_Sims_4">Give birth to 100 babies in as few generations as possible</a>. These parameters set up a world in which a wacky narrative emerges, something that Sims <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2svi_xw_Q7I">influencers and YouTubers play up</a>. But Midsummer Studios will likely take some of its inspiration from the XCOM franchise, which Solomon previously worked on. Like <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>PUBG</em>, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/how-i-xcom-i-enables-players-to-tell-their-own-stories">XCOM is known for providing the parameters for creative</a>, player-driven narrative.</p>

<p id="rhdbqh">“One, we ask players to choose what kind of story they are trying to tell right at game start (Romance, Family Drama, Town with a Cast of Eccentric Characters), and as a result, we can tailor the cast of characters and the storylines we introduce into the player’s game to support the type of story the player wants,” Solomon said. “Two, we are generating a web of relationships between characters right at the very start of every game so that players are instantly stepping into a ‘narrative rich’ environment rife for telling dramatic storylines. What if your ex-lover was also your coworker? What if your estranged father was your neighbor? And players can, of course, customize these to their heart’s content.”</p>
<p id="ajbAn7">Like <em>Minecraft </em>or <em>Fortnite</em>, the next generation of life sims needs to pull from emergent storytelling to emphasize the one thing a game can’t thrive without — the players and the stories they create. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-guide-ticket-excess-express/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>In order to kick off Chapter 6 of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, you’ll need to get yourself a ticket to ride the Excess Express train. This is similar to how you had to get a blimp ticket to kick off Chapter 3, but, of course, the steps are a bit different. Don’t worry though, we have you covered…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd61.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After wrapping up Chapter 5, you’ll talk to Professor Frankly, who will inform you that the next Crystal Star is in Poshley Sanctum, which can only be accessed via the Excess Express. You’ll need to talk to Don Pianta again in order to secure a ticket.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd63.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Head through Peeka’s shop on the far West edge of Rogueport to get to Don Pianta’s office. Unfortunately, he’s incapacitated due to missing his daughter Francesca too much (she eloped with her boyfriend earlier in the game). So, you have to find her.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd62.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Head back to Keyhaul Key, then into the jungle. You’ll find Francesca and Frankie next to the pond. Unfortunately, Francesca has lost her wedding ring and isn’t going anywhere without it. Obviously, you’re going to have to find it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd64.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Head deeper into the jungle. Near the entrance to the Pirate’s Grotto, next to the big palm tree, there is a patch of grass that’s sparkling slightly. Hit that with your hammer and the wedding ring will pop out.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd65.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Return the ring to Francesca, then hop on Cortez’s ship back to Rogueport. Talk to Don Pianta and he’ll give you the ticket. The just north up the main road in west Rogueport and give the ticket to the black-and-blue toad porter near the train.</p>
<p>And there you are, get ready to solve some mysteries aboard the Excess Express!</p>
<p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is available now on Nintendo Switch. You can check out all of&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech’s Paper Mario The Thousand-Year Door guides here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24167198/hades-2-jesus-fan-art-crossover-dark-souls-call-of-duty</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fan-artists-are-mashing-up-their-favorite-games-with-hades-2%E2%80%99s-friends-and-fiends.884379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24167198/hades-2-jesus-fan-art-crossover-dark-souls-call-of-duty<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="xyGbLU">Melinoë is just beginning her journey in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24147392/hades-2-early-access-release-date-how-to-play"><em>Hades 2</em></a>, the sequel to Supergiant Games’ brilliant roguelike based off Greek mythology. <em>Hades 2</em> recently entered early access, and while there’s a ton of content to explore, there are still placeholder assets and obstacles blocking player progression past a certain point. Still, fans are happily digging into everything on offer — and getting inspired by the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24133525/hades-2-new-character-list-designs-hecate-hephaestus">gorgeous art style</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151266/hades-2-early-access-content-hecate-scylla-bosses">new lore</a>. But what if you could encounter even more new and exciting myths and legends in your journey up to Olympus — including ones from other games entirely?</p>
<p id="qP4AAz">Jen Zee, the artist behind <em>Hades</em>’ iconic art style, has inspired many artists to try and imitate some of those bold stylistic decisions. If you’ve drawn a character in that style, it’s simple enough to put them on top of a <em>Hades 2</em> screenshot with some custom text.</p>

<p id="gYkPKX">Would Ghost from <em>Call of Duty</em> be a particularly helpful companion? On one hand, he’s a step down from all the myths and figures that currently populate <em>Hades 2</em>. On the other hand, he does have the power of gun, and I can see that being handy. </p>

<p id="oUoq8K">Or what if we went with a darker presence? Carmina Mora, also known as The Artist in <em>Dead by Daylight,</em> is a tormented figure brought low by corruption and pulled into an extraplanar realm ruled over by the Entity. Seeing her show up on the way to the Underworld isn’t too surprising, although she doesn’t have too much to say.</p>
<p id="tP77po">If you prefer a more traditional deity — albeit one outside of the Greek pantheon — how about Jesus Christ?</p>

<p id="ZMRboS">Personally, I was impressed with Dryya, an artist on X who has been creating mashups between <em>Hades 2 </em>and the cast of <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em>, including encounters with <a href="https://x.com/Dryya_/status/1795684261301047303">Senshi</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Dryya_/status/1794764078566777198/photo/1">Chilchuk,</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Dryya_/status/1794132865741172794/photo/1">Laios</a>. I’m a fan of this art of Marcille, which depicts her as looking more wan and anxious than her typical depiction in the anime — which is appropriate, considering she’s wandered into another property altogether.</p>

<p id="demL2e">Finally, I’m also a big fan of this Dark Souls crossover, introducing everyone’s favorite sun-loving knight Solaire to the mix. Mustakro has also created a <a href="https://x.com/mustakro/status/1795484118190288979">Siegmeyer fanart</a> and a crossover <a href="https://x.com/mustakro/status/1795876254450679973">with <em>Elden Ring</em></a>.</p>

<p id="vN2dXn"><em>Hades 2</em> still needs some time in the oven; the early access title is still being tested and built upon. But it’s cool to see how its art style is already inspiring fan creativity. I remember seeing similar fanart for the first <em>Hades</em>, and the enthusiasm only seems to have grown with the sequel. We may never see Ghost or Solaire meeting up with any of the <em>Hades</em> cast — unless there’s a <em>Fortnite </em>event — but it’s fun to imagine these interactions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pistols-powers-one-page-ttrpg-now-available<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The bar for indie TTRPG development is considerably lower in the internet age. It has seen the release of quirky projects like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hit-road-jack-brings-chase-to-table"><em>Hit The Road, Jack</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tha-haunting-of-abimond-manor-coming-to-kickstarter"><em>The Haunting of Abimond Manor</em></a><em>,</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/i-have-high-ground-ttrpg-releases-this-month"><em>I Have The High Ground</em></a>. Now, there is <em>Pistols &amp; Powers</em>, a superpowered cowboy TTRPG.</p>

<h2>The <em>Pistols &amp; Powers</em> announcement</h2>

<p><em>Pistols &amp; Powers</em> was announced via social media post by <a href="https://www.dungeonsanddisableds.com/">Dungeons &amp; Disableds</a>. Dungeons &amp; Disableds is a TTRPG show where nerdy disabled players play <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. The campaigns are DM'd by Steve Saylor, who is the lead designer of this new cowboy TTRPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pistols-powers-playtest-screenshot.jpg?itok=VcTp7GwR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pistols-powers-playtest-screenshot.jpg?itok=Leb203e9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Everything you need to play on one page.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's official <a href="https://www.dungeonsanddisableds.com/pistols" rel="noopener" target="_blank">store page</a> provides further detail. This one-page TTRPG has one simple idea: what if the tall tales of old gunslinging legends were more than just fancy talk? What if Billy The Kid had superhuman speed, allowing him to drop 21 men without being hit once?</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, <em>Pistols &amp; Powers</em> uses a deck of playing cards and one six-sided die. The core rules are similar to Blackjack. The player has to try to get as close as possible to 21 without going over? As for superpowers, that is where the die comes in. A roll of the die allows you to add or subtract value from your current hand.</p>

<p>If the premise seems interesting, the page contains a full one-shot playtest with Saylor as the dealer. In addition, the page contains an archived behind-the-scenes stream of Saylor's design process.</p>

<p>The Dungeons &amp; Disableds show has featured several beloved gaming community members. Players include journalist for <em>Wired</em> and accessibility advocate <a href="https://www.wired.com/author/grant-stoner/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Grant Stoner</a>, streamer and influencer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JustSeum" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Seum</a>, and EA's own Game Accessibility Lead, <a href="https://leahybaker.com/about/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Morgan Baker</a>.</p>

<p><em>Pistols &amp; Powers</em> is available right now on <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/482478/Pistols--Powers" rel="sponsored">DriveThruRPG</a>, <a href="https://stevesaylor.itch.io/pistols-and-powers">itch.io</a>, and the <a href="https://dungeonsanddisableds.store/products/pistols">Dungeons &amp; Disableds store page</a>. It is being sold in PDF format for $3. No prior experience in the hobby is needed to enjoy the game.</p>

			<p>The much-anticipated remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is here, and much like the Gamecube original, the game is bursting with puzzles, secrets, and some quirky mechanics that new players may find slightly perplexing. Don’t worry though, we’re here to cut The Thousand-Year Door’s more confusing aspects down to size.</p>
<p>In between most Paper Mario TTYD chapters, you’ll play through short vignettes with Princess Peach. These are usually fairly straightforward, but the one between Chapters 5 and 6 actually contains a fairly tricky puzzle that may frustrate folks who don’t see it coming. Don’t worry though, we’ve got you covered…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd53.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After completing Chapter 5, you’ll once again find yourself in the pink shoes of Princess Peach. The computer TEC will ask her to retrieve a Data Disk from Sir Grodus’ office, and in order to do so, you’ll need to mix up a potion that will make you invisible.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd54.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Exit the elevator that takes you to the second floor, then head left until you get to the one open room, in which you’ll find the potion mixing puzzle. First, you need to put the four color of potions in the right order. You’ll find a number of clues around the room, most notably, “Do not put the Red potion on the far right,” “Place two potions between the Red and Green potions,” and “Place the Yellow potion between the Blue potion and the Green potion.”</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd55.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Using those three clues, you can determine the right order – (from left to right) Red, Blue, Yellow, Green.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd56.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Now push the button on the left. A beaker will now move down the conveyor belt. Push the buttons below the four potions to pour them in as the beaker stops above them.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd57.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Okay, now the part that will likely throw a lot of people off. The game will ask you to heat the combination of potions for 30 seconds. Press the button to star the heating, then again to stop it. There’s no special “trick” to this, you actually have to time it. If you have a watch or timer you can use, that will work, but if you don’t, I’ve found timing it using the sound of the siren going off during the heating works best. With every “weeoo” of the siren and rotation of the yellow light, count – this is actually slightly faster than a second, so you’ll have to count to around 40 before shutting off the heat. It will still work if you go slightly longer than 30 seconds, but you can’t go any less.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd58.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you’ve done everything right, the potion will turn green. If you’ve messed something up, it will be an orange-ish color and you’ll have to repeat the process again.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd59.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once you drink the green potion, you’ll turn invisible and can head to Grodus’ office and grab the Disk (it’s on the shelf behind his desk).</p>
<p>And there you go – one of the trickier Peach sections of the game, solved!</p>
<p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is available now on Nintendo Switch. You can check out all of&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech’s Paper Mario The Thousand-Year Door guides here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/anime/24166567/my-oni-girl-netflix-anime-spirited-away-easter-egg<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="pNUdon"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWhtovYy3E0&amp;ab_channel=NetflixAnime"><em>My Oni Girl</em></a> is a charming, emotional fantasy where the details don’t entirely add up. The ending of Netflix’s anime movie in particular raises a lot of questions about what an oni actually is in this setting, and about the rules governing the hidden village where these creatures from Japanese folklore live in isolation. Still, between debates about what drives certain events in this movie, anime fans might take a moment to appreciate the extended riff on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/27/21271278/spirited-away-watch-best-studio-ghibli-movie">Hayao Miyazaki’s <em>Spirited Away</em></a> that director Tomotaka Shibayama (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/19/21296219/a-whisker-away-review-anime-netflix"><em>A Whisker Away</em></a>) and co-writer Yuko Kakihara (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/2024/2/5/24056807/best-anime-netflix-crunchyroll-watch-winter-2024"><em>The Apothecary Diaries</em></a>) dropped about 30 minutes into the story.</p>
<p id="WtTIDu">The plot focuses on shy schoolboy Hiiragi Yatsuse, who clearly wants to be liked and hopes to be helpful to others. But those desires make him an easy mark for his classmates, who keep taking advantage of his good nature. When he helps runaway oni girl Tsumugi out of a small moment of difficulty, though, his compassion leads him into a much bigger, stranger world. Tsumugi has left her hidden oni village to look for her missing mother. Hiiragi offers to help, and they run off together, headed to a distant shrine where Tsumugi’s mother supposedly can be found.</p>
<p id="kZJr0o">In one of several episodic chapters in their journey, Tsumugi separates from Hiiragi and is wounded by a mysterious flying creature. Hiiragi finds her unconscious in a forest and carries her to the first building he finds… which happens to be a large, fancy spa and bathhouse. That’s the first hint that <em>My Oni Girl</em> is headed into referential territory.</p>
<p id="3Iug1D">The first person Hiiragi approaches to ask for help is a bald, bearded man with glasses who works at the inn and has a close relationship with the woman who runs it. He turns out to have a soft heart, and to be easily impressed by a hard worker.</p>

<p id="mN8qxC">But the real decider of Hiiragi’s fate is the lady who runs the bathhouse — a stern, fearsome woman who says she has no reason to grant him any favors. Ignoring all her other questions, he asks her over and over to let him stay, and to let him work for his keep. She finally breaks down and gives him a temporary job.</p>

<p id="IQry3T">It isn’t that these images look particularly similar (though the trains come closest), or that Shibayama was drawing directly on Miyazaki’s framing, character design, or visual style for <em>My Oni Girl</em>. It’s more that the bathhouse segment of his movie feels broadly familiar in its story details, and winkingly familiar in its specific interactions. The whole segment is about nine minutes long — big for an Easter egg, but a small part of a feature film, and just one of a number of adventures Hiiragi and Tsumugi have on their journey. It isn’t meant to copycat <em>Spirited Away</em> or draw on its fame, and it works fine as a story element even if you’ve never seen Miyazaki’s movie. </p>
<p id="GvRxlH">But it’s a fun little diversion once you notice it. Shibayama worked on <em>Spirited Away </em>as a digital ink-and-paint artist, and this feels like a relatively subtle callout to that film — an echo of the most famous project he’s worked on, thrown in just for fun, for the anime fans who might notice.</p>
<p id="R7rjYh">In spite of all the broad plot elements in common, though, the shot in <em>My Oni Girl</em> that most reminded me of <em>Spirited Away</em> was a quiet, late-night shot of Naoya — the Kamaji equivalent, though he has some elements of Lin, too — vaping at night on the balcony of his bathhouse, overlooking the city. That shot has the same solemn, melancholy feeling of a very similar shot of Chihiro in <em>Spirited Away</em> eating a dumpling at night on the balcony of <em>her</em> bathhouse, overlooking the sea that’s appeared and surrounded the building.</p>

<p id="6Ih2MF">Both of these shots are breaks in the action, where a character takes a little time away from everyone else and from the drama of adventure. It’s an interesting narrative choice to have the equivalent shot in <em>My Oni Girl</em> involve a very minor character, rather than the protagonist, and certainly the sequence in <em>Spirited Away</em> is sweeter, sadder, and stranger. </p>
<p id="VZGPex">But I enjoyed <em>My Oni Girl</em>’s extended riff on Miyazaki’s masterpiece, as seen through a completely mundane lens, without gods and monsters. In a way, the sequence feels like <em>Spirited Away </em>AU fanfic — the equivalent of a story that moves the characters into a mundane, modern-day setting, without any of the colorful fantasy elements, but with familiar dynamics and characters. It’s a cover version that doesn’t live up to the original song, but plays around with it in some entertaining ways. </p>

You are Rover, an amnesiac who awakens in a post-apocalyptic future, on a world called Solaris-3. You set out with the help of a growing cast of characters to learn more about yourself, while fighting off monsters called Tacet Discords. It’s a basic premise that does the job. Once into the world, the game begins to teach you about its core pillars of exploration and combat. </p><h2 id="h154235"><a id=""></a><strong>Proof that adding a grappling hook is always a good idea</strong></h2><p>As in <em>Genshin Impact</em>, you navigate a large open world, mainly through climbing and gliding. One quality-of-life improvement in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is that sprinting does not cost stamina here, instead being reserved for climbing, meaning you feel much freer to enjoy exploring. You’re also able to run up walls for a short time, although this burns through stamina very quickly. </p><figure id="" data-id="80c8d33619df89c4d0a5c129d606923c" data-recommend-id="image://80c8d33619df89c4d0a5c129d606923c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1247" data-height="702" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pink haired character uses a grappling hook through a city" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="80c8d33619df89c4d0a5c129d606923c" data-recommend-id="image://80c8d33619df89c4d0a5c129d606923c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1247" data-height="702" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pink haired character uses a grappling hook through a city" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s also a grappling hook! Certain structures across the map have grapple points that let you zip across long distances, and it can be used anywhere else to zip you up in the air slightly, offering a nice boost from which you can then glide forward.<br></p><p>Combining these three main methods of traversal together makes exploring the world of <em>Wuthering Waves</em> a joy. Solaris-3 has a gorgeous color palette, ranging from bright greens and purples to more muted apocalyptic greys and browns, although the world design does lack the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-farewell-to-liyue-an-exceptional-part-of-genshin-imp-1846093827&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-farewell-to-liyue-an-exceptional-part-of-genshin-imp-1846093827">unique aesthetic style</a></span> of <em>Genshin</em>. <em>Wuthering Waves</em> has a more generic vibe, and I don’t find myself stopping to smell the roses.</p><h2 id="h154236"><a id=""></a><strong>The combat is a knockout</strong></h2><p>Combat is the star of the show in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. Characters have basic and special attacks they can trigger, and you can switch between characters in a party at any time. There’s a dedicated dodge button, as well as an especially engaging parry mechanic that requires you to attack when a yellow circle appears on enemies and, when executed properly, gives you a chance to do high damage. The parry window also discourages attack spamming—a smart mechanic that incentivizes more thoughtful and involved fighting. </p><p>Switching between characters triggers special intro and outro attacks that let you tag-team opponents in combat. It’s a smart addition that brings more depth to combat and team composition. However, I think my favorite bit of combat design is the echoes, a system in which you collect the enemies you defeat in the world and can then equip them, granting your characters new skills and attacks. Echoes and regular team composition make for a fun mix-and-match style of play that, when combined with all the other combat systems, makes fighting in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> feel truly exhilarating. I like having more to do when fighting, and it feels like a more strategic system than I’m used to from <em>Genshin</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="44fb45b3a8cc6dee378382c5c5b10841" data-recommend-id="image://44fb45b3a8cc6dee378382c5c5b10841" data-format="jpg" data-width="1247" data-height="702" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blue haired swordsman fights a big monster" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="44fb45b3a8cc6dee378382c5c5b10841" data-recommend-id="image://44fb45b3a8cc6dee378382c5c5b10841" data-format="jpg" data-width="1247" data-height="702" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blue haired swordsman fights a big monster" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course, all this is wrapped inside a gacha game. That means a lot of time will be spent grinding for leveling materials, as well as pulling for new characters and weapons as they get added to the game. The hope is that players spend money to acquire these items, but a good gacha game has a balance between how many characters and items you can acquire for free and those that will likely require spending that keeps players hooked. So far <em>Wuthering Waves </em>is pretty forgiving in this respect.<br></p><p>Banners currently guarantee that players will get a five-star item (either a character or weapon depending on the banner) within 80 pulls. The inclusion of this system on the weapons banner is a godsend after dealing with the absolutely <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-weapons-banner-scam-alhaitham-1850003328&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-weapons-banner-scam-alhaitham-1850003328">horrid weapons banners of <em>Genshin</em></a></span>. Currently, it feels balanced enough that I can feasibly work toward all the five-star items I want without having to spend real-world money, all in a reasonable amount of time. However, there is one aspect of <em>Wuthering Waves</em> that is holding me back from truly diving into the grind. </p><h2 id="h154237"><a id=""></a><strong>Room for growth</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="14f1103417c7d8950cd32cd0924299d9" data-recommend-id="image://14f1103417c7d8950cd32cd0924299d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="970" data-height="546" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rover sits on a rooftop overlooking a valley" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rover sits on a rooftop overlooking a valley" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kuro Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14f1103417c7d8950cd32cd0924299d9" data-recommend-id="image://14f1103417c7d8950cd32cd0924299d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="970" data-height="546" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rover sits on a rooftop overlooking a valley" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If combat is the shining star of <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, then narrative is its downfall. Currently, the story lacks interesting character stories or an enticing overarching tension. Now, I am a player who values story a lot, so the lack of an interesting narrative is a big drawback for me. That may not be the case for everybody, and if you just want a crunchy combat system to engage with, then this game will fit the bill nicely. Of course, all of this does come with the big caveat that this is only the 1.0 release of <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. <em>Genshin</em> <em>Impact</em>’s 1.0 release was also lacking in some crucial areas, and the story really didn’t kick in until players managed to get out of the introductory nation of Monstadt and into Liyue. So I’m not gonna hold the weak narrative against <em>Wuthering Waves</em> too much at this point. For now, the game’s combat system will be enough to hook a lot of players into the gacha grind.<br></p><p><em>Wuthering Waves</em> is dropping at a perfect time for me.<em> Genshin Impact</em> is wrapping up its Fontaine storyline which means I’ll probably put that game on the back burner for a bit until I need to do some farming ahead of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-5-0-natlan-pyro-archon-pokemon-1851499488&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-5-0-natlan-pyro-archon-pokemon-1851499488">5.0</a></span>. That leaves room for <em>Wuthering Waves</em> to be my go-to mobile title in the meantime. Yeah, the story isn’t much right now, but as a reprieve from more story-focused titles I spend my time with it’s perfect, and the action is a delight. It’s also getting its claws into me right before HoYoverse releases its new combat-focused title, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zenless-zone-zero-release-date-trailer-platforms-story-1851216949&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zenless-zone-zero-release-date-trailer-platforms-story-1851216949"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a></span>, in July. So for now, I’m going to keep on exploring and fighting through the world of <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Waking up with your own past a mystery, you're tasked to survive among the factions of people that have formed in this little, localized apocalypse. The developers have tried to create a world inspired by classics like Stalker, The Road, and La Jetée.</p><p>So far so good, right? These are all things I like to hear. I recently sat down with a demo build of the in-progress game and got a look at how it's going so far.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>City 20 - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The first thing that really strikes me about City 20 is the art style. It's confident and decisive, to my eyes inspired by comics or paintings, with very stylized characters: Broad hips, bowed legs, narrow shoulders. The colors meanwhile are muted, washed out. They're something between a set of slightly dirty pastel tones and the darker shades that have become pretty popular in the wake of Disco Elysium. Either way, the aesthetics as a whole are pretty confident and consistent, which I think is important and good to see as this sort of sandbox really lives or dies on how deeply the visuals can pull you into the unfolding story.</p><p>City 20 is supposed to be a survival sandbox, one where a realistic social and ecological simulation plays out over seasons of in-game time. Figuring out the politics of the different factions, how they relate, and how to gather the limited resources of the ruined city is supposed to be a major part of the game. The crafting and survival elements are important but relatively simple and basic, with the emphasis there on conserving resources and not overtaxing the environment—one example given by the developers is harvesting too many deer or rabbits, causing local foxes and wolves to become aggressive toward people.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In the demo, however, most of my time was spent figuring out what to eat and drink and where to get it from. Though I woke up in a cabin provided by a friendly man, the two steaks and four apples he gave me barely staved off hunger for a day. While I'm all for a hunger and thirst system, this one was a bit aggressive and will certainly need tweaks before it's out. How do I engage with the cool social simulation if most of every day has to be spent figuring out the logistics of food?</p><p>Anyway, once I figured out I could just murder the nice man and steal all his food, I had enough to get me through my demo time without further concerns. Once I did that I saw some promising glimmers beneath the post-apocalyptic muck and rust.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>By talking to people you can learn about them, and by trading with them you can figure out what they need. Every NPC I encountered had a job and a faction, ate and drank, and had a routine that included going to work and sleeping. Trading with them for what they wanted made them more favorable toward me—and presumably making enough of them favorable toward me over time would alter the whole faction's opinion of me. </p><p>The factions themselves are also part of the balance of the in-game economy. They need resources like metal and wood to craft things and sell amongst themselves, and the characters need food and water to live. Giving lots of resources to a favored faction would, eventually, make them more powerful and wealthier than other factions simply because they have more food, better tools, and better weapons. On the other hand, losing access to an entire faction because they hate you would cut you off from a significant portion of the in-game economy—and probably make gathering resources near their territory pretty dangerous, as the pretty simple combat system goes well for you when you're one-on-one, but the same fights get pretty one-sided pretty fast if several enemies group up on you.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Once I figured out I could just murder the nice man and steal all his food, I had enough to get me through my demo time without further concerns.</p></div><p>Sandboxes like this one are pretty hard to judge at this stage in development. I'm inclined to look over the frustrating bits toward the more interesting systems, but this is also a pretty tricky genre to develop in the first place. Games can have deeply interesting simulations at their heart but wind up being boring to engage with because of poor pacing, because the core gameplay isn't fun, or because the simulation itself is too opaque for the player to manipulate. Hopefully City 20 doesn't fall into any development traps, because I'm interested to see where it's going from here.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/capes-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>It’s probably the funniest joke in Capes – which has a lot of pretty good superhero jokes – that not one of your eight playable characters actually wears a cape. This clever and challenging turn-based tactical game does wear its heart on its sleeve, though, and a clear love of the comics that inspired it comes across as it makes its underdog vigilante squad feel powerful with creative combo mechanics. It’s a style of battle that gives you almost all the information and lets you execute a surefire plan in a way that reminds me of Into the Breach more than it does XCOM.</p><p>Every level is a tactical puzzle that tells you almost everything that’s going to happen next turn up front, and winning is all about countering the enemy’s moves before they can damage you by either taking them down, disarming them, or moving them right where you want them. Only a handful of abilities have randomized effects and there’s no chance to miss, plus you can see any enemy’s abilities and a timeline of who will get to move next. In short, you have all the information you need to succeed. I do wish it went a little further and told us specifically which target an enemy plans to attack and with what to take the last of the guesswork out of figuring out how best to thwart them, but once you understand that they’ll always go after the closest target (unless otherwise specified), it’s rare that you’ll be surprised by how a turn plays out if you’ve taken the time to read the room. Sometimes that can take a minute when there are literally 25 characters in the turn order list and you have to go through each one every turn to make certain your almost-dead character isn’t in the line of fire.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Superhero RPG, Capes - 9 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Capes’ tongue-in-cheek story grew on me fairly quickly – and when I heard that Morgan Jaffit, a writer who’d worked on the excellent Freedom Force games was involved, it made perfect sense. Sure, we’ve seen about 300 off-brand versions of the iconic Marvel and DC heroes at this point (everything from The Boys to Invincible to Watchmen has their own set of characters inspired by the classics), but it’s fun to embody the “I understood that reference” Captain America meme as Capes rolls out its parade of eight heroes that pay homage to the likes of Nightcrawler, Colossus, Storm, Quicksilver, Professor X, The Hulk, Human Torch, and… I dunno, someone who punches a lot? I wouldn’t say any of them are terrifically memorable on their own, but they hold their own well enough and only Ignis, the fired-up influencer parody, gets annoying to listen to at times.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fights stay interesting and diverse over what turns out to be a pretty lengthy campaign.</p></div><p>The triumvirate of supervillains who rule over King City are entertaining megalomaniacs, and they come with creative boss fight mechanics. The Joker-ish telepath Wildstar can mess with your heroes’ heads and make them miss their first attack on him, while anti-Tony Stark Primax is completely invulnerable and has to be avoided and worked around as you achieve other objectives, rather than fight her directly. Those boss battles – and a strong variety of enemies and minibosses with tons of different abilities – keep fights interesting and diverse over what turns out to be a pretty lengthy campaign. I extended my time with it by replaying some missions to perfect them and earn more skill points, and there were a couple of very tough ones that took me a lot of tries to squeak through, but it was around 40 hours before I saw the end.</p><p>Plenty of amusingly cheesy superhero humor is thrown around – including a lot of references to Primax’s self-driving cars being death traps – but the story is also often dark, with plenty of straight-up murders and blood splashed in the streets as the villains hunt down supers and slaughter anyone in their way. There’s a fair amount of debate over whether heroes should kill, though all the while it sure seems like we’re killing a bunch of dudes by knocking them off of buildings or exploding them with fireballs, and the way it ends seems to hand-wave a lot of that moral ambiguity away. But as excuses to have superheroes beat up bad guys go, this ain’t bad.</p><p>That said, it’s very strange that while most of the story is delivered between missions with a 2D animated comic book style where characters’ lips don’t move, sometimes it will randomly switch to conversations between characters using their in-game 3D models. That works well enough, but it’s a confusing inconsistency. There’s also an annoying glitch where the frame rate regularly chugs as the camera zooms out from a cinematic, which is odd for a game that isn’t trying to be terribly ambitious with its graphics.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>One of Capes’ best ideas is that your squad of four heroes work together to enhance each others’ abilities.</p></div><p>Even though animations aren’t always its strong suit, they successfully make this group feel like a team and bring energy to the turn-based action. One of Capes’ best ideas is that your squad of four heroes work together to enhance each others’ abilities when they’re close enough. It’s not unlike the team-up system in Marvel’s Midnight Suns, but here it’s much more based on position and they work differently based on which two heroes are collaborating. Among many other team-ups, the speedster Mercurial can leave a trail of fire behind her as she zips from next to Ignis to the other side of the map; Weathervane’s lightning storm is vastly more powerful with Kinetic nearby to supercharge its damage; and Mindfire can telepathically make an enemy turn around so that Rebound can teleport in for a backstab with bonus damage. It makes the choice of which four team members to bring to a fight hugely important – though it doesn’t cost you anything to restart the mission with a different squad if you find yourself in need of, say, damage mitigation from Facet’s crystal armor. You also have to keep your team’s position in mind, because if they stray more than a few tiles apart they won’t be able to take advantage of their team-up abilities.</p><p>Capes is very smart about layering on mechanics to think about beyond simply punching or zapping an enemy for as much damage as possible. Some attacks do disarm damage, which doesn’t necessarily reduce their health but can force a thug to drop a gun or bat, or interrupt a more powerful enemy’s super attack that they’re charging up for next turn. On top of that, each hero has an ultimate ability – such as nerdy scientist Hyde transforming into a big stompy swarm of nanobots – but they all charge up differently. Facet charges as he absorbs damage while armored, Mindfire earns his by making an enemy vulnerable and then dealing damage to it, and Ignis slurps up fire around the map like Pac-Man. Because of that, swapping out a single member of your team can pretty radically change your priorities in clever ways.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><p><h3>Dan's favorite tactics games</h3></p></div><p>Once you get the hang of it and are reliably beating down bad guys, you can test your skills by attempting to complete each mission’s list of optional objectives. In addition to completing the main objective without a hero being downed (they can be revived with half their health), you’ll be challenged with pushing some number of enemies off ledges, disarming them, or using specific abilities, among other things. This is the main way you earn skill points to upgrade your heroes’ powers – some of which are minor half-point damage or range increases, but others unlock whole new extremely handy skills – so it’s definitely worth revisiting missions in the Simulator to mop them up, especially if you were <em>that close</em> to pulling off a perfect run.</p><p>However, the one type of mission I have no desire to revisit are the stealth ones, which are often obnoxious exercises in trial and error. While you can preview exactly where an enemy will patrol on their next turn and tiles they can currently see are highlighted, their gaze sweeps over the map as they walk and turn, and it can be very tricky to figure out where you’ll be safely hidden. I also had instances where I was detected despite not appearing to be in an enemy’s sight at all, and though there might be a reason for that, it wasn’t clear. That’s no fun, but the saving grace is that the quick-save button makes reloading painless, and several of the stealth missions are optional anyway.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Capes’ clever and challenging take on superhero-flavored turn-based tactical combat gives you all of the information you need to turn the tables on its villains. Watching the action figure-like characters combine their powers and supercharge their diverse ultimate abilities sells their teamwork well, and chasing optional objectives in each mission gives you a lot to think about to counter a wide range of enemy types. Stealth missions don’t work quite as well but they’re mostly optional, and the story, heroes, and villains are entertainingly written throughout the substantial campaign.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
