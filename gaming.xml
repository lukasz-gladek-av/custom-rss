            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/677301/the-switch-2s-promising-start-hides-an-uncertain-future<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With the Switch 2 launch days away, analysts and consumers are watching to see how well Nintendo can follow-up the best selling home console in its history. Judging from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655361/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sold-out-walmart-gamestop-target">the pain of trying to secure a Switch 2 pre-order</a>, it seems like Nintendo has nothing to worry about – at least at launch.</p><p>Down the line, however, concerns about tariffs, a steadily rising cost of living, and a saturated market might cast a shadow on the Switch 2. <em>The Verge</em> talked to analysts, journalists, and normal video game playing people to put the Switch 2 launch in perspective. The key takeaway? While the console will assuredly have another blockbuster debut, its future looks much less certain.</p><p>The Wii U gets brought up a lot in the conversation surrounding the Switch 2, as it’s the most famous example of a Nintendo failure. “The Wii U, with its confusing controller-screen gimmick, sluggish user interface, and lack of a great <em>Custom Robo</em> game, was one of Nintendo’s worst flops,” <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/"><em>GameFile</em></a> author Stephen Totilo explained in an email to <em>The Verge</em>. </p><p>It sold less than 14 million units, a dramatic drop from the Wii, which sold over 100 million. And while Nintendo expects to sell one million more Switch 2 units in its first year than the Wii U sold in its life, that’s not necessarily indicative of long-term success. “The Wii U nevertheless sold out at launch back in November 2012,” Totilo said, “pulling in sales that <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/arts/nintendo-wii-u-hardware-sales-411119/">reportedly</a> topped the US launch sales of the Xbox 360 and PS3.”</p><p>When looking at launch sales projections and predictions, Mat Piscatella, video game analyst for Circana, warned that what a console does during its launch period is no indication of what it’ll do overall. </p><p>“Sales around the launch period are more reflection of available supply than anything,” Piscatella said. Another, more important factor for a console launch is the audience. “With anything regarding gaming right now, we have to separate the enthusiast market from the mass market, because they’re behaving very differently,” Piscatella added. </p><p>According to Piscatella, it’s the enthusiasts driving most of the Switch 2 hype we’re seeing, particularly since the last major console launches – the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S – happened five years ago. “We haven’t had new hardware designed for the masses in a long time,” he said. “So we have a big pent up demand just for something new.” </p><p>We’re seeing part of that demand satisfied by the Switch 2 pre-order frenzy. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">day pre-orders opened in the US</a> (after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">a few weeks’ delay</a> because of President Donald Trump’s tariff chicanery) they sold out within hours. GameStop held in-store pre order events that saw people <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/655949/switch-2-in-person-preorder-gamestop">lining up outside storefronts</a> for hours to secure one.</p><p>But what will really determine the success of the console is how the bigger, mass market reacts, the same one that made devices like the Wii and original Switch such hits. Piscatella says this group is biding its time right now, “leaning into free-to-play and the content they already have.”</p><p>It’s a tricky time for the industry. New blockbuster titles are getting ever more expensive to make. Consumers, in turn, are buying fewer of them in favor of spending their time and money in established games, all while persistent layoffs three years running are making it harder for new games to come out on time. Add that to 2025’s unique and volatile US tariff situation and the associated price increases, and now is one <em>hell </em>of a time to launch a video game console.</p><p>“A games console is for a lot of people [...] an unaffordable luxury, especially for families,” said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/keza-macdonald">Keza MacDonald</a>, video game editor at <em>The Guardian </em>and author of a forthcoming book about Nintendo’s history. MacDonald believes that most people who want a Switch 2 will have already pre-ordered one and that Nintendo’s real work will be to convince everyone else they want one too – a job the company doesn’t seem to be doing that well.</p><p>Silvie Krekow, a gamer who works at Vox Media as a creative director, says she knows “almost nothing” about the Switch 2. She doesn’t frequent gaming websites or consume gaming media, but she noted it was odd that “a 33-year-old gamer with disposable income who owns a Switch, PS4, and Xbox One” didn’t casually come across at least <em>some</em> Switch 2 information.</p><p>Other colleagues and self-described “gaming casuals” I spoke to expressed similar sentiments. According to MacDonald, Nintendo is handling this launch period very conservatively. “It’s like, ‘We know everyone’s going to buy this anyway. We don’t have to sell you on it,’” she said. “But I’m not sure if that’s true.”</p><div><p>At the Switch 2 Direct in April, Nintendo showed off a console with some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">slight quality-of-life and performance upgrades</a>. That may work for the enthusiasts – <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">they get more of what they already liked about the original</a>. But without something more to entice consumers beyond the diehards, the Switch 2 may struggle to find its audience.</p></div><p>“As for the [Switch 2 features] I’m not particularly excited,” said Kushal Raval, an operations manager at Vox Media. “The rolling controller sounds interesting, but the voice chat feature seems a bit pointless.” </p><p>Kushal owns a Switch, which he said didn’t run games like <em>Fortnite</em> as well as he wanted. And while the Switch 2’s technical upgrades will likely improve this, Kushal said, “With a $450–$500 price tag, I’m leaning much more toward getting a Steam Deck.”</p><p>The Switch 2 also has to compete against people content with its predecessor. “I have a Switch Lite that I bought during the pandemic,” said Jackie Noack, a video producer at Vox Media. “My husband has the Switch 1, and I don’t think we use them quite enough to justify replacing them.” For Noack, the console’s price is also a major factor. “$500 does seem steep to me!”</p><p>The Switch 2 will not be a dud like the Wii U, but it likely will not reach the heights of the original Switch. The price and lack of defining new features are two reasons, but perhaps the biggest is that the circumstances that fostered the OG Switch’s success were incredibly unique.</p><p>“The Switch really picked up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22188452/animal-crossing-new-horizons-coronavirus-pandemic-year-2020">during the pandemic with <em>Animal Crossing</em></a>. That was an enormous hit,” MacDonald said. “And obviously that was such a unique combination of circumstances, I’m not sure that could happen again.” Piscatella agrees: “The Switch is an outlier success. I think [the Switch 2] is unlikely to do Switch numbers in the long term.”</p><p>The lead up to the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 has been filled with so much built-up pressure from the anticipation of hungry gamers eager for any news, which was exacerbated by prolific leaks and Nintendo’s typical propensity for silence. With the console’s official reveal and the enthusiastic response from dedicated fans, that pressure could not be higher – and with launch coming next week, the release valve is finally about to open.</p><p>“Simply because of the logo on the box, it’s safe to say that the Switch 2 is too Nintendo to fail,” said Totilo. “At least in the early going.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/is-marathon-the-best-chance-extraction-shooters-have-to-break-into-the-mainstream<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Late last month, mega publisher <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn">EA fired 300 workers</a>, including around <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-around-100-employees-impacted">100 at developer Respawn</a>. The studio, founded by ex-Call of Duty developers, is responsible for Apex Legends and the Star Wars Jedi games, and was reportedly working on a third game in its beloved Titanfall series before its staff roster was cut. Now cancelled, the rumours suggest that this Titanfall project was an extraction shooter – a difficult-by-design PvPvE genre that currently only enjoys niche popularity. But an extraction shooter set in the world of Titanfall and Apex Legends could have been the genre’s ticket to the big leagues. So if not EA, who will take the “Tarkov-like” beyond its enthusiastic niche and into the mainstream? The answer may be just months away.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we’ve made select changes within our organization that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth," an EA spokesperson said of the layoffs that cut away at Respawn. It’s a sentiment EA employees have heard before. This move follows a rash of downsizing in other segments of EA’s portfolio, including at developers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-developer-codemasters-suffers-round-of-layoffs">Codemasters</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">BioWare</a>, and a more general <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">670 company-wide employees</a> back in March of last year. This trend has many decrying the state of the games industry as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-never-seen-it-this-bad-game-developers-explain-the-huge-layoffs-hitting-riot-epic-and-more">unsustainable</a> and calling for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-workers-form-first-north-american-industry-wide-union-with-communications-workers-of-america">unionization</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what of that rumored Titanfall extraction shooter? Naturally, its apparent cancellation has many fans disappointed; the existence (and lack of public appearance) of a new Titanfall game has become something of an in-joke in recent years. Further, rumors of a new extraction shooter from a triple-A studio has shone a spotlight on a style of game that has struggled to garner a significant audience thus far. And whether or not the cancelled Respawn title was indeed an extraction shooter, more people are discussing the potential of a genre that is in its infancy.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is an enthusiast genre which has, thus far, not significantly broken out to the mass market player,” Mat Piscatella, Video Games Industry Advisor at Circana, tells IGN.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, developer Bungie finally revealed gameplay footage for Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter that some predict will launch the genre into the mainstream. It's a game that's already found itself in hot water, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-developer-bungie-launches-thorough-review-after-once-again-being-found-to-have-used-work-from-an-uncredited-artist">accused of plagarising art assets</a>. But while there are ethical questions around Marathon's production, the response to the game itself after press went <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-hands-on-preview-can-bungie-do-to-escape-from-tarkov-what-fortnite-did-to-pubg">hands-on with it </a>seems largely positive. Perhaps this is to be expected from the studio with a reputation for stellar first-person shooter experiences like Halo and Destiny. But, come September, Marathon will be launching into a very different market, and the extraction shooter is a relatively untested genre. Will pedigree and tight FPS design be enough to carry the game to success? Analysts say: perhaps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If I were to bet on any developer being able to bring this genre to the mass market it would be Bungie,” Piscatella says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar, extraction shooters tend to be made up of a combination of player-versus-player and player-versus-environment gameplay loops. Small squads of players are dropped into a world, where they fight AI enemies and sometimes other player-controlled squads, to complete goals and gather resources, then escape the map. The genre was popularized by Escape From Tarkov, an incredibly unforgiving take on the formula characterized by its high-risk, high-reward firefights, which garnered a respectable audience during the COVID-19 lockdowns. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If I were to bet on any developer being able to bring this genre to the mass market it would be Bungie.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, a number of other developers have tried their hand at the genre with varying degrees of success. One of the most prominent is last year’s Helldivers 2, developed by Arrowhead Game Studios and published by Sony. It leans heavily on a campy schtick, community engagement, and in-game events, which has made it a standout among extraction shooters. Also, and perhaps most importantly, it’s a co-op only affair, with none of the tense PvP encounters that make games like Escape from Tarkov so challenging. According to Piscatella’s data, Helldivers 2 was the eighth most-played game on Steam in April, and ranked 34 on PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Helldivers 2 is the outlier success among this group,” Piscatella explains. “In April, approximately 9% of US active Steam users played Helldivers 2, while around 3% of PS5 players engaged with the game at least once. No other [extraction shooter] reached more than 2.3% of active players on any platform on which that particular game was played.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s immediately obvious that these stats are small when compared to more popular genres like battle royale or multiplayer FPS games. As hugely popular as Helldivers 2 seems to dedicated PlayStation owners, the mainstream is Fortnite, Call of Duty, and EA’s FC – games that garner much, much larger audiences. But Piscatella is quick to point out that the extraction shooter is a burgeoning genre with a great deal of potential, and it faces the same challenges as any other genre does in its early days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Small or developing genres often only get big after one game makes it so,” he says. “The dance/music genre was a pretty small niche until Guitar Hero showed up. Console FPS games didn't usually sell all that well at all until Halo. MMOs comprised a relatively small portion of the market until World of Warcraft became the biggest thing in the world. Maybe Marathon does that for extraction shooters. Maybe it doesn't. Nothing is guaranteed for any new game in today's market.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/16/marathon-1-1747388849733.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Other popular games in the extraction shooter genre include Deep Rock Galactic, Hunt: Showdown 1896, and Delta Force. The latter is a free-to-play title launched late last year and has been enjoying a steady rise in popularity in recent months: as of this writing, it ranks 15th in daily players on Steam, with somewhere around 135,000 players at peak. This is a respectable number, but nowhere near the numbers consistently put up by the battle royale genre and its titans. And let’s face it: executives have exhibited a certain amount of tunnel vision chasing the high monetization bars set by the Fortnites, Warzones, and PUBGs of the world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an argument that this sort of fixation has led to a certain amount of creative stagnation in the development space, and studio heads are less willing to take a chance on an unproven genre such as extraction shooters (it’s perhaps telling that Call of Duty’s attempt at it was an under-supported, now abandoned mode added to Warzone, rather than its own flagship release). In that way, Marathon represents the first significant triple-A effort to bring the genre to the masses. And it’s going to need all the help it can get along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bungie being the developer certainly does not guarantee Marathon success,” Piscatella says. “In order for [it] to break through it would certainly help if the game could win over dedicated fans of the genre so they could advocate for the game among family and friends.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest challenge facing Marathon is the untested nature of the extraction shooter genre as a whole.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond word of mouth, Bungie will need to ensure smooth onboarding for prospective players. In particular, converting core players familiar with first-person shooters will likely figure into Bungie’s rollout strategy, but long-term retention will all boil down to the gameplay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It would…be helpful if Marathon were to have a ramping path for people that are more familiar with the big FPS titles like Call of Duty to help initiate trial and conversion,” Piscatella explains. “It would also have to nail the whole ‘easy to pick up, difficult to master’ trick that many mass market hits are able to pull off.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reality is that these are all the same problems faced by any new title, and the one true decider of success or failure is the market, which, as Piscatella points out, is extremely unwelcoming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is a very fickle market at the moment. People have their favorite long-running games that are constantly being updated, are familiar, have significant social and monetary hooks, and many of these titles are free-to-play or easily accessible without an upfront purchase price. So, the challenges facing Bungie and Marathon are not dissimilar to those facing any new game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fickle market notwithstanding, the biggest challenge facing Marathon is the untested nature of the extraction shooter genre as a whole. Escape From Tarkov has enjoyed its accolades, but that game benefitted from an audience inflated by pandemic lockdowns, as well as a gameplay loop that appealed to the core gamer segment. Subsequent titles have only seen middling performances (with Helldivers 2 being the outlier), so it’s easy to understand why studios have been reticent to devote significant resources to such a project, especially when the battle royale genre has proven its dominance.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that way, Marathon should prove to be a useful litmus test for the rest of the industry. It’s surprising to see a studio like Bungie going all-in on an extraction shooter in this environment, and if it receives a strong reception you can expect other developers and publishers to take its lead. Of course there are dozens of factors to account for - things like monetization and market trends - and nobody can predict how things will unfold. But Bungie certainly has the clout and design chops to make something special. And it’s going to take something special to take the extraction shooter genre from niche to mainstream. You can be sure that, come September, the industry will be eagerly watching the launch of Marathon. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>For those who are not familiar with Football Manager, it is easy to assume that the series is just about football. After all, you choose a team to manage, get a squad together, pick some tactics, and hope they work out to take your team to glory. It is easy to come to that conclusion. It is also wrong. Football Manager 2024 is a game that’s about so much more than just football. It’s really just the cover to a game about interpersonal relationships, and the importance of how managing them is integral to success or failure.</p>
<h2>The connection between players and manager</h2>
<p>The most crucial relationships in Football Manager 24 are between you and your players. You are managing people at different stages of their careers, from the youngsters just taking their first steps into the world of professional football to those who are experienced and close to retirement. Just like any workplace, each individual has their own needs, wants, and goals. If you’re a good manager, you will help each of these players to meet their expectations and exceed them in some cases. One player may want to be seen as the most important player at the club, while another will want to go out on loan to gain valuable experience. Others can make demands of you to make improvements to the club or push you to back other players in the squad.</p>
<p>Dealing with the different demands and promises made of a small group is hard enough, but now imagine that for a squad of 25 or more players? Not everyone will get what they want, no matter how hard you try. If you have two players wanting to play in the same position, and there is one who is clearly better than the other, your job as manager is to pick the better player for the good of the club. You can do your best to support the other player, such as placing them on loan, but this can upset them just as much as not playing. Making too many promises comes with its own issues. Break a promise to one player and you might get away with it, depending on their influence on the team, but keep breaking promises and the squad will turn on you making it almost impossible to get success on the pitch, putting your own job at risk.</p>



<p>No manager really wants to admit it, but everyone has their favourites. Some players will be backed no matter what because of how good they are, while a player who doesn’t take their chances will start to be ignored, leading to a breakdown in your relationship. However, your favourites can also turn on you when the transfer windows open, demanding to be sold to someone else, no matter what you say. At the same time, the player you ignored may not want to leave and try to prove they can be better.</p>

<p>All of this just scratches the surface of how relationships with players works in Football Manager 2024, and it can be a source of more frustration than losing 1-0 in a league match where your team had 15 shots while the opposition had one. Players are not the only group you have to have a good relationship with though.</p>
<h2>The connection between the backroom staff and manager</h2>
<p>The players are the public-facing part of the football club, with their performances there for all to see. However, those performance and player development depends on the hidden engine which is the backroom staff. Assistant managers, coaches, the medical team, and the recruitment team all influence the club’s success, with the advice they can give you and how they help your players.</p>
<p>The relationship system with your backroom staff is not as deep as it is with players, but it still matters. For example, if you find an exceptional coach that is great for your team’s development you will want to keep them happy, lest another club comes in and offers them a job. You can convince them to stay with you, usually with a better contract, but if you do not know their needs they will decide to leave.</p>

<p>The whole backroom squad is also reliant on your for their jobs, and at times you need to be ruthless. Better coaches and scouts may become available, meaning you weigh up keeping a current staff member or deciding to get rid of them and bring someone with better attributes in. It is not a simple decision, because firing someone usually means paying them some compensation which can also impact your club finances.</p>
<p>The backroom team has as much power as you allow them to have. As a manager you might want to control everything or, like me, delegate responsibility for things like training. You can choose to have meetings regularly with your staff too, discussing things like recruitment policies and player development. Their suggestions can help you decide if a staff member fits your vision, or is providing information that is useless, so firing them is the better option. Like the players, it is all about managing staff expectations and doing what is best for the club, even it means letting people go and angering them in the process.</p>
<h2>The connection to the board</h2>
<p>While you have management power over players and the backroom staff, you are not the final authority. Just like most of us in real life, you also have a boss in Football Manager 2024 and you need to meet their expectations to keep your own job. When you start at a club, the board will set you targets to meet. Unhappy players and staff can be managed, but an unhappy board of directors is a sign you are not going to last long in your post.</p>

<p>What you have to do here is apply techniques of managing upwards, influencing your board to come to your way of thinking. Some boards are easier to persuade than others, especially those with some money behind them. Those with poor finances will need convincing that your requests will turn the club around. When you make a request a board may decide to implement it or reject it. If they reject you can try to convince them or give them an ultimatum. Much like real life, ultimatums rarely work so it probably isn’t a good idea unless the board really likes you.</p>
<p>Boards will like you if you are meeting their targets, which vary club to club. Some will want you to focus on building up the youth squad for long term success, so convincing them to build better youth training facilities should be easy. Others will want you to focus on club finances by buying and selling players for profit or reducing the wage budget. Meet these expectations and the board will listen to you. Fail and you’ll be sitting in front of them convincing them to keep your job.</p>
<h2>The connection between the fans, media and manager</h2>
<p>There are two other groups that will help decide your fate with those being the club fans and the media. As a manager you have a responsibility to engage with these stakeholders too. Fans are similar to the board in that they have their expectations, and if they are unhappy that will influence the board. Their expectations usually align, so the only way to keep them happy is to meet or exceed them, as there is no direct way to chat to a fan spokesperson about club issues.</p>

<p>The media is another matter. They will contact you for quotes about club happenings, grill you over new signings, and want to chat post-match. Each sports journalist will form an opinion of you, with some loving you and others absolutely loathing you. How they view you impacts the way they write their stories, which will influence relationships with others other managers, the fans, the players, and the board.</p>
<p>How do you manage the media? By providing them some juicy quotes and tidbits, so they want to keep you happy so you provide more information. How do you turn the media against you? Well, keep your information close to your chest or just don’t engage with them. They will write stories that are not great for you, but as a manager you need to put the club first.</p>

<hr>
<p>Football Manager 24 is not just a football management game. It is a relationship game which is set in the world of football. You have to meet the expectations of players, the board, fans, and staff. Just like real life relationships, each one has different ways to navigate them so that people feel valued, but just like in reality, you cannot keep everyone happy all of the time. Sometimes things will work out for you and the relationships are all positive which is great, but if things start to break down it can lead to a messy breakup with the club.</p>

This one is an ice dragon that specializes in AOE attacks, which can be annoying. However, there’s a special in-game event that could help you out immensely if you’re lucky.</p><h2 id="h636652"><a id="1"></a>Preparation</h2><p>Being made of ice, Caligo’s weakness is fire, so it’s important to find a fire elemental weapon during your expedition. Just look for structures on the map with the fire icon and defeat the bosses there for a chance at earning a corresponding elemental weapon..</p><p>If the Mountaintop Shifting Earth event is active, trekking up the mountain to get the bonus at the end is worth it. Shifting Earth events are random occurrences in the game that will change a part of Limveld’s map. </p><p>If you reach the top of Mountaintop, you’ll earn a passive buff that will greatly increase your frost resistance as well as increase your damage against dragons. Since we’re going up against an ice dragon, Mountaintop is definitely worth tackling on Day Two where you’ll have more of a fighting chance against the monsters there.</p><p>Ranged classes like Ironeye are helpful too as you can aim for Caligo’s head.</p><h2 id="h636653"><a id="2"></a>Strategies for fighting Caligo</h2><figure id="" data-id="225d8cae93ab74f345d02d6720c16f1d" data-recommend-id="image://225d8cae93ab74f345d02d6720c16f1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player races toward Caligo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player races toward Caligo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="225d8cae93ab74f345d02d6720c16f1d" data-recommend-id="image://225d8cae93ab74f345d02d6720c16f1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player races toward Caligo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Caligo is gigantic, even by Nightlord standards. As such, it doesn’t move nearly as often as others and that can make for an easy target. It’ll typically swipe with its claws, but that attack is easily telegraphed and dodged by rolling forward.</p><p>Caligo will start incorporating ice into its attacks, such as its freezing breath. This attack spreads out in a cone, so be sure to dodge roll <em>behind </em>Caligo. There is another breath attack where Caligo will stand on its hind legs and breathe fog directly down in front of it. The same strategy as before applies here—get behind Caligo. This attack can also form icicles on the ground that will inflict damage and build up frostbite should you touch them. Avoid these.</p><figure id="" data-id="2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-recommend-id="image://2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The entire sky is blotted out with a icey fog." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The entire sky is blotted out with a icey fog." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-recommend-id="image://2b8ab69af04e76df142abba951dd364b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The entire sky is blotted out with a icey fog." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Eventually, Caligo will cover the entire screen with fog. You’ll also sometimes see a gust of black wind heading in a specific direction at the same time. Follow it until you find a pillar of ice to hide behind. This will shield you from Caligo’s upcoming huge ice wave attack. </p><figure id="" data-id="6fc3ab7e4e50b41234431eae71a4dfd3" data-recommend-id="image://6fc3ab7e4e50b41234431eae71a4dfd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A surge of ice stretches across the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A surge of ice stretches across the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6fc3ab7e4e50b41234431eae71a4dfd3" data-recommend-id="image://6fc3ab7e4e50b41234431eae71a4dfd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A surge of ice stretches across the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In a variation of this attack, Caligo will summon a gigantic sheet of ice to come crashing down into the ground. The sound of ice cracking signals this attack. Unfortunately, right now it seems like the only way to avoid this attack is to run as fast as you can away from the noise and pray that you’re out of the ice sheet’s range before the fog lifts and the sheet comes crashing down.</p><figure id="" data-id="01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-recommend-id="image://01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ice forms around the player while the dragon boss flies into the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ice forms around the player while the dragon boss flies into the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-recommend-id="image://01c94fc1c780c0268f489d4ab1506062" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ice forms around the player while the dragon boss flies into the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Caligo will also fly around and summon meteors to hit you. This is the most mobile it’ll be through the entire fight. Fortunately, this move is rather rare and easier to dodge than Caligo’s other ones.</p><p>Arguably, Caligo is a more annoying boss battle than it is a hard one, especially due to how much space its attacks cover. Timing your expedition with the Mountaintop event will make the fight significantly easier, so make sure you get every advantage you can.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/677197/playdate-season-2-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A lot of games have been released for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">the Playdate since it launched in 2022</a>, as a quick browse of <a href="https://itch.io/games/tag-playdate">itch.io</a> or <a href="https://play.date/games/">the Catalog shop</a> will attest. But still, there’s something unique about the handheld’s seasonal format, which just kicked off its second iteration. When it first launched, the Playdate came with 24 games from notable indie developers that were steadily released on a weekly cadence, making a perfect introduction to the little yellow device and its crank. Now, a few years later, we finally have season 2, and it’s off to a solid start — and it even includes a bizarre mystery.</p><p>The new season runs for the next six weeks and totals a dozen games, two of which will drop each week. <a href="https://play.date/games/seasons/two/">The entire collection will run you $39</a>. To start, we have a pair of very different games. <em>Fulcrum Defender</em>, from <em>FTL: Faster Than Light</em> developer Subset Games, is sort of like a modern take on <em>Asteroids</em>. You control a little ship in the middle and fire guns at little squares flying toward you. The twist is that you use the crank to rotate the ship around and aim your shots. There’s also something of a roguelike element, where you steadily unlock random upgrades like new weapons or a larger spread for your bullets. The goal is to last for 10 straight minutes.</p><p>It’s a pretty challenging game — so far, I’ve only really had success on easy mode — but it’s also surprisingly chill, eliciting that sort of zen state that the best shooters and puzzle games can create. This is helped by its lo-fi soundtrack that pretty much demands you play with headphones on. It’s an absorbing game.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum is <em>Dig Dig Dino!</em>, developed by Dom2D and Fáyer, who brag that the game “is perfect to play while watching TV! No time pressure, no quick reflexes needed!” It’s a puzzle game where you travel to different dig sites to uncover dinosaur bones, artifacts, and trash. You only have a limited amount of moves per dig, but you can upgrade your capacity over time — while also getting new tools to smash rocks or dig deeper — letting you dig both more and for longer. It’s sort of like a really cute take on <em>Minesweeper</em>, one clearly designed for short play sessions. It’s not exactly difficult, but there’s still something satisfying about uncovering a large dinosaur bone when you’re just about to run out of moves.</p><p>These two games do a good job of showing the breadth of games possible on the Playdate; one is meant for quick bursts, the other for longer, more focused sessions. But the launch week package is rounded out by something a whole lot weirder. It’s called <em>Blippo Plus</em> and, well, it’s a series of TV channels you can flip between using the crank. Some are nothing but static, while others have giant FMV videos of strange TV shows or commercials. One show, called <em>Tantric Computing,</em> is nothing but closeup shots of someone using a computer mouse. Another, <em>Werf’s Tavern</em>, is some kind of musical talk show. There’s also a messaging tool and some kind of fax service.</p><p>What’s most interesting about <em>Blippo Plus</em>, though, isn’t just that it’s odd. It’s also a mystery that seems like it will evolve over the course of the season. Playdate maker Panic says that “Playdate season 2 owners should tune in weekly and make sure they are connected to WiFi when season 2 updates at 10 AM PT on Thursdays.” There are lots of other promising games planned for season 2, including the point-and-click adventure <em>Shadowgate PD</em> and whatever the heck <em>Long Puppy</em> and <em>Tiny Turnip</em> are.</p><p>But an FMV mystery that unfolds over the course of weeks is something that’s pretty unique to this format — and further evidence that the Playdate exists in its own parallel universe.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SEGA Football Club Champions will have two game modes built into it. The first of these is career mode where you build up a local team and steer it to becoming the best club in the world. In career mode, you will need to sign players, develop your club facilities, manage training, and get the tactics right to win on the pitch. The other mode is Dream Team Mode which is a PvP mode which will include a number of different options including Arena and Event matches. When it comes to licensing, the game has 10,000 pro players included. These players are from the Japan J1-J3 league, the South Korean K League, FIFPRO players, and players from Manchester City.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman’s&nbsp;</strong>sadly run into a progress breaking bug in Oblivion and doesn’t fancy replaying a whole chunk of the game to rectify it. So he’s hopped into the Skyrim and Elden Ring inspired Tainted Grail… which is also quite buggy, but does at least have active devs working on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead and we’ll see you back here next week!</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Geralt, the hero of The Witcher series of games, nearly had a considerably different face. He actually did, briefly, but the game's community disliked it so much CD Projekt Red panicked and changed it back.</p>
<p>The problem? Anatomical correctness. The community didn't think Geralt was alien-looking or ugly enough.</p>
<p>The year was 2010 and CD Projekt Red was ready to debut its brand new Witcher game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</a>, to the world. A couple of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-unveils-the-witcher-2">leaked videos preceded the formal announcement</a> but when a clutch of screenshots was eventually released, it debuted a different looking Geralt to the one people were used to from The Witcher 1.</p>
<p>Whereas Geralt had previously had the proportions of a triangle, roughly, which angled to a point on his nose and didn't seem to involve a chin of any kind, he now had much easier-on-the-eye proportions and looked like an actual person. He was even, dare I say it, handsome. It simply wouldn't do.</p>
<p>Some of this was to be expected. The transition from Witcher 1 to Witcher 2 included a transition for the game's engine, moving from BioWare's Aurora engine, which once powered <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neverwinter-nights">Neverwinter Nights</a>, to CD Projekt Red's internally made engine Redengine. A facial design that worked well in one engine wouldn't necessarily work in both.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>"The problem was that The Witcher 1 was heavily stylised," CD Projekt Red art director Pawel Mielniczuk explained to me. "From an art point of view, it was a much simpler visual fidelity than was in The Witcher 2 and Witcher 3. It was based on this Aurora engine from Neverwinter Nights - low poly, you know - so the character looks great there but the face of Geralt in The Witcher 1 wasn't very anatomically correct. It was making a good impression.</p>
<p>"When we got to The Witcher 2, we had a better engine - larger budgets for polygons, more artists to sculpt nice faces, and we actually got better at making characters, already being a studio that released one game. And Geralt's [existing] face just did not match the style of the rest of the characters," he said. "It was not realistic human proportions."</p>
<p>The solution was clear: redesign Geralt's face. "Let's make Geralt from scratch - nobody will notice that," Mielniczuk said, and laughed at the memory. "So we made it at the very beginning of The Witcher 2 production and we released it with this first bunch of screenshots to see what the response was, and the response was horrible! Our community just smashed us on the forums - there were almost riots there."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Sadly I can't find those riots on those company forums now; 15 years of chatter has buried it. But Mielniczuk told me the comments there were to the effect of: "True Geralt: he's supposed to be ugly and inhuman!" CD Projekt Red backtracked as a result of the backlash, and it would take a further two years of tinkering, and testing and re-evaluating, to get Geralt's look right for the game. "And was a hybrid of The Witcher 1 Geralt and a real human," Mielniczuk said.</p>
<p>By the time <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> development came around, in around 2011-2012, the opportunity once again presented itself to tinker with Geralt's face, but this time the studio resisted. "With The Witcher 3, we actually used exactly the same model from Witcher 2, added more polygons, updated textures, but we did not touch it," Mielniczuk said.</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">

</figure>
<p>That's not to say Mielniczuk didn't want to alter Geralt's face for the third game. He was the lead character artist on The Witcher 3. He hand-sculpted both Ciri and Yennefer's face, and he could see glaring issues with Geralt's. "If you look at the profile of Geralt: he has this incredible profile but the tip of his nose is a completely straight line from his forehead, kind of Greek proportions, and it was not fitting his face, so we wanted to fix that. But we did not," he said. "We made a decision, 'Okay, that's Geralt, he's recognisable, people are loving our character. We pass. We cannot make this mistake once again.'"</p>
<p>Which brings us around to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, which is now in full production and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">we know will include Geralt to some degree</a>. The new game will also move the series to a new engine, Unreal Engine 5, so once again there's an opportunity for a Geralt-face redesign. Will CD Projekt Red take it?</p>

</figure>
<p>"It's such a grounded character right now I would really not dare to touch it," Mielniczuk said. "And in general, it's a very successful character because his face is recognisable, probably also because of these features of inhuman proportions in the upper part of the body. So no, I wouldn't update anything, just textures, normal maps, adding more details on the face, make it realistic through the surfaces, but not through the anatomy and proportions."</p>
<p>But there is one thing that might tempt Mielniczuk to update Geralt's face, or rather one person, and that's Henry Cavill, the former star of The Witcher Netflix TV show. Mielniczuk is a big fan of his. "Henry was just perfect," he said. Then he added, laughing: "If I would do something to the face, I would be easily convinced to scan Henry and put him in The Witcher 4!"</p>
<p>I spoke to Pawel Mielniczuk as part of a series of interviews <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-worked-in-the-witcher-3-and-what-didnt-looking-back-on-a-landmark-rpg-with-cd-projekt-red">looking back on The Witcher 3, a decade on, through the eyes of the people who made it</a>.

</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p><em><a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/category/guides/elden-ring-nightreign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em> is the new standalone, not-DLC set in the world of <em>Elden Ring</em> by FromSoftware.</p><p><em>Nightreign</em> is condensed and distilled <em>Elden Ring</em>. It even takes place in a smaller version of the Lands Between. But that distillation also makes it faster, denser, and even more challenging. As weird as it is to describe any FromSoftware game this way, <em>Nightreign</em> makes <em>Elden Ring</em> look positively cozy in comparison.</p><p><strong>The following starter guide was <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/guides/elden-ring-nightreign/nightreign-what-you-should-know-beginners-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally</a> published by our friends at <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Friendly Guide</a>, a new website devoted to game guides.

Below, we’re going to break down some important things you should know before diving into <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>.</p><h2><strong>What the hell is Elden Ring Nightreign?</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p><em>Nightreign</em> is a multiplayer, battle-royale-but-PvE game with roguelike elements. And what that means is, let’s just say it here, it’s kind of <em>Fortnite</em>-ified <em>Elden Ring</em>. You start an Expedition — a run — by <em>gliding</em> onto an <em>island</em> where there’s a shrinking <em>circle</em> that damages you if you get caught outside.</p><p>It’s not a battle royale, though. It’s you and two teammates against a parade of <em>Elden Ring</em> enemies that come from a wide range stages in the base game.</p><p>Your Expedition takes place across three days. Your ultimate goal is to earn Runes (by killing enemies) and pick up items throughout the day to level up both your character and your gear. Then, when the Night’s Tide (that shrinking circle) forces you to an arena at the end of that day, you’ll need to defeat a boss to progress to the next day. Day 2 is similar to day 1, and you and your buddies will need to work hard to get strong for the boss battles to come.&nbsp;</p><p>After the night fight on day 2, you’ll be teleported to just outside of a boss arena where you can level up if you have enough Runes or shop at a nearby merchant. You and your squad can then take on the Night Lord, the big boss that comes at the end of each Expedition. If you kill it, you win, and will progress the game. If you and your teammates go down during the boss fight — or any of the previous night fight — you’ll fail and will need to start a new Expedition from scratch at <em>Nightreign</em>‘s version of the Roundtable Hold.</p><p>And you’re going to fail. Often.</p><h2><strong>Leveling up is streamlined</strong></h2><p>Just like in <em>Elden Ring</em> proper, killing enemies earns you Runes, but you’re not out to kill every single enemy on the map. You’re here for one reason — to survive until the third night, which means surviving three circles, defeating at least three (probably more) bosses, and then fighting the chosen Night Lord. And doing that means leveling up.</p><p>You do this at Sites of Grace scattered around the island. In <em>Nightreign</em>, the leveling up process is much simpler than in <em>Elden Ring</em>. You only have one stat to adjust — your level — and that adjusts all of your other stats.</p><p>How fast and easy <em>Nightreign</em> makes leveling up is good because …</p><h2>Elden Ring Nightreign is chaotic</h2><p>When you head out on an Expedition, it’s chaos. It’s you and two strangers — who you can’t talk to, as there’s no in-game voice chat — dropped onto an island with a lot of shiny distractions and no plan for where to go.</p><p>If you want to survive, stick with your party and watch for the shrinking circle of deadly (tick damage) rain. Use the pin function on the map to suggest destinations, but be ready to head in the opposite direction if you get outvoted (or your teammates just ignore your pin).</p><p>Speaking of …</p><h2><strong>Resist the urge to act like you’re playing solo</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is a multiplayer game. And while you can play solo, it is both very tough and removes the down-but-not-out state, which is a real (literal) lifesaver in combat. Solo runs are theoretically doable, and there’s no doubt that some absolute heroes out there will make it work for them, but it’s definitely not ideal for your first time through the game. It’s much more fun to play with other players — even if you don’t know them and aren’t communicating at all — than playing by yourself.</p><p>With that in mind, it’s important to play with your team once you do actually load into a match. You’re at your strongest when you’re playing together and working to help grow everyone’s power, not just your own.</p><h2>Item drops are shared</h2><p>When you kill an enemy, smash a crate, or open a chest, the items that drop aren’t for you alone — they’re shared and collectable across everyone in the party. Sometimes, that means you’re going to be racing to pick up the good stuff. Sometimes, that also means you’ll be better served by letting someone else grab that cool sword. Basically, don’t be a dick.</p><h2><strong>Treat smithing stones and extra flask charges like gold</strong></h2><p>Finding new weapons and leveling up is critical to success as you advance through <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>. But there are other things you need to focus on as well in order to boost your power. Namely, you should be looking for smithing stones and visiting churches.&nbsp;</p><p>The smithing stones will allow you to upgrade your weapon’s rarity, which can drastically increase its damage output. While you’re leveling up, you should definitely save some Runes for a smithing stone before you take on the Night Lord at the end of your Expedition.&nbsp;</p><p>As you come across churches mid-Expedition, look for the giant, angelic statue. Interact with the altar in front of it to add a healing charge to your flask.</p><h2>Traversal is a lot faster and jumpier</h2><p>Jumping is a lot more important in <em>Nightreign</em>. And there’s a wall jump now that essentially lets you climb vertically on certain surfaces. Oh, and there’s no fall damage in this version of the Lands Between.</p><p>This is good, since every Expedition involves a lot of headlong sprinting across the landscape and you’re going to take some big falls when you’re not paying attention. But it also means there are more options for climbing and just generally getting around the island.</p><h2><strong>Just because you find a boss doesn’t mean you should fight a boss</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>As you sprint across the map with your buds, you’re going to encounter a ton of different enemies from <em>Elden Ring</em>. They’ll come from every stage, area, and difficulty of the game, all mixed together.</p><p>Some of those enemies will be bosses. Bosses can drop some great loot alongside a ton of Runes — both of which you’ll need for any successful run. But, if you’re not prepared, those bosses can also wipe out your entire party, ending your Expedition before it even gets started.</p><p>There’s only so much you can accomplish over the course of a day, so don’t get too caught up fighting the biggest and baddest thing you encounter. Sometimes it’s better to save those fights until you get more powerful.</p><h2>Relics make you more powerful</h2><p>Not every buff and stat increase happen during an Expedition. At the Roundtable Hold, you can equip Relics by performing Relic Rites.</p><p>Relics are color-coded items that give you benefits on all future expeditions. They do things like add poison damage to your starting weapon or increase your resistances — you’ll need all the help you can get.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll earn Relics at the end of every Expedition, so even failed runs can benefit you.</p><h2><strong>Watch the UI for critical info</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>Image: FromSoftware/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>The UI in <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is packed with obvious and not-so-obvious details that are extremely important to look out for. One of the more obviously helpful notifications is one that you can easily miss if you’re too focused on the fights happening all around you: the circle closing.</p><p>The game will tell you the Night Rain is coming toward you via a message box that says “rains gather, portending the tide of Night” in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, just under your Rune counter. Once you get the notification, you’re going to want to mark the safe zone and book it — depending on where you are in the circle, you won’t have much time to get to the next area.</p><p>A not-so-obvious helpful UI tip is that you can tell when you have enough Runes to level up just by looking at the top left-hand corner of your screen. To the left of your current level, you’ll see an arrow pointing up over and over again if you’re rich enough to jump to the next level. Levels are extremely valuable in <em>Nightreign</em>, so make sure you hit a Site of Grace before the next boss fight if you see that arrow.</p><p><strong>For more tips, tricks and guides, visit <a href="https://bigfriendly.guide/guides/elden-ring-nightreign/nightreign-what-you-should-know-beginners-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Friendly Guide</a>.</strong></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-parrying-clair-obscur-ea"><h3>It’s Never Too Late To Talk About A Video Game</h3></a><p>It's also never too late to have *obviously correct* opinions about video game mechanics</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract"><h3>Zenimax Union Reaches Tentative Contract With Microsoft</h3></a><p>The QA worker union has been bargaining for nearly two years</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring Nightreign GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is intended as an online co-op game for three players, or solo, but with no option to only play in pairs unless they match with a random third wheel. While a three-person group is quite common in online games, including Apex Legends and Destiny, the lack of a duo option has not gone down well for folks who just want to play with a friend or partner. It's one of the criticisms highlighted amongst the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">negative reviews on Steam</a>, where the game is currently sitting at a "Mixed" rating. </p><p>The lack of a Duos Mode was made clear during Elden Ring Nightreign's announcement and game director Junya Ishizaki also explained in an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> interview back in December that the reason behind focusing on three players was "largely a game balancing decision, rather than a game design decision." In a later <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> interview ahead of the game's launch, Ishizaki did however admit that duos were "kind of overlooked and neglected" and hinted that support may come post-launch.</p><p>While nothing has been officially confirmed, this is yet another example of modders stepping in to add such missing features to a game.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is available now for PC, PS4, PS5, X.box One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

Time to choose your Nightfarer and set out into Limveld in hopes of defeating the Nightlord before you’re lost to the rains.

His Sixth Sense passive allows you to cheat death and stay up through one instance of fatal damage. As a generalist, he doesn't excel with any specific weapons, but can use most martial armaments. His favorite weapon is the Greatsword.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/wylder-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wylder Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Guardian</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-3-guardian-1748614612549.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Guardian is Nightreign's tank class. He's most comfortable wielding a large shield and a weapon that can be used while guarding, such as a Halberd, Rapier, or Hand Crossbow. The Guardian deals less damage than the other Nightfarers, but has immense durability and multiple ways to disrupt foes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/guardian-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Guardian Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ironeye</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-4-ironeye-1748614631528.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Ironeye is the bow specialist, though his high Dexterity makes him proficient with a variety of other melee weapons such as daggers and curved swords. Unfortunately, his low durability makes him a poor choice as a front-line fighter, so use melee weapons with caution. Overall, his abilities are simple to use, making him an excellent choice for beginners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/ironeye-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ironeye Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Duchess</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-5-duchess-1748614659315.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Duchess is a dagger-wielding Nightfarer who excels at evasive action to weave in and out of combat. Her starting weapon comes with a potent character skill, enchanting your blade with the Magic affinity for extra damage. In addition, she can adeptly wield Glintstone Sorceries due to her high intelligence, and she has decent Faith scaling for Incantations as well. For the Duchess, look out for weapons with the Magic or Frost Affinity, and those that can trigger statuses like Frostbite or Blood Loss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/duchess-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Duchess Character Guide</u></a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Raider</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-6-raider-1748614679688.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Raider has high Strength and uses large/colossal weapons to smash his foes. While he can use a variety of martial armaments well, his FP is extremely low, making it difficult to use weapon skills. The Raider's inherent durability makes him difficult to stagger, helping him ensure that his blows connect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/raider-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Raider Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Revenant</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-7-revenant-1748614720933.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Revenant is a support class, though her high Faith allows her to use offensive Incantations with ease. However, her ability to deal damage is limited as she has no method of FP recovery. Her passive ability summons the shades of foes to fight at your side, distracting enemies and dealing damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/revenant-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Revenant Character Guide</u></a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Recluse</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-8-recluse-1748614743897.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A spellcaster adept who can use her character skill to restore FP, the Recluse excels at unleashing devastation from afar. Her stats favor Sorceries and Incantations, but she can use Magic, Frost, Fire, Holy, and Lightning affinity weapons. This character is a bit more difficult to play as you don't have as many defensive options, and need to manage FP in addition to your Health and Stamina. However, if you do everything correctly, she deals significant damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/recluse-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Recluse Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Executor</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-9-executor-1748614759386.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Executor excels in single combat. He has high Dexterity and Arcane, giving him access to a majority of the game's smaller weapons.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-expansion-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we first reviewed&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-mandalorian-adventures-review-is-this-way" rel="nofollow"><em>The Mandalorian Adventures</em></a> here on TechRaptor, we were truly impressed by the depth of the game and replay value contained within the core box. But every adventure, no matter how great, deserves a second season (or more)! Which is why we're thrilled to preview <em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two</em>, which the fine folks at <a href="https://unexpectedgames.com/clanoftwo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unexpected Games</a> (via distributor <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/products/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-expansion" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Asmodee USA</a>) sent along a copy of for us to check out!</p>



<p><em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two</em>&nbsp;is an expansion to&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures</em>, inspired by events taking place in the second season of&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian</em>. With new heroes to play as and new missions to tackle, this great expands the base game - but, be warned,&nbsp;<strong>you need the base game to be able to play&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two</em>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Box Contents Include:</strong></p>

<ul><li>1 Rulebook</li>
	<li>1 Mission Book</li>
	<li>95 Cards (Including 4 New Heroes)</li>
	<li>18 Mini Cards</li>
	<li>137 Tokens</li>
	<li>4 Standees</li>
	<li>2 Mercenary Mission Sheets (Double-Sided)</li>
</ul><h2>What New Heroes Are Included In&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two?</em></h2>

<p>There are four new heroes included in&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two&nbsp;</em>that you can play as with both these expansion missions and the missions included in the core game. These include: the exiled Jedi Ahsoka Tano, famed bounty hunter Boba Fett, Mandalorian heiress Bo-Katan Kryze, and master assassin and sharpshooter&nbsp;Fennec Shand.</p>

<p>Each of these characters also have new persistent character abilities, changing how they play and making them feel wholly unique compared to the characters contained in the core box. Let's take a look hero by hero and chat briefly about their abilities!</p>

<h3>Ahsoka Tano</h3>
<p>Ahsoka Tano's hero card may seem like it comes with a major drawback - she can only attack enemies within the same space as her? But along with it perfectly fitting her flavor (she is, after all, a lightsaber wielder), but with her "Shoto Lightsaber" card shown above (of which she has two in her deck), she could potentially dish out 6 damage!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-ahsoka-cards.jpg?itok=Q2W_Sk7R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-ahsoka-cards.jpg?itok=zK4iBW8Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ahsoka's cards keep her very free-wheeling and float-y around the battlefield, just like a Jedi!</figcaption></figure><h3>Boba Fett</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-boba-fett.jpg?itok=HVgHcCQo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-boba-fett.jpg?itok=wqQ4FR6L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Everyone's favorite bounty hunter Boba Fett blasts onto the scene with the persistent character ability you see above, allowing him to attack twice in a turn (as long as there aren't too many other cards in the action slot). Another great ability that gives you a huge benefit while also making you think carefully about how you play!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-boba-cards.jpg?itok=Ew8KNleG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-boba-cards.jpg?itok=qsEjwT9z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boba Fett is, as expected, extremely combat focused, with cards that help you mitigate his character ability's downside of strength restriction in action spaces.</figcaption></figure><h3>Bo-Katan</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-bo-katan.jpg?itok=C6SBbUou 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-bo-katan.jpg?itok=zasn13Pp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Bo-Katan is the most unique of any hero we've seen come to the game, as her persistent character ability says that she has to keep the top card of her skill deck faceup! This is a very fun mechanic, leading to a lot of shenanigans with trying to manipulate your skill deck to get the most out of her every turn, while giving you a bit of extra info you wouldn't normally know.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-bo-katan-cards.jpg?itok=ma0w-DqC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-bo-katan-cards.jpg?itok=iycHl-mv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bo-Katan's cards truly focus on her ability to use and manipulate her skill deck, and is one of the trickier (but more satisfying) characters to play.</figcaption></figure><h3>Fennec Shand</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-fennec-shand.jpg?itok=zDQlndW2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-fennec-shand.jpg?itok=8fGyMqfS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Fennec Shand is an unparalleled sniper in the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;universe, and her ability to increase the range of her attack by one (at the cost of one strength) will make her close some pretty incredible distances in the game. Remember, three spaces can often feel like half the board when you're winding around the map!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-fennec-cards.jpg?itok=d3eYZN8o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-fennec-cards.jpg?itok=FoJzAakf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fennec is especially good at keeping enemy forces reined in and pinging out damage around the board.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are The New Missions Like In&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two?</em></h2>

<p>The new missions in&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures - Clan of Two</em>&nbsp;break the mold from the original game in fun and challenging ways, while providing a diverse set of challenges and maps that require different plans of attack! I don't want to spoil too much (that's part of the fun of playing&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures</em>), so I'll stick with showing off and describing a bit about the first of the four missions in this expansion, which recreates the thrilling fight against the warlord Morgan Elsbeth on Calodan.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-map-mission.jpg?itok=70oggOCw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-map-mission.jpg?itok=IWmXa5bM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This first mission really feels like a race against time, as each time you trigger the 6+ space you'll be advancing the power track - this increases the hit points on Morgan Elsbeth, who you'll need to flush out&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;saving three different prisoners. It's a tough one, right out the gate, and introduces enemies with new abilities.</p>

<p>Along with the four core missions, there are also two new mercenary missions included in this expansion - and it all goes together to form what seems to me to be an extremely strong expansion. It's more of what we loved about&nbsp;<em>The Mandalorian Adventures</em>, but the abilities on these four new heroes feel&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;different!</p>

<p>With an MSRP at $39.99, this feels like a perfect addition if you've played through and explored all that the original&nbsp;<em>Mandalorian Adventures</em>&nbsp;had to offer. Hitting shelves everywhere Friday, June 6th!</p>

And this week’s games are the aforementioned <em>Wonderlands</em> and <em>Limbo</em>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Just a heads-up that these games will only be free until June 5</a></span>. Meanwhile, the Epic Games Mega Sale event ends on June 12, so we’ll get two more freebies before the party wraps up. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/limbo-review-death-foreshadowed-5590872&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/limbo-review-death-foreshadowed-5590872">Released in 2010, <em>Limbo </em>is a fantastic</a></span>, bite-sized, black-and-white 2D platformer that made a big splash over a decade ago on Xbox Live Arcade. Since then, this creepy and minimalistic game has been ported to everything and is worth checking out, especially if you loved 2016's <em>Inside, </em>which was developed by the same folks. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-borderlands-spinoff-impressions-1848705496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-borderlands-spinoff-impressions-1848705496">Meanwhile, 2022's <em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</em></a></span> is probably the exact polar opposite of <em>Limbo</em>. <em>Wonderlands </em>is a fantasy-themed <em>Borderlands </em>spin-off featuring melee weapons, magic, and a big overworld map. It’s a strange game, but one which I’ve played through twice and enjoyed thoroughly. If you like <em>Borderlands </em>and haven’t played this looter shooter spin-off yet, now is a great time to hop in. And if you’re excited about <em>Borderlands 4,</em> launching in September, <em>Wonderlands</em> will keep you busy until then. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/disney-lorcana-fabled-preview-features-elsa-gift-box<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ravensburger has released new information on the upcoming <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Disney Lorcana</a> Fabled</em> set. The latest set of the trading card game based on iconic Disney characters will be getting a new format, new products, and a gift box featuring the ice queen, Elsa.</p>



<p>As part of their Weekly Lorecast on their official Twitch channel, Ravensburger showcased their <em>Disney Lorcana Fabled</em> preview. The preview centered on official products and accessories alongside the full <em>Fabled</em>&nbsp;lineup of booster packs, Illumineer's Troves, and starter decks.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-fabled-starter-deck-artwork.jpg?itok=jHy3WL1o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-fabled-starter-deck-artwork.jpg?itok=VFwLfCB1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those who want to get into <em>Disney Lorcana</em>, the two starter decks are a decent entry point.The first is an Emerald and Ruby deck sporting Max, Goofy, and Powerline from <em>A Goofy Movie</em>. The other deck, showcasing Ariel and Mulan, is an Amber and Sapphire deck. Both will be sold at an MSRP of $16.99 each.</p>

<p>The new products and accessories will portray other characters featured in the set. Those accessories are a pair of <em>Goofy Movie</em> and <em>Mulan</em>-themed card sleeve packs and deck cases. The card sleeves will be sold at an MSRP of $9.99, and the deck boxes will be sold at an MSRP of $5.99.</p>

<p>In addition, two playmats will be available. One spotlights Cinderella as she gets her gorgeous dress from her fairy godmother. The other showcases Mufasa, King of Pride Rock. Both playmats will be available at an MSRP of $19.99</p>

The box will contain five booster packs, an Elsa-themed storage box, three punch-out dividers, and a glimmer foil promo card of <em>Elsa - The Fifth Spirit</em>. This Elsa Gift Box will be available this October at an MSRP of $29.99.</p>

<p>Lastly, the <em>Disney Lorcana Fabled</em> preview has confirmed the launch of two new formats. The first, Super Sealed, is a variation on a sealed draft. You get four boosters from each of the most recent sets. From there, you must make a three-ink color deck of 50 cards in under 60 minutes.</p>

<p>You are allowed to change cards between matches, but must revert back to the initial deck after each round and before the start of a new match.</p>

<p>The second format is called Triple Deck Constructed Format (Single Elimination). As the name implies, players create three decks, each covering all six ink colors. Players then play best-of-three against one another. You can even use an ink token to "bench" one of your opponents decks. The Grand Finals are determined in a best-of-five.</p>

<p><em>Disney Lorcana Fabled</em> will have a pre-release on August 29. The set's full release will be September 5.</p>
