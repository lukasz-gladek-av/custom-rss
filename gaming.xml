<p>After cropping up back in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">September Direct</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</a> made another haunting appearance at last night's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/round-up-what-was-announced-in-sonys-state-of-play-livestream-for-november-2025">State of Play</a> showcase, and what do you know, it got a release date this time.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja have announced that the next spooky remake will arrive on Switch 2 on <strong>12th March 2026</strong>. Pre-orders open today on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series, though Koei Tecmo states that we Switch 2 fans will have to wait until "a later date" to bagsy our copies.</p>
<p>As the latest trailer showcases, the remake has seen a pretty substantial upgrade in the visual and sound departments, with Minakami Village and its wraiths packing an extra level of creepy detail. There are also some new features this time, including focus, zoom and filters for your Camera Obscura, and the ability to hold Mayu's hand for a much-needed health and spirit boost.</p>

<p>In terms of performance, the game's <a href="https://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/zero/crimson-re/uk/specs/">official website</a> states that the Switch 2 version will run at 1080p / 30fps, with no support for HDR. That said, there is the option to move the Camera Obscura with gyro aiming in handheld mode, so that's something.</p>
<p>The game will soon be available to pre-order in both its standard and 'Digital Deluxe' forms — the latter of which throws in a digital soundtrack, digital artbook and a handful of bonus costumes for Mio and Mayu.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/aion-2-launch-globally-second-half-2026-monetization-less-aggressive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aion-2-to-launch-globally-in-the-second-half-of-2026-monetization-to-be-less-aggressive-than-throne-and-liberty.1350880/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During its Q3 2025 quarterly report (as <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/11/11/ncsoft-q3-2025-guild-wars-2-delivers-solid-results-as-aion-2-sets-2h-2026-global-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by MassivelyOP</a>), NCSoft announced that Aion 2 will debut on the global stage in the second half of 2026. The MMORPG is set to launch in exactly a week from today in South Korea and Taiwan for PC and mobile devices.</p>



<p>Aion 2 is a direct sequel to the 2009 classic MMORPG. It's set roughly 200 years after the events seen in that game. Its massive game world is estimated to be around 1,200 square kilometers and features distinct biomes like dusty frontier towns, icy peaks, flowing rivers, and hidden labs. Just like in the original, flight mechanics are included both for exploration and aerial combat. Players can also look forward to eight classes, more than 200 dungeons (between the solo and group ones), various PvP modes (large-scale faction warfare between the Elyos and Asmodian, but also 1v1, 4v4, 8v8 arenas), and other systems like housing. In the investors' call, NCSoft promised that Aion 2 would feature less aggressive monetization compared to Throne and Liberty, which in turn should 'secure a bigger userbase'. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/aion-2-to-launch-globally-2026-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> a couple of weeks ago, the game, powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5, will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>



<p>2026 is poised to be a significant year for NCSoft, with the launch of Aion 2 and other key titles, including Cinder City, Limit Zero Breakers, and Time Takers. We covered Cinder City from Gamescom 2025; it's an intriguing open world third-person shooter with MMO-like elements coming in 2026 to PC and consoles. Check out our exclusive interview with the development team <a href="https://wccftech.com/cinder-city-preview-qa-open-world-shooter-mmo-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>Limit Zero Breakers, developed by VIC GAME STUDIOS, is a free-to-play anime-style cooperative action RPG due in 2026 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3764400/LIMIT_ZERO_BREAKERS/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>) and mobile. In the game, a team of adventurers known as 'Breakers' explores a fragmented, corrupted world from atop a powerful airship, searching for the mythical 'Library of the Gods'. During battle, players unleash stylish attacks and combinations against enormous creatures lurking in ancient dungeons, striving to restore peace to the continent of Seraphia.</p>



<p>As for Time Takers, it's a third-person team-based shooter for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596040/Time_Takers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>) and consoles that features Time Energy as a unique resource that players can spend on reviving teammates or upgrading skills, for example. </p>



<p>Arguably, though, the most exciting game in NCSoft's whole upcoming lineup could be the one set to be announced tomorrow at G-Star 2025. According to rumors, it might be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-game-reportedly-in-the-works-supposedly-made-by-sony-and-ncsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon </a>MMO we first heard about three years ago. Earlier this year, another rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> it had been canceled, but that might have been incorrect. We'll know for sure in a few hours.</p>

            <p>Yep, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> developers FromSoftware are definitely planning to release some DLC for the action RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlcs-planned-to-drop-by-march-next-year-fromsoftwares-big-corporate-bosses-reveal">by March 2026</a>.

<p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launches-dec-4-on-ps5-ps4/">PlayStation blog</a> about the DLC speaks of the "Great Hollow", a big hole that's opened up in the depths of Limveld, shifting the earth. It's filled with ancient ruins, life-sapping crystals, and also lots of things that want to take your lunch money.</p>
<p>Venturing forth as your tried and tested Nightfarer or one of the two new ones added by the DLC, you'll come face to face with bosses like Shadow of the Erdtree's Dancing Lion and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>' abyss-battling knight Artorias. Don't worry, I'm sure they won't be too tough, especially if you accept those fresh shoes and take them on as the Scholar, a nerdy Nightfarer with big book smarts, or the Undertaker, an abbess with lots of strength, faith, and presumably the ability to immediately reassure anyone she says "my condolences" to.</p><p>As for how it'll all fit in lore-wise, FromSoft had the following to say: "In our war against the Night, every battle left a scar. These wounds were given will. A foul life, born of cast-away souls. Steel your resolve, Nightfarers. This hunt must be seen to its end." There's <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1988380951978861023">also chatter</a> about someone called "the Dreglord" and how they must be sliced, spelled or smacked out of existence in this tale of post-night battling. Odds are they're the weird thing which roars near the end of the trailer, with the studio being quite coy about both them and the gang of angelic fighters pictured in the new threats section of the PS blog.</p>
<p>I'm sure if you waltz over to your old buddy Artorias on December 4th, he'll be happy to give you the rundown.</p>

            <p>Former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/reggie-fils-aime">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a> is "surprised" that Xbox has "not yet fully embraced" the newly released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, as part of a discussion on third-party support.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">The Game Business</a>, Fils-Aimé stated Nintendo will "never position itself as a direct competitor to PlayStation", though the company would "welcome some of the latest core gamer-type of content". Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-talks-switch-2-support-says-nintendo-a-great-partner">Phil Spencer, meanwhile, called Nintendo a "great partner"</a> and confirmed support for the Switch 2, though little has been announced so far.</p>
<p>"I'm surprised that Xbox has not yet fully embraced Switch 2 from a software perspective," said Fils-Aimé. "Certainly some games could easily be ported over to Switch 2. And I'm surprised that we haven't seen more of that. I thought there would be much more, especially during this timeframe leading into the Holiday.</p>

<p>"All through the fall, I was fully expecting some dedicated announcement. And I'm surprised it hasn't happened."</p>
<p>Fils-Aimé also noted that Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox are no longer directly competing, due to their differing approaches this generation. While PlayStation focuses on premium products and exclusives, and Nintendo remains focused on its hybrid console series, Xbox is moving further into publishing.</p><p>"I do think that the years of direct competition are done," said Fils-Aimé. "With a large part of the Xbox business now being publishing, by definition, they're a big third-party publisher that also makes some hardware. From that standpoint, they are no longer directly competing with the PlayStation business. And in fact, they need support from Sony for Microsoft's software to reach the largest audience. And as I said earlier, I think it would be in their best interest to find ways for Xbox software, beyond Minecraft, to make its way onto the Nintendo platform. So, from that standpoint, direct warfare is over.</p>
<p>"But, on the other hand, gamers out there have limited budgets. You have to win for every dollar spent; you need to win for every minute spent playing. And so there's always going to be a war going on. It may be below the surface, but there's always going to be a battle for attention and mindshare."</p>
<p>Last year, Xbox games Pentiment and Grounded made their way to the Switch and were set to be followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, though that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-will-launch-on-nintendo-switch-2-report">reportedly shifted to Switch 2</a>. <a href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is officially coming to Switch 2 next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">Xbox announced its long-time exclusive Halo is headed to PS5</a>. Could Switch 2 also be on the cards?</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is gearing up for Season 5 and its first anniversary celebrations, but teases for the next two characters potentially being introduced in the game have surfaced—including Deadpool.</p>



<p>Season 5 is bringing X-Men duo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-trailer-officially-reveals-rogue-and-gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gambit and Rogue into the fray for Season 5</a>, with the former available from the season start on November 14, expanding the roster of characters available to 45, and there are no signs of stopping.</p>



<p>NetEase has regularly teased which characters are coming soon in in-game lore, which previously teased the additions of Angela and Daredevil in Season 4, and fresh teases that may have revealed the two characters coming in Season 6.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Deadly. Image via Marvel</figcaption></figure>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAssembled/status/1988511207569895885" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RivalsAssembled on X</a>, the Season 5 gallery card drops a major hint that Deadpool and Elsa Bloodstone are lined up as the next two characters to join the game.</p>



<p>On the gallery card, it teases “Earth-born operatives” that have been “working behind the scenes,” describing the pair as including a “blathering, foul-mouthed mercenary and a monster hunter as deadly as she is beautiful.”</p>



<p>The brief descriptions certainly fit Deadpool, widely known as the Merc with a Mouth, and, while Elsa Bloodstone isn’t as much of a mainstream name as Wade Wilson, the description accurately highlights her.</p>







<p>Of course, nothing is guaranteed at this stage, but Marvel Rivals developers have always been very clever with their placement of easter eggs in the game, following them up with full reveals later down the line.</p>



<p>The pair aren’t the only teases from Season 5, however, as the reveal trailer included a shot of Cyclops attending the wedding of Rogue and Gambit, while Professor X’s voice played over part of the video.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is rapidly approaching its first anniversary, and NetEase has revealed that all players will receive 2500 Units later this month to celebrate.</p>



<p>The PvP hero shooter has come on leaps and bounds in the past year, with regular seasonal transitions introducing new characters, maps, and game modes, and Season 5 is making some major changes.</p>

<p>Season 5 in Marvel Rivals also has plenty of other big additions to the game, including a new social hub that can fit up to 100 players, the long-awaited introduction of cross-progression in the game, and placement matches being added to Ranked—something that the community has been crying out for.</p>







<p>Season 5 kicks off on Friday, November 14 and will last until January 2026, with a mid-season break to introduce Season 5.5 that brings Rogue to the game as the latest playable character.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/27-inch-playstation-gaming-monitor-announced-will-launch-next-year/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/27%E2%80%B3-playstation-gaming-monitor-announced-will-launch-next-year-in-the-us-and-japan.1350850/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During the State of Play Japan broadcast that aired a few hours ago, Sony announced a 27-inch PlayStation Gaming Monitor that will launch next year in the United States and Japan. No pricing has been revealed yet, but we do know its specifications:</p>



<ul>
<li>Quad High Definition (QHD) IPS display with a resolution of up to 2560 x 1440, allowing players to game at a comfortable viewing distance from their desk.</li>



<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR) support with Auto HDR Tone Mapping, which automatically adjusts HDR settings during setup on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, ensuring a rich and vivid picture quality.</li>



<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support and refresh rates of up to 120 Hz for smooth and seamless gameplay on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, and 240 Hz on compatible PC and Mac devices.</li>



<li>Built-in Charging Hook for a DualSense or DualSense Edge wireless controller (sold separately), making it easy for players to get right into gaming.</li>
</ul>



<p>The PlayStation Gaming Monitor is equipped with two 2.1 HDMI IN ports and one 1.4 DisplayPort IN port for compatibility with PlayStation 5, PC, Mac, or other devices. The 2.1 HDMI IN ports support up to 2560×1440 resolution, 240Hz frame rate, Fixed Rate Link (FRL), and VRR; the 1.4 DisplayPort IN port supports up to 2560×1440 resolution, 240Hz frame rate, and Display Stream Compression (DSC).</p>



<p>You'll also find two USB Type-A and one USB Type-C port that can be used with PlayStation Link Adapters or other devices. The display is compatible with select VESA mounting systems to mount it on a wall, for instance. When it comes to audio, there's a built-in stereo speaker and 3.5mm audio output, but Sony recommends pairing it with the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-unveils-pulse-elvate-wireless-speakers-built-in-mic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pulse Elevate Wireless Speakers</a>. This set features planar magnetic drivers and a built-in microphone, and it's also due to launch in 2026.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Spec-wise, the PlayStation Gaming Monitor is undoubtedly a step down from <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-inzone-m10s-oled-m9-ii-gaming-monitors-launched-up-to-4k-480hz-with-dp-2-1-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony's Inzone M10S OLED and M9 II monitors</a> released last year. However, it's also likely to be significantly more affordable, although we'll have to wait for official pricing news to know exactly how much it will cost.</p>



<p>During the aforementioned State of Play, Sony also announced a new, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-launching-cheaper-japanese-language-only-digital-ps5-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheaper Japan-only version of the PlayStation 5</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Love Them or Hate Them, Extraction Shooters Are Running Wild Right Now]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/love-or-hate-extraction-shooters-wild/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/love-them-or-hate-them-extraction-shooters-are-running-wild-right-now.1350847/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The extraction genre is having a defining moment. From the gritty realism of Escape from Tarkov to the retro-futuristic chaos of ARC Raiders, gamers are flocking to these more challenging-than-most titles that fuse looting, survival, and high-stakes choice-and-consequence gameplay loops.</p>



<p>Even satirical titles like Escape from Duckov, packed with absurd mechanics and visuals, are finding solid audiences and millions of sales. But why? Because extraction shooters tap into something deeper than just gameplay: they simulate risk and tension in a way that no other genre can.</p>











<p>At their core, extraction shooters are typically built around loss aversion and delayed gratification concepts. Every raid is a gamble, every crate or box opened is like spinning a slot machine, and finishing up an intense, high-value run releases an immense burst of dopamine-fuelled satisfaction that’s almost unmatched in gaming.</p>



<p>Players entire deeply hostile zones in extraction shooters, and set about completing quests, gathering loot, and fighting enemies both human and AI-driven. The kicker is that they <strong>must </strong>extract to keep their loot, and a single misstep can lead to crumbling fortunes.</p>



<p>Every decision – engage or evade, loot or leave – is loaded with consequence and consideration. This mirrors real-world psychological triggers, and it gets those synapses firing.</p>



<ul>
<li>Loss Aversion, otherwise known in the extraction space as ‘Gear Fear’, gives you a sense of acute ownership over the loot you collect, and the thought of losing it again increases anxiety</li>



<li>Variable Rewards, which tie into the gambling mechanic, mean that you never know what you’ll find in a room or a box, which makes you want to keep opening more, especially when you get a rare item</li>



<li>Mastery and Progression, the mechanics of which encourage players to learn the best loot routes, methods, combat metas, and more, in a bid to become as wealthy or powerful as possible</li>
</ul>



<p>This sublime cocktail of tension, reward, and trepidation creates a psychological loop that’s more potent than traditional run-and-gun multiplayer shooters.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-arc-raiders-different">Why is ARC Raiders Different?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>ARC Raiders is changing the face of the genre</figcaption></figure>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is the number one extraction shooter on the market right now, and it has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-reveals-arc-raiders-player-count-steam-majority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieved millions of sales</a> and record-high scores for the genre. It’ll be challenged by Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release, set to drop on November 15, but for now, it’s doing just fine.</p>



<p>Embark Studios poured a little something special into the extraction shooter formula in ARC Raiders, and it has proven to be a huge success. In ARC Raiders, players are encouraged to lean on team synergy, social mechanics, and more intricate player guidance systems to enjoy a much more accessible entry point into the extraction shooter genre.</p>



<p>That mainstream appeal has brought fresh eyes into the genre, which has long been gatekept by its own intensity and inherently challenging aura.</p>



<p>The shift opens up the genre to players who might have bounced off Escape from Tarkov’s steep and unforgiving learning curve. It’s proof that extraction shooters don’t have to be exclusive to ‘talented’ gamers, and it also proves that you can get that dopamine hit and gambling-like gameplay loop in a game that some consider ‘easier’.</p>











<figure><figcaption>10 years later, Escape from Tarkov is being released</figcaption></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov is about to debut on Steam, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hitting a 1.0 state</a> after <strong>ten years </strong>in testing. It’s one of the biggest evolutions the game will have ever seen, and it’ll propel the title into a place of extreme popularity once again.</p>



<p>In the meantime, ARC Raiders will continue to soar, hold a solid community, and receive updates from Embark Studios that keep it fresh and engaging.</p>



<p>We can easily expect more extraction shooters to surface soon. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-extraction-shooter-dumb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie’s Marathon</a> is set to be released by March 2026, and there is every opportunity for top-tier titles like Call of Duty and Battlefield to dip back into the extraction market.</p>



<p>It might be that we see cross-genre blending become more prevalent. How about a horror-based extraction shooter or one with deeper RPG mechanics and progression paths?</p>



<p>There’s a lot of potential in this space, and love them or hate them, extraction shooters are here to stay.</p>

                <p>For the better part of three decades, Pokemon's creatures have been called upon by their human trainers to do battle with each other at their command.

Instead, the player can offer them the chance to live side-by-side in an environment that's been specifically tailored to their individual needs. There's no need to fight over anything, or even any need for a human to determine their destiny.

Instead of placing a human at the center of the gameplay, Pokopia introduces a Ditto that uses its natural transformation abilities to pass itself off as a human.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blast-r6-major-munich-playoffs-predictions/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blast-r6-major-munich-playoffs-bracket-is-set%E2%80%94let%E2%80%99s-talk-predictions.1350829/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Swiss Stage of the massive BLAST R6 Major in Munich has just wrapped, slicing out half the competing teams and leaving us with the final eight squads fighting for the lion’s share of the $750,000 prize pool. The winner also unlocks direct qualification to the Six Invitational, so there’s plenty on the line.</p>



<p>Leading the charge are M80 and Team Falcons, sitting in a prime position after earning byes by topping the board in the Swiss Stage. It’s a mixed bunch that’s left, but which team is most likely to walk away with the trophy at the BLAST R6 Major in Munich? Let’s take a look at the predictions.</p>







<h2 id="h-blast-r6-major-munich-predictions">BLAST R6 Major Munich Predictions</h2>



<p>The BLAST R6 Major Munich playoffs kick off in just a few hours, opening with a tense match between FaZe Clan and Wildcard. The grand final is set for November 16, and there’s a lot of ground to cover before then.</p>



<p>M80 and Team Falcons have proven to be something special thus far in the tournament. They’ve emerged with some aggressive map control and clean strats, pushing M80 especially into the limelight with an undefeated streak.</p>



<p>But will either team be able to secure the trophy this time around?</p>



<p>M80’s discipline might edge out any opponents coming forth, but FaZe Clan has a chance to make an upper bracket run after a tumultuous Swiss Stage. Some are hoping that Wildcard can make a break for the grand final, which, if it does, will make history as it’ll be the furthest an APAC team has got in years.</p>







<p>It’s a stellar run thus far for M80, relying on the old beastcoast squad that dominated the BLAST R6 Manchester Major in 2024 to lift the organization’s first trophy. Could the team pull off another huge win here in Germany?</p>

<p>Previous issues have been resolved</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Earlier this year, a few months after the Switch 2 launch, Nintendo identified an issue with the Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> on the new hybrid platform.</p>
<p>Now, according to Nintendo's new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-launches-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-search-page">Switch 2 compatibility search page</a>, the same title has received an update yesterday on <strong>11th November 2025</strong>. According to the note attached, previously identified issues have been fixed.</p>
<h3>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Compatibility</h3>
<p><strong>Supported - Game behaviour is consistent with Nintendo Switch</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Update 11/11/2025</em></li>
<li><em>Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The page doesn't share any specific information, but as previously reported there was an issue where the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-identifies-xenoblade-chronicles-x-voice-sync-bug-on-switch-2">voices were out of sync in some areas</a> of the title. With the game behaviour now "consistent", the Definitive Edition of Xenoblade Chronicles X should work just fine on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Since the new system's launch in June, Nintendo has also released an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>, which made several adjustments to improve the overall gameplay on the new platform. There's currently been no mention of upgrades for the Xenoblade games, but there were some reports earlier this year of a supposed "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1jfoucs/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition_games/">hidden 60fps mode</a>" for the Definitive Edition of X. If we hear anything, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<p>This compatibility update follows on from Nintendo's release of new firmware for the Switch 2 yesterday, bumping the system up to Version 21.0.0. You can find out more in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">our previous coverage here</a> on Nintendo Life.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-nexon-ceo-defends-ai-voices/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexon-ceo-defends-arc-raiders-ai-voices-and-says-%E2%80%98every-game-company%E2%80%99-is-doing-it.1350811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Unless you’ve been hiding away under a rock somewhere, you’ll likely have heard about the ongoing debate regarding ARC Raiders and Embark Studios’ use of AI to create dynamic voices in the game. It warranted one particular outlet to give the game a shockingly low score, prompting the game’s Metacritic rating to tank by a couple of points.</p>



<p>In a bid to defend the game, Nexon’s CEO Junghun Lee has taken to the airwaves to suggest that more developers are using AI than you realize. He directly suggested that ‘every game company’ is using AI in some capacity, and that the ‘AI voice debate’ in the ARC Raiders world is a non-starter.</p>







<h2 id="h-should-we-ignore-the-ai-generated-voices-in-arc-raiders">Should We Ignore The AI-Generated Voices in ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p>The presence of AI-generated voices in ARC Raiders is a point of contention for some, but for the majority, it’s not an issue. The game has managed to sell four million copies in a week and has peaked on some platforms with staggering concurrent player counts.</p>



<p>By numbers, <a href="https://loaded.pxf.io/4G1L4L" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-highest-rated-multiplayer-shooter/">highest-rated multiplayer shooter</a> in a decade, and the top-rated extraction shooter <strong>ever made</strong>.</p>



<p>But that hasn’t stopped some from lambasting the post-apocalyptic shooter on socials, striking it down for what seems to be a misunderstood use of generative AI. Embark Studios has been transparent and pointed out that voice actors provided their talents to be replicated by AI and were paid fairly for their work, but that’s not enough to placate some.</p>



<p>Junghun Lee, CEO of Nexon, the parent company of Embark Studios, explained <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in an interview</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>First of all, I think it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI. But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it’s important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness.</p>



<p>AI has definitely improved efficiency in both game production and live service operations.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Using AI allows Embark Studios to bring this game to the market and float it with updates that are delivered faster and more cost-effectively. The team also uses machine learning algorithms to encourage dynamic animations of the game’s ARC enemies, but it’s the AI voices that most people have issues with, as it walks a blurry line that many are reluctant to accept as becoming the de facto standard.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s anything to be concerned about regarding Embark Studios’ reliance on AI for voice lines? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to several gaming insiders, Ubisoft is currently working on a new multiplayer shooter. Furthermore, some concept art and even an in-progress screenshot of the game have been shown.</p>







<p>Ubisoft has had a fair share of shooters over the past 40 years. From the iconic Tom Clancy series to the wild Far Cry franchise, it’s served up quite a few good ones. Still, the company has only managed one success in the multiplayer FPS world: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege</a>. With many companies like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-marathon-fy25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation/Bungie</a> and EA getting in on the trend, a supposed leak teases that Ubisoft wants in. Now, we may know what that vision the team is shooting for may look like, and it’s literally out of this world.</p>



<h2 id="h-project-scout-an-fps-sci-fi-competitive-shooter-from-ubisoft-possibly-leaked">Project Scout, An FPS Sci-Fi Competitive Shooter from Ubisoft, Possibly Leaked</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Twitter/X leaker Shiny <a href="https://x.com/Shiiny77/status/1988305728784744488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted a message</a> surrounding a new multiplayer title from Ubisoft. The FPS, supposedly made in <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong>, takes place in <strong>a sci-fi world</strong>. It would include <strong>competitive multiplayer</strong>, including <strong>crossplay</strong>, and be on <strong>a larger scale</strong> than other titles. </p>



<p>Later on, user 6leaks furthered Shiny’s claim, <a href="https://x.com/6leaksgg/status/1988397275266334782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posting screenshots of the title</a>, known as <strong>Project Scout</strong>. The images, seen above, show what appears to be a loading screen with concept art and an in-game screenshot with developing assets and the game’s UI. We can also see one of the characters on the bottom left, as well as some interesting interface systems like a compass and ‘crew level’.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that <strong>Ubisoft has not confirmed Project Scout or any new multiplayer game</strong>, so <strong>take the news with a grain of salt</strong>. We have reached out to Ubisoft to confirm and will update if and when we get a response. Regardless, the concept does look pretty cool, and it’ll be interesting to see, if true, how the core gameplay will work. </p>







<p>What do you think of Ubisoft’s Project Scout? Do you think it’s real? Do you want it to be? Think it can make another multiplayer shooter and succeed? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>Get ready for an even bigger launch</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>During PlayStation's '<a href="https://youtu.be/DJp8K40TSxc?t=563">State of Play</a>' broadcast this week, Koei Tecmo and Omega Force issued a reminder about the "major DLC" on the way to the 1 vs. 1,000 musuo early next year.</p>
<p>The <strong>Visions of the Four Heroes</strong> will add new stories and weapons when it arrives on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong> for <strong>$34.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) and pre-orders are now live on select platforms. This date lines up with the base game's launch on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Here's some additional details, and you can check out the latest overview trailer above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Visions of Four Heroes features brand-new stories centered around four heroes whose stories were not explored in <em>DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS:</em> Zhang Jiao, Dong Zhuo, Yuan Shao and Lu Bu. These stories are explored as “What If” scenarios and will allow players to discover new sides to these legendary heroes. New companions are also featured in the major DLC including Zhuhe, a Guardian of Peace; Diaochan, a beautiful warrior and a familiar fan favorite; and a mysterious new officer who will be revealed as the story unfolds.</p>
<p>"Fans will also be able to enjoy new weapons – the “Bow” and “Rope Dart” – to further enhance the exhilarating action of 1 vs. 1,000 warfare by leveraging each weapon’s unique characteristics on the battlefield. Existing weapons will also receive an update, granting new arts, skill panels, as well as an increase in the trait level cap. Finally, a new “Training Ground” mode will be included, where players battle formidable foes while practicing their skills."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you pre-order the DLC, for a "limited time" you will also receive an exclusive outfit for the protagonist (the "Yellow Turban Attire"). Below is some more information about this. There'll also be an early purchase bonus and a digital pre-order bonus for Switch 2 players.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Alongside a new story trailer today, Square Enix has released an eShop demo for its upcoming Switch and Switch 2 release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>.</p>
<p>This demo will allow you to experience the opening of the new game, including the first chapter of three different story arcs from the "Retribution story, as well as the first chapter of the "Restoration story" (or up to three hours of gameplay).</p>
<p>Save data will also carry across to the full release when it arrives next month on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3f24bc2675cee"><a title="Octopath Traveler 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3f24bc2675cee/octopath-traveler-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's some extra information about what you can expect in the demo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first thing you’ll do is design your protagonist, and play through the explosive introduction to the game. You’ll discover how a joyful town festival turns to tragedy, and how your hero embarks on a journey of restoration and revenge.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>You’ll set off after three antagonists, known as the Masters. Each of them has their own ‘Master of’ arc, and in the demo, you can play through the first chapter of each of them in any order you please.</p>
<p>You can also play up to the end of the first chapter of the ‘Kindlers of the Flame’ story arc, which focuses on the restoration of Wishvale and the town-building features of the game. It’s a great way to lay some strong foundations before you build the town of your dreams in the full game!</p>
<p>You can play through all this content for up to three hours. After that, the demo ends.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-50-inch-4k-fire-tv-suddenly-drops-40-off-amazon-clears-stock-for-pocket-change.1350715/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The 50-inch size hits the sweet spot for most living rooms and bedrooms, large enough for an immersive viewing experience without overwhelming your space. This <strong>Insignia F50 Series 4K Fire TV</strong> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/">just dropped to an all-time low of $179 on Amazon, down from its regular $299 price</a>. For this price, you’ll get a smart TV equipped with Ultra HD resolution, HDR10 support and built-in Fire TV streaming without the premium pricing that Samsung or LG demand for similar specs.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>4K Resolution That Makes a Difference</h2>
<p>The 3840×2160 resolution supplies <strong>four times the pixel density of standard 1080p displays</strong>&nbsp;which becomes evident when watching nature documentaries or sports where fine details make all the difference. Textures in clothes are finer, individual blades of grass on football fields are more distinguishable, and facial features during close-ups are sharper. The <strong>upscaling engine</strong> takes your existing HD content from cable boxes or Blu-ray players and upscales it to near-4K quality, filling in missing information via intelligent processing. This means that even older shows and movies look better than they did on your previous TV.</p>
<p><strong>HDR10 opens up a wider color gamut</strong> than what standard dynamic range displays can show, and displays subtle gradations in bright skies and shadow details that might otherwise disappear to black. Sunsets contain more layers of orange and red rather than a flat blob of color, and dark movie scenes reveal details in shadows without washing out the overall image. This wider color gamut makes animated films pop with vibrant hues while live-action content receives a more realistic appearance that feels closer to what your eyes see in real life.</p>



<p>The <strong>Fire TV interface puts streaming apps front and center</strong> and removes the need for external streaming sticks or boxes that clutter your entertainment center. Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max load directly from the home screen, and the system remembers where you left off across different services. Voice control through the included Alexa remote lets you search for content by speaking actor names, movie titles, or even vague descriptions.</p>



<p>DTS Virtual-X processing does give simulated surround sound from the TV’s built-in speakers, and furthers dialogue clarity and adding spatial depth to action sequences. It analyzes the audio signal and adjusts the output of the speakers to create an impression of height and width that goes beyond the physical speaker placements. Of course, it is not a replacement for a dedicated sound system, but it considerably enhances the viewing experience compared to the thin, tinny audio that plagues budget TVs.</p>
<p>HDMI eARC support transmits full-resolution audio from streaming apps or connected devices to compatible soundbars and receivers without compression. This type of connection is used to handle more advanced audio formats like Dolby Atmos and DTS:X which need higher bandwidth than the standard HDMI ARC allows. You can attach a soundbar later with no concerns about limitations of audio quality and the automatic switching of the audio output when connecting compatible equipment occurs seamlessly.</p>
<p>The <strong>refresh rate of 60Hz handles standard TV content and movies smoothly,</strong> and refreshed the image 60 times per second so that motion blur does not occur when the camera pans or there is fast action on screen. Smart home integration allows Ring doorbell feeds, Philips Hue lights, or Nest thermostats to be accessed through the TV interface using voice commands. Content from iPhones and iPads can directly mirror onto the screen via Apple AirPlay, without the use of additional casting devices.</p>
<p>But this Insignia TV delivers on most people’s actual usage at a price point of just $179 for a 50-inch 4K display with streaming built in, rather than requiring months of budgeting.</p>

It’s also designed for use with both the PlayStation 5 (PS5) and PC.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-are-the-gaming-monitor-s-features">What Are The Gaming Monitor’s Features?</h2>



<p>The PlayStation gaming monitor—not to be confused with Sony’s INZONE brand—comes in at 27″ with a Quad High Definition (QHD) IPS display at a max 2K (2560 x 1440p) resolution. It also includes High Dynamic Range (HDR) support with Auto HDR Tone Mapping. For refresh rates, the monitor supports up to 240 Hz on PC and 120 Hz on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles as well as Variable Refresh Rates (VRR). </p>



<p>One of the more unique features is the built-in charging hook for DualSense and DualSense Edge controllers.</p>







<p>Input wise, it has two HDMI 2.1 inputs and one DisplayPort 1.4 input. There are also two USB-A ports and one USB-C port. Lastly, the monitor has a built-in speaker and 3.5mm audio output while also being VESA compatible for mounting. </p>



<p>The PlayStation gaming monitor will launch sometime in 2026 though no sepecific date or price was confirmed. What was announced, however, was that it will only be available in the United States and Japan.</p>



<p>Are you going to pick up the PlayStation gaming monitor whenever it releases? </p>
