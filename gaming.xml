            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-game-pass-capcom-1851606852<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The world of <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is meant to feel fantastical and from another time, but the game itself also feels like an anachronism. Something that shouldn’t exist in 2024. It’s not a sequel in a hit franchise. It’s not working in a popular genre. And it’s not pandering to an international audience. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-review-game-pass-1851600358&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-review-game-pass-1851600358">It’s just an excellent game</a></span>, and it shows what’s possible when big publishers take a chance on something completely different.</p><p>“We believe it is important to respond to the expectations of our users with new titles in [existing] series and remakes, but we also believe it is equally important to take on the challenge of creating something new,” the game’s producer, Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, a more than 20-year veteran of Capcom, told <em>Kotaku</em> in a recent email interview<em>. “</em>As a completely new title, we are taking on a number of challenges.”</p><p><em>Path of the Goddess</em> has you play as the sword-dancing warrior Soh, who must rally villagers and protect the Maiden Yoshiro on a treacherous journey to purge evil from a mountain. But instead of a straightforward third-person action game that has you exploring levels and slicing through hordes of demons,<em> Path of the Goddess </em>is structured like a tower defense game where, in addition to killing enemies yourself in fluid arcade combat, you can also conscript villagers into unique classes and order them around the battlefield.</p><p>One key was to make sure that neither side overshadowed the other and each was viable in its own way. “We did not want to force players to have to use both elements equally, so we spent a lot of time adjusting the balance between action and strategy,” Kawata said. “Therefore, players could enjoy more [either one], depending on their equipment and assigned villager roles.” It’s an unlikely mashup that works surprisingly well and doesn’t sacrifice quality to realize its experimental creative vision. It’s also presented in a context that’s unabashedly Japanese.<br></p><p>“I am a fan of old Japanese folklore and other bizarre folktales, and I thought it would be interesting to incorporate them into a game set in the mountains of Japan, where a messenger from the other world appears every night and you must fend them off and protect the gods,” said the game’s director, Shuichi Kawata, also a long-time Capcom employee. “A major part of this idea was that I thought it would be compatible with tower defense. I think we were able to make every aspect of the game cohesive by incorporating player actions and the relationship between the enemies with Japanese culture.”<br></p><p><em>Path of the Goddess</em> features dozens of intricate and evocative enemy designs for the evil spirits you face, called The Seethe. Some have heads shaped like massive mouths with tongues jutting out of them. Others look like pearly white tumors floating through the air with dangerous hooks hanging off the bottom of them. In one stage you face a massive corrupted tree whose roots come alive and attack you like a giant mutant earthworm. Their variety and level of detail is one of the key ways the game punches above its weight.</p><p>But the other main thing that helps <em>Path of the Goddess</em> stand out is just how bespoke and carefully considered every small detail of the game feels. “Mixing multiple game elements will always increase the complexity of the game, but it is important to choose carefully what is and isn’t necessary for the game,” said Kawata. “In order to prevent the game from becoming a ‘grinding’ game, I think it is important to allow the users to think about what to do based on the given game materials, and the result should lead to a sense of accomplishment.”</p><p>The UI is carefully integrated with the rest of the game’s look and feel. To access the main menu, you have to go into a village and visit Yoshiro’s tent where a table in front of her collects the various ornaments, artifacts, and other objects you’ve gathered throughout your journey that double as the game’s power-ups, status-enhancing relics, and other unlockable upgrades. You increase the level of your villagers’ roles by decorating their masks, and the save screen is a long horizontal piece of folded paper that you stamp with each new file. One of the game’s collectibles, an array of desserts, sit in a nearby box for you to examine at your leisure.<br></p><p>There are over 20 stages in <em>Path of the Goddess</em>, and each one has two phases to it. The result is three to five enemy waves per stage with generous checkpointing. While no gameplay ideas were discarded during its development, testing revealed that most of the stages originally felt too long and drawn out, so they ended up making them shorter. “Many people commented that this part of the game was tiring and made the play time longer, so we decided to shorten it and increase the tempo of the game progression.”</p><p>The game feels stripped down to its essentials, preserving only what’s elegant, polished, and meaningful to the overall experience. Where other games devolve into ticking boxes on a marketing strategy, <em>Path of the Goddess</em> feels bereft of bloat. It’s the opposite of the open-world RPG with skill trees, gear scores, and random loot that pads itself out with extra hours of content just to hit a certain number on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howlongtobeat.com/game/83146&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/83146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Long To Beat</a></span>.</p><p>“I think that the sandbox in a playground is similar to this situation, and used that concept to explain it to my team,” Kawata said. “The scope is fixed and the use of sand is fixed, but you are free to use the sand to your liking.” This is part of why I think people keep referring to it as a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24201259/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-game-pass-impressions&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/24201259/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-game-pass-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS2 cult-classic</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Papapishu/status/1816547398816268365&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Papapishu/status/1816547398816268365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">or lost PS3 game</a></span>. It feels made for an era where a good idea, cool look, and fun gameplay were enough, if not to sell millions of copies, than at least to convince a well-known publisher to take a chance on something new.</p><p>Before pitching <em>Path of the Goddess</em>, Kawata directed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2020/03/capcoms-wonderful-underwater-2d-action-adventure-shinsekai-into-the-depths-was-just-surprise-relea/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2020/03/capcoms-wonderful-underwater-2d-action-adventure-shinsekai-into-the-depths-was-just-surprise-relea/"><em>Shinsekai: Into the Depths</em></a></span>, an underwater action puzzle game on Apple Arcade that was later ported to Switch. Much of that team was carried over to <em>Path of the Goddess</em>, but developers from other bigger-budget Capcom franchises like <em>Resident Evil</em> joined as well, bringing additional know-how and experience with the RE Engine that’s become increasingly standard across all of Capcom’s portfolio (<em>Monster Hunter </em>is also moving to it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-preview-release-date-1851535133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-preview-release-date-1851535133">with <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a></span>). Still, Hirabayashi said the team remained “relatively compact for the size of the production volume.”</p><p>Unlike a lot of those games, however, <em>Path of the Goddess</em> is priced at $50, just below the premium next-gen price tag of things like <em>Street Fighter 6</em> and <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>, but just above cheaper Steam games like <em>Helldivers 2</em>, whose $40 price many regard as a key component of its runaway sales success. I asked what goes into making that call, which anecdotally some PC players feel is still too high.<br></p><p>“As a completely new title, we have taken on a number of challenges, such as a ‘unique Japanese-inspired setting’ and a ‘new gaming experience’ that combines action and tower defense,” Hirabayashi said. “We have decided to set the price as affordable as possible to allow as many people to get their hands on this game.” He stressed that the size of the game is comparable to a full-price game, but you can see Capcom hedging in the fact that <em>Path of the Goddess </em>is also “free” for paid Game Pass members on Xbox and PC. When I asked previously at Summer Game Fest how that deal came about, Hirabayashi said the goal was to try to get the game in front of as many people as possible, given it was an unknown IP in an unusual genre.<br></p><p>I hope it works. We’ve seen that a bold vision that delivers and a cult of enthusiasm from fans isn’t always enough to guarantee a sequel or a chance to continue building on the work that came before. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-review-tango-gameworks-shutdown-xbox-1851473875&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-review-tango-gameworks-shutdown-xbox-1851473875">That’s now the sad story of <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a></span>, the 2023 GOTY contender from Tango Gameworks. That studio was founded by <em>Resident Evil</em> director Shinji Mikami (Kawata and Hirabayashi were on the cinematics team for <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, the last one Mikami directed), who left a year before Microsoft announced it was shutting down Tango Gameworks.</p><p>As exploding development costs push publishers to retreat into proven sellers and popular licenses, there’s a real fear the top end of the gaming industry could calcify even more than it already has in recent years through remakes, sequels, and live-service lottery machines. When I asked if we might see more experiments like <em>Path of the Goddess</em> from Capcom, Hirabayashi said he couldn’t comment on the larger company’s policy. “However,” he added, “as an individual, I am very grateful that there were so many people within the company who agreed with me to deliver this title to the users.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The DLC will not only see an artistic update to its ensemble cast and weapons, but it will also let players design their characters using the Steam workshop. Paint Boss Paradise will also introduce a new playable character named Paint Junior, whom the devs describe as someone who can “vanquish enemies with the very power of their imagination.” Seeing as how the live stream is titled “The Behemoth Roadmap,” Painter Boss Paradise’s announcement wasn’t couched with a release date, though The Behemoth says it will divulge those details at a later date. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We used to be enemies.

In tandem with its yet-to-be-revealed release date tease for Painter Boss Paradise, The Behemoth also listed a slew of updates for its other previous release games: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Battleblock Theater is getting a quality-of-life update addressing visuals, frame rates, and bug fixes on Steam as well as a console port for Xbox Series X/S.</li><li>Pit People is also receiving a quality-of-life update</li><li>Alien Hominid HD and Alien Hominid Invasion are coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</li></ul><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While working on updates for our entire gaming library, we’re also prototyping for our next game!

Little is known whether or not the upcoming game will be the long-awaited Castle Crasher 2 or if it will be a brand new game entirely. All the same, The Behemoth fans have a lot of gaming to look forward to in the coming days. </p><p>In our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/08/27/castle-crashers-review-2"><u>9/10 review of Castle Crashers</u></a>, we wrote, “Castle Crashers takes the best elements of traditional side-scrolling beat-em-ups and adds lots of flair.

<p>SAG-AFTRA has called for a strike of all its members working in video games, with the union demanding that its next contract not allow "companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike">The strike</a> mirrors similar actions taken by SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) last year, which, while also broader in scope than just AI, were similarly focused on concerns about AI-generated work product and the use of member work to train AI.
</p><p>"Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year—that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that,” Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, chief negotiator for SAG-AFTRA, said in a statement.</p>
<p>During the strike, the more than 160,000 members of the union will not provide talent to games produced by Disney, Electronic Arts, Blizzard Activision, Take-Two, WB Games, and others. Not every game is affected. Some productions may have interim agreements with union workers, and others, like continually updated games that launched before the current negotiations starting September 2023, may be exempt.</p>
<p>The publishers and other companies issued statements to the media through a communications firm representing them. "We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations," a statement <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/business/hollywood-actors-strike-video-game-companies.html">offered to The New York Times</a> and other outlets read. The statement said the two sides had found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals and that the game companies' offer was responsive and "extends meaningful AI protections."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The Washington Post says <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/25/artificial-intelligence-sagaftra-ai-video-games/d01249ae-4abc-11ef-9149-c75da5dd9201_story.html">the biggest remaining issue</a> involves on-camera performers, including motion capture performers. Crabtree-Ireland told the Post that while AI training protections were extended to voice performers, motion and stunt work was left out. "[A]ll of those performers deserve to have their right to have informed consent and fair compensation for the use of their image, their likeness or voice, their performance. It’s that simple," Crabtree-Ireland said in June.</p>
<p>It will be difficult to know the impact of a game performer strike for some time, if ever, owing to the non-linear and secretive nature of game production. A game's conception, development, casting, acting, announcement, and further development (and development pivots) happen on whatever timeline they happen upon.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA has <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/videogamestrike#production_search_result">a tool for searching game titles</a> to see if they are struck for union work, but it is finicky, recognizing only specific production titles, code names, and ID numbers. Searches for <em>Grande Theft Auto VI </em>and <em>6</em> returned a "Game Over!" (i.e., struck), but <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082">Kotaku confirmed</a> the game is technically unaffected, even though its parent publisher, Take-Two, is generally struck.</p>
<p>Video game performers in SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/its-official-unionized-video-game-voice-actors-are-on-strike/">last went on strike in 2016</a>, that time regarding long-term royalties. The strike lasted 340 days, still the longest in that union's history, and was settled with pay raises for actors while residuals and terms on vocal stress remained unaddressed. The impact of that strike was generally either hidden or largely blunted, as affected titles hired non-union replacements. Voice work, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/video-game-voice-actors-struggles-extend-well-past-bayonetta-3-drama/2/">noted by the original English voice for <em>Bayonetta</em></a>, remains a largely unprotected field.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As of today, video game performers and voice actors are <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially on strike</a> over disagreements about AI that 18 months of negotiations couldn’t solve. Where, exactly, are companies and the union at odds, though? SAG-AFTRA chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez told Aftermath that the core problem comes down to protections being extended to voice actors, but not physical performers.&nbsp;</p><p>"Until a couple of days ago, the employers were adamant that AI protections would only extend to voice, not to on-camera coverage," said Rodriguez. "So anybody doing a stunt or creature performance, all those folks would have been left unprotected under the employers' offer. At the 11th hour, when we were about to go on strike, they gave us new language that does make a reference to on-camera performers."</p><p>Unfortunately, according to Rodriguez, that new language came with asterisks that, in SAG-AFTRA’s eyes, made it untenable.&nbsp;</p><p>"The protections only extend to on-camera performers and to voice performers under their offer if the performer is identifiable in the output of the AI digital replica,” he said. “But the truth is, in video games, it's not going to be identifiable, as you could be doing the stunts that form the movement for Spider-Man, but what the player is going to see is Spider-Man. So that requirement of identifiability really leaves movement performers out of the scope of coverage."&nbsp;</p><p>Similar – and similarly disqualifying – requirements reared their head elsewhere, as well.</p><p>"There is a requirement of a one-to-one relationship between the performer and the resulting character that you see in the game, and that's not how games are usually made,” Rodriguez said. “There's usually more than one person whose work will be integrated into the character. So again, when you compare that to the reality of this work, they're really not covered."</p><p>He added that there was another stipulation concerning AI systems trained on “the whole internet” – in other words, not meant to resemble any specific person – where protections once again only covered voice actors, not physical performers.</p><p>“We're not going to leave half our members behind and make a deal only on behalf of voice performers,” said Rodriguez.&nbsp;</p><p>Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson representing EA, Take-Two, Activision, Insomniac, and <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other companies with which SAG-AFTRA has been bargaining</a>, told Aftermath that the proposed agreement is in line with those of other major industries.</p><p>“I would reiterate that we have proposed terms that provide consent and fair compensation for anyone employed under [SAG-AFTRA’s Interactive Media Agreement], if an AI reproduction or digital replica of their performance is used in games,” Cooling said. “Our proposal clearly extends AI protections to all performers working under the IMA; it ensures companies will get consent before using a digital replica of their performance in games and also ensures fair compensation for the use of that performance. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.”</p><p>Other industries’ agreements, however, tend to cover 1:1 performances, which are standard in Hollywood but not necessarily the default in video games. Thus, the current impasse.</p><p>That said, the terms of the strike are not as rigidly defined as they might initially seem. Companies can sign <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/video-game-strike-interim-agreements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interim agreements</a> to continue working with SAG-AFTRA talent, which is all well and good as far as Rodriguez is concerned. However, there are also agreements in place that render any game that was in development before September 2023 exempt from the strike – including, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku recently reported</a>, <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're obviously not happy about that," Rodriguez said. "That language was bargained into one of the legacy Interactive Media Agreements before merger [of SAG and AFTRA]. It's language that the merged union basically inherited, that I think is insane. But it’s there.”</p><p>Rogriguez went on to say that video game performers are typically hired as day players, meaning that their contractual agreement only lasts for a day. After that, performers are free to do as they please. This, he hopes, will include opting out of further work on exempt games made by struck companies.</p><p>“We're hopeful that performers, in solidarity with their fellow members – and recognizing that showing solidarity is going to shorten this strike and help us gain critical protections – will exercise their discretion, even with respect to some of those non-struck titles," he said.</p><p>Some exempt games, Rodriguez added, may not stay that way.</p><p>“We do believe that there are certain titles that we can challenge, and we are preparing ourselves to bring a challenge with respect to the application of this language with respect to some of the titles,” he said. “So we are doing our best to wage the strike as effectively [and] as strongly as we can – even in spite of that language being there."</p><p>Live-service games like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Apex Legends</em> are also currently exempt under this provision, as they’ve been in development for many years. But if the strike lasts 60 days or more, it’s a whole different ball game.&nbsp;</p><p>"If you apply this [language] that we're talking about to live-service games, they become contracts of unlimited duration, and there is a law that a contract of unlimited duration can be terminated on reasonable notice,” said Rodriguez. “So that's what we've done: We have provided reasonable notice that we are terminating our contract with respect to those live-service games."</p><p>SAG-AFTRA is pulling every ripcord it can because its leaders believe that AI represents a potentially existential threat to performers’ careers. The previous video game performer strike in 2016 and 2017 set the stage, but Rodriguez sees this one as the main event.</p><p>"This is an even more dangerous threat to performers [than what we struck over in 2016 and 2017],” he said. “Not achieving AI protections risks [performers] putting themselves out of work, maybe permanently. It is a career-derailing development if your unique qualities as a performer – what you do, your skill set – can in effect be expropriated from you by a computer, and employers then have the right to generate what would have been your performance without your consent, without paying you, in perpetuity. ... That is potentially a very dim career prospect."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earth Defense Force 6 launched this week for PC, PS4, and PS5, and the Steam version has faced criticism for requiring an Epic Games Store login for online play. But a change to this controversial requirement is already being explored by the game's developer."</p><p>The announcement seemingly came out of nowhere, as the Epic requirement wasn't communicated to players until launch day when the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2291060/view/4361257526914035378" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed it</a> in a Steam post. Of course, players weren't thrilled about this, and the review status of the game was "mostly negative" upon launch, as <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/cult-classic-shooter-series-returns-to-steam-after-5-years-and-immediately-takes-a-piledriver-into-the-review-dumpster-over-epic-games-account-requirement/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamesradar reports</a>.</p><p>Developer Sandlot <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2291060/view/4361257526917398046?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to the backlash</a> with a new post on Steam, saying, "The EDF 6 development team for Steam is reviewing and planning changes to the specification that requires sign-in to Epic Games account, which has received the most feedback."</p><p>The studio didn't provide a timeline or what it would change, but the team is now working on a solution. As of right now, Earth Defense Force 6's review status is sitting at a slightly better "mixed" on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2291060/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_6/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The Epic requirement for a game on Steam is unusual, but not unprecedented. Another game, Bigfoot, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/509980/discussions/0/3812910932501573788/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously required an Epic account</a> on Steam before later removing it. </p><p>Earth Defense Force 6 is the latest entry in the series that lets players kill giant alien bugs and creatures bent on destroying the planet. The game has been compared to Helldivers and Starship Troopers: Extermination. Coincidentally, Helldivers 2 faced similar criticisms earlier this year due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-be-forced-to-link-a-psn-account-sarting-this-month/1100-6523147/" data-ref-id="1100-6523147">Sony implementing mandatory PSN account</a> logins after launch, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">walked back the requirement following a backlash</a>.</p>

            <p>Paradox Interactive appear from the outside to be a company run by dice roll. That was the case earlier this year when they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-shutter-studio-tectonic-and-cancel-troubled-sims-competitor-life-by-you">cancelled Sims competitor Life By You and closed its developers</a>, weeks after it had missed a project release date.
</p>
<p>"It is clear that we have made the wrong calls in several projects, especially outside of our core, and this must change," writes CEO Fredrik Wester in an interim financial report, released today.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We end the second quarter of the year with mixed feelings. On the one hand, our core business has performed very well, but on the other hand, we made the difficult decision to cancel the release of Life by You, as the game would not be able to meet our expectations," writes Wester in <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/financial-reports/interim-report-january-june-2024">the mid-year report</a>.
</p>
<p>Due to writing down the development cost of 208 million kronor (around £14.9 million) for Life By You, operating profit in Q2 2024 fell 90% year-on-year. Paradox Interactive still turned a profit due to strong performance from what they consider their "core games", including new expansions released for the likes of Stellaris, Victoria 3 and Europa Universalis IV.
</p>
<p>Wester writes that the publisher has "made major changes to how we invest in riskier projects, which means that we have not started new projects with the same combination of high risk and high costs as Life by You" since 2021. 
</p>
<p>Life By You isn't the only troubled project to fall under Paradox in recent years. Cities: Skylines 2 was a long-awaited sequel to a beloved game, but launched with bugs, performance issues and design choices which alienated many of its players. Lamplighters League was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pulpy-xcom-a-like-lamplighters-league-written-off-as-a-big-disappointment-and-22m-loss-by-publisher-just-a-week-after-release">$22 million flop</a> that led to layoffs and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">a parting of ways with long-time development partner Harebrained Schemes</a>. Bloodlines 2 has been in development hell for years, only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-looks-pretty-dishonored-in-this-14-minutes-gameplay-trailer">recently resurfacing under the leadership of The Chinese Room</a>. Prison Architect 2 - somehow not mentioned at all in this financial report - was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-2-developers-part-ways-with-paradox-months-before-its-due-for-release">delayed from May until September</a>, leading to long-time development studio partner Double Eleven to leave the project and a new studio to come onboard to finish the game. 
</p>
<p>Wester aims to paint a silver lining around the rough quarter, by noting that "in-house developed core games continue to deliver good content that players have appreciated," but yeesh. You'd think dice rolls wouldn't come up snake eyes so many times in a row.</p>

Tyson appears to have made a number of inappropriate comments and “edgy jokes” in this server, and during this time she seems to have had a more direct relationship with one minor in particular, named LavaGS, according to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ava-kris-tyson-mrbeast-grooming-allegations-prism-interview-1235068234/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ava-kris-tyson-mrbeast-grooming-allegations-prism-interview-1235068234/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a <em>Rolling Stone</em> investigation</a></span>.<br></p><p>According to the article, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/LavaGS&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/LavaGS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LavaGS</a></span>, who is now 20 years old, has a history with Tyson going back several years. When Tyson was in her early 20s and LavaGS was a teenager, they would regularly communicate via Discord and Twitter, often playing games and exchanging messages containing crude and sexual humor. Eventually, LavaGS was even able to get a job working for MrBeast’s gaming-centric channel, MrBeastGaming, through Tyson. As a production assistant for the channel, LavaGS moderated aspects of the channel, appeared in some videos, and even flew out to MrBeast’s “compound” in North Carolina.<br></p><p>Since the allegations against Tyson were made in June by a right-wing creator, and subsequently picked up by numerous other YouTuber content creators a month later, LavaGS has spoken up a number of times. At first, he came to Tyson’s defense, saying, “These videos are massive lies and twisting the truth. Ava never did anything wrong and just made a few edgy jokes. I was never exploited or taken advantage of.”<br></p><p>Since those initial claims, though, LavaGS has publicly commended Donaldson’s actions against Tyson, and clarified that while he doesn’t believe he was groomed, “there is still alot of other allegations that deserve to [be] investigated thoroughly.”<br></p><p>Since the allegations went wide, a number of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Valkyrae/status/1815786640121725196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Valkyrae/status/1815786640121725196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/pokimanelol&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/pokimanelol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streaming personalities</a></span> have spoken up and, perhaps unsurprisingly, some people online have seized on the controversy as an opportunity to deploy transphobic rhetoric against Tyson.

                <p>M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie, Trap, is scheduled to hit the big screen on August 2. A fan recreated the Grand Theft Auto 5 the film launch, and Shyamalan recently praised the fan-made project.</p><p dir="ltr">The video was initially posted on the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FinalFlameProductions/videos"> Final Flame Productions YouTube channel</a>. This account has a history of recreating movie trailers within GTA 5, including Joker 2 and Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F. Shyamalan caught wind of the video featuring his new movie, prompting him to say on <a href="https://x.com/MNightShyamalan/status/1816839173505966319" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X/Twitter, "This is so cool!"</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puS6arD_crA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/puS6arD_crA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Trap tells the story of a father who takes his daughter to a pop concert. But the catch is that the father is a serial killer, and the police have set up the concert to catch him.</p><p dir="ltr">The video's YouTube description reveals that the trailer was made using the GTA 5 PC Rockstar Editor. Instead of having Josh Hartnett play the killer, the fan-made trailer has Michael De Santa, one of the game's main protagonists, take his spot. This is oddly spot on, given how Michael acts throughout the majority of the game.</p><p>GTA 5 was released way back in 2013, but a sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, will finally launch in 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dc-forever-superhero-deckbuilding-game-available-now-fore-pre-order<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pre-orders are now live for a new DC superhero board game. The game is called <em>DC Forever</em>, a brand new deckbuilding game by Wizkids; not to be confused with the <em>DC Deckbuilding Game: Forever Evil</em> by Cryptozoic Entertainment. This deckbuilder stands out thanks to a unique asymmetrical twist.</p>

<p>According to its <a href="https://shop.wizkids.com/products/dc-forever">store page</a>, <em>DC Forever</em> is a competitive fast-paced deckbuilding game. One player takes command of different DC comic superheroes (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, etc.) while the other plays as the rogues (Lex Luthor, The Joker, Cheetah, etc.).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dc-forever-joker-card-artwork.jpg?itok=3Ebq7oJ3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dc-forever-joker-card-artwork.jpg?itok=JwwZhVMK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>What makes <em>DC Forever</em> different from other deckbuilders like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ascension-legends-brings-back-beloved-deckbuilding-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Ascension</em></a> are its asymmetrical elements. When the game starts, both players choose a handful of characters. Each character in the game has a deck of cards which you can buy from when building your deck. These characters also provide powerful cards to your deck from the beginning.</p>
<p>This is different from most deckbuilding games where both players select cards from a single completely random shop. The game has eighteen different characters, which can lead to many potential strategies and synergies. Adding to the variety are twelve different location cards, which move the action from Gotham to Metropolis to Atlantis.</p>
<p>Lastly, winning a game of <em>DC Forever</em> does not depend on resources. There are multiple ways to win the game, either fighting your enemies directly or spending time working on your master plan in the margins. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>Each copy of <em>DC Forever</em> will contain the following:</p>
<ul><li>80+ Hero Cards</li>
<li>80+ Rogue Cards</li>
<li>12 Location Cards</li>
<li>8 Unaligned Character Cards</li>
<li>25+ Citizen Tokens</li>
<li>35+ Damage Tokens</li>
<li>6 Activation Tokens</li>
<li>18 Character Standees</li>
</ul><p>The game is being sold at an MSRP $49.99. According to the store listing, copies will be shipped to customers in Q1 of 2025.</p>

It’s a grand fantasy story and an excellent tactical RPG that feels unmatched, even within the franchise to which it belongs.

The “three houses” of the title refer to groups within the game’s central setting of the Garreg Mach Monastery’s Officer’s Academy, one of which you choose to lead at the start of the game. There are the Blue Lions and the Golden Deer, but I am most concerned with the Black Eagles and its seemingly cold-hearted leader, Edelgard.</p><p>Each house leader is the presumptive heir to a given political body within the world of <em>Three Houses</em>. They play as schoolmates and tentative friends, but all exist under the looming shadow that they will likely be enemies when (not if) that impending war does finally begin. Edelgard is the only one of the three who seems to have put any thought into this reality in the game’s first section, which is set during their time at school while a mysterious antagonist known as the Flame Emperor terrorizes the monastery. This can make her an off-putting figure, someone who comes off as calculating and uncaring. As the only female leader, one who, if taken at face-value, could be seen simply as a shallow, bossy woman, it is perhaps unsurprising that the white-haired ruler to be rubbed some people the wrong way. Cut to the game’s big reveal that Edelgard is, in fact, the Flame Emperor, here to overthrow the way of life you and the rest of the game’s cast have been training to preserve. She’s a dangerous, despotic revolutionary that you spend the game’s second section working to defeat. At least, that’s how it goes in all but one timeline.</p><figure id="" data-id="dc970cfbb2b61dbadc346d2c7c97744a" data-recommend-id="image://dc970cfbb2b61dbadc346d2c7c97744a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard saying &quot;Me?

Doing so begins the Crimson Flower route. Given the cold and shallow demeanor Edelgard presents at the game’s start, it isn’t necessarily something people will stumble on themselves. Even for those who do choose her house, it requires continued persistence to reach the point where she trusts you enough to reveal her secrets. In other routes, the only identity she earns is that of a horrible antagonist that must be stopped at all cost. In Crimson Flower and the Black Eagles route through the game’s first section, she gets to be human.<br></p><p>Referring to the reveal of Edelgard’s identity as the Flame Emperor as a twist feels inaccurate. If you join the Black Eagles and spend time with her it feels almost obvious, as it’s the natural step to take given how Edelgard sees the world of <em>Three Houses</em>. In the first half of the game, you’re presented with story beat after story beat that openly show the medieval fantasy world to be a place bereft with horrible class inequality and ingrained ways of life held up by the church, the very institution you serve. Much of this inequality comes down to Crests, special marks that, over time, have been used to decide nobility. These Crests are hereditary and lead to women born with Crests often being seen as vessels to give birth to men who can pass on the special powers, an issue seen explicitly with Ingrid’s story. These issues, and more personal traumas like the massacre of her entire family, have turned Edelgard into the cold woman we meet at the beginning of the game. But if you accompany her throughout the first half, we see these horrific realities of the world up close. If you pay attention to the world, then Edelgard’s mission isn’t much of a twist. The reasons behind what Xeecee accurately named her “call to arms” in a 2019 article for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/gyzq9y/fire-emblem-revolution-flame-emperor&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/gyzq9y/fire-emblem-revolution-flame-emperor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vice</em></a></span><em> </em>are all laid bare for you to see.</p><p>As shown in her school time, Edelgard is the only future leader in the world of <em>Three Houses</em> who is concerned with changing the systems in place in order to benefit the people. The other leaders, Dimitri and Claude, are concerned with retaining their—and their kingdoms’— place in the status quo. They may talk about caring about their people, but it’s in an us vs them mindset that fears losing a place in the upper echelons of a world governed by the church. Through Edelgard, <em>Three Houses</em> gives you the rare chance to do something truly revolutionary as a protagonist. It invites you to actually leave the world of the game a better place than when you found it.</p><figure id="" data-id="0948da3e4d4d8fa22a860d9c95e64906" data-recommend-id="image://0948da3e4d4d8fa22a860d9c95e64906" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard saying &quot;For their sake, I will build a world where such meaningless sacrifice is never again sanctioned.

In many ways she has given up her identity and life in order to pursue change for everyone. Part of the beauty of the Crimson Flower path and leading the Black Eagles during their time at the Officer’s Academy is getting to breathe some humanity back into her after the horrific life she has lived. Again, the downside is that you only see this side of her if you choose to lead the Black Eagles and then follow Edelgard in her revolution. It locks so much of the best writing and character work in the entire game behind so many choices, but in some ways it’s better for it, as it requires you to truly seek it out through your love of Edelgard.<br></p><p>Edelgard remains a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/204445-fire-emblem-three-houses/78883417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/204445-fire-emblem-three-houses/78883417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">widely hated</a></span> character in <em>Three Houses</em>. She is easily painted as an irredeemable villain who causes mass murder, all for the sake of her own goals. Of course, she isn’t perfect, but the game goes to great lengths to show the cost of revolution is high but necessary. Edelgard is sacrificing her own humanity, and it eats away at her. The revolution is not something she takes lightly, and she even confides in you that she worries the cost will be too high in the end. But holding the systems of oppression in the world of <em>Three Houses</em> accountable is something that must be done, and it will mean change for the better. It shouldn’t be overlooked that it is so easy for a particular subset of players to utterly demonize the female lead (if we consider the house heads as leads, which I think is fair to do). At the end of the day, every character in every route is responsible for a long list of deaths and war crimes, but only one of the house leaders has a distinct moral drive behind every action they take.</p><p>For queer players, her route takes on even more meaning if you choose to be the female protagonist of the game. Edelgard is romanceable regardless of gender and in a story of revolution, in which she is fighting to break down oppressive institutions, reading her as queer just clicks. Building a relationship with Edelgard is the central pillar of understanding the moral imperative to fight alongside her. It also, as I previously mentioned, helps to breathe humanity into her in a world that has worked so hard to tear it out. It sounds cliche, but by giving her love and romancing her, you can make the story of revolution all the more poignant. She is not just fighting for a better world for those around her, but so she can be the truest version of herself without judgment.</p><figure id="" data-id="52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-recommend-id="image://52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard crying while she hugs female Byleth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Edelgard crying while she hugs female Byleth" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-recommend-id="image://52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard crying while she hugs female Byleth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To Edelgard’s detriment, Crimson Flower is the shortest route in <em>Three Houses</em>. Yet it packs so much remarkable storytelling into a smaller package than its counterparts. It robs her of a true catharsis, relegating the fruits of her labors to epilogue text. Furthermore, each route that follows a different house leader ends with corruption being rooted out from the world of <em>Three Houses</em>, so in the end, many may wonder why Edelgard’s methods were even necessary or justified. But again, even if the world changes regardless of who you choose, Edelgard is the only ruler who sets out with that change in mind as her singular goal. Her devotion to that mission is also what enlightened the other leaders around her, persuading them to eventually work for some level of change, even in the routes in which she is killed for her crimes.<br></p><p><em>Three Houses</em> is a game you’re encouraged to play through many times in order to see all the different routes and permutations, but at the end of the day, if someone asked me what single route they should play, I would answer Crimson Flower. Edelgard is not right about everything, she is not perfect. She is, however, the most compelling and well-written character in <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em>. She will never deserve the hate she gets. That was true in 2019 and it is true now, five years later. Edelgard Von Hresvelg, you will always be famous.</p><p><strong>Buy <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses: </em></strong><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Emblem-Three-Houses-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07DK13HKX/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-five-years-edelgard-switch-1851606712&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B07DK13HKX" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmKDjOaplgN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmKDjOaplgN" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Indie developer The Behemoth outlined its plans for the future in a recent livestream, and it includes major updates to games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/castle-crashers/" data-ref-id="5000-27643">Castle Crashers</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battleblock-theater/" data-ref-id="5000-42607">BattleBlock Theater</a>, as well as work on a new game that will soon be in the prototype phase.</p><p dir="ltr">Castle Crashers, the side-scrolling beat-em'-up originally released in 2008, will receive a major update on Steam called Painter Boss Paradise, which is the first new content added to the game since the introduction of new playable characters back in 2012. The update will add Steam Workshop support, allowing for players to create their own characters and share them with others. The Behemoth states in its roadmap trailer that creating characters will be as simple as swapping out a single image and then letting the game handle all the hard stuff like animations.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Behemoth Upcoming Updates And Games Roadmap Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For those who don't want to craft a character of their own, there will also be an official new playable character, Paint Junior, who uses their imagination to create art and defeat enemies. Painter Boss Paradise will additionally introduce redrawn models for all of the game's playable characters and weapons, but don't worry: The new models can be toggled on or off in the options menu.</p><p dir="ltr">For the studio's platformer BattleBlock Theater, an update for the Steam version will allow for higher frame rates, support for more controller types, better rendering, and higher audio bitrates for improved sound. The game will be coming to modern consoles as well, something also in the works for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alien-hominid/" data-ref-id="5000-21360">Alien Hominid HD</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alien-hominid-invasion/" data-ref-id="5000-507833">Alien Hominid Invasion</a>, which are currently available on Xbox and PC but will soon be coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 too.</p><p dir="ltr">Not to be left out, The Behemoth's quirky strategy title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pit-people/" data-ref-id="5000-310603">Pit People</a>, will also be receiving some quality-of-life improvements, though specific details were not shared.</p><p dir="ltr">No release dates were given for any of these updates, and no additional information was shared in regards to when The Behemoth's next new game would arrive. In a press release, the developer states that all of the aforementioned updates "will be rolling out while the team looks ahead to prototyping and developing new titles."</p><p dir="ltr">The roadmap served as a way to "address several popular far requests from the past 21 years while establishing a new level of transparency with players," according to the press release. The studio's most-recent projects were Alien Hominid HD and Alien Hominid Invasion, both released in 2023.</p>

            <p>Demos were once a cornerstone of PC gaming and they arguably will be again thanks to events like Steam Next Fest. The latest update to Steam seeks to make those free slices of potential delight easier to find for players, and easier to promote for developers.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Great Steam Demo Update, as <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4155211502162971563">the announcement calls it</a>, makes several changes. Demos will now behave differently in your library: you can add them without immediately installing them; they can now be installed even if you already own the full game; and they can be manually removed from your library, or will be automatically removed when uninstalled.
</p>
<p>Demos can also now have their own separate store page, if a developer so chooses. This allows a developer to explain the demo's contents in more detail, add unique screenshots and trailers, and even allows players to write user reviews of the demo.
</p>
<p>All demos will also now appear in more places around the Steam store, acting more like standalone free games.
</p>
<p>When I started my career twenty years ago, it was my job to make coverdiscs (both CDs and a DVD) filled with demos to be stuck to the front of a PC gaming magazine, and to write about the contents of the demos inside the magazine's pages. I got to watch up-close as those demos grew in filesize, becoming hard to fit even on a DVD, and as their creation grew less and less common. It was a terrible shame.
</p>
<p>I imagine there's still debate over whether or not demos help developers sell their game - and I imagine the answer varies wildly depending on the game, the demo, and whether either are any good. As a player, I have little invested in that debate. For me, demos are an unequivocal good: free, hypothetically fun, and great way to avoid spending money on games I wouldn't like. It's great that they've had such a huge revival and now we get to write about them in events like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/wishlisted-2024">Wishlisted</a>.</p>

As the strike commences, many games currently in development will be affected due to the labor strikes. However, one notable game that will not be affected is Rockstar Games' upcoming open-world game, which is undoubtedly one of next year's most highly anticipated titles: Grand Theft Auto 6. </p><p>First <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by Kotaku</a> and independently verified by IGN, Grand Theft Auto 6 is exempt from the video game voice actor strike. Take-Two declined IGN's request for comment. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/26/strike-1721952790030.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>SAG-AFTRA'S video game voice actor strike went into effect at midnight on July 26. | Image Credit: SAG-AFTRA</figcaption></figure></output><p>Additionally, this claim of GTA 6's exemption from the video game voice actors strike can be verified by heading to the SAG-AFTRA database, which includes a search tool allowing SAG-AFTRA members to search for the struck status of video game projects. Below, you can read the message on SAG-AFTRA's website regarding GTA VI's exemption. </p><blockquote>"While not struck, this game is produced by a struck company. If you have been engaged under a daily contract for this game, you can show solidarity with your fellow union members by choosing not to sign new contracts on the game. However, you may work the game and will not be disciplined for doing so." </blockquote><p>GTA 6 is exempt from the video game voice actors strike because games already in production before August 25, 2023, including live service games, are covered by the previous contractual agreement between SAG-AFTRA and gaming companies. However, actors may still choose not to work on the game in solidarity with fellow members and cannot be penalized by employers.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 Stills</h3></div></output><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-rockstar-officially-unveils-first-trailer-early-after-leak">officially revealed in December 2023</a>. Its first trailer became a mega-hit for Rockstar Games, becoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-has-already-surpassed-grand-theft-auto-5s-reveal-with-more-than-100-million-views">YouTube's most-viewed video game reveal within 24 hours</a>.

However, Take-Two Interactive would narrow that release window in May 2024, when CEO Strauss Zelnick told IGN in an interview that the company was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-take-two-interactive">"highly confident"</a> that GTA would not be delayed, while also revealing the game would be released in Fall 2025 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. </p><p>While GTA 6 remains technically unaffected by the strikes, that does not mean the gaming industry will feel the effects of this ongoing labor strike.

                <p>Riot's 5v5 hero shooter<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/"> Valorant</a> has now entered open beta on consoles. Anyone playing on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S can join the fun.</p><p dir="ltr">Before the announcement, the only way to play Valorant on console was through a closed beta that players needed to sign up for. In a series of posts made on the<a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1816867027060920540" rel="nofollow "> official Valorant X/Twitter account</a>, the studio explained that console players won't be able to play PC players. However, those on Xbox and PlayStation can join each other's games.</p><p dir="ltr">There'll also be shared cross-progression for PC and console, which will give players full access to everything they've purchased. All progress made towards the battle pass will count towards both platforms. Those who are subscribed to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will automatically unlock all agents. The open beta is currently only available in the United States, Canada, Europe, Brazil, and Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">Bringing Valorant to console did require a lot of work. As an<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/26/valorant-console-open-beta-xbox-series-x-s/" rel="nofollow "> Xbox Wire post</a> explained, the standard way to shoot on PC was hip firing. This didn't translate well when it came to console, so to combat this, Riot created Focus, a new type of shooting mode that acts like hip fire but with reduced sensitivity.</p><p>If you're jumping into Valorant for the first time, check out<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/12-valorant-tips-to-help-you-master-the-competitive-shooter/2900-5546/#1"> our guide, which details everything you need to know about getting the upper hand</a>.</p>
