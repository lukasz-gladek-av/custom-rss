                <p>After nearly a decade of anticipation for the next installment of Dragon Age, the latest sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, unfortunately <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/" data-ref-id="1100-6528964">failed to reach EA's expectations</a>. Subsequently, the game's developer, BioWare, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">laid off staff members</a> and became considerably smaller. Now, one of the voice actors from The Veilguard is sharing her dismay about the backlash against the game from people who she says wanted to see BioWare fail.</p><p>Alix Wilton Regan--who voices the female Inquisitor in both Dragon Age: Inquisition and Dragon Age: The Veilguard--recently told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-star-absolutely-devastated-over-backlash-says-people-wanted-to-see-bioware-fail" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that she loved the game and she suspects that The Veilguard's haters were intentionally trying to bring it down.</p><p>"I feel absolutely devastated for BioWare as a studio that they got such mixed reactions to the game," said Wilton Regan. "I personally thought it was a really strong game. I thought it was just BioWare being more BioWare. I also think a lot of people kind of wanted to see it fail, or wanted to see [BioWare] fail, either because they're just really bad people on the interne--of which there are unfortunately many, as we have discovered... "People were attacking the game before it was released. It's ridiculous. How can you judge a game, a book, a film, a TV show before it's actually released? You can't. It's an idiotic stance to take."</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like Dragon Age will get a sequel any time soon. EA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">shifted some of BioWare's developers</a> to other parts of the company, while leaving the remaining devs to tackle the next Mass Effect game. </p><p>EA chalked up The Veilguard's disappointing response to an "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">evolving industry landscape</a>." BioWare wasn't the only developer inside of EA to face layoffs. Earlier this week, EA shuttered Cliffhanger Games and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-its-developer-and-lays-off-additional-staff/1100-6531883/" data-ref-id="1100-6531883">canceled the AAA Black Panther game</a> that was in development.</p>

                <p>The Duchess is one of the eight available classes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, but it's not one that you'll have unlocked by default at the start of the game. Instead, you have to complete a specific action to unlock the class and start using it on your expeditions.</p><p>Of course, if you already have the Duchess unlocked in Nightreign, then you might be wondering the best way to build out the class. Fortunately, we have you covered on both fronts. You can see our full detailed guide below on how to unlock the Duchess and the best build for it in Nightreign. You can also check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-nightreign-classes-and-tier-list/2900-6624/" data-ref-id="2900-6624">tier list for all eight classes</a> so you can see how the Duchess stacks up to its counterparts.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_unlock_the_Duchess_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to unlock the Duchess in Elden Ring Nightreign</a></li><li><a href="#Duchess_class_overview_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Duchess class overview in Elden Ring Nightreign</a><ul><li><a href="#Passive_Ability__Magnificent_Pose">Passive Ability: Magnificent Pose</a></li><li><a href="#Character_Skill__Restage">Character Skill: Restage</a></li><li><a href="#Ultimate_Art__Finale">Ultimate Art: Finale</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_Relics_for_the_Duchess_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Best Relics for the Duchess in Elden Ring Nightreign</a><ul><li><a href="#Old_Pocketwatch">Old Pocketwatch</a></li><li><a href="#Golden_Dew">Golden Dew</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="How_to_unlock_the_Duchess_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to unlock the Duchess in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>First and foremost, you need to know how to unlock the Duchess if you want to start using the class.</p><p>You won't be able to unlock the Duchess until you defeat the first expedition boss in Nightreign, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-tricephalos-boss-guide-how-to-beat-gladius/1100-6531888/" data-ref-id="1100-6531888">Tricephalos</a>. This is the only major boss you have access to after completing the tutorial, and you can go on the expedition to fight the boss by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-roundtable-hold-guide/2900-6607/" data-ref-id="2900-6607">interacting with the Roundtable Hold's</a> central table.</p><p>After you have defeated the Tricephalos boss, you'll receive an "Old Pocketwatch" as a reward for completing the expedition. This Old Pocketwatch can be used as a Relic at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-relics-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531727/" data-ref-id="1100-6531727">Relic Rites station</a> in the Roundtable Hold. However, you don't want to make plans with the Old Pocketwatch just yet, as it's the main way to unlock the Duchess class.</p><p>With the Old Pocketwatch in your inventory, go speak with the white-gowned woman who first spoke to you upon arriving at the Roundtable Hold. During the dialogue with the woman, she'll ask you to give her the Old Pocketwatch, as it was hers to begin with. You can either choose to hand over the Old Pocketwatch or keep it for yourself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504107-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.42.30.59.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504107" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504107-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.42.30.59.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504107"></a><figcaption>Choosing to hand over the Old Pocketwatch or keep it. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504107-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.42.30.59.png"></figure><p>You want to choose to hand over the Old Pocketwatch to the woman. Doing this results in the woman trusting you more, causing her to reveal her true identity. The woman is the Duchess herself, and as soon as you hand the watch over, she transforms into the Duchess. You now have full access to the Duchess in Elden Ring Nightreign, and you also get to keep the Old Pocketwatch as a usable Relic.</p><h2 id="Duchess_class_overview_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Duchess class overview in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>The Duchess is unlike any other class in Nightreign, as she excels in quick combat with fast attacks and speedy movement. However, with this speed, the Duchess doesn't have a ton of HP, so you'll need to use your movement to weave your way in and out of battles to avoid being hit too much. The Duchess's starting weapon is a dagger that can attack extremely quickly, but doesn't do an overwhelming amount of damage per hit.</p><p>Here are all of the Duchess's abilities in Nightreign:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504109-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.46.05.94.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504109" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504109-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.46.05.94.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504109"></a><figcaption>All of the Duchess's skills in Elden Ring Nightreign.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504109-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.46.05.94.png"></figure><h3 id="Passive_Ability__Magnificent_Pose">Passive Ability: Magnificent Pose</h3><ul><li>Attack and dodge optimally, dodging repeatedly when necessary.</li></ul><p>The Duchess's increased movement abilities allow her to dodge over and over, which gives you the ability to avoid damage as much as possible.</p><h3 id="Character_Skill__Restage">Character Skill: Restage</h3><ul><li>Stage reprisal of recent occurrences to damage nearby foes.</li></ul><p>Restage is a fairly decent ability that gives the Duchess a chance to deal damage while not engaging with foes.

The Finale skill also obscures your nearby allies, though, so it's important to consider their positioning before casting it.</p><h2 id="Best_Relics_for_the_Duchess_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Best Relics for the Duchess in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>Now that we've gone over how to unlock the Duchess and all of her skills, it's time to build out the class using Relics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504111-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.14.38.57.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504111" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504111-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.14.38.57.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504111"></a><figcaption>The Duchess' Goblet can be purchased at the Small Jar Bazaar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504111-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.14.38.57.png"></figure><p>For starters, it's best to go to the Small Jar Bazaar and purchase the Duchess' Goblet for 1,200 Murk. This gives you a new set of Relic Rites, which include two orange slots and one green slot. By default, you have access to the Duchess' Urn (two red slots, one blue slot). By swapping to the Duchess' Goblet, you're able to make use of much stronger Relics. You can also eventually upgrade to the Duchess' Chalice.</p><h3 id="Old_Pocketwatch">Old Pocketwatch</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504110-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.16.44.19.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504110" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504110-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.16.44.19.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504110"></a><figcaption>The Old Pocketwatch is one of the best Relics for the Duchess</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504110-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.16.44.19.png"></figure><p>Coincidentally, one of those Relics is the Old Pocketwatch, which is tailor-made for the Duchess. The Old Pocketwatch is a green Relic Rite and has the ability to restore FP upon successive attacks and gives a flat +3 to Dexterity, the main stat the Duchess utilizes.</p><p>The FP restoration after successive attacks is perfect for the Duchess since you can attack multiple times using her default dagger and any other fast weapons you find during an expedition.</p><h3 id="Golden_Dew">Golden Dew</h3><p>The other Relic you want to make sure you equip for the Duchess is the Golden Dew, which is an orange Relic Rite that can slide right alongside the Old Pocketwatch. The Golden Dew Relic is unlocked through the Duchess' Remembrance quest in Nightreign and offers improved Character Skill Attack Power for the Duchess specifically, as well as boosts the attack power of added Affinity Attacks.</p><p>The third Relic slot for the Duchess (using the Goblet) can be filled with other Relics that you earn as rewards while playing as the Duchess. You want to focus on the Dexterity attack, dagger attack power, and bonuses for attacking quickly.</p><p>That does it for our Duchess class guide in Elden Ring Nightreign.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6 Season 04 | Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Why these ads were added four seasons into Black Ops 6 instead of earlier (or preferably never) is unclear, but it's easy to see why players aren't exactly thrilled about them. For starters, it's not like the battle pass isn't already featured very prominently, as it has its own dedicated menu tab and there are frequent reminders for players to claim rewards and upgrade to the premium version.</p><p dir="ltr">Ads for weapon blueprints are equally frustrating. If a player hasn't kept up with each season, they may have numerous weapons they need to grind XP for in order to unlock. Buying a weapon blueprint for that weapon, however, unlocks it immediately. It's easy to see these in-game advertisements then as publisher Activision's way of trying to entice players to simply pay for access to new weapons.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1928155987409514677" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Activision has now added Bundle and Battle Pass advertisements to the Create a Class and Events tab with the Season 4 update in Black Ops 6 and Warzone. <a href="https://t.co/4rLvLbWmTe" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/4rLvLbWmTe</a></p>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1928155987409514677?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty is, of course, no stranger to microtransactions. Black Ops 6 has sold mini-event battle passes and even an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-has-an-option-to-pay-for-better-audio/1100-6527328/" data-ref-id="1100-6527328">option for better audio</a>, and its store is filled with so many weapon and Operator bundles it's hard to keep track. In-game advertisements for those microtransactions sadly feel par for the course, but it's still disappointing nonetheless.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what else is coming as part of Black Ops Season 4, new maps, modes, and weapons are available now, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wicks-ballerina-is-coming-to-call-of-duty/1100-6531722/" data-ref-id="1100-6531722">John Wick Ballerina crossover</a> set to begin later in the season.

While it is designed as a three-player co-op roguelite experience, you can also play Nightreign solo… but it’s really, really hard. Fortunately, From Software is listening to players and releasing a patch next week to make solo expeditions easier.</p><p>The studio announced this patch on the <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436889293345246">official Elden Ring X account</a>, stating Patch 1.02 arrives next week and includes several bug fixes and improvements for solo expeditions. As for what to expect, From Software <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436890924884471">says</a> the effect, “Automatic Revival Upon Defeat,” which allows revival once per night boss battle, will be added to solo expeditions, and the amount of runes gained will be increased.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This should make the entire experience easier for solo players, as increased runes will allow them to level up faster. And having the ability to revive once per night boss battle will give players more of a fighting chance in Nightreign’s various fights. From Software says further details about Patch 1.02 will be provided next week.</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Elden Ring Nightreign review</a> and then check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/tips-tricks/2025/05/29/elden-ring-nightreign-beginner-tips-and-tricks"><em>Game Informer’s</em> beginner tips and tricks for Elden Ring Nightreign</a>.

Kojima Productions really is determined to make sure we don't forget <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> is almost upon us. Alongside a <a href="https://www.deathstrandingconcert.com/">musical world tour</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/limited-edition-death-stranding-2-ps5-controller-will-launch-alongside-kojimas-sequel">themed PlayStation 5 controller</a>, plus all that chatter about a Death Stranding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-movie-reportedly-being-helmed-by-a-quiet-place-day-one-director">movie</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-casually-reveals-a-death-stranding-anime-is-in-the-works">anime</a>, the studio has now confirmed it'll be streaming a Death Stranding 2 panel event next month.
</p>
<p>
Officially known as the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Game Premiere event, it's the first date in Kojima Productions' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-getting-world-tour-to-celebrate-its-release">previously announced months-long "world tour"</a> that careens through the likes of Sydney, Paris, London, and Hong Kong before ending in Lucca this November.
</p>
<p>
Things get underway, however, at 7pm PDT on Sunday, 8th June in Los Angeles, California - and keen-eyed observers will immediately appreciate that ties is neatly with the start of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest season</a>. And thus enter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, who'll be hosting the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Game Premiere event at Los Angeles' Orpheum Theatre, with best pal and Death Standing creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> in attendance too.

<p>
The focus of the event is a panel discussion featuring Kojima and unspecified "special guests", but there's also talk of a live demonstration of Death Stranding 2, should you wish to get another peek ahead of its 26th June release on PlayStation 5. And if you <em>do</em>, you can either show up in person - tickets are <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/f7243f5b-d8db-4292-9b92-eacc5a299c61/summary">available online</a> - or, probably more conveniently for most, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gOV2Rx-ncxM">watch the whole thing on YouTube</a>. Just be aware that it doesn't start till 3am on 9th June in the UK, so you might prefer to catch up later once you've had your beauty sleep.
</p>
<p>
So there's a lot happening in the world of Death Stranding, then, but will the wait be worth it? Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale nipped across the ocean to have a look a few months back and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic">came away with many thoughts</a>. Perhaps the most telling words, however, are these: "So far, [Death Stranding 2] feels like the most Kojima-game yet".

Patch 1.02 is scheduled to release sometime next week and will improve the solo experience of playing this co-op game.</p><p>"Next week, Patch 1.02 will be released, and will include several bug fixes as well as improvements for solo expeditions," the official <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436889293345246" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elden Ring account on X</a> explained. While the full patch notes won't be released until next week, the account did tease some important updates coming to solo expeditions in Nightreign. After Patch 1.02, solo players will be able to revive themselves once per night-boss battle and gain more runes (a form of in-game currency) while playing.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436890924884471" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The following improvements for solo expeditions will be added to the game:<br>- The effect "Automatic Revival Upon Defeat", which allows revival once per night boss battle, will be added to solo expeditions.<br>- The amount of runes gained will be increased.<br>Thank you for your support.</p>  — ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436890924884471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Nightreign remixes the critically acclaimed 2022 game from Dark Souls creator From Software into a more multiplayer-focused experience where players take on tough bosses together. That said, players also have the option of going on these expeditions alone if they really want to, although even GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">glowing review of Nightreign</a> admits that "it never feels like it was designed to accommodate a single player." After Patch 1.2, Nightreign should feel more welcoming to those solo players.</p><p>The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-players-warned-of-pc-performance-issues-in-day-one-patch-notes/1100-6531903/" data-ref-id="1100-6531903">received a day-one patch</a> that implemented some last-minute balance adjustments and warned of PC performance problems. It's currently unknown if Patch 1.02 will fix any of those performance issues. None of these balance, PC performance, or solo play issues have prevented Nightreign from becoming an instant success, though. It has already been confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928451382111052101" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2 million people</a> have played Elden Ring Nightreign on its first day.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is available now for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>That's an impressive feat for any game, but not all that surprising for a spin-off of the uber-popular <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>, which <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/28/elden-ring-celebrates-30-million-copies-shipped">surpassed 30 million copies shipped</a> last month. Despite featuring "Elden Ring" in the title, Nightreign differs from its predecessor. Instead of a single-player action-RPG focused on exploration, mystery, and overcoming challenges, Nightreign is a three-player co-op roguelite spin on Elden Ring about min-maxing efficiency in each run.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It's a great time, and you can read about why in <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency"><em>Game Informer's</em> Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.

			<p><span>FromSoftware has just&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that its new game, Elden Ring Nightreign, has already registered over two million players on its launch day. On Steam, it has peaked at 313K concurrent players, and it could certainly get higher during the weekend.</span></p>
<p>On one hand, this is entirely unsurprising since it's the spin-off of a game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-sales-top-30-million-units-after-3-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over 30 million copies to date (and is now getting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rumored-a24-elden-ring-movie-with-alex-garland-writing-and-directing-is-reportedly-real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movie</a>, too). On the other hand, Nightreign is inevitably an experiment to some degree, and its formula wasn't exactly guaranteed to be equally attractive. Indeed, critic scores were a bit lower than usual for the Japanese studio. However, our Francesco De Meo still enjoyed his time with the game, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his 9/10 review</a> published earlier this week:</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign, more than many other FromSoftware titles, is likely to be an acquired taste for most players. My first few Expeditions into Limveld weren't particularly enjoyable, but the more I learned its mechanics, and the less I expected a traditional Soulslike with some roguelike elements sprinkled in, the more the game grew on me. Now, after dozens of failed Expeditions and a handful of successful ones spread over 30+ hours, I find it hard to put down. With its wealth of character customization options and the tension of a ticking clock dictating the fast pace of the experience, Elden Ring Nightreign is an engaging and exhilarating experience that even those with only a passing interest in FromSoftware's games, or those still skeptical about it, should give a chance. Like me, they may find themselves drawn to the Night so deeply that they may never want to leave.</em></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign is one of the most unique titles ever developed by FromSoftware, and arguably one of their best to date. Adapting the traditionally slow-paced Souls formula into a fast-paced, co-op-focused experience with roguelike elements was no easy feat, but the Japanese studio has fully delivered, once again proving why they remain masters of their craft.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/676805/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fromsoftware-elden-ring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Imagine playing <em>Fortnite</em>, but instead of fighting other players, all you want to do is break into houses to look for caches of slurp juice. Yes, the storm is closing in on you, and there’s a bunch of enemies waiting to kill you, but all you want to do is take a walking tour of Tilted Towers. Then when the match is over, instead of queueing again, you start reading the in-game lore for Peely and Sabrina Carpenter. You can count your number of player kills on one hand meanwhile your number of deaths is in the hundreds. You’ve never achieved a victory royale, but you’ve never had more fun.</p><p><em>Nightreign</em> is FromSoftware’s first <em>Elden Ring</em> spinoff, and it’s unlike any <em>Souls</em> game that the developer has done before. <em>Nightreign</em> has the conceit of so many battle royale games — multiplayer combat focused on acquiring resources across a large map that slowly shrinks over time — wrapped in the narrative, visual aesthetics, and combat of <em>Elden Ring</em>. Instead of the Tarnished, you are a Nightfarer. Instead of the expansive Lands Between, you are sent to Limveld, an island with an ever-shifting landscape. And instead of becoming the Elden Lord, your goal is to defeat the Night Lord and end the destructive storm that scours the land.</p><p><sub>Elden Ring Nightreign<em> aura-farming exhibit A.</em></sub></p><p>In <em>Nightreign</em>, gameplay sessions are broken up into expeditions, each of which is divided into three day-night cycles. During the day, you — either solo or with two other players — explore the world looking for weapon upgrades and fighting bosses for the enhancements they reward. You’ll be forced to move as the deadly Night’s Tide slowly consumes the map, whittling your health to nothing if you’re caught in it. When the map is at its smallest, you face a tough midboss. Defeat it to commence day two of the expedition or die and start it all over. Then, on the third day, you face the expedition’s final boss. There are several expeditions to conquer each with different bosses, mid-bosses, weapons to collect, and all kinds of events that make each run unique.</p><p>I had the opportunity to play <em>Nightreign</em> once before earlier this year (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">and during a more recent network test</a>) , and it wasn’t the best preview, as the game was plagued with all kinds of issues that didn’t allow me to experience it the way the developers intended. Those technical issues have been ironed out but I still haven’t completed the game’s most basic objective: beat the first expedition. This isn’t because of any technical or gameplay issues I had. For the times I wanted to play as intended, my colleague Jay Peters stepped in to help me and I had no problem finding party members to tackle expeditions with on my own… I just never really wanted to. And part of the reason why I’m enjoying <em>Nightreign</em> so much is because the game lets me play it in a way that’s completely counterintuitive – slowly and alone.</p><p>Collaborative gaming doesn’t always feel good to me. I want to take things at my own pace, and that’s hard to do when there’s a group of people frustrated with me because they need my help to kill a boss while I’m still delving into a dungeon a mile away. But the ability to solo queue does come with a significant catch – you’re not gonna get very far. I died <em>often </em>and to everything from random enemies to bosses. It’s not often that I even make it to that first boss fight without dying to the warm-up battles that precede it. This <em>should </em>frustrate me, but I don’t care in the slightest. I’m just so pleased that I can go at my own pace to explore more of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s visually gorgeous and narratively sumptuous world.</p><p>Which brings me to my favorite part: its characters. <em>Nightreign</em> has eight new classes, each with their own unique abilities. The classes can still use every weapon you find (with some locked behind level requirements) so there’s an option to tailor a character to fit your playstyle. There are certain kinds of classes I gravitate toward, specifically ranged combat, but for the first time in a class-based game, I love every one of them. It is so much fun shredding enemies to ribbons with the Duchess, using her Restage ability to replay the attacks done to an enemy essentially doubling the damage they receive. I love the Raider’s powers of just being a big fuckin’ dude, slamming things with big ass great weapons. And true to my ranged combat loving heart, Ironeye’s specialty with bows makes it so nice when I wanna kill things without putting myself in danger.</p><p>Then there’s the Guardian. Look at him. He’s a giant armored bird-person with the busted wing and the huge-ass halberd and shield. His story involves being a protector who failed his flock and has found a new one in the other Nightfarers. I fell to my knees reading one of his codex entries and seeing how the Recluse, the mage character, helped him with his damaged wing. Every character has a codex that updates with their personal story the more expeditions you attempt. This is the shit I get out of bed for. </p><p>I thought I was going to hate the concept of <em>Nightreign</em>. I want more E<em>lden Ring</em>: I love that world, so any chance I can have to go back, I’ll take but… I just don’t like multiplayer games. Describing <em>Nightreign</em> makes it sound like the reason why it exists is because an out of touch CEO looked at the popularity of <em>Elden Ring</em> and at all the money <em>Fortnite</em> prints and went “Yeah, let’s do that.” Even if that’s the case, <em>Nightreign</em> has been constructed so that it still appeals to lore freaks like me and I can ignore the less savory bits around multiplayer with relative ease. </p><p>If I can take a moment and borrow a pair of words from my Gen Z niblings to describe <em>Nightreign</em> it’d be “aura” and “aura farming.” Aura is used to describe a person’s general coolness or badassery while aura farming is the activities one can engage in to increase one’s aura. John Wick has aura. In the first movie, when he performs his monologue about getting back in the assassin business spitting and screaming – that’s aura farming.</p><p>And between the cooperative nature of the game, its rapid-paced combat, and the new characters, abilities, and story, <em>Elden Ring</em> Nightreign has a ton of aura that I’m having a lot of fun farming – just not in the way I expected.</p><p><sub><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The latest release from the <em>Dark Souls</em> team immediately sprang up the Steam charts to reach over 300,000 concurrent players. That made it the fourth-biggest game on Valve’s storefront and the second-biggest FromSoftware launch on PC behind <em>Elden Ring</em>. Its namesake and its $40 price point clearly did the experimental multiplayer spin-off some favors. </p><p>But it didn’t take players long to realize that <em>Nightreign</em> is very much not <em>Elden Ring</em>. Unlike its slow, plodding predecessor, the spin-off is a battle royale-influenced loot race in which sessions see an entire Soulsborne experience condensed into just 45 minutes. It takes some getting used to, and players are already coming to grips with <em>Nightreign</em>’s notable hostility to explaining itself, even for a FromSoftware game. And while it does allow for offline solo play, its steep difficulty curve—more of a right angle really—heavily rewards group play and coordination. </p><p>“If you don’t have 2 other friends to play with in voice chat, don’t waste your time,” wrote Steam user Hishamm. “Game is <em>Elden Ring</em>, but 3p, and the solo queue is abysmal.” “Gameplay itself seems fun but I can’t possible leave a positive review if a game released in 2025 has no way to communicate in a coop game (neither voice nor text chat),” wrote Lynni. “Impossible to make progress without voice chat,” wrote Vahit Horoz. “If you have 3 friends you can talk to and play regularly, you will have a great time, the connection is smooth, the map is full of events and the game loop is very interesting.”</p><p>The game currently has a Steam rating of 65 percent, making it the lowest-scored FromSoftware release on the platform outside of <em>Dark Souls III</em>’s <em>Ashes of Ariandel</em> DLC. The reviews are full of complaints about the lack of duos (you have to either play alone or with a three-stack) and how matchmaking with strangers often leads to people randomly running around the map without coordinating, a task made harder by the lack of communication tools outside of pings and emotes. I think that might even out in the days and weeks ahead as players learn the basics of the randomized<em> Nightreign</em> map and how much more efficient you are together than split up, but the lack of modern multiplayer features is a real issue. </p><figure id="" data-id="193e46e0697b78f994a60384db271918" data-recommend-id="image://193e46e0697b78f994a60384db271918" data-format="png" data-width="2256" data-height="888" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative Elden Ring Nightreign reviews.

Nightlord bosses are practically impossible at the moment for all but the most experienced and hardcore <em>Elden Ring</em> loners. A mysterious day-one patch alluded to balance changes and other improvements, but didn’t spell out exactly what those changes are. If FromSoftware does decide to dial things back a bit, it wouldn’t be the first time it’s made one of its games easier. The studio quickly made <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-erdtree-update-1-14-dlc-radahn-boss-nerf-1851645615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-erdtree-update-1-14-dlc-radahn-boss-nerf-1851645615"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s final boss</a></span> much easier when it kicked everyone’s ass last summer.

		<p>This is it. The last week without a Switch 2. I am actually incredibly hyped – way more than I have been for the past couple of console launches – and I think it’s because of one thing: Mario Kart World. We’ve basically been playing the same Mario Kart game for 11 years. Yes… 11! Don’t get me wrong, those have been some great years, and Mario Kart 8 has been tweaked, updated and added to across that time, so it’s not the same game. But… it is the same game. Mario Kart World is a totally new take on Mario’s kart racing franchise, and I can’t wait to check it out.</p>
<p>The other nice thing is that there are fewer launch games for me to pick up here. I’m always an idiot and buy too many things at launch, and then none of them get played properly, but there’s a small batch that I’m interested in, having played other games elsewhere. I do wonder how that will play out for third parties, and whether they’ll see the return they’re hoping for with legacy titles, but here’s hoping it doesn’t put them off from bringing more Switch 2 games to the table.</p>
<p>This week, I’ve been playing a few things, going from Doom: The Dark Ages to a bunch of different sized wheels in Warhammer 40,000 Speedfreeks, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/roadcraft-review/">Roadcraft</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/f1-25-review/">F1 25</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has spent this week playing Chains of Freedom for review, Baldur’s Gate 3, Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader, and Oblivion.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been probably been playing Destiny 2 this week, but he’s also been writing about a batch of other things that he’s going to tell you about, including Hell is Us, which he seems rather taken with. You can <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/30/hands-on-hell-is-us-preview/">read his preview right here</a>.</p>

<p>After jetting off to Madeira for most of the week, <strong>Aran’s</strong> gaming was limited to starting Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon for review. He says, “So far I have escaped a dungeon and killed a miniboss found in a hidden dungeon in a blood-filled lake.” Sounds delightful!</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been playing Hypercharge: Unboxed but says it is “more fun in concept than it is in execution”, calling it, “A pretty by-the-numbers arcade shooter that’s fun for a short while”.</p>
<p>That’s not all he’s had on the go though, as he tell us, “After chipping away at it for a couple of weeks, I also crossed Resident Evil 8 off my backlog. I really enjoyed the setting and many of the smart refinements Capcom has made to the series’ new formula. Presenting players with a cast of twisted villains, then tasking us with taking them down works great just as it did in Resi 7. However, much like its predecessor, there’s a jarring theme shift between atmospheric horror and sci-fi that I wasn’t a huge fan of.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been carrying on this week. Specifically with&nbsp;Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which is “a great RPG with memorable characters, an engaging story, and superb combat but irritating platforming sections” and continued to enjoy Revenge of the Savage Planet in co-op with his partner.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also been Revenging that Savage Planet, saying, “It works really well in the transition to third person”. He’s also rinsed Doom the Dark Ages, telling us, “It was a fun campaign but the pacing felt off in places. I’ve had the chance to try out a few demos early with previews on the way and really enjoyed Near Mage – review up soon. Finally as a result of the early demos I’ve been trying to beat the NES Ninja Gaiden games and my God they’re tough. Resisted save state scumming so far but don’t think that’ll last much longer.”</p>
<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been doing some prep work for the impending arrival of the Switch 2 next week. That’s meant going all the way back to the PS4 to capture some Yakuza 0, Cyberpunk 2077, Kunitsu-Gami and more for comparisons – Cyberpunk on PS4 is such a rough time… He’s also dipped into the Splitgate 2 open beta, which is a pretty good time while everyone’s still figuring out how to best use portals, jet packs and everything else.</p>
<p><em>What about you? What have you played?</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-seemingly-teasing-more-splinter-cell-remake-news-is-coming-soon/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-seemingly-teasing-more-splinter-cell-remake-news-is-coming-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We've heard next to nothing about the Splinter Cell Remake since Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-snowdrop-engine-linear-not-open-world/">confirmed the remake was coming</a> after years of waiting for Ubisoft to even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-were-working-on-splinter-cell-comeback/">say that they are bringing the series back</a>.</p>
<p>Last August, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/">a sly comment</a> from the managing director at Ubisoft Toronto, the studio that's leading development on the Splinter Cell Remake, amounted to Ubisoft saying they had nothing to say at the time. That was the last time we heard anything directly from Ubisoft about the coming remake.</p>
<p>Today, however, Splinter Cell was brought up again, through the company's <a href="https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1928421132438224990">account on X</a>. The post is just a photo of Sam Fisher, not from the original 2002 game, but from 2005's Chaos Theory, captioned with emoticons making a face and a Splinter Cell hashtag.</p>
<p>The image's alt-text reads "<em><span>Close-up of Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, showing a stern expression with focused eyes, short dark hair, and a rugged beard, set against a blurred high-tech background. He's locked in.</span></em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Splinter Cell Remake: Stepping Out of the Shadows | Ubisoft [NA]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Summer Game Fest is around the corner, and interestingly, Ubisoft is not included in the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">image showcasing the partners for this year's show</a>. Keighley also claimed that this year's show has 60+ partners, but the image and the <a href="https://www.summergamefest.com/">website</a> only list 57. This was likely purposeful, for Ubisoft to announce its involvement in Summer Game Fest separately with a yet-to-be-announced Ubisoft Forward event sometime during the SGF weekend.</p>
<p>That's all just speculation, but with how vocal Splinter Cell fans have been about asking for a return of the series, the company has to be acutely aware of the impact even mentioning Splinter Cell has. It's not likely that Sam Fisher would show up a week ahead of SGF if Ubisoft didn't have something to show regarding the Splinter Cell Remake.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll get an announcement soon that Ubisoft does have something Splinter Cell Remake-related to show.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nine-sols-sales-800k</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nine-sols-sales-top-800k-developer-red-candle-reveals.1202694/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nine-sols-sales-800k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Red Candle Games has revealed that Metroidvania action platformer&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has reached a big sales milestone, with the game also celebrating its first anniversary.</p>

<p>Released on May 29th last year,&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has, according to a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1809540/view/544484746860692250" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, reached 800,000 copies since its launch. That number counts across all platforms, too, so it includes not only the game's initial PC release, but also November's console ports.</p>

<p>Red Candle also includes a timeline of&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' achievements in the post, revealing that by the six-week mark, the game had reached 6,000 Steam reviews and earned itself an Overwhelmingly Positive rating (which, across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all reviews</a>, it still holds at time of writing).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nine-sols-sales-800k-explosion.jpg?itok=knOIaziU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nine-sols-sales-800k-explosion.jpg?itok=ya2byuep 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell 800,000 copies across all platforms since launching last year.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>, it's a 2D action platformer with heavy Metroidvania elements created by Taiwanese studio Red Candle Games, best known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devotion-removed-from-steam-amid-outcry-over-winnie-pooh-reference" rel="nofollow">controversial</a>&nbsp;horror adventure game&nbsp;<em>Devotion</em>.</p>

<p>The game revolves around Yi, who must seek out the titular nine Sols in order to take their Sol Seals. His true motivations are unclear at the outset of the game, but become clearer as the plot progresses.</p>

<p>Yi also befriends a young human child by the name of Shuanshuan at the start of&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>, and it's his relationship with Shuanshuan that informs his character development and reveals more about the world in which the game takes place.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>is a Metroidvania, that might not be the best attitude with which to approach it; you can think of it more as a semi-linear platformer that takes influence from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice" rel="nofollow">Sekiro</a>&nbsp;</em>than as a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a>-style sprawling and interconnected experience.</p>




<p>If you'd like to give&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>a go (and I'd recommend you do so), you can check it out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/nine-sols/9N3LGKGF3CC2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nine-sols-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. It's well worth your time.</p>

In addition to adding support for the new console, the app includes new options for managing and limiting a child’s access to the Switch 2’s GameChat feature, and provides more details on what games they have been playing.</p><p>With parental control limits activated, “It’s only possible for players under 16 to use GameChat with friends who have been approved by their parent or guardian,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fmobile-apps%2Fparental-controls%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOooRiJLZdgZyK9geaRT8U-xRryWWd1C5eh_GeEgrZ7JmsTxUgf8k" rel="sponsored">according to a support page</a> on Nintendo’s website. Parents or guardians will also be able to add notes in the app for each of their child’s friends if they need a reminder about who those contacts are. The app will also provide a detailed history of who children use GameChat with and for how long.</p><p>Nintendo is being especially restrictive when it comes to kids using GameChat’s video capabilities and a camera. “Permission is required from a parent or guardian every time younger players want to use video chat to ensure family rules about use of video sharing are followed.” When a player under 16 starts a video chat, a request will be sent to the parental controls app that needs to be approved before the chat can begin.</p><p>Earlier this week, Nintendo also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676287/nintendo-switch-2-mobile-app-screenshots-backup-upload">updated its Nintendo Switch App</a> ahead of the new console’s arrival with new features that make it much easier to upload screenshots and videos to a mobile device, as well as expanded functionality for the Switch 2 editions of <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There is no way to play two-player co-op. We’ve already reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-massive-steam-launch-tarnished-by-mixed-user-reviews-over-lack-of-duos-co-op-voice-chat"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign’s ‘mixed’ Steam user review rating</u></a>, with most of the complaints revolving around a lack of a duos option as well as no voice chat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing Elden Ring Nightreign solo is proving to be a particularly difficult experience. As explained in IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign review</u></a>: "Let’s get the most important caveat out of the way first: if you are hoping to tackle Nightreign entirely solo, and are anything less than a hardcore Elden Ring player that actively seeks out ways to make that already difficult game even more challenging, Nightreign isn’t for you. Yes, there is technically a single-player option, but it is so poorly balanced that I would be shocked if it isn’t patched and adjusted within the first month of release. And this is coming from someone who lives and breathes these types of games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems FromSoftware is moving fast to address solo play. According to the early patch notes, below, next week’s update will add the effect "Automatic Revival Upon Defeat,” which allows revival once per night boss battle, to solo expeditions, and will increase the amount of runs gained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No doubt this patch will just be the start of Elden Ring Nightreign’s balance journey as FromSoftware reacts to fan feedback. It has also suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players">it will release a duos mode for the game at some point in the future</a>, although there’s no timeframe for that.</p><div id="top-25-fromsoftware-bosses" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3><h3>Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite these issues, Elden Ring Nightreign has enjoyed a massive launch on Steam, with an incredible 313,593 peak concurrent users on Steam overnight.
