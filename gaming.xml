		<p>Trams. The trains of the streets. Once a staple of British cities, first as horsedrawn trams and eventually electricity as the dominant power method, the rise of the motorcar and busses (and even trolley busses) saw basically all of our tram tracks ripped up by the 1960s. Now they’re oddities with limited routes in Croydon, Manchester, Nottingham, Edinburgh and a few other cities in the UK.</p>
<p>Over on the continent, though? Well, Vienna’s trams are iconic, and there’s large networks in Cologne, Berlin, Milan, Budapest and beyond that never went away, living alongside busses, metros and trains. They often have the best of all worlds, serving inner cities, having large raised platforms, and minimal air pollution.</p>
<p>So anyway, trams are pretty neat if you’re a public transport user, and the team at ViewApp agree. A few years on from the TramSim games, they’ve now released City Transport Simulator: Tram, bringing the game out of Steam Early Access this week.</p>
<p><iframe title="City Transport Simulator: Tram - Out Now! (PEGI)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iwU99WshX2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>I’ll be honest, the simulator craze has largely passed me by, but I’ve got childhood memories of catching trams in Vienna or Budapest on holiday, and there’s always a tram ride or two each year at Gamescom. but City Transport Simulator: Tram doesn’t take you to any of the real cities. Instead, there’s the German/Austrian-like fictional city of Tramau.</p>

<p>As the intro cinematic tells you, this city has always had plenty of trams, but as the years have gone by, the network has lost some of its vim and vigour. So the mayor has bought trams from all over the world to turn Tramau into the living tram museum of a tram-lover’s dreams.</p>

<p>The career mode gives you the whole network of trams to manage, with limited resources to start that you need to build up as you craft a hustling, bustling public transport network, customising the tram liveries along the way. You’ll obviously be able to drive the trams as well, like you’re a CEO on Undercover Boss or something.</p>
<p>But you don’t have to engage with that management side of things if you’d rather just drive some trams. Once you’ve completed the tutorial that runs you through the basics, you can easily just pick a tram and route to drive, or have the game pick for you with a Quick Play option.</p>
<p>Driving a tram is pretty straightforward. You’re on tracks, so all you have to worry about there is setting the throttle, minding the speed limits and traffic lights (there’s tram-specific lights at many junctions), and coming to a stop for each station. You’ll quickly get the hang of pulling away from a station or junction, quickly toggling the throttle back to neutral to manage the top speed, and then slowing at the station to hit the mark. I do wish it was a little more naunced, though. Especially on keyboard, it feels very digital and having some additional throttle stops for 25% and 50% would help with that more graceful arrival into a station or maintaining a speed through a curve or hill.</p>

<p>I also wish there was a little more of a helping hand in certain key areas. You can settle for simplified controls that peel away needing to fuss with doors and signalling, but it would be great to have distant traffic lights highlighted and enlarged in the UI. You have the speed limits in the speedometer, and can zoom your view quite a lot, but I missed a bunch of overhead traffic lights on my first couple efforts.</p>
<p>The game has that rather clean and pristine look that you’ll be used to from simulator games, but aside from the trams that have been recreated in fine detail, I like the look of Tramau as a place. It really captures the feel of a European city, with the pastel rendered buildings, the blocks of buildings, the mix of classic architecture and modern flat faces, the narrower streets, the way that tram tracks and car lanes blend together and separate. It’s a great stand-in for the many cities that have these tram networks.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a lot of Vienna that the game is trying to mimic. Depending on the version of the game you get – from £20 Standard Edition to the £40 Collector’s Edition – there’s up to 7 trams, and over half of them are from the Viennese network, including the modern vehicles and the classic E1, which looks as old and retro as you’d hope.</p>

<p>You’ll mainly be looking around the driver’s cabin of each, and there’s all the buttons and toggles that you’d expect. More than you’ll typically need, to be fair, so there’s interactive toggles for heating and defrosting the windscreen on the old E1. Mostly it’s just drive, signalling and managing the doors for people to get on and off. Also some quick camera view swaps from cockpit to passenger area and a follow cam.</p>
<p>Disappointingly, I ran into some slightly annoying bugs in my first little foray with the game. Setting a name for my person, I couldn’t call him ‘Stefan Strassenbahn’ getting a complaint about using special characters, even without the ß. But that’s fine. More frustrating were instances where the simulation broke down. At one semi-pedestrianised station, pedestrians would just walk into my stationary tram and clip through before disappearing into nothingness, so that every time I tried to drive off, I’d get a warning about hitting people. Coming to the final stop, all the traffic (including another tram up ahead of me) was completely stuck in place despite the lights cycling multiple times. Bored, I stepped out of the driver’s cabin, the tram started moving on its own, and I was clipped outside of it. Then the game crashed.</p>
<p>That’s more than a few rough edges that I’d have hoped the stint in Early Access would have helped to stamp out. It’s a shame, because what’s there feels like it should really appeal to tram and sim enthusiasts. With a few patches, this could still become a tram-filled paradise.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-sims-1-and-2-re-released-for-franchises-25th-anniversary.1097160/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-sims-1-and-2-re-released<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has shadow-dropped re-releases for&nbsp;<em>The Sims 1&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>2&nbsp;</em>as part of the franchise's 25th anniversary, and you can pick both of them up right now on PC.</p>

<p>Starting from today,&nbsp;<em>The Sims Legacy Collection&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Sims 2 Legacy Collection&nbsp;</em>are both available on PC via Steam, Epic, and the EA app, although you will need to install and use EA's proprietary software on Steam and Epic to play them.</p>

<p>Both packs bundle in&nbsp;the base games and all of the expansions released for both of them throughout their lifetimes, as well as&nbsp;<em>Sims 4</em>-themed bonus content to sweeten the deal. It's a deal that might need quite a bit of sweetening, too, given that the first&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>&nbsp;will set you back $20 and the second will cost $30 (although there's also a $40 bundle).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sims-1-and-2-re-released-sims-2.jpg?itok=bh8deMti 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sims-1-and-2-re-released-sims-2.jpg?itok=vcPPqQbh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can now say "sul sul" to the first two&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>games on PC.</figcaption></figure><p>Aside from the included bonus content, it seems like these aren't remasters of&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Sims 2</em>, but re-releases, which means you shouldn't expect too much in the way of revamped visuals and gameplay.</p>

<p>Still, if you're looking for some nostalgic retro thrills and you're yearning for a return to the days when not everything in&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>was sold via DLC or microtransaction, then you'll definitely want to pick these re-releases up.</p>

<p>You can check out the (rather disturbing) launch trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Sims 2&nbsp;</em>right here. Be aware that it contains at least one clown.</p>




<p>These re-releases harken back to a simpler time, when the direction EA was taking with&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>was perhaps a bit simpler and more conventional.</p>

<p>Back in September, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5" rel="nofollow">revealed that it has no plans</a> to create&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5&nbsp;</em>anytime soon, and that the focus is instead on creating more content for&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4</em>, as well as updating the game to ensure it keeps up with modern standards.</p>

<p>If you wish the series would return to traditional flagship games rather than this live service-adjacent model, then it looks like&nbsp;<em>The Sims 1&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>2</em>'s re-releases may be where you get your money's worth. They're both available now on Steam, Epic, and the EA app.</p>

The post-launch update and DLC schedule for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> slightly discombobulates me, because the image above is weirdly reminiscent of Civ 7's own historical Age progression screens. But that uncanny similarity also pleases me, because I can now do the intro joke "all roadmaps lead to Rome".* 
</p>
<p>
In case you missed it, the new 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> jobbo is out 11th February. Developers Firaxis have now sketched out plans for updating it, which extend from the usual balancing and bug fixes to a variety of new map types, possible multiplayer features and Age settings.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All that's from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/508445172204306615?l=english">a Steam post</a> which comments that the developers have "a seemingly endless list of ideas". I too have endless ideas - becoming an expert on toadstools, writing a feature film inspired by both Event Horizon and the Oresteia, inventing the Hammer of Dawn weapon from Gears Of War so that I can write evil slogans on my local football pitch, finishing this news post before 5pm. But as we all know, human beings are not endless, and it's possible some of the Civilization 7 team's grand plans won't come to fruition.
</p>
<p>
"The first set of updates we'll be providing are those that directly target the game as it currently stands," the Steam post comments. "There will be some bugs to fix, plenty of balance changes to make, and we know there are spots in the gameplay and user interface that can be enhanced with any number of quality-of-life improvements. You'll see regular updates from us in all of these areas."
</p>
<p>
Beyond these routine tune-ups, they're prioritising the below "features that didn't quite make it in for our initial launch". They don't have arrival dates, but there are definitely developers working on them.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
- Adding Teams to multiplayer games so we can let you play cooperatively
</p>
<p>
- Expanding to 8 players for multiplayer in all Ages through refinements to our Distant Land system
</p>
<p>
- Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single or double Age games
</p>
<p>
- Providing a wider variety of map types
</p>
<p>
- Adding in hotseat multiplayer
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The post also goes over some of the forthcoming paid additions to the forthcoming nation-nurser. They'll be grouped into themed "content collections" that encompass new leaders, civilisations and wonders of the world - all to be released "over the course of a few months" rather than in one dollop.
</p><p>
The first of these boutique-sounding groupings is the Crossroads of the World collection, which will roll out in March 2025. It'll arrive in two doses, the first of which includes "long-standing favourites" Carthage and Great Britain, plus the new leader Ada Lovelace, "who has a way of mastering a game world unlike any other". Some sort of analog AI revolution, perhaps? The second Crossroads of the World drop adds Simón Bolívar and the all-new civs Bulgaria and Nepal.
</p>
<p>
The full Steam post also discusses the game's victory types, and how they mesh with the new Age system. It's been a while since I properly played Civ - I think Civ 5 was the last one I really sold my soul to. I'm curious to see how Ages change things in practice, though I am disappointed to learn that the new 4X makes use of ye scurvy Denuvo DRM.

<p>If you happen to still play The Sims 1/2 or just happen to have an old save file, EA says that players will be able to bring their old saves into the newly released versions of the game.

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds Release Date—Release Time, Platforms, Editions, and Price]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date%E2%80%94release-time-platforms-editions-and-price.1097145/</guid>

<p>2025 is going to be supersized thanks to the presence of a new Monster Hunter game. Capcom is back with Monster Hunter Wilds, and the monster-slaying sequel has a release date, along with information on its platforms, price, and many more mammoth details.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is looking to outdo the enormous success of 2018’s Monster Hunter World. The franchise has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-series-hits-100-million-in-cumulative-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold millions</a> upon millions of copies and has a worldwide fanbase. It might be because it’s Capcom, or possibly because slaying oversized creatures after a minutes-long struggle is exhilarating—and few do it better.</p>



<p>It’s probably safe to say Monster Hunter Wilds is one of 2025’s biggest games, and I wanna dive into the good stuff.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-release-date">Monster Hunter Wilds Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’re a bit big. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds has a February 28 release date.</strong></p>



<p>This means it’s coming into direction competition with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a>, but they’re very different games with unique audiences. <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is one of February 2025’s biggest launches, and its January 28 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> can’t come soon enough!</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-release-time">Monster Hunter Wilds Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>It’s unlikely Monster Hunter Wilds will release simultaneously for everyone, so expect a worldwide midnight launch on release day.</strong></p>



<p>This means New Zealand gets its hands on Monster Hunter first, with America, and other regions, needing to wait a bit longer. The footage and what we’ve seen suggests any extra wait is worth it. Just be sure to <strong>stay off social media for spoilers</strong> as you never know who’s going to leak what details!</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-platforms">Monster Hunter Wilds Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>It’s a full-on current-gen release for Monster Hunter Wilds with PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC launches.</strong></p>



<p>A game with the scale of Monster Hunter Wilds was always going to suggest the PS4 and Xbox One were missing out. It’s sad, given the impact of the two consoles, but they’re quickly becoming outdated and unable to run more modern games with great efficiency. </p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch is also another notable (but expected) omission—but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> could get a port down the line.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-price-amp-editions">Monster Hunter Wilds Price &amp; Editions</h2>



<p><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds Standard Edition is £69.99 and £64.99, whereas you’re looking at $89.99 and £79.99 for the Deluxe Edition, and $109.99 and £99.99 for the luxury of the Premium Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>These are the recommended retail prices and digital figures. If you’re buying a physical edition of Monster Hunter Wilds, online and in-store retailers should have offers and various discounts to bring this eye-watering cost done.</p>



<hr>



<p>How much are you looking forward to hacking and slashing away at monsters? Is there any realm where Capcom fails to deliver on the enormous expectations and hype?</p>



<p>If you can’t wait for Monster Hunter Wilds, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-how-to-join-dates-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Beta</a> might be something you need to check out and get involved with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-1-and-2-return-to-pc-at-last-today-via-the-sims-25th-birthday-bundle<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Maxis are celebrating the 25th anniversary of The Sims franchise with a truly excellent surprise. Today, both The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 are available on PC once again via two Legacy Collections and The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has announced that it's releasing The Sims: Legacy Collection and The Sims 2: Legacy Collection today on PC. The two are available separately as well as combined for $40 in The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Both games include all expansions and <em>almost</em> all stuff packs, as it looks like The Sims 2: Legacy Collection is missing the IKEA Home Stuff pack from 2008. But otherwise, everything's there. In fact, both collections include some bonus content, with The Sims 1 getting something called Throwback Fit Kit and The Sims 2 receiving a Grunge Revival Kit on top of all the other add-ons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA's re-release of the two older The Sims games marks the first time in over a decade that both gave have been readily available to play. The Sims 1 was only ever released on disc, so for years now unless you were able to track down an old physical copy and somehow make it run on a modern Windows machine, there was just no way to get ahold of it (and that doesn't even include the expansion packs!). The Sims 2 was available more recently in 2014 via an Ultimate Collection on EA's Origin store, but the Ultimate Collection was taken down a while ago. So unless you took advantage of it at the time, The Sims 2 remained unavailable to you unless you could similarly find a physical disc. With these two new collections, all four The Sims games are now easily purchaseable and playable again through digital storefronts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/05/the-sims-6">The Sims 1 a 9.5/10</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/10/28/the-sims-2-2">The Sims 2 an 8.5/10</a> waaaaay back in the day when we first reviewed them both. While the series has added numerous new features and ironed out a lot of kinks since then, the originals are still worth checking out for their goofiness, relative simplicity, challenge, and legacy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sims: Legacy Collection and The Sims 2: Legacy Collection are both available now on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and through the EA app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-bloodborne-60fps-patch-says-sony-has-sent-him-a-dmca-takedown-but-why-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The creator of the high-profile Bloodborne 60fps patch has said he’s received a DMCA takedown from Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lance-mcdonald-hacker-story-pt-god-of-war-bloodborne">Well-known video game tinkerer Lance McDonald</a> announced the news in a <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1885347693125566806" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, saying he received a takedown notification on behalf of Sony Interactive Entertainment “asking that I remove links to the patch I posted on the internet, so I've now done so.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McDonald then pointed to one of his <a href="https://youtu.be/i0tqppZDYxw?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube videos</a> on the Bloodborne 60fps patch, which he released in 2021, and recounted a meeting with former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida in which he mentioned he made the 60fps mod for Bloodborne.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I met @yosp and said to him ‘I make mods for PlayStation games’ and he said ‘oh!.’ And I said ‘I made the 60fps mod for Bloodborne’ and he laughed so hard.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne is of course one of the biggest conundrums in the video game industry. The FromSoftware masterpiece launched on PS4 to critical and commercial acclaim, but since then Sony hasn’t touched it. Fans are desperate for an official next-gen patch that would make the game run at 60fps, up from 30fps, but there are also calls for a remaster and a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That leaves it to the likes of McDonald to plug the gap. But more recently, fans managed to get PS4 emulators to deliver something akin to a remaster on PC. The tech experts at <a href="https://youtu.be/-zjzBbdl7hk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry released a video</a> covering “a breakthrough in PS4 emulation” via ShadPS4, which means Bloodborne is now fully playable start to finish in 60fps. Could this breakthrough have triggered an aggressive response from Sony? IGN has asked Sony for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory">Yoshida delivered his Bloodborne no-show theory</a> in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an interview with Kinda Funny Games</u></a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida began. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is Bloodborne remains dormant nearly 10 years after the first game came out. But is there hope? In interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5"><u>Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

If you're willing to try your luck, you can wait for the GPUs to come back in stock which would save you quite a bit compared to buying an entire pre-built PC, and--assuming you snag one in time before they sell out again--potentially get you the new GPU even sooner.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll find listings for the RTX 5080 and 5090 listings at multiple retailers in the links below. They're still sold out at the time of writing, but keep checking to see if they're back in stock. The RTX 5070 isn't available to buy yet, but the "budget" 50-Series GPU is expected to release in February.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Nvidia RTX 50-Series Restock Tracker</h3><ul><li><a href="https://howl.link/mtmjt8revfrlh?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17382497956399?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Best Buy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DVCH9WJH,B0DQSLHSP2,B0DQSMMCSH,B0DTJFSSZG,B0DTYCPM5Y,B0DVCF7XDF,B0DTJF8YT4,B0DTY2P2ZK,B0DTJDR3V9,B0DTJFZ4YS,B0DVCGBPL9&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fpromotions.newegg.com%2Fnvidia%2F25-0017%2Findex.html%3Fcm_sp%3DHomepage-Top2021-_-top-_-nvidia%252F25-0017-_-%252F%252Fpromotions.newegg.com%252Fnvidia%252F25-0017%252F1150x320.jpg%26icid%3D781305&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Falienware-rtx-50-series-gaming-pcs-are-up-for-preorder-for-a-small-fortune%2F1100-6529159%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Newegg</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15324736%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.antonline.com%2Fnvidia%2Fgeforce-rtx50&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Falienware-rtx-50-series-gaming-pcs-are-up-for-preorder-for-a-small-fortune%2F1100-6529159%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Check stock at Antonline</a></li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-world-lego-set-is-discounted-at-amazon-but-probably-not-for-long/1100-6525283/">Super Mario World Lego Set Is Discounted At Amazon, But Probably Not For Long</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-riffmaster-wireless-guitar-controller-gets-rare-discount/1100-6528970/">Fortnite Festival Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller Gets Rare Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-25-on-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-for-nintendo-switch/1100-6524388/">Save 25% On Donkey Kong Country Returns HD For Nintendo Switch</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-chance-to-grab-3-movies-on-4k-blu-ray-for-only-33-at-amazon/1100-6528683/">Last Chance To Grab 3 Movies On 4K Blu-Ray For Only $33 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-ps5-reprint-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6528630/">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Physical Edition Gets PS5 Reprint - Snag It While You Can</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-2500-piece-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-is-now-available-at-amazon/1100-6523747/">The 2,500-Piece Legend Of Zelda Lego Set Is Now Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-lego-sets-are-available-now-check-out-all-six-in-the-launch-lineup/1100-6528603/">Mario Kart Lego Sets Are Available Now - Check Out All Six In The Launch Lineup</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-lego-sets-launch-at-major-retailers-including-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6528629/">Fortnite Lego Sets Launch At Major Retailers, Including Amazon And Walmart</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <p>
A high-profile mod that allows Bloodborne to run at 60fps has been hit by a legal takedown notification from PlayStation, its creator has said. 
</p>
<p>
Noted modder Lance McDonald revealed the legal request from Sony Interactive Entertainment today via a post on social media. 
</p>
<p>
The takedown specifically targets McDonald's famous Bloodborne patch that ups the game's frame-rate, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloodborne-modder-releases-60fps-patch">released back in early 2021</a>. It's unclear why PlayStation has finally decided to take action now, four years later.

"On 21st February 2021, I created and released a patch for Bloodborne which makes the game run at 60fps," McDonald wrote this afternoon.</p>
<p>"Today I received a DMCA takedown notification on behalf of Sony Interactive Entertainment asking that I remove links to the patch I posted on the internet, so I've now done so."
</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted PlayStation for comment.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">On February 21st, 2021, I created and released a patch for Bloodborne which makes the game run at 60fps.

McDonald first announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modder-plans-to-release-a-bloodborne-60fps-patch-but-will-give-sony-a-chance-to-go-first-on-ps5">plans to upgrade Bloodborne's frame-rate</a> by, essentially, hacking the game back in 2020. Initially, however, McDonald held off as hoped Sony would update FromSoftware's beloved Soulslike itself. 
</p>
<p>
However, Sony has never issued a 60fps patch for Bloodborne, or shown any inclination of wanting to do so. Infamously, there's been no word of a PS5 version of the game, either.
</p>
<p>
"There's a real opportunity here for a genuinely crowd-pleasing piece of back-compat magic from Sony," Digital Foundry's John Linneman wrote in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2020-bloodborne-60fps-hack-tested-the-complete-story">deep-dive into how the Bloodborne 60fps patch worked</a> with McDonald himself. "The question is whether the platform holder has any appetite at all to revisit the game."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has issued a DMCA takedown against a fan-made patch that allowed 2015 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>to run at 60FPS, sparking fresh speculation that a remaster of the game could be in the works.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/manfightdragon.bsky.social/post/3lh2cipa4rk2v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">modder Lance McDonald</a>, who's also one of the most prominent members of the&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>community, Sony asked him to "remove links to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dropping-this-month" rel="nofollow">the patch</a> [he] posted on the internet" via DMCA notice, which means it's no longer available for download.</p>

<p>In the replies, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/powerful.crabf.art/post/3lh2eegkh4c2x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">users</a> are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/turbohotdog.bsky.social/post/3lh2eg7nc3s2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speculating</a> that Sony's sudden flurry of activity aimed at the patch could mean that the company is working on its own version of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>that runs at 60FPS.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca-old-hunters.jpg?itok=Q6hcoT7F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca-old-hunters.jpg?itok=n1bloLO- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony has DMCA'd a 60FPS&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>patch, but does that mean anything?</figcaption></figure><p>There is precedent for this standpoint. Back in 2022, Konami <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-leak-dmcad-by-konami" rel="nofollow">issued a DMCA notice</a> against a leak for a then-upcoming&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>game, and that game subsequently turned out to be&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill: The Short Message</em>, so that DMCA was issued in order for Konami to get ahead of the leaks.</p>

<p>Of course, the obvious (and unfortunate) fallacy in the argument is that companies don't always issue DMCA takedowns because they're planning on creating something similar to what's been taken down.</p>

<p>Studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-2-dmcas-gta-mods-save-file" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> are extremely <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-issues-another-wave-of-dmcas-for-gta-mods" rel="nofollow">au fait</a> with DMCA takedown notices, and often, those takedowns are issued simply because the company is protective of its IP and doesn't want anyone else coming within sniffing distance of making money from that IP.</p>

<p>It's entirely possible that Sony has only just become aware of the&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>60FPS patch and that it has no intention of doing anything with the IP; it just doesn't want anyone else doing anything with it either.</p>




<p>It's a shame if the DMCA is purely for IP protection reasons, because&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster is frequently requested by fans thanks to the game's popularity (as well as its relatively shoddy performance in its current state).</p>

<p>Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-february-2023-here-are-all-news-announcements" rel="nofollow">has been known</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-january-2024-recap-heck-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals" rel="nofollow">hold State of Play presentations</a> around this time of year, though, so with all that said, it is possible we could be about to learn that a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster is indeed in the works.</p>

<p>For now, you'll have to content yourself with <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/bloodborne/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">picking up the original on PS4</a>. It's also playable on PS5 via backwards compatibility, of course.</p>

That hasn’t been DMCA’d. Yet.</p><p><em>Bloodborne</em> has languished for a decade now with no meaningful official upgrades on PS4 Pro, PS5, or PS5 Pro. It never got a remaster or even a PC port. Fans have waiting patiently for a sequel to the FromSoftware action game, but not even a whiff of one has ever materialized. Ex-PlayStation veteran Shuhei Yoshida <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-2-remake-remaster-miyazaki-sequel-1851741356&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-2-remake-remaster-miyazaki-sequel-1851741356">recently speculated</a></span> that Sony is waiting until original director Hidetaka Miyazaki is ready to continue the spin-off series, and the timing has just never worked out. </p><p>But then Sony does things like this. Why randomly hit a 60FPS mod  that only works on hacked last-gen consoles with a takedown request? Why wait almost four years to do it? Does this suggest Sony might actually have something <em>Bloodborne</em>-related in the works, like a PS5 upgrade that boosts the resolution and framerate on regular modern consoles? Or was Sony somehow just never aware of the project before and only got around to enforcing its copyright just now?</p><p>A chance meeting  looks both funnier and more ominous now in light of the current circumstances: MacDonald tweeted last year that he had just met Yoshida for the first time. “[I] said to him ‘I make mods for PlayStation games’ and he said ‘oh!’” he wrote. “And I said ‘I made the 60fps mod for bloodborne’ and he laughed so hard. Beautiful to meet him, such a wonderful person.” Did Yoshida narc? Or is this another mystery that will drive <em>Bloodborne </em>fans deeper down their conspiratorial rabbit holes? </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A former Midnight Society dev recently revealed that the Studio and devs discovered that Dr Disrespect was being fired at the same time as the world did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HUN2R’s recent post on <a href="https://x.com/HUN2R/status/1885346960766378441" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) sheds some light on conversations between Midnight Society’s Director of Technical Product, Rich Cabrera, and the fans. After the news about the studio shutting down was confirmed, multiple members of the community asked why they let Dr. Disrespect go. Cabrera answered that the decision was not in the hands of the “studio and devs” and that the “leadership” made it. They found out at the same time that we did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same thread, Cabrera was also asked why the Studio didn’t release an NFT token, which might have saved them from closing down. Cabrera confirmed they were working on a Token and conversing with a launch platform. However, the shutdown came too soon, leaving them no time to execute this plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those unaware, Midnight Society recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/midnight-society-has-announced-its-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it is cancelling its NFT-backed extraction shooter, DEADROP. Hence, it is seeking other gaming studios to offer employment opportunities to its talented team members. Dr Disrespect founded the development studio; however, the allegations surrounding the streamer last year led to Midnight Society cutting ties with him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Dr. Disrespect is streaming for Rumble and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-run-rumble-head-of-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping them run the platform</a>. Here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-first-stream-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his side of the story</a> on last year’s allegations. What do you think about Midnight Society’s devs being as unaware as we are of Dr. Disrespect’s decision?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

                <p>As part of The Sims series' 25th anniversary celebration, developer Maxis has <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/the-birthday-bundle" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that The Sims and The Sims 2 are once again available to purchase on PC. The reveal comes after a handful of subtle teases by the studio, and heavy speculation from fans. Both games will be available to purchase separately, with The Sims: Legacy Collection retailing for $20 and The Sims 2: Legacy Collection coming in at $30. Those looking to purchase both games can pick up The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle, which combines them for the slightly discounted price of $40.</p><p>In addition to a whole lot of nostalgia, each game comes with every expansion released for the title, as well as select packs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spider-man-2-pc-port-bad-reviews<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2&nbsp;</em>has officially hit PC, and fans are flocking to Steam to express their dissatisfaction with what they see as an unsatisfactory port, citing extensive technical issues.</p>

<p>The game landed on Steam yesterday, and a quick look at its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reviews on the platform</a> shows a Mixed rating across almost 2,000 reviews (at time of writing), which isn't a great look for a first-party Sony game that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-pass-548-milion-units-marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies" rel="nofollow">sold gangbusters</a> on PlayStation and serves as one of the company's flagship titles.</p>

<p>Common themes have emerged across the negative reviews, too. One user <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047951793/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> that calling the port "rough" would be "an understatement", pointing to improperly-loaded features like lighting, extra-slow framerates, and regular freezes and stutters, which <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/RootyBlues/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">other users</a> have also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199237301221/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">complained about</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-port-negative-reviews-city.jpg?itok=342RL_r5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-port-negative-reviews-city.jpg?itok=qq17ncnN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2&nbsp;</em>is picking up some bad reviews on PC.</figcaption></figure><p>For what it's worth, some reviewers are <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198276342581/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">saying</a> that they've been able to get the game running with relatively <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/GeneralKamo/recommended/2651280/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">few problems</a>, so it seems the crashes and bugs aren't affecting all players equally.</p>

<p>Still, though, enough players are complaining about technical issues with&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>'s PC port that I'd imagine Sony will issue an emergency patch in the next few days to address some of the more common problems.</p>

<p>The timing of this issue is particularly unfortunate for Sony. Just a couple of days ago, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-psn-account-requirement-incentives" rel="nofollow">walked back its PSN requirement</a> for certain PC single-player games, including&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>, promising incentives for those games if you linked a PSN account.</p>

<p>It's a move that's bound to garner goodwill from the PC gaming community given just how <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack" rel="nofollow">unpopular mandatory PSN accounts are</a> with those folks, but low-quality PC ports like this one apparently is will probably do a lot to erase that goodwill.</p>

<p>Shang Chi actor reveals that his dream has been to bring Sleeping Dogs to the big screen and then a sequel that players have been hoping for for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>zengames44 recently tagged Simu Liu on <a href="https://x.com/zengames44/status/1884321313923424362" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, asking if he’s working behind the scenes to bring one of the fan-favourite games to the movies. To everyone’s surprise, Simu Liu replied to the post, stating that he is already “Working with the rights holders to bring Sleeping Dogs to the big screen.” However, fans are a bit confused, as it was shared during a recent interview that the Sleeping Dogs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donnie-yen-sleeping-dogs-movie-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">movie is dead</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly, in a <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/1885252869483340236" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent post</a>, Simu Liu doubled down on his plans with Sleeping Dogs, discussing his dreams for the franchise. Liu shared that only some movies can make it from the “pitch phase to greenlight” and that “it has been tiring” pitching the film to executives who do not understand the game. However, his dream remains: “First a movie, then a sequel game for everyone.”</p>



<p>“Sleeping Dogs,” released in 2012, was developed by United Front Games and published by Square Enix. Fans quickly fell in love with the game’s open-world setting, which allows players to explore a vibrant and bustling city set in Hong Kong. The combat and parkour mechanics are well-designed and intuitive, enhancing the overall experience. Additionally, the story centred around the Triads, the impressive visuals for a game from 2012, and the high-quality soundtrack were all standout features.</p>

A full campaign in Civilization 7 is one that goes through all three Ages: Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern. Once the Age is completed, all players (and any AI opponents) experience an Age Transition simultaneously. During an Age Transition, three things happen: you select a new civilization from the new Age to represent your empire, you choose which Legacies you want to retain in the new Age, and the game world evolves. The Civilization games have never had such a system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beach then explained why Firaxis chose Small as the default map size for Civilization 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know that many veteran Civ players love to play on the largest map size and see the maximum number of empires battle it out,” he said. “However, there's a very deliberate reason that we chose Small as the default map size. With three other empires on your home continent, and a few more to discover later in the game, Small Maps make for a very comfortable experience while you are learning the ins and outs of Civ 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We especially recommend this map size as you get your feet wet with our new Diplomacy system. Tracking your relationship and ongoing diplomatic activities with a manageable number of opponents makes it way easier to get the hang of how you want to spend and manage your Diplomatic Influence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We also recommend sticking with Continents Plus for your Map Type selection. The extra islands just off-shore help ease you into the ocean exploration – a key element of the Exploration Age, the second chapter of our game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Tutorial and Advisors, Beach confirmed that when you launch into your first game of Civilization 7, it turns the Tutorial on for you. He also strongly recommended Civ pros play with the Tutorial on, at least for their first full game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Tutorial is designed to provide tips and explanations exactly when you first encounter something new,” Beach explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fans experienced with earlier Civ titles may scoff at the idea of playing with the Tutorial on, but with so many of our game systems having received upgrades and revisions, we really do recommend sticking with the Tutorial for your first full campaign through our three Ages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Keep in mind that the game has four different Advisors, and you can control which ones are actively leading you through a series of quests to teach you their portion of the game. If it's too much to take in all at once, we suggest listening to only a single Advisor at a time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even after you’ve mastered enough systems to turn the tutorial off, you should switch to the setting Only Warnings, Beach recommended.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This setting allows these same Advisors to jump in and warn you if your empire's progress is about to undergo a major setback,” he said. “Even our internal team at Firaxis that knows this game so well plays with these warnings enabled!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overnight, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-post-launch-roadmap-reveals-free-and-paid-content-updates-for-2025">Firaxis unveiled <u>Civilization 7</u>’s post-launch roadmap</a> as part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKbxcOGKINE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a special livestream event</u></a> (Great Britain has been relegated to DLC). Civilization 7 itself launches on PC via Steam, on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S on February 11, although the more expensive Deluxe Edition grants access from February 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Player First Games and WB Games have <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that MultiVersus will be shut down on May 30 and that Season 5's content update will be its last one. Along with the server closure, MultiVersus will also be delisted from all digital storefronts.</p><p>Season 5 starts on Feruary 4 and is adding two new characters to the roster:DC's Aquaman and Looney Tunes' Lola Bunny. They'll both be unlockable through gameplay, with Aquaman as a battle pass reward and Lola as a daily calendar login reward.</p><p>Online features will be available through Season 5 until May 30 at 9 AM PT. Afterwards, MultiVersus will have an option for local gameplay, either solo with AI-controlled opponents or up to three other players. However, in order to do so, you'll need to download the new update between February 4 at 9 AM PT and May 30 at 9 AM PT. With that installed, you'll then need to log in so that a local save file can be created with your unlocked and purchased content.</p><p>Starting today, January 31, players can no longer use real-world money to purchase Gleamium, which is MultiVersus' in-game currency. However, those who still have Gleamium or character tokens can use them.</p><p>MultiVersus first launched into open beta in 2022 and then taken down for a period of time after a year, so this isn't the first time the game experienced some sort of interruption. It then came back fully released in 2024 with new content. It's an all-star platform brawler similar to Super Smash Bros. It features characters from across various WB properties, including DC, Looney Tunes, and Cartoon Network.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/multiversus-review-a-super-smash-hit/1900-6417930/" data-ref-id="1900-6417930">MultiVersus review,</a> we said, "Warner Bros' all-star battle proves to be a worthy contender to the platform fighter throne."</p>
