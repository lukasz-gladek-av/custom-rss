            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fellowship-is-a-co-op-multiplayer-game-focused-on-mmo-like-dungeon-runs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, publisher Arc Games announced a new co-op multiplayer game called Fellowship. Developed by newly established studio Chief Rebel (composed of industry veterans who worked on World of Warcraft, Diablo, Helldivers, Battlefield, The Division, Just Cause, and more), Fellowship is described by the team as a 'MODA': a multiplayer online dungeon adventure. Effectively, it is focused on MMO-like dungeon runs, cutting all the space in-between that type of content.</p>
<p>Axel Lindberg, CEO and Game Director at Chief Rebel, said:</p>
<p><em>We're very excited to introduce Fellowship, a passion project that we’ve been working on for a long time since we formed Chief Rebel. With Fellowship, we took inspiration from many games that we love to create a dungeon adventure that lets players jump right into the best part of MMOs and ARPGs, end-game dungeons, right from the start with ease. Fellowship will be a constantly evolving adventure and we want players of it from the very beginning, so we can’t wait for players to join us for our Closed Alpha playtest!</em></p>
<p>Yoon Im, CEO of Arc Games, stated:</p>
<p><em>Fellowship marks the beginning of a new genre that aims to modernize the traditional MMO gameplay experience, making it a potential game changer in our industry. We are thrilled to leverage our extensive online multiplayer and MMO expertise to support Chief Rebel on this ambitious new video game. The Closed Alpha test is just the beginning for Fellowship, as we have a lot of incredible content and features to unveil as we look toward a PC launch next year.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Fellowship | Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lxmwWiKew20?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As you'd expect, the so-called Holy Trinity (Tank, Healer, and DPS) of roles is in full display here. According to Chief Rebel, the dungeon runs will be 'endlessly scaling'. Also, unlike regular MMOs, players will choose from established heroes. In the Closed Alpha playtest due to take place between August 15 and 21, players will be able to choose between six heroes (two Tank, two DPS, and two Healers).</p>
<p>Dungeon runs will be divided into Adventure and Ranked. The former will be a bite-sized experience that lasts 10 to 15 minutes, whereas Ranked dungeons last 30 minutes and also register the results on a competitive leaderboard.</p>
<p>You may register for the Closed Alpha playtest on the official <a href="https://www.playfellowship.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>.</p>

            <p>Obsidian's first-person action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Avowed is one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-75-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2024">75 most anticipated games of 2024</a>, but according to a report, it's been booted back into early 2025 to avoid a "very busy period" on Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service. Thanks, Microsoft. Do you know how long it took to cobble together that 2024 list? I still get hand cramps.</p><!--more-->
<p>The report in question is from The Verge's Tom Warren - as sturdy a source as they come. Writing on his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211199/microsoft-teams-new-ui-chat-xbox-employees-studio-d-notepad">Notepad blog</a> (paywall), Warren claimed that Avowed is in "good shape", and that the delay is "more a matter of wanting to give the game breathing room during a very busy period for Xbox Game Pass".</p>
<p>Obsidian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidian-accidentally-reveals-an-avowed-release-date-before-deleting-it">accidentally let slip a 12th November release date for Avowed</a> in June in a developer blog. On Game Pass, that would have put it up against Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (19th November) and the much-delayed post-apocalyptic shooter Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl (20th November). I'm not convinced that qualifies as a "very busy period".</p>
<p>Outside Game Pass, it would have to reckon with Assassin's Creed Shadows (15th November) and, perhaps most worryingly for Obsidian, BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard (not dated yet, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-wont-arrive-before-october-1st">due to land in EA's third quarter 2024</a>, after 1st October).</p>
<p>Avowed could probably do with a bit of distance from anything comparably bulky and shiny with "action" or "RPG" in the job description. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-avowed-details-its-a-classless-rpg-with-easy-respeccing-and-open-zones-comparable-to-outer-worlds">A classless RPG with easy respeccing and "open zones"</a>, once pitched as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-was-originally-pitched-as-obsidians-take-on-skyrim">Obsidian's Skyrim</a>, it still feels to me like it's trudging through a No Man's Land between Obsidian's prior Pillars Of Eternity CRPGs, which are set in the same universe, and the more recent first-person Outer Worlds.</p>
<p>As with all current fantasy RPGs, it must also reckon with (perhaps unfair) expectations created by last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, whose spell and ability combos knock what I've seen of Avowed's combat alchemy into a cocked hat. I do like the looks of the game, but I'm not exhilarated.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As we approach the final fixtures for Rainbow Six Siege’s category at the Esports World Cup, we’re preparing to soak up some <strong>intense </strong>matches. This weekend, the grand final will take place, but before then, six more teams will be eliminated. As Rainbow Six Siege is so popular as an esports game, it has found a prestigious spot at the Esports World Cup, and there’s a massive $750,000 prize waiting for the number-one team.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-everything-to-play-for">Everything to Play For</h2>



<p>It has been a phenomenal event thus far. In the opening stages, we saw some teams suffer immeasurably at the hands of heartbreak, particularly those from the United Kingdom, with Into the Breach and Wolves Esports falling short of qualifying for the latter stages. Wolves took up the bottom-most place in the tournament, ending up in sixteenth after failing to secure a single win during the group stage.</p>



<p>The frontrunners have now been established, though. Both FaZe Clan and DarkZero managed to hang on through intense lower-bracket runs that saw them clinch the final spots in the playoffs, but the likes of Team BDS, Team Liquid, and Spacestation have put on monumental showings thus far.</p>



<p>Here are the opening fixtures for the Rainbow Six playoffs at the Esports World Cup:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team Liquid vs. DarkZero</li>



<li>Bleed vs. w7m Esports</li>



<li>Team BDS vs. FaZe Clan</li>



<li>FURIA vs. Spacestation</li>
</ul>



<p>This round weighs heavily in the favour of the Brazilian teams, and they’ve traditionally been fantastic on the grandest stages in Rainbow Six esports. However, there’s no denying the talents shown by the likes of Spacestation and Team BDS so far this tournament, which means we could see an EU or a North American team crowned the ultimate victor.</p>



<p>The playoffs are due to start today, and by Sunday, we’ll have our winner.</p>

<p>Guild Esports, one of the most prolific organisations in the United Kingdom, has reported deepening financial woes in a recent update. With a warning being issued to shareholders, Guild Esports has advised that the firm has less than £25,000 ($31,000) left on hand. This unfortunate news comes following the revelation that Guild’s share price had bottomed out at a record-low.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-explore-the-options">Explore the Options</h2>



<p>In a statement, Guild Esports’ representatives advised shareholders that it was seeking additional funding to stay afloat:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The company is actively exploring a range of options to meet its short-term liabilities. These include securing additional funding, negotiating improved payment terms with creditors, and further cost reduction initiatives.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Guild Esports has long been represented by David Beckham, who came on board as an investor and an ambassador, appearing in commercials and promotional materials for the brand. Recent reports highlighted that while his share value in the firm has dwindled, he has made bank as an influencer attached to the Guild Esports label.</p>



<p>In the recent financial update, it was revealed that Guild Esports has ‘burned through’ £26 million ($33 million) in just three years, while at the same time ‘only’ pulling in around £14 million in revenue. The organisation hasn’t been the most successful in the esports space, and despite a solid following, it hasn’t managed to grow too big in the industry.</p>



<p>Time will tell what decisions the board will make to right the ship, but for now, it looks as though a major shift in the form of a merger might be the only thing that’ll save Guild.</p>

<p>It was revealed a good while ago that Henry Cavill is taking a starring role in a Warhammer 40,000 film – but since that news was announced, there have been some issues pushing the project forward. In a recent financial update, Games Workshop discussed these blockers, addressing the fact that both GW and Amazon have just six months to agree on creative guidelines before the project is assumedly shut down.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-the-air">In The Air</h2>



<p>Back in December, Games Workshop revealed a partnership with Amazon that would last 12 months, during which the two firms would need to decide on creative guidelines for both the Warhammer film <strong>and </strong>a television series. However, one of the tighter stipulations of this contract was that these productions would <strong>only </strong>proceed if agreements could be made. Otherwise, they won’t even make it out of the starting gate.</p>



<p>Speaking on the project a while ago, Henry Cavill, one of the world’s most prolific actors and a lifelong gamer, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I have loved Warhammer since I was boy, making this moment truly special for me. The opportunity to shepherd this cinematic universe from its inception is quite the honor and the responsibility. I couldn’t be more grateful for all the hard work put in by Vertigo, Amazon and Games Workshop to make this happen. One step closer to making a nigh-on lifelong dream come true.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-have-until-dec-2024-to-agree-creative-guidelines-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-film-and-tv-series-or-they-wont-happen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> for the quote</em></p>



<p>Games Workshop has been growing in leaps and bounds in recent months, picking up solid profits and expanding worldwide. The push to produce a Warhammer movie and a television series is a logical one, and partnering with Amazon to get it done is shrewd. Earlier this year, Prime Video saw the arrival of the Fallout TV series, and it became the second-largest launch on the platform <strong>ever</strong>. </p>



<p>Games Workshop advised that they’ll provide an update shortly, but with fewer than six months left to work out the intricacies of the project, some fans are getting itchy…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/konami-reports-record-profits-whats-next/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Konami has just released a financial update covering Q1 FY25 (April 1 – June 30), and the numbers are looking good. In the breakdown, it was revealed that the company reached record-breaking peaks in this opening quarter of FY25, with sales being boosted by up to 24% year-over-year. </p>



<p>Speaking to what’s coming next, Konami outlined the road ahead, detailing the top-tier titles coming as part of a hefty content roadmap that includes some real heavy hitters.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-konami-on-top">Konami On Top</h2>



<p>In the financial update, the firm revealed that digital sales were up 33.4% year-on-year, with special praise being given to eFootball 2024 as a leader in the space. The Japanese titan also confirmed that the 25th-anniversary celebrations of Yu-Gi-Oh! have been remarkably well received, and the sale of merchandise is continuing in earnest. </p>



<p>This diversification will continue to be driven by the firm going forward. In a segment of the financial update, <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20240801046/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Konami reiterated</a> what’s on the horizon, including the remake of Silent Hill 2 (coming October 8) and the launch of an all-new title, CYGNI, on August 6. The latter title is a side-scrolling shooter that aims to bring the somewhat antiquated genre into the modern age.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Konami is still preparing to release the likes of:</p>



<ul>
<li>Suikoden I&amp;II HD Remaster</li>



<li><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta</strong></li>



<li>Silent Hill f</li>



<li>Silent Hill: Townfall</li>
</ul>



<p>There are some busy days ahead for Konami, but the future is looking bright.</p>

<p>As Gamescom kicks off in Cologne later this month, Sid Meier’s Civilization VII will be revealed in much greater depth, with the team at Firaxis showing off 20 minutes of gameplay in a deep-dive breakdown. It has only been a few weeks since Civ VII was announced, but the team is eager to debut a lengthy gameplay trailer at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony to stoke the hype train a little more.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-that-s-not-all">But That’s Not All</h2>



<p>The Firaxis team also confirmed that Civilization VII will be playable during the week that Gamescom is hosted in Cologne. From August 21 to 25, attendees will be able to give the game a try.</p>



<p>As Insider Gaming will be on-site at Gamescom, you can bet your last dollar we’ll be giving the game a go.</p>



<p>Here’s <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/289070/announcements/detail/4362384060804271093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blurb from Firaxis</a> talking about the upcoming release of the gameplay trailer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Civilization&nbsp;is a game that is as wide as it is deep, covering the span of human history as you build your empire piece by piece in the attempt to stand the test of time. We know many of you love getting into the details, and we do too – that’s why we’re going all-out for the gameplay reveal coming later this month.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following Gamescom, Civilization VII will head to PAX West in Seattle, complete with a full-fledged developer panel breaking down everything you need to know about the game. If you’re not already in the know, Civilization is one of the oldest strategy-slash-city-building franchises in existence – and one of the longest-running video game series still going today. It debuted in 1991 and is still going strong as we speak.</p>



<p>Put that in your calendar – on August 20, all will be revealed.</p>

As you roam the realm and fend off attackers, you will encounter various nations and leaders vying for your attention, and it is up to each player to weigh up which force can truly be trusted to fight by their side.</p><p dir="ltr">From allying with the holy Papal states of Rodinia, one of the oldest theocratic regimes on the continent, to drawing up a treaty with the Union of the Knights' States – a national coalition made up of 13 powerful military states – each new ally you declare will have an impact on both your town and the land, bringing a new host of narrative consequences. Can you trust the ancient religious powers to bring peace to the land? Or will long-set corruption be their downfall?</p><p dir="ltr">In a nice touch, individual decisions affect the evolution of your town and how your tale unfolds, adding a welcome layer of dynamism and player agency to Sword of Convallaria’s rich and winding storyline.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4336420-swordofconvallariaimage1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336420" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4336420-swordofconvallariaimage1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336420"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4336420-swordofconvallariaimage1.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Declare your allegiance</h3><p dir="ltr">No matter how much you grow to love the story, you can only hope to reign victorious with the right allies by your side. Unlike in many games in the genre, Sword Of Convallaria’s tactics don’t just extend to the battlefield. As you journey through Iria, a mineral-rich country whose magical resources have drawn unwanted attention from dangerous external factions, you will need to form alliances with other formidable powers to keep your town safe.</p><p dir="ltr">In Sword of Convallaria, the world is shaped by your choices, with your actions determining the fate of Iria and its loyal citizens. Placed in the leather boots of a rising mercenary leader, it’s up to players to win over hearts and minds across the land with both their words and their swords. While you can recruit individual party members by plying them with ale at local taverns, it’s the more weighty factional alliances that will truly help you to turn the tide of war.</p><p dir="ltr">As you recruit and train a roster of lovable and roguish mercenaries, you will find yourself toiling over each agonizing narrative-affecting decision as you attempt to save the great nation of Iria from invading forces.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4336419-swordofconvallariaimage2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336419" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4336419-swordofconvallariaimage2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336419"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4336419-swordofconvallariaimage2.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Reign Supreme on the battlefield</h3><p dir="ltr">Victory in Convallaria is earned through employing clever strategies throughout engrossing ‘hardcore combat.’ In classic tactical RPG fashion, battles in Sword of Convallaria are fought via turn-based grid-set skirmishes. While the game follows the genre’s traditional ‘rock, paper, scissors’ approach to resistances and weaknesses, there is a unique twist to proceedings that decides which unit acts first. In Sword Of Convallaria, speed is king, with units acting first according to their agility stats, allowing swift units like archers and rogues to seize key strategic locations on the battlefields before their slower opponents.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s not simply speed and might that wins battles here, but cunning, too. In Sword of Convallaria, you can turn the battlefield itself to your advantage, making use of the environment around you to fell even the most fearsome foes. Unlike many tactical RPGs, here the world around you isn’t just set dressing, but another piece of the puzzle to leverage. By cleverly utilizing terrain advantages and objects like wooden crates, gunpowder barrels, and boulders, players can position units on platforms, obstruct enemies, and even outmaneuver unsuspecting foes.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it’s not all down to the battlefield: preparation is also key to ensuring that your army has a fighting chance. Equipping different gear and raising each unit’s stats at taverns between battles is key to building a fearsome legion, with the latest and greatest gear ensuring that you will strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">There you have it. Launching on PC, Android, and iOS on July 31st, this thoughtfully-made tactical RPG looks set to be a modern love letter to a much revered classic genre. Sword of Convallaria looks set to inject the genre with a captivating tale of tactics, twists, and turn-based brilliance.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://soc.xd.com/#/?shortlink=yoe4d8r6&amp;c=Native%20Article&amp;pid=Fandom&amp;source_caller=bulk" rel="nofollow ">Click here to download the game now.</a></p>

                <p>Nintendo will soon be adding another beloved Pokemon game to Switch's classic games catalog. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-rescue-team/" data-ref-id="5000-25025">Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team</a> is coming to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service on August 9.</p><p>Originally released for Game Boy Advance back in 2006, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team is a roguelike that casts players in the role of a human who has mysteriously turned into a Pokemon. After meeting a partner Pokemon and establishing a rescue team together, players explore dungeons and embark on various missions to help other Pokemon out and unravel the mystery of their transformation.</p><p>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team was originally released alongside a Blue Rescue Team version for the Nintendo DS. The two games were remade for Nintendo Switch in 2020 as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-rescue-team-dx-coming-to-s/1100-6472626/" data-ref-id="1100-6472626">Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX</a>.</p><p>Once it drops, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon will be available through Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pack plan. This premium tier of the service includes all of the benefits of the base plan along with access to select Nintendo Switch DLC and a library of classic Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis games.</p><p>A base Nintendo Switch Online subscription costs $20 USD a year, while an Expansion Pack membership costs $50 USD a year. Nintendo also offers an annual family plan for $80 that covers up to eight Nintendo Accounts, even across multiple systems.</p>

And<a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2024/05/gamestops-meme-stock-explodes-again-after-youtuber-roaring-kitty-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> like its parent company</a>, EB Games is resorting to some really fuckin weird ways to try to stay in business.</p><p>Such as EB World PLUS, a new premium membership program that is asking people to pay AUD$49 a year to get a ramen bowl, a 5% discount off digital purchases (including most digital currencies and gift cards) and, best of all, a "buy 10 get one free" deal on all clothing.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>INTRODUCING 📣 EB World PLUS!</p><p>Get more out of your EB World membership with amazing awards and benefits including free gifts, extra trade value, and MORE!

And like a battle pass in a game, it leaves free-to-play grinders who have spent years earning loyalty rewards as part of EB World (the chain's longstanding regular membership program) in the dust.</p><p>Even if you weren't an existing member, it's a stupid idea, and was instantly treated as such by the Australian gaming public, who flooded the replies of the announcement tweet with so many variations of "Yikes hard pass for me lol" and "This is the worst thing I've ever seen from you guys" that EB Games locked the thread down, leaving that initial wave of hostility frozen in amber forever, a fitting testament to a company and social media team that wrote the words "BUY 10 GET 1 FREE CLOTHING" and said yup, great idea, the kids will love this.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, two senior executives at Bungie, were both part of the recent round of layoffs, according to a new report. Speaking on his Game Mess Decides <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszLbBLdM3Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast</a>, Jeff Grubb confirmed that the duo were working on Payback, a new game set in the Destiny universe, but were let go as part of sweeping job losses at the now PlayStation-owned studio.</p><p>"[Smith and Noseworthy] were labelled as working on Payback. It was going to be the next big thing for Destiny, but not Destiny 3," Grubb said. "Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy are no longer at Bungie. They were let go. They were caught in the executive and leadership shakeup mentioned in the blogpost. Payback has been shelved."</p><p><strong>[Update]</strong> Sources have clarified that Smith and Noseworthy's departure came as the Payback project was shut down, after which executive restructuring meant they had no path forward at Bungie. </p><p>Smith was executive director at Bungie and became a notable public-facing representative for the studio, having guided Destiny 2's narrative back to a place that excited fans and more clearly set up a long-term story for the sci-fi shooter. Noseworthy, meanwhile, was vice president of the Destiny universe and responsible for the overall strategy of Destiny as an intellectual property and a business.</p><p>GameSpot has contacted Bungie for a statement.</p><p>On July 31, Bungie executive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/#:~:text=In%20a%20blog%20post%2C%20Bungie,affecting%20more%20than%20100%20people." data-ref-id="1100-6525438">Pete Parsons confirmed the company is cutting around 220 people</a> from several departments. This number represents 17% of its workforce. A further 150 people are reportedly being moved around Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p><p>"Due to rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions, it has become clear that we need to make substantial changes to our cost structure and focus development efforts entirely on Destiny and Marathon," Parsons said. He also indicated that layoffs at "every level" of Bungie and that "most" of Bungie's executive or senior leader positions are impacted.</p><p>As part of the layoff announcement, it was also confirmed that Bungie is working on a brand-new game, but it is not Destiny 3 or Payback. Instead, this new sci-fi project will be developed at a new internal studio being set up within PlayStation.</p><p>The layoffs follow the release of Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion, which was very positively received by fans. Although Destiny 2 remains one of the most popular games-as-a-service titles on the market, the significant job losses at Bungie have called into question what content players can expect going forward. According to Grubb, the larger expansions that Bungie has traditionally released are unlikely to return and players will instead be given smaller content packs.</p><p>Bungie is also working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">new Marathon</a>, which is coming back as an extraction shooter.</p>

                <p>Often cited as the "best deal in gaming," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-getting-a-price-increase-and-introducing-a-new-tier/1100-6524819/" data-ref-id="1100-6524819">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is going up from $17 to $20 a month starting September 12</a>, but if you act fast, the Amazon-owned online retailer Woot is selling discounted <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fdigital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-will-soon-cost-240-year-but-this-deal-drops-it-to-134%2F1100-6525487%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">prepaid Game Pass codes</a> that will save you a hefty chunk on the subscription service.</p><p>With the deal, you can grab a 30-day prepaid Game Pass Ultimate digital code for $13.49 (was $17) or a 90-day code for $36.49 (normally $51 at the Microsoft store). But that's not all--if you use the coupon code <strong>VIDEOGAMES</strong> at checkout, you'll get an extra $3 off your code. The coupon can only be used once, but that extra $3 helps make this one of the best deals on Game Pass you'll find. For comparison, after the price increase next month, three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will cost you $60, so this is almost a 50% discount based on the upcoming price hike.</p><p>This is a great deal even if you only grab one 30- or 90-day code, but the discount is a great excuse to load up on a few months worth of Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p>The current discount price works out to $143 for a year, or $435 for three years of Game Pass. When the price increase hits, a full year will cost $240 and three years will cost $720. At the time of writing, you can stack up to 36 months of Game Pass Ultimate in all countries where it's available, and Woot will let you order up to 24 codes (either 30-day or three-month versions) per customer. After September 18, you will only be able to prepay for 13 months of Gamepass. This won't affect any existing stacks that existing subscribers may already have. When the deadline passes in September, several other tiers of Game Pass will increase in price as well.</p><p>Other Game Pass price increases include PC Game Pass increasing from $10 to $12 per month, and the annual price of Xbox Game Pass Core is going from $60 to $75 a year. The $10 monthly subscription price will remain unaffected for that leaner gaming library.

Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">yesterday's mass layoffs</a> at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer Bungie - in which 220 employees lost their jobs - a new report has claimed the cuts were a result of Bungie leadership 'overstating the studio's financial prospects' to Sony, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">acquired the developer</a> in 2022.
</p>
<p>
That's according to sources interviewed by journalist Stephen Totilo, who, writing in his <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">GameFile newsletter</a>, reports yesterday's job cuts were necessary to stem Bungie's continued financial losses. The studio is said to have repeatedly missed financial targets promised to Sony, and has reportedly lost money since the release of Destiny 2 expansion Lightfall in 2023.
</p>
<p>
Totilo claims yesterday's layoffs - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">second round</a> of job cuts in less than a year - had long been planned, and "couldn't be avoided" even if this year's Destiny 2 expansion, The Final Shape, had "blockbuster performance". Bungie management reportedly concluded last year - amid poor sales and a dwindling Destiny 2 player base - it would need to "make deep cuts to show Sony's executives that it was taking its finances seriously", with the studio's autonomy - and management jobs - seemingly on the line if it failed to meet its targets.

<p>
That tallies with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-staff-reportedly-worried-about-bungies-future">reports from IGN</a> last year, in which numerous Bungie employees told the publication the mood at the studio was "soul-crushing" as leadership implemented harsh cost-cutting measures, apparently in a bid to cling onto independence.
</p>
<p>
Totilo notes Sony's gaming division has reported slimmer profits in recent times, and that when Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">replaced outgoing PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan</a> earlier this year, they wrote, "Expectations for us are high and we aim to drive improving profitability." However, Totilo's sources say employees have little animosity for Sony over the cuts, with many instead blaming Bungie management for promising unrealistic growth - an attitude reflected in staff social media posts <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">slamming studio CEO Pete Parsons</a> following yesterday's layoffs.
</p>
<p>
According to Totilo, Destiny 2 remains the only game currently making money for Bungie, and this year's The Final Shape expansion "sold less than Lightfall", despite its positive critical reception. That's a problem for a Bungie leadership still looking to prove it can turn things around to Sony, and perhaps not an easily solvable one. "The financials just don't work," one source told Totilo. "Destiny is an incredibly expensive game to make."

                <p>Just over a year ago, the performers in SAG-AFTRA went on strike against the major Hollywood studios and streamers over a variety of issues including a lack of AI protections. Now, the actors are on strike again against video game studios whom they claim have refused to offer the same AI protections that SAG-AFTRA secured following last year's strike.</p><p>"We've made deals with the studios and streamers," said SAG-AFTRA national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland during an interview with the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sagaftra-strike-video-games-ai-f3f18ad01c5b8f4d525a836aeb531447" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Associated Press</a>. "We've made deals without a strike with the major record labels and with countless other employers, which provide for informed consent and fair compensation for our members. And yet, for some reason, the video game companies refuse to do that and that's what’s going to be their undoing."</p><p>SAG-AFTRA members authorized a strike last week after negotiations between the union and the video game publishers dragged on for 18 months without a resolution. Some of the studios that the actors reached deals with last year, including Warner Bros. and Disney, have video game divisions as well. But that hasn't led to any movement on a new protections for the actors who lend their voices and likenesses to video games.</p><p>Until the strike is settled, SAG-AFTRA performers will not be able to perform any voiceover work for the video game companies. And to kick off the first major picket of the strike, the actors are protesting in front of Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank. That's where many of them spent a long hot summer in 2023 before a deal was finally reached for film and television performers the following fall.</p>

Desktop PC builder and retailer NZXT <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/flex">can ship you a whole gaming rig for as little as $59 per month</a> — as long as you provide your own mouse, keyboard, and monitor.</p><p>The Flex subscription program has been available for at least several months, based on <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/unleash-the-gamer-in-you-with-nzxt-flex-the-ultimate-pc-subscription-service">NZXT’s posts</a>, and the pricing and specs of the machines listed have changed over time. Now, it’s updating its three-tiered approach to PC renting with new specs, with its base <a href="https://nzxt.com/flex/player-one">Player: One</a> entry-level sub running $59 per month for a tower running an Intel Core i5 14400F and Nvidia RTX 4060 GPU. Stepping up to the mid-tier <a href="https://nzxt.com/flex/player-two">Player: Two</a> costs $119 per month for an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X CPU and RTX 4070 Super GPU, and the top-tier <a href="https://nzxt.com/flex/player-three">Player: Three</a> package costs $169 per month with an Intel Core i7 13700KF and RTX 4070 Ti Super. </p><p>All three tiers also require a $50 “setup and shipping fee” that will include the return label if you decide to cancel your subscription.</p><p>The NZXT site indicates that subscribers can expect to have a new or like-new Flex PC delivered within three to five days on a month-to-month term that’s free to cancel anytime. Customers will also have access to free replacements with 24/7 customer support if something should go wrong and guaranteed hardware upgrades every two years.</p><p>Two years is a pretty long period, and even with the cheapest Player: One model, you’ll have spent $1,416 to use that 4060 through 2026 (though, there should be a free upgrade at some point in that timeline). The Player: Three tier with 4070 Ti Super would cost $4,056 to rent for two years. </p><p>That’s the kind of money you could potentially spend to build your own 4090-level desktop that’s much more capable for 4K gaming. Woof.</p><p>We’ve reached out to NZXT for clarification on what the full specs are for each updated tier (including RAM and storage) and if subscribers have any incentives like rent-to-own pricing if they can buy their rented Flex computer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Intel Corporation is reportedly going to lay off 15,000 employees, as the company makes drastic cuts. The company announced it will be seeking $10 billion in savings for 2025, which will lead to the layoffs of a large quantity of staff members.</p>



<p>Intel CEO, Pat Gelsinger, revealed the news of the lay offs earlier today to his staff, as the company is gearing up to make the cuts.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-intel-to-have-massive-layoffs-ahead-of-2025">Intel To Have Massive Layoffs Ahead Of 2025</h2>



<p>With competitors such as Nvidia on the market, Intel has decided to introduce a massive cost-saving plan, that will reportedly cost 15,000 employees their job.</p>



<p>In 2024, Nvidia was declared the world’s most profitable company as Intel missed its growth targets, according to Gelsinger.</p>

<p>“Our revenues have not grown as expected—and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI,”&nbsp;said Gelsinger. “Our costs are too high, and our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both—particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our revenues have not grown as expected—and we’ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI.</p>
<cite>Pat Gelsinger, CEO of Intel</cite></blockquote>



<p>So, where did all of Intel’s losses exactly come from?</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-challenges-faced-by-intel-foundry">Challenges Faced By Intel Foundry</h3>



<p>Intel also reported that a large reason for its losses in 2024 was due to challenges it faced revolving around the Intel Foundry. In fact, the Intel Foundry segment does not expect to see profits until 2027 at the earliest. </p>



<p>While Intel’s traditional business seems to be stable, it has still been impacted in recent days by heavy market demand for laptops and PCs. The company plans to produce a large amount of chips over the next year in hopes of competing with brands like AMD.</p>



<p>With a lowering share price, and many other issues revolving around Intel as of late, we can only hope to see the company bounce back, and that no more hard-working employees lose their jobs.</p>

It barely feels like five minutes since the last one, but, somehow, Gamescom is almost upon us again. Which means publishers are starting to detail their plans for the show - and in Microsoft's case, we <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/01/xbox-gamescom-2024/">now know</a> that'll include daily livestreams for those at home, plus over 50 playable games for anyone wandering the Koelnmesse's halls.
</p>
<p>
Attendees visiting Microsoft's Hall 7 Gamescom booth in person will find 50 games from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a>, Blizzard, Bethesda, and third-party partners, playable across 240 gaming stations. These include Age of Mythology: Retold, Ara: History Untold, Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>: Milepost Zero, The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road, and Towerborne.
</p>
<p>
Playable third-party games, meanwhile, include Star Wars Outlaws, Space Marine 2, and the long-awaited Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. A full list of games at the booth can be <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/events/gamescom">found here</a>.

<p>
And if you're wondering where Microsoft's flagship 2024 titles have got to, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>: Shattered Space, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidians-avowed-reportedly-delayed-from-2024-to-early-next-year">reportedly delayed</a> Avowed will be present at the show but unplayable. Instead, all three games will be receiving "exclusive theatre presentations".

<p>Microsoft is planning for quite a lot of huge games to be shown off during this showcase, and the effort they are putting into the event isn't going unnoticed. Their effort comes at a time where the games industry is suffering a multitude of layoffs, with Bungie laying off 220 staff just the day before.</p>
<p>For Microsoft specifically, they have seen the layoffs of 1,900 staff, and have closed several Bethesda Studios, including the studio Tango Gameworks behind the iconic Hi-Fi Rush. In addition to Tango Gameworks, Arkane Austin was also shut down, the studio responsible for making Redfall.</p>
<p>However, in June, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phil Spencer</a> came forward to make a statement about the layoffs and said that he had to make "hard decisions" to be able to run a sustainable business. Some of the studio closures came as a massive shock, especially with the huge success of Hi-Fi Rush.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether gamescom will be a successful event for them, and whether it will help keep the business profitable, as Phil Spencer claimed in his statement, or whether the industry will continue to suffer from drastic cuts.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Uber Uniques are supposed to be the rarest, most powerful items in <em>Diablo IV</em> and they’re about to get completely reworked. Blizzard outlined <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-patch-notes-infernal-hordes-season-5-1851611347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-patch-notes-infernal-hordes-season-5-1851611347">how each item is changing</a></span> in the upcoming Season of the Infernal Hordes to make the gear stronger across all builds. They’re also getting a new name.</p><p>The first thing to know about Uber Uniques in season 5 is that they are now going to be called Mythic Uniques. The second is that each one is getting major changes to its stats to make sure they can compete with the best Masterworked gear and feel meaningful and rewarding no matter which class you play as or which build you’re running. </p><p>Here’s the list of the eight current Uber Uniques getting overhauled, which have a small chance to drop in Nightmare Dungeons or can be crafted with Resplendent Sparks. The full changes are viewable in the above slide-show:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Tyrael’s Might </li><li>Ahavarion, Spear of Lycander </li><li>Andariel’s Visage </li><li>Doombringer </li><li>Harlequin Crest </li><li>Melted Heart of Selig </li><li>Ring of Starless Skies </li><li>The Grandfather</li></ul><p>Season of the Infernal Hordes goes live on August 6, adding a new wave-based mode, some more story questlines, and a ton of tweaks to classes, XP farming, and just about everything else in the game. It’s the big content update expected to carry players through to the Vessel of Hatred expansion coming to <em>Diablo IV</em> in October, and it comes after a massive overhaul of loot just last season.<br></p><p>Over a year into its life, the loot-driven action-RPG is arguably better than ever, even if it’s still not all some players had hoped, and might never be due to its modern, battle-pass-driven live service design. It’s still an excellent shut-your-brain-off-and-grind game, and it’s as good a time as any to start building a character for Vessel of Hatred. <em>Diablo IV</em> is also free with a paid Game Pass subscription on Xbox and PC, even if the price for those just got jacked up moving forward. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But with a dwindling headcount—Bungie still has over 800 employees, but is down several hundreds since this time last year—and all these new projects, <em>Destiny 2 </em>is now just sitting in a sort of vegetative state, and it doesn’t feel like one it’ll stir from anytime soon.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-ceo-layoffs-locked-account-destiny-pete-parsons-1851610118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-ceo-layoffs-locked-account-destiny-pete-parsons-1851610118">Bungie Devs React To More Mass Layoffs: ‘My Whole Team Is Gone’</a></span></p><p>The hope appears to be to continue producing content for the live-service treadmill, but cut back on spending, which will be reflected in the size of future updates as well as the number of people actually working on <em>Destiny 2</em>. Despite repeated calls for Bungie to drop the game in favor of producing another numbered sequel in the franchise, <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Jason Schreier has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a></span> that <em>Destiny 3</em>, which was believed to have been canned as part of these layoffs, was never in development in the first place.</p><p>To be clear, most fans assumed that after <em>The Final Shape</em>, <em>Destiny </em>would slow down as it ramped up new narrative arcs or a potential new game. Following the latest expansion, the studio reworked its seasonal model into an episodic one, cutting back from four seasons a year to three episodes. The episodes are divided into three acts each, which Bungie suggested would translate to even more content. But considering the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-seasons-changing-weekly-stories-1851583614&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-seasons-changing-weekly-stories-1851583614">tepid reaction to the relatively thin episode</a></span> that’s in progress, players are already beginning to feel like they’ve been led on by the studio and we’ve barely gotten outside of <em>The Final Shape</em>’s launch window.</p><p>Now that it’s been confirmed that no new game is on the horizon, the community is left with an increasingly convoluted and quickly aging game, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-seasons-upset-echoes-1851564928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-seasons-upset-echoes-1851564928">disappointing evolution of a busted content delivery model</a></span>, and no promise for something better in the near future. They’ve been stranded.</p><p>Moreover, discontent with Bungie continues to foment in the community over a lack of communication about this uncertain future. The studio has refused to outwardly commit to any future plans beyond what’s been announced, which consists of the next year’s episodes, and a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content pack codenamed <em>Frontiers</em></a></span>. People want to be excited about the journeys to come. and more importantly, they want to know that <em>Destiny </em>is a thing they can continue to come back to. They want to feel like their investments in the series aren’t completely wasted. In return, Bungie’s leadership seems content to string them along in the hope that nebulous promises make good while they tear the studio apart looking for any remaining stones to bleed for a bit more money.</p><p>Paired with the confirmation that there is no numbered sequel in the works, the severity of these layoffs, the lack of meaningful communications, and a move away from expansions portend a grim picture for <em>Destiny. </em>Despite being billed as the end of the beginning, <em>The Final Shape </em>really is beginning to feel like the nail in the game’s coffin. There appears to be no certainty that <em>Destiny </em>will even be around in a few years, or that it’s a priority to the studio outside of being a cash cow riddled with microtransactions. So long as it can maintain a number of players who are actively playing (and more crucially, <em>spending</em>), Bungie seems to have placed any plans for <em>Destiny</em>’s continued growth on an indefinite hiatus. </p><p>Throwing further fuel on the fire, one person who wasn’t impacted by this week’s layoffs was Pete Parsons, Bungie’s CEO and the man who multiple former <em>Destiny </em>developers claim is largely to blame for the hard times the team’s fallen on. As developers were laid off earlier this week, repeated calls for Parsons’ job popped up from a number of senior developers who’d previously departed the studio, with one calling Parsons a “joke,” while another accused the CEO of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-ceo-layoffs-locked-account-destiny-pete-parsons-1851610118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-ceo-layoffs-locked-account-destiny-pete-parsons-1851610118">turning <em>Destiny </em>into “a money pit with no return.”</a></span> Accordingly, it was discovered that Parsons, who players and employees now have to trust to steward the franchise and studio, has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-layoffs-classic-cars-sony-buyout-de-1851610196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-layoffs-classic-cars-sony-buyout-de-1851610196">spent more than $2.3 million buying cars</a></span> since Bungie was acquired by Sony.</p><p>I trust that the talented developers left behind are going to continue to try their hardest to take care of <em>Destiny</em>, a franchise I care for more than I like to admit. But it pains me to say that I don’t know if I trust Bungie’s leadership to ever enable it to be the best that it can be. And so as regrettable as it may be, it might be time to let <em>Destiny </em>go. At least until it’s in capable and caring hands again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">Infernal Hordes, however, is just the tip of the iceberg. A new type of dungeon meant to introduce some of the mechanics of Infernal Hordes, Hellbreach dungeons, will also be added. Completing these will progress a new Reputation track, The Mother's Gift, which has been overhauled compared to previous seasonal Reputations to have better rewards, more ways to earn reputation, and be the main way players will progress the seasonal storyline.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-bosses-are-getting-some-big-changes-in-season-5/1100-6525482/" data-ref-id="1100-6525482">Bosses are seeing some big changes</a>, the most notable being that world bosses will have a new mechanic called Resilience that will "normalize" damage in Diablo 4's open world and prevent them from being instantly killed by overpowered players. Season 5 introduces notable changes to XP rewards as well, with side quests, priority quests, and class quests rewarding more XP. Fighting monsters that are up to 30 levels higher than the player will reward progressively more XP, encouraging players to fight harder enemies (if they can handle it).</p><p dir="ltr">On the class front, Blizzard is keenly aware that Barbarians are considered to be the best class in the game, in large part thanks to having access to more item slots for Legendary Aspects. Blizzard will be looking to bring Barbarian down a notch while bringing up other classes to compensate. One way it will do that is by adjusting the amount of damage players gain from their core stat on a class-by-class basis. Barbarians will receive 1% additional damage for every 10 Strength, while Necromancer, Sorceress, and Druid will receive 1% more damage for every 8 of their core stat. Barbarian is seeing some significant adjustments to its Key Passives, but it's not all bad news, as Hammer of the Ancients, as well as various Barbarian Uniques, will receive buffs.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of Uniques, a big part of Season 5 is making Uniques worth using again in a post-<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/" data-ref-id="1100-6523061">Loot Reborn update world</a> where Legendary items are often a better pick. Blizzard has reworked nearly every Unique in the game to make them much more powerful and appealing to players. It's far too long of a list to detail in full here, but you can check out Blizzard's <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24123440/diablo-iv-1-5-0-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official patch notes</a> for more details. The rest of the patch notes can be found below.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 5 will be around a month shorter than previous Diablo 4 seasons, running for around two months instead of three.

It seems aimed at leaning even more into the action RPG’s strengths of letting you blow up a whole screen full of enemies in mere seconds. </p><p>Out August 6 after weeks of being previewed on the PC-only public test servers, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24123440/diablo-iv-1-5-0-patch-notes?blzcmp=blizzard-news&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24123440/diablo-iv-1-5-0-patch-notes?blzcmp=blizzard-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the version 1.5.0 patch notes</a></span> for season 5 outline another host of refreshing changes ahead of the <em>Vessel of Hatred </em>expansion coming later in October. The masterworking material penalty for other players in the party entering The Pit is going away, the legendary drop-rate for monsters over level 100 in Helltides is going up, and basically every unique piece of gear in the game is getting a major rework. </p><p>Content-wise the big new thing will be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24119591/slay-endless-demons-in-season-of-the-infernal-hordes#Hell&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24119591/slay-endless-demons-in-season-of-the-infernal-hordes#Hell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infernal Hordes</a></span> which are available in both the seasonal and eternal realms. Players complete other end-game activities to earn Infernal Compasses that initiate the wave-based horde mode. They select from various Infernal Offerings to augment the quality of rewards and difficulty of the enemies after each 60-second onslaught. During the overall run there are limited revives and special mini-bosses that spawn. Collecting Burning Aether during the event determines what rewards you can unlock at the end. At the end of every run, players face a random assortment of three different Fell Priests each with unique abilities. </p><p>The mode sounds like a lot of fun, though how well it performs will come down to just how engaging it is and whether the challenge and time required feels worth the level of rewards earned. Between overhauled Helltides, The Pit, and now Infernal Hordes,<em> Diablo 4</em> is putting together a nice buffet of different ways for players to grind XP and earn rare loot by using all of the powers they’ve unlocked and customized to just murder hundreds of enemies a minute. </p><p>Season of the Infernal Hordes is also adding multiple new questlines and over 50 additional unique and legendary pieces of gear to be discovered. Baneful Hearts are being made more plentiful in Helltides, experience earned from higher level enemies is going up, and of course there’s a new battle pass for cosmetics and other unlockables. Some of the biggest changes to existing content, however, is an overhaul of uniques, including uber uniques which will now be called mythics, to make them feel more special. </p><p>“With Season of the Infernal Hordes, we wanted to make Uniques special again, in pursuit of equalizing all builds across the game,” the developers wrote earlier this week. “Our goals were to make build-defining uniques the best item for the skill they support, and for their corresponding affixes to have values that are best in that slot. Considering Uniques can’t be tempered, we wanted them to feel competitive to affixes that can be tempered.”</p><p>The patch notes for season 5 show how each of the existing uniques will change. Doombringer, for example, will increase health by a bigger percentage, healing per lucky hit, damage reduction, and overall damage output. Harlequin Crest will increase maximum life and cooldown reduction more, as well raise armor by a ton. It’ll take a while to see how all of the changes cash out, but uniques are already looking a lot more impactful and powerful on the whole. </p><p>Here’s the full list of patch notes for version 1.5.0 in Season of the Infernal Hordes: </p><div data-type="BlockQuote"><h3 id="h66057"><a id=""></a>Game Updates</h3><h4 id="h66058"><a id=""></a>Infernal Hordes</h4><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Distinct audio queues have been added to signal the beginning and end of a wave.</li><li>The number of waves has been tuned.Tiers 1-3: 6 WavesTiers 4-5: 7 WavesAll other tiers remain unchanged.</li><li>The wave timer has been reduced to 60 seconds.</li><li>The number of Monsters encountered has been generally increased across the board.</li><li>The Health Pools of the Council and other Bosses have been reduced.</li><li>Infernal Compasses can now be acquired more frequently and through more means.Tier 4-5 Compasses can drop in High Tier Nightmare Dungeons.Tiers 4-8 Compasses now naturally drop in high tier Pit runs.Tiers 4-8 Compasses will now rarely drop in Helltide and from Whisper caches after completing these tiers of Nightmare Dungeons or Pits.
