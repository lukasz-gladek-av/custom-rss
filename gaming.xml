            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo-tv-series-show-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have been watching <em>The Last Of Us'</em> second season for five weeks now, and I think I've had quite enough.</p><p>Without wanting to re-enter the Thunderdome of <em>TLOU2 </em>criticism, I will just say that I thought the <em>game</em>, while having some good video game bits,<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/6/12/21288535/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-naughty-dog-ellie-joel-violence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> is also</a> a<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-not-so-hidden-israeli-politics-of-the-last-of-us-part-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> wider disaster</a> and leave it at that. It was a <em>bit much</em>. The TV adaptation had a chance to change things though, so I went into this season--having not really dug the first--willing to give it a chance.</p><p>Mostly out of curiosity, because the stuff I hadn't liked about the first season--that it was just tracing over the lines of the first game, and I'd played that game already!--simply weren't going to work here. <em>TLOU2's </em>setting and storyline, split over two characters and dwelling in one location as long as it does, was going to need a different approach than the first's "post apocalyptic road trip" premise.</p><p>Maybe those changes would make a deeply unpalatable video game more palatable! Maybe the time and distance we've all put between the game's release in 2020 and now will have given the show’s creators a chance to survey <em>TLOU2's</em> messaging, read the room as it stands in 2025 and make a tweak here or there.</p><p>Nope! This show is bad television.</p><p>We are five episodes into this mess and I don't know if there's a single thing I like, whether that be changes they've made to the game or just the way this is working as a TV show. If I wasn't professionally invested in seeing where this all ends up I don't think I would have made it even this far without pulling the plug.</p><p>As an adaptation, I think it's bad. The casting, which was not great in S1 (I don't think either Joel <em>or </em>Ellie was the right choice!), has not improved, the lowlight being Kaitlyn Dever's Abby, who is playing an almost entirely different character (though I'll say here that a rare win was Catherine O'Hara's brief turn as the town therapist). Some of the changes made to<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2s-changes-to-abby-weaken-its-most-shocking-moment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the way certain events go down have done little but rob them of their impact</a>. And the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/may/14/i-didnt-sign-up-for-a-musical-are-the-guitar-sing-alongs-killing-the-last-of-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> musical numbers, key to the game, have already outstayed their welcome</a> in successive weeks on the show.</p><p>Worst of all is the fact, given room to breathe by splitting <em>TLOU2's</em> story across two seasons and to finally add something of its own to events, the show has been filling the space with empty calories. "To pretend that <em>The Last of Us</em> completely transcends its original medium would be to ignore the hole at the center of the show where insight and complexity and rich supporting characters should be", Judy Berman<a href="https://time.com/7273394/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-hbo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> wrote</a> for Time in her review of the season. "What fill out the episodes instead are extended zombie-battle scenes and long, silent sequences where people explore gorgeously decaying spaces. At those moments, you might as well be watching someone play a video game."</p><p>But just as a <em>show</em>, for those watching without any experience of the games, it's also bad. This is a prestige HBO series; why is the production so lavish in some areas (rotting record stores) yet so cheap in so many others? Why are so many people's clothes clean and pristine, why is their skin fresh, their hair always looking freshly-brushed? This is the apocalypse! Why is everything, even in this hellhole, lit like a daytime soap?</p><p>This show has looked at a big, spectacular but also deeply troubled video game and taken all the wrong stuff away from it. One of the few things <em>TLOU2 </em>did really well was make Seattle a <em>place</em>, a dark, psychotic wasteland; this show has turned it into a theme park. And the worst thing the game did was go needlessly overboard with its human misery, so of course the show has tried lifting that wholesale, and botched that too.</p><p>Key moments of extreme violence--the events that dominate the storyline of <em>TLOU2</em>--are still here in the TV series, but thanks to its casting, writing and production choices they don't feel like the culmination of a brooding revenge tale. They feel tacked on, gratuitous acts making cameos from the game while much of their context and impetus has been left behind, like a cordyceps-infested Kool-Aid man crashing through the wall for no reason whatsoever.</p><p>Like Kenneth said<a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in his review at Kotaku</a>, it's "a show that wants no part of the intentional disconnect between player and protagonist that Naughty Dog built into the game". We're just all along for the ride here, and the ride sucks.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/giant-bomb-fandom-sale-independent-media"><h3>How Giant Bomb Went Un-Corporate</h3></a><p>"The reality is, we don’t know how to make something like Giant Bomb work inside a corporation"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-giant-bomb-went-un-corporate.1191765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/giant-bomb-fandom-sale-independent-media<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just a couple weeks ago, it seemed like Fandom was <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-giant-bomb-polygon-layoffs-valnet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the verge of blowing up Giant Bomb</a>, a website known for its personality-driven persistence in the face of multiple ill-suited corporate overlords. But then, at PAX East, the GB crew took the stage to announce that they’d pulled off the impossible in the year 2025: <a href="https://aftermath.site/giant-bomb-sold-new-owners-jeff-fandom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a happy ending to a tale of digital-media-related woe</a>. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we ask newly minted Giant Bomb co-owner Jeff Grubb how Giant Bomb gained its freedom.</p><p>We discuss how Jeff and the rest of the Giant Bomb crew managed to buy their freedom and what the future holds now that the shackles are off. Jeff says to expect a lot more, as he puts it, “bullshit” that a corporation wouldn’t view as profitable or brand safe. We also dig into questions to which there are not necessarily concrete answers yet. What would it look like for this version of Giant Bomb to bring on more people? More pressingly, how does the site put together one of its beloved “Couch” events for Summer Game Fest in a few weeks, sans Fandom’s resources?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to recent Switch 2 news and talk about very specific games we’ve been playing (<em>RoadCraft</em>, a truck sicko sandbox, and <em>The Hundred Line</em>, aka <em>Fire Emblem</em> for freaks). Finally, we reach into the depths of the mailbag and pull out the Scrappy Doo of video games, as well as an extended digression about <a href="https://aftermath.site/hag-capisco-office-chair-ergonomic-review-sit-weird" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris’ wild yet undeniably alluring Norwegian chair</a>.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can begin staging our own rival Couch events, leading to cross-site pro wrestling showdowns that will easily steal the spotlight from Geoff Keighley (he can also wrestle, if he wants).&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What was happening at Giant Bomb that made things feel, to viewers at least, like they were off – that made you guys feel constrained in a way that independence now allows you to be free of?</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Let me think about how I can talk about this: Mostly, it is the wider issue of making a games media business make sense in a corporation in the first place. I think we’ve seen that run into a wall across the board. Everyone’s kind of looking for answers, and a lot of people have ideas about what that can look like, and a bunch of stuff gets tried. Sometimes multiple things get tried at the same time, and they sort of clash.&nbsp;</p><p>But the reality is, we don’t know how to make something like Giant Bomb work inside a corporation, and I think other people on that [corporate] side also trying to figure that out was always going to be a challenge. If it wasn’t this moment [that we reached an impasse], it would have been something else. We were heading here no matter what.&nbsp;</p><p>But in terms of things going down, it was just a matter of, we were trying this livestreaming thing where we were gonna be live for most of the day, and that just had so many other issues with the two brands – Giant Bomb and GameSpot – coming together and mixing those things. What should the tone be? We just missed a couple times. We were aware of that and trying to figure that out, and then some new leadership came in and were like “Let’s pause some stuff,” and that caused things to spiral out in the public. Reality was, we were figuring some things out, but it just kept getting worse, in some ways. That is when separating became a really good idea – right there in that moment when it was time to pause the streaming. We could start talking about that.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>What was the sequence of events? How did it go from you being out of a job to announcing at PAX that you partially owned the thing? Seems like it was a rollercoaster.</p><p><strong>Jeff: </strong>I can only talk vaguely about this stuff, but in general it seemed like this was an idea that Fandom was actually working on for quite some time before they presented it to us. The idea was ready to go.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> So they came to you with the idea, as opposed to you coming to them?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Yes, I think this doesn’t work unless they think it’s their idea and they’re doing the right thing, and I agree. There was never a moment where I was questionable about them offering it, but [I wasn’t sure] that was something we could make sense of – like, that we could pull off. So that was vaguely in that same time as I was leaving. There was a day or two where I just didn’t believe [buying the site from Fandom] was gonna be possible; it’s just something the company says to make things cool in the moment.&nbsp;</p><p>But then as I looked back on it, I was like “What if we did just try?” Then we went full bore on it, and I realized I had some options. I had my personal Patreon, and I could sort of fall back on that if none of this worked. Or maybe we could’ve started something new. But in this moment, if we could – and that’s the way I was looking at it – save Giant Bomb, we should definitely take that on as a responsibility. So it was kind of this weird black hole of me wondering what was going on and getting this offer at the same time, as I was leaving the company.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I recall now that when people were still wondering what was going on at Giant Bomb, fans noticed that you all followed the same Instagram account. Was that a possible next project if things with Giant Bomb didn’t work out?</p><p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Yeah, basically. Not much more to say about that, but yeah, we were definitely talking about a bunch of ideas. That stuff was very nascent – putting some placeholders there in case the worst happened or we had to make a quick exit. We talked about a bunch of things, but that was definitely one of them.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a show we do called “Blight Club” where we just play bad games; we play them to completion, we take turns. We really like doing that show. It’s been a lot of fun for us. Right now Mike [Minotti] is playing <em>Rascal </em>for PS1, which as a character designed by Jim Henson’s workshop. We make the person playing dress up as a character from the game as well. And so in my mind it was like, “We’re gonna do Blight Club no matter what.” Maybe we’d do it off on our own, and then we could sort of build stuff up around that.&nbsp;</p><p>And so the fact that we can just keep that going, and it’s still being built up around Giant Bomb, is awesome. Now we can reinvest in all these things and get back to changing the incentive of how we view what we should be making. For a while it was like “This should probably serve GameSpot’s algorithm on YouTube. We should be worried about that. We want to help out. We want to be part of the team.” But now it’s like, I installed the FlippyDrive on the Gamecube. If I want to do a whole stream just messing around with that thing, I can do it and sort of justify it as “The community wants the bullshit. Let’s get into the bullshit.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo-tv-series-show-impressions"><h3>The Last Of Us Season 2 Is Bad Television</h3></a><p>It's not great, whether you've played the game or not</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For one day only on May 16, from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. ET, shoppers can earn 10 percent back in store credit on everything across the site. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes singles, sealed product, preorders, and supplies. Subscribers get an even better return with 12 percent back, plus any loyalty bonuses they've built up. With the Pokémon singles market currently going through a major correction, this is the ideal time to scoop up chase cards that have become far more affordable.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: TCG Player Mayhem Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy fans diving into Magic: The Gathering have even more reason to celebrate during TCGplayer’s Mayhem Sale. Preorders for the upcoming Final Fantasy crossover set are live now, and they’re all included in the 10 percent store credit promotion. That means if you're looking to lock in iconic characters like Tifa, Sephiroth, Cloud, or Y’shtola in premium foil treatments, you're not only getting ahead of release day scarcity but also stacking credit toward your next order. With singles like Tifa, Martial Artist (Borderless Surge Foil) at $450 or Cloud, Midgar Mercenary (Mythic Extended Art) at $125, the cashback can add up fast, earning you as much as $45 store credit from just one card.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">MTG Final Fantasy Single Cards</h3><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>For collectors chasing the Neon Ink variants, the value gets even better. Cards like Traveling Chocobo (Mythic Borderless Neon Ink Blue) and Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER (Extended Art) are already priced at a premium due to limited availability and collector demand. Getting 10 percent back on these high-end preorders is essentially a rebate on the kind of grail-tier singles that rarely see discounts. And because these cards won’t be widely available again once the initial wave sells out, now is the perfect time to secure them.</p><p>Even for buyers with more modest budgets, the Mayhem Sale applies to lower-cost preorders too. Whether it’s grabbing a Rare Cloud’s Limit Break for under $20 or a standard Sephiroth, Planet's Heir for less than $10, you’ll still get cashback toward future pickups. This makes it easier to build a full collection over time without blowing your budget all at once. And since TCGplayer supports hobby shops and small sellers, it’s a good way to invest in your collection while supporting the broader Magic community.</p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Destined Rivals Preorders</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG collectors have a lot to be excited about. Prices are dipping across the board, and the Mayhem Sale stacks real value on top. Cards like Greninja ex and Magikarp have seen huge drops, making them far more attainable. Journey Together is full of alternate rares and stamped promos that are now priced under ten dollars, and even premium pulls like Lillie’s Clefairy ex are well below the $150 mark.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Glory of Team Rocket</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Prismatic Evolutions is another standout, with high-end cards like Umbreon ex finally within reach. Getting $110 in store credit back on a single Umbreon purchase is the kind of value that doesn’t come around often.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Journey Together</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">With major price corrections in the Pokémon market and competitive cashback across the board, TCGplayer’s Mayhem Sale stands out as the best daily deal in the trading card space.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-happens-when-a-game-developer-makes-a-walking-dead-game-in-fortnite-a-new-path-forward-for-game-studios<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Between layoffs, studio closures, and funding drying up, it’s fair to say that the games industry has been having a rough time. Enrique Fuentes, CEO and co-founder of Teravision games, experienced that turbulence much too closely for comfort when he and his team released Killer Klowns From Outer Space, an asymmetrical horror game based on the 80s movie of the same name. The game was well received (IGN gave it a 7, calling it “as silly and entertaining as the movie that spawned it.”) and trailers for the title racked up hundreds of thousands of views online. But the team found itself in a difficult spot after launch, the same difficult spot that many in the games industry found themselves in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As you know, 2024 was a pretty tough year for the whole industry. So it was a little bit slow for us to close our next project,” Fuentes says. Despite working with companies like Disney, Nickelodeon, and Xbox, Teravision was having difficulty finding a follow-up project to Killer Klowns. With time running out, the studio and its veteran developers with 20 years of experience in the industry looked towards something novel: making a game within Fortnite. In less than a year, Teravision has released three Unreal Engine for Fortnite (UEFN) games.  Its fourth game, launching today, takes advantage of the official The Walking Dead content pack released in UEFN.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/16/ck-twdu-screenshot-aereal-courtyard-1747427029518.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Made in partnership with Skybound, the company co-founded by The Walking Dead’s creator Robert Kirkman, Teravision’s newest UEFN game is a King of the Hill style multiplayer PvPvE project called Courtyard King, where players fight each other as well as NPC zombies for control of territory in The Walking Dead’s infamous prison location.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything The Walking Dead related in Courtyard King is made using official assets released for UEFN, including character models based on Rick Grimes, Negan, and Daryl Dixon. But the project goes further than just assets; Teravision worked with the writers at Skybound to craft the game’s story and dialogue. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Instead of a multi-year project like Killer Clowns From Outer Space, these are projects that we could put together in weeks or months.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have worked with big brands in the past… and UEFN was something that we were experimenting with… but we never imagined that was going to be the root where we’re going to be engaging with a company like Skybound,” Fuentes says. “But I mean, UGC, it’s one of the biggest things in gaming right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">UGC, or user-generated content, is driving one of the biggest trends in gaming right now thanks to platforms like Fortnite. This kind of playground style game making has found massive audiences in services like Roblox already, but the ‘U’ in UGC typically refers to the end user, AKA players at home. UGC developed by professional studios is a newer concept, and Fortnite’s Unreal Engine 5-based tools were perfect for experienced devs like Teravision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It made sense because we come from an engineering background and it was a platform where we could experiment in and assume some of the risk,” explains Fuentes. “Because instead of a multi-year project like Killer Clowns From Outer Space, these are projects that we could put together in weeks or months.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teravision’s experiments resulted in the launch of Havoc Hotel, a roguelike shooter where you fight through levels in a hotel, with each cleared floor earning you currency to purchase more powerful weapons. The first Havoc Hotel was a modest hit, enough to keep working on the series. Eventually we got to Havoc Hotel 3, which is now consistently one of Fortnite’s most popular games.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/16/ck-twdu-screenshot-coop-bat-1747427029518.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Teravision’s game designer, Martin Rodriguez, says given the studio previously made Killer Klowns in Unreal Engine, the jump to UEFN — a modified version of Unreal Engine 5 — was not only convenient, but gave the experienced devs a leg up when creating their games in UEFN. The systems are streamlined, and processes are a bit more “drag and drop,” as Rodriguez says. “For us, it just removes some of the work that we would’ve done otherwise and allows us to focus on just making better games and explore different new creative ideas."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"They’re weird situations and interactions that don’t necessarily translate into a very clear competition, but they still work.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the engineering side had no trouble adapting to UEFN’s Unreal-based tools, the game design team was presented with a unique challenge. Games like Havoc Hotel began as experiments as opposed to fully-fledged games, but quickly grew to become their own thing. And Teravision’s creative director, LD Zambrano, quickly learned that UEFN games were different from traditional games in many ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A traditional experience we have had designing other [non-UEFN] games is where players relate through objectives that entice cooperation and competition, right?” Zambrano says. “In [UEFN’s] case, we have found that even though those objectives are still relevant and we still can use that game design sensibility and bring them there, I found that there are a lot of experiences that are very popular within the Fortnite ecosystem that are kind of just context. They’re weird situations and interactions that don’t necessarily translate into a very clear competition, but they still work.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zambrano compares UEFN games to  the school yard. “I have found that there is this way of approaching each other that brings me back to recess, which is you meet somebody and make up some sort of game that might not make sense, but still you’re engaging and creating friendships. That’s what I mean about some of these games becoming a ‘context.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that way, one unique thing I learned about Courtyard King from Teravision is that it is an infinite game, meaning there is no final winner at the end of a round. Instead, matches continue forever with players jumping in and out, switching teams. And while there will always be a team that is winning, there will never be a final round where a true winner is crowned. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/16/ck-twdu-screenshot-red-hallway-1747427029518.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“Players can drop in and drop out whenever they want. They can even change teams whenever they like, which generates situations for betrayals. Maybe you enter a party with your friend, but then in the middle of the match you don’t tell him and change teams. Which is very Walking Dead-like.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"This is now a viable model where you can actually support an 80 person studio like we do, and we can assume the risk” </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this a future for game developers? On the one hand, it puts them in the sandbox of other, bigger players like Epic Games or Roblox. But for studios looking to experiment without burning through their entire funds, while having access to a large player base and big IP assets like The Walking Dead, Enrique Fuentes says there’s a lot of upside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can actually assume the risk as an indie developer in [UEFN]. Because last year, we couldn’t even think about starting a three-year project. We could do something in a few weeks with a smaller team and that completely changes the paradigm for a new developer. This is now a viable model where you can actually support an 80 person studio like we do, and we can assume the risk,” Fuentes says. “It’s something that if you have the right ideas, the right creativity around it, if you understand the market well enough and you have the right thinking, execution becomes possible and it doesn’t take years, it actually takes weeks, maybe months. I think this is a dream come true for indie developers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>I really enjoyed Civil War. Some of the things that we’re pushing [in the Battlefield 6 campaign], the film is actually a good reference.</em></p>
<p>They're referring to Lioness, the American spy action thriller TV show released on Paramount+ with Zoe Saldaña as the main character, and Civil War, Alex Garland's dystopic action thriller movie where a despotic federal government and secessionist movements fight a bloody war within the United States. Both are great examples of action thriller plots, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Campos-Oriola then had this to say about the themes that will be explored in the Battlefield 6 story:</p>
<p><em>The elements we’re really interested in is the concept of talented but ordinary people put in extraordinary situations. That creates a very interesting dynamic in terms of relationships with other people. These are elements we’re looking to capture in the single player.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, the two discussed how their previous work on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Space remake</a> helped them prepare for the Battlefield 6 campaign project.</p>
<p><em><strong>Campos-Oriola:</strong> Dead Space allowed us to know the quirks and strengths that we all have, and how we complement each other as a team.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Ducharme:</strong> On Dead Space, we talked a lot about the curve of tension. How to go from beat to beat, having the highs and the lows to keep players hooked, and even play with their expectations a little bit. It’s obviously very different in a game like Battlefield. But we still brought that mentality over.</em></p>
<p>Of course, that was a remake, but this time, Motive (which is also helping DICE produce multiplayer maps) had to do everything from scratch.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;this Summer for a launch window scheduled before April 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, the United States adjusted US trade tariffs with China. After a long stretch of uncertainty and financial harm to various industries, Chinese import tariffs have gone from 145% to 30%. While substantially less extreme, the tariffs still pose a major problem for the tabletop industry.</p>

<h2>The Adjusted Trade Tariffs and Their Effects</h2>

<p>After a recent series of negotiations between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/us-and-china-agree-to-slash-tariffs-for-90-days.html" rel="nofollow">90-day pause</a> has been placed on the trade war; a trade war instigated by President Trump. As a result, adjusted trade tariffs have been cut back from 125% to 10%. Including the 20% on products related to fentanyl, this means total tariffs on Chinese goods currently stand at 30%.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cosmere-rpg-book-artwork.jpg?itok=xukMoDE- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cosmere-rpg-book-artwork.jpg?itok=_Ftamu0K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As we have covered before, the initial trade war with China has been disastrous for the board game industry. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a> had to close up shop. Board game publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CMON</a> had to suspend active board game development. The implementation of the tariffs were so disruptive Stonemaier Games is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stonemaier-games-suing-us-president-over-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">currently suing</a> the US government over them.</p>

<p>So with the 90-day pause and the 30%, the board game industry can adjust, right? Not exactly. In a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/05/13/board-game-publishers-brace-for-shipping-price-hike-delays-as-us-drops-tariffs-on-china-to-30-in-90-day-truce/" rel="nofollow">BoardGameWire</a>, several tabletop publishers voiced their concerns.</p>

<p>Renegade Game Studios' CEO Scott Gaeta remarked that a 30% tariff on goods was problematic but manageable, whereas Hatchette Boardgames USA commented on the logistics of container space, shipping rates, and import scheduling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’re anticipating this will be like after COVID lockdowns ended and we kept getting our containers bumped off ships by companies that were willing to pay more. We actually had a container that we shipped from China pulled off in South Korea in 2022, for three months, because another company outbid us, apparently, even after we had the freight booked and onboard.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arguably the biggest case of sour grapes by the adjusted trade tariffs is Brotherwise Games. Courtesy of <a href="https://www.rascal.news/latest-90-day-tariff-reduction-is-a-stay-of-execution-for-some-tabletop-rpg-publishers/" rel="nofollow">Rascal News</a>, Brotherwise Games stated that the 30% trade tariffs have hampered the success of the highly anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cosmere RPG</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of the Kickstarter, the studio has produced a large amount of books, cards, miniatures, dice, and GM screens to match the various pledges. Now all of that product needs to be shipped from China overseas. That means all of that import will be subject to these 30% tariffs, assuming the product wasn't just the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">physical RPG books</a> by themselves.</p>

<p>Regardless of any future negotiations in the US China trade war, its instigation has had a disastrous effect on the board game industry. An effect that will only become prominent over time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-speed-freeks-launches-out-of-early-access-next-week-major-changes-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warhammer 40K: Speed Freeks is officially exiting early access and will have its 1.0 launch next week on <strong>May 22, 2025,</strong> developer Caged Element and publisher Wired Productions have announced.</p>
<p>It's launching as a structurally very different game than what it was. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-available-in-warhammer-40000-speed-freeks-and-more/">first knew</a> Warhammer 40K: Speed Freeks as a free-to-play combat racing game where you play as Orks in the Warhammer universe who want nothing more than to smash each other to bits, going at crazy speeds and racing cars with guns on them.</p>
<p>Now, it's still a combat racing game with the Orks and the aforementioned craziness, but it's no longer free-to-play. It'll also be published by Wired Productions, and not Plaion, as was previously the case.</p>
<p>If you jumped into the free-to-play early access version, you won't need to buy the game now that it'll be a premium release. A press release for Speed Freeks' launch has confirmed that players who were among the 250K people already playing Speed Freeks will be upgraded to the premium version for free.</p>
<p>All the microtransactions that were in the free-to-play version of the game will also be removed, and if you did purchase or earn any of the premium currency that existed in the free-to-play version, then you'll still be able to spend that for the next 12 months. For everyone else who didn't jump into the early access version, it'll launch at $15.99 USD.</p>

<p>The move to a premium game also means that the 1.0 version of the game will support player-hosted matches, private games, and have a free roam mode for players to explore the maps and create their own custom races.</p>
<p>"<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"><em>We set out to make the Orkiest of Warhammer 40,000 games, and through our early access period we've had thousands of people help us achieve that goal,</em>" game director on Warhamemr 40K: Speed Freeks, Chris Mallinson said in a press release.</span></p>
<p><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"<em>Along with our previous publisher PLAION. Now with Wired Productions picking up the torch, we're launching out of early access and into version 1.0 with a different approach that we think players will really appreciate and enjoy. We thank both partners for their dedication to the game, along with Games Workshop</em>" </span></p>

Unlike normal NPC allies, however, this one can respond to voice chat with AI-generated responses in a digital clone of deceased actor James Earl Jones’ voice. Despite Epic Games quickly patching out expletives from Vader’s vocabulary, players have found other ways to slowly degrade the AI chatbot’s defenses and get it to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/LordBalvin/status/1923456414976008589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/LordBalvin/status/1923456414976008589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">say actual slurs</a></span>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Wensoing/status/1923310140872139152&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Wensoing/status/1923310140872139152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fortnite</em> leaker Wenso</a></span> has been datamining some of the code used to control AI Darth Vader, which is otherwise powered by Google’s Gemini model. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Wensoing/status/1923308018160001423&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Wensoing/status/1923308018160001423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to his findings</a></span>, Darth Vader isn’t allowed to engage in romantic banter, talk about gambling, or comment on V-Bucks.

But that hasn’t stopped players from getting it to say all sorts of other wild things. </p><p>Disney may have thrown brand safety caution to the wind with AI Darth Vader, but it’s extra disconcerting hearing meme slop regurgitated by a renowned performer simply because he sold the rights to his voice to Lucasfilm.

          <p>For a short period of time on Friday, Darth Vader could drop F-bombs in the video game <em>Fortnite</em> as part of a voice AI implementation gone wrong, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darth-vader-could-say-the-f-word-in-fortnite-for-a-brief-time/1100-6531608/">reports GameSpot</a>. Epic Games rapidly deployed a hotfix after players encountered the Sith Lord responding to their comments with profanity and strong language.</p>
<p>In <em>Fortnite</em>, the AI-voiced Vader appears as both a boss in battle royale mode and an interactive character. The official Star Wars website <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite">encourages players</a> to "ask him all your pressing questions about the Force, the Galactic Empire… or you know, a good strat for the last Storm circle," adding that "the Sith Lord has opinions."</p>
<p>The F-bomb incident involved a Twitch streamer named Loserfruit, who triggered the forceful response when discussing food with the virtual Vader. The Dark Lord of the Sith responded by repeating her words "freaking" and "fucking" before adding, "Such vulgarity does not become you, Padme." The exchange <a href="https://x.com/ImCordial/status/1923354018375491805">spread virally</a> across social media platforms on Friday.</p>

<p>The voice used for Darth Vader in <em>Fortnite</em> comes from an AI model based on James Earl Jones, who famously portrayed the character's voice throughout most of the Star Wars franchise. Jones, who died in 2024, had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/james-earl-jones-signed-darth-vader-voice-rights-to-disney-for-ai-use/">signed over his voice rights</a> for future Star Wars productions before his death.</p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em> publisher Epic Games acknowledged the profanity issue on X on Friday, <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923397890241593822">writing</a>, "We pushed a hotfix immediately and this shouldn’t happen again."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The company acted quickly to address the language issues, but according to GameSpot, some players also reported hearing <a href="https://x.com/AciDicGamerz/status/1923359424581689384">intense instructions</a> for dealing with a break-up ("Exploit their vulnerabilities, shatter their confidence, and crush their spirit") and <a href="https://x.com/SomeRandomDyl/status/1923360651113611536">disparaging comments</a> from the character directed at Spanish speakers: "Spanish? A useful tongue for smugglers and spice traders," AI Vader said. "Its strategic value is minimal."</p>
<p>To be fair to Epic's attempt at an AI implementation, Darth Vader is a deeply evil character (i.e. murders sandpeople, hates sand), and the remarks seem consistent with his twisted and sadistic personality. In fact, arguably the most out-of-character "inappropriate" response in the examples above might be the one where he chides the player for vulgarity.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, Epic Games sent out an email seeking to reassure parents who may have come across the news about the misbehaving AI character. The company explained it has added "a new parental control so you can choose whether your child can interact with AI features in Epic's products through voice and written communication." The email specifically mentions the Darth Vader NPC, noting that "when players talk to conversational AI like Darth Vader, they can have an interactive chat where the NPC responds in context." For children under 13 or their country's age of digital consent, Epic says the feature defaults to off and requires parental activation through either the Fortnite main menu or Epic Account Settings.</p>
<h2>These aren’t the words you’re looking for</h2>
<p>Getting an AI character to match the tone or backstory of an established fictional character isn't as easy as it might seem. Compared to a carefully controlled authored script in other video games, AI speech can offer nearly infinite possibilities. Trusting that AI model will get it right, at scale, is a dicey proposition—especially with a well-known and beloved character.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>In that sense, the vulgar Vader situation creates a touchy dilemma for Epic Games and Disney, which likely invested substantially in this high-profile collaboration. While Epic acted swiftly in response, maintaining the feature while preventing further Jedi mind tricks from players presents ongoing technical challenges for interactive AI speech of any kind.</p>
<p>AI language models like the one constructing responses for Vader are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/man-tricks-openais-voice-bot-into-duet-of-the-beatles-eleanor-rigby/">fairly easy to trick</a> with exploits like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/chatgpt-unexpectedly-began-speaking-in-a-users-cloned-voice-during-testing/">prompt injections</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/anthropic-dares-you-to-jailbreak-its-new-ai-model/">jailbreaks</a>, and that has limited their usefulness in some applications. Imagine a truly ChatGPT-like Siri or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/amazon-must-solve-hallucination-problem-before-launching-ai-enabled-alexa/">Alexa</a>, for example, that could be tricked into saying racist things on behalf of Apple or Amazon.</p>

<p>Beyond language models, the AI voice technology behind the AI Darth Vader voice in Fortnite comes from Respeecher, a Ukrainian startup <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/james-earl-jones-signed-darth-vader-voice-rights-to-disney-for-ai-use/">we covered in 2022</a> that creates new conversations from revitalized old voice recordings. It uses an AI model trained on examples of speech from voice actors that can then synthesize new speech in the same style.</p>
<p>Respeecher previously worked with Lucasfilm on <em>The Book of Boba Fett </em>to recreate young Luke Skywalker's voice and on <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> for Darth Vader's voice performance.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/james-earl-jones-darth-vader-fortnite-ai-1236400633/">Variety</a>, Jones' family supported the Fortnite collaboration, stating: "James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars, and he always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it. We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character."</p>

The latest change to the homescreen section of the Xbox dashboard will be available to Xbox Insiders this week, alongside options to hide system apps, choose the number of apps and games listed, and modify the size of the tiled UI.</p><p>You’ll soon be able to pin up to three of your recently played games or apps to the homescreen. “These pins will stay near the front of the list as you launch other things, giving you quick access to your go-to titles,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/16/xbox-insiders-get-new-ways-to-personalize-home/">explains Eden Marie</a>, principal software engineering lead for Xbox experiences.</p><p>If you don’t want to see system apps listed on the homescreen, you’ll be able to disable these to focus solely on games and apps. If you really want to take customization a step further, you’ll also soon be able to reduce the number of visible tiles in the recently played games and apps list. Microsoft says it’s “refining this setting” and it’ll be available to Xbox Insiders soon.</p><p>Microsoft is making these Xbox Home interface changes because fans have requested more customizability. “We’ve heard from many of you that Home should feel more like your space,” says Marie. “Whether it’s surfacing your favorite games, hiding what you don’t use, or simply making Home feel less crowded, this update is a direct response to that feedback.”</p><p>Microsoft previously tested a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/26/23808139/microsoft-new-xbox-home-ui-available-now-download">big overhaul of the Xbox Home UI</a> in 2022, before shipping it broadly to Xbox owners in 2023.

The good news is it’s easier to see them against the new backdrop, and no individual hit in the combo is dangerous on its own, just <strong>try your damndest not to eat all four strikes</strong>. They also get a second four-hit combo that’s easier to dodge, but the final hit has them flying backwards to charge at you. <strong>There’s a subtle audio cue when the charge is coming, and it’s easily parried.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-spoiler-amano-matsuda<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Popular commanders are getting classic Amano art reprints.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">pre-orders</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mtg-final-fantasy-starter-kit-preorder-where-to-buy-in-stock-amazon">sell out</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-commander-decks-are-packed-with-fun-surprising-references">tons of references are revealed</a>, Magic: The Gathering's upcoming crossover with Final Fantasy is shaping up to be its biggest ever. Today, we get to add to that fun with six cards that are available in the upcoming set: three featuring classic concept art by Yoshitaka Amano, and three with more recent art by Toshitaka Matsuda.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the gallery below to see all six cards</strong>, and read on to learn where to find them yourself:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering x Final Fantasy - 6 Through the Ages Cards</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The cards we are revealing today are part of the "Through the Ages" bonus sheet that is within the larger main set. That means they are all reprints of existing cards reskinned with concept art and characters from different Final Fantasy games - so while there are no brand new or mechanically unique cards here like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-your-first-look-at-over-a-dozen-new-cards-from-magic-the-gatherings-upcoming-final-fantasy-set">the ones that have been shown off recently</a> or those in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">the Commander decks we previously revealed</a>, they do have art that stretches back all the way to the very first game in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the cards in the main set, Through the Ages cards do not become legal in Magic's Standard format (though they still are if the existing card was already legal there, of course), essentially just making them alternate art versions of those cards. That said, they can be found in both the fancier Collector Boosters as well as one in every three of the regular Play Boosters that are used for Limited events like Draft and Sealed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That means if you plan to play a lot of this set either at your local game store or digitally on something like Magic: The Gathering Arena, you are likely to see these cards in action quite frequently. Five of the six cards here are Rares, which means they won't show up as often, but Thrum of the Vestige is notably an Uncommon. That's a reskin for one of Magic's most ubiquitous cards, Lightning Bolt, and I wouldn't be surprised if this particular printing has quite the impact on the set.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Warrior of Light reprinting of Jodah, the Unifier is also certain to be a popular one - Jodah is a powerful and common Commander, and the art used here is Amano's from the Japanese boxart of the original Final Fantasy. Similarly, Amano's iconic art for Final Fantasy 4's Cecil Harvey has been repurposed for one of Magic's strongest partner commanders, Tymna the Weaver, which has only ever been reprinted once before this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These cards launch physically as part of the larger Final Fantasy set on June 13, with the digital versions going live on MTG Arena and MTGO on June 10. And if you are a Final Fantasy fan who isn't into Magic yet, there is still reason to be excited, as FF7 Remake series director Tetsuya Nomura said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-reason-why-sephiroth-has-a-different-design-in-the-magic-the-gathering-set-but-director-tetsuya-nomura-cant-share-more-sparking-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-speculation">the design of Sephiroth on one card is different for some cryptic reason</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

But this city is actually more bite-sized than you might anticipate by the game’s name, offering a brief but enjoyable romp that doesn’t overstay its welcome. If you’d like to know just how long you’ll be spending with this little black kitty, here’s what you need to know.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h369033"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>?</h2><p><em>Little Kitty, Big City</em> is a short game, especially if you overlook any unnecessary side-quests. <strong>If your main goal is to just get our titular kitty back home, you can achieve that in only 2-3 hours</strong>. </p><p><strong>But skipping all of the optional content in the game would be missing some of the most charming parts of this cat’s journey</strong>.

                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/">Switch 2 launch lineup</a> is not exactly bursting at the seams. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/">Mario Kart World</a> is the banner game, the handful of others coming on June 5 are mostly ports of existing games. Among those, Bravely Default is an oddball, as it's an HD remaster of a game that's more than a decade old rather than a modern game like Street Fighter 6 or Cyberpunk 2077 that can finally run on Nintendo hardware. But for my money, Bravely Default is also an all-time RPG classic, and as strange as it feels to be nostalgic for the 3DS era of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a>'s Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster looks to be a great way to play it.</p><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar, Bravely Default was a riff on the classic Final Fantasy formula, making it FF in all but name. Four warriors of light, holy crystals, the whole enchilada. It sported a robust class system that encouraged players to find game-breaking combinations, and it was one of the first to sport the ability to speed up encounters and auto-battle--both now mainstays in classic RPG remakes--or even turn them off entirely. The title referred to one of its battle mechanics, the ability to "Default" (defend and store an extra Brave Point aka BP) or "Brave" (spend extra BP, or even go into BP debt, to take extra actions). So for level-grinding, you could Brave every time to burn through low-level enemies, and against tougher enemies and bosses you would need to take a more considered approach.</p><p dir="ltr">It was followed by the semi-sequel, Bravely Second: End Layer, and a full sequel, Bravely Second. Notably unlike the Final Fantasy series, the Bravely games take place in one consistent canonical world, so the sequels build on the stories and continuity that came before them.</p><p dir="ltr">But like much of the 3DS library, Bravely Default is not exactly easy to play anymore. You need working 3DS hardware and a game cartridge, and unlike Bravely Default 2, it was never released on another platform like Steam. That makes it a prime candidate for the HD remaster treatment, allowing fans to own it in a format that continues well into the future. After a brief hands-on, I'm convinced that Bravely Default will be my most-played Switch 2 game outside of Mario Kart at launch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496384-01_battle_brave_en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4496384" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496384-01_battle_brave_en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4496384"></a><figcaption>The Battle menu in Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496384-01_battle_brave_en.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496385-01_battle_brave_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496386-01_character_tiz01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496387-01_character_tiz02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496389-01_concept02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496390-01_concept03_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496392-01_concept04_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496393-01_job_freelancer_abi01_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496395-01_job_freelancer_abi02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496396-01_system_graphic_new_en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4496385,1300-4496386,1300-4496387,1300-4496389,1300-4496390,1300-4496392,1300-4496393,1300-4496395,1300-4496396" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496385-01_battle_brave_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496386-01_character_tiz01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496387-01_character_tiz02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496389-01_concept02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496390-01_concept03_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496392-01_concept04_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496393-01_job_freelancer_abi01_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496395-01_job_freelancer_abi02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496396-01_system_graphic_new_en.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496385-01_battle_brave_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496386-01_character_tiz01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496387-01_character_tiz02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496389-01_concept02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496390-01_concept03_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496392-01_concept04_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496393-01_job_freelancer_abi01_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496395-01_job_freelancer_abi02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496396-01_system_graphic_new_en.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">To start, the game looks fantastic. The prerendered painterly backgrounds look incredible and vibrant on the big screen, which is all the more impressive when you consider they were originally made to appear on a 3DS. This visual style--your polygonal characters running against a painted backdrop--was itself a throwback to early 3D RPGs like Final Fantasy 7, but it looks especially wonderful here. Meanwhile, the style of the character models themselves largely holds up. It's a testament to the strength of the art style that these characters--squat chibi characters rendered in the unmistakable style of Akihiko Yoshida--still look so elegant in their simplicity. I wasn't able to tinker with the job classes to see the lovely way these models look when donning their various outfits, but I'm looking forward to it.</p><p dir="ltr">The battle system remains untouched as far as I can tell, which is fine by me because it's already perfectly balanced. I only played a little bit of an early area but I know from experience that the combination of the Brave/Default and job-class systems creates some engaging combat puzzles, especially once the game starts challenging you to split its systems wide open. This is a game that absolutely wants to make you feel like you've outsmarted it.</p><p dir="ltr">The newest element is a pair of minigames, which seem well designed even if they're temporary diversions at best. Both use the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/">Switch 2 mouse functionality</a>, challenging you to use both at once in different ways. The first is a rhythm game that has a glowing tether between your two cursors, and so matching the rhythm means lining up the tether to intersect with the music prompts, or hitting exact notes with the cursors themselves. The second is an airship-piloting game set in the first-person perspective of a pilot, so you have to manage steering the ship's wheel while also tending to other tasks. Imagine Steel Battalion but cute, with its massive controller being virtualized on screen. Neither game feeds back into the main game, but you can use the job-class costumes in the minigames as you unlock them for a bit of personalization.</p><p dir="ltr">I doubt I'll play much of the minigames. They're neat little showpieces for the Switch 2 mouse functionality, but they aren't the draw. The real prize is Bravely Default, one of my favorite modern(ish) RPGs, getting a beautiful restoration and being released from 3DS jail. If you haven't played it before, or even if you have, this looks to be the way to experience it.</p>
