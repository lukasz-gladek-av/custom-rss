            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aston-villa-fifa-pes-pro-evo-efootball-avfc-ecl-champions-league<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I know that, among the more online elements of the video game community, there's a certain amount of disdain for sports games. Eww, sports games, or lmao, sports games. Part of that is justified--asking $60 a year for what are becoming increasingly minimal updates to the underlying experience is <em>bold</em>, to say the least--but a lot of it isn't, because it misunderstands a huge element of what playing sports games is about.</p><p>Multiplayer is huge in sports games, whether it's some friends on the couch or online competitions bringing in billions in in-game transaction sales. But these games also ship with singleplayer modes, those modes are popular, and for many people they're popular for one big reason: they're dream factories.</p><p>Let me explain. Sport is <em>cruel</em>. There is usually only one winner, out of many, and so every season the odds of your team coming away with a trophy range from slim to astronomical to none. Doesn't matter where you are in the world or what sport you're following (or playing in a video game), the story is the same. Ask a Lions fan or a Mariners fan, a Suns fan or a Spurs fan and they'll share the same sad stories of what it's like following a team that rarely, if ever, wins <em>anything</em>.</p><p>That hurts! And it's a feeling that compounds annually. The more you see other teams winning, other fans enjoying themselves and revelling in the glory, the more your own team's failures and shortcomings become ever more apparent. You start to wonder, well:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Doesn't Gil get a lick??" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RRWAQ255qhs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Which brings me to Aston Villa Football Club, who I am bound to support through family ties (my great granddad played a few games for them, and my Nan was born around the corner from Villa Park, their home ground). Founded in 1874, Villa are one of the oldest, proudest and--over that <em>entire </em>timespan--most successful sides in English football. The problem is that a lot of that success is front-loaded into the earlier half of the club's 150-year existence, and for most of my lifetime they have swung wildly from plucky upstart to midtable irrelevance to flawed masterpiece.</p><p>In 1981 Villa won the English first division (which would later become the Premier League). In 1982 they went one better and were crowned champions of Europe after defeating German powerhouses Bayern Munich in the final of what was then called the European Cup (and is now the Champions League). It doesn't get any better than that! Villa remain one of only six English sides to <em>ever </em>win it, and topped the whole thing off by beating Barcelona in the European Super Cup not long after.</p><p>That's an incredible run of success, enough to sustain some fans for a lifetime, but I was two years old at the time, so it doesn't mean much to me outside of historical admiration. Instead, all I get to remember is what happened next. Villa were relegated from the first division in 1986, made it back to the first division in time to finish second in 1989/90 and again in 1992 (the first ever season of the Premier League), won a couple of League Cups in the mid-90s and then...all hell broke loose.</p><p>The 28 years following that last League Cup win in 1996 have seen rollercoaster league finishes, a bunch of lost cup finals,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4631238/2023/06/27/villa-structure-emery-sawiris/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> four different owners</a>,<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/aston-villa-remi-garde-english-manchester-united-villa-b2529309.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> another relegation</a>,<a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/villa-steve-bruce-newcastle-united-17017203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> cabbage</a>, late-season collapses, a<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-47523268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> player getting punched by a fan <em>on the field</em></a> and much, much more. And in all that time, Villa haven't won <em>shit</em>. For a club of Villa's size, with its back catalogue of achievements, it's been an agonising wait to achieve anything of note outside of a few runs in smaller European competitions like the UEFA Cup and this year's Europa Conference League.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Celebrating 140 years of Aston Villa" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uAY54jvd8Eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>(For fans of smaller sides who never play in Europe or don't even play in the top flight, I get it, this might sound spoiled! The same way I'd make pissbaby boo hoo faces at a Chelsea fan complaining it's been longer than 12 months since they last won a trophy. I hope you can realise I'm trying to talk about an imbalance in achievements vs the history and size of the club, and how my lifetime in particular has coincided with a relative dry spell!)</em></p><p>For that whole time, I've been in therapy. Not actual therapy, but sports video game therapy. As maligned as they can be, sports video games are very good at allowing fans of the bottlers, choke artists, downtrodden and plain <em>bad </em>teams the chance to dream. If we can't win anything in real life, at least we can win something in <em>FIFA</em>, or <em>Pro Evo</em>, or <em>Madden</em>, games that allow players to simulate alternate timelines where their terrible team can sign a superstar, catch some lucky breaks, beat their rivals and achieve glory. It's not <em>actual </em>glory, but for a brief shining moment, it's <em>something</em>.</p><p>From the early <em>FIFA </em>games through to <em>PES </em>and now back to <em>EA Sports FC</em>, I've been taking charge of Villa and, through career mode playthroughs, transformed the club from inconsistent irrelevance to global powerhouse. I've lost track of the number of stars who have graced my (virtual) Villa Park who would never have signed for the club in real life: Alan Shearer, Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry, Zidane, Pirlo, Aguero, Benzema, Messi, Odegaard and countless others. We've won cups, league titles, banished rivals to the shadow realm, and reigned supreme over English football for years or sometimes (thank you, <em>PES </em>Master League) <em>decades </em>at a time.</p><figure><figcaption>This was an astute signing</figcaption></figure><p>The crowning achievement every season, though, is playing in the Champions League, the chance for the biggest teams around Europe to face off and see who is the best of the best. Playing Brentford a couple of times a season is fine, I guess, but it's <em>way </em>sexier to have midweek nights away at Real Madrid or Milan. Yet every time my (virtual) Villa would embark on a Champions League campaign, it would be pure fantasy, digital wish fulfilment, because since the competition's inception in 1992 Villa have never qualified for the real thing. Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Spurs, Newcastle, Blackburn, Leeds and even Leicester have all had a shot, but never Villa.</p><p>Until now! This week Villa, resurgent under the management of Unai Emery,<a href="https://www.avfc.co.uk/news/2024/may/14/villa-champions-league-reaction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> secured fourth spot in the Premier League and a guaranteed place in next season's Champions League</a>. I know it's not technically <em>winning </em>something, but given the magnitude of the achievement, it feels like it. For the first time ever, I'm going to sit down with a football video game next season and it won't be pure fantasy. Aston Villa will be there in the Champions League, with a seat at the big boy's table, for <em>real</em>. And it's a very weird feeling.</p><p>I'm joyous as a fan, of course. Having been playing in England's second division as recently as 2018 (<a href="https://www.balls.ie/football/aston-villa-crisis-390404" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while on the brink of financial ruin</a>), the thought of squaring off against PSG and Barcelona in the Champions League just six years later is <em>wild</em>. But there's an extra layer of gratification here from my years in the digital desert. I feel like every season of faking it has made the year we actually <em>made </em>it all the more satisfying. All that compounded hurt, those decades spent playing pretend, and now the dream has actually come true.</p><p>It's a nice feeling! And we don't get many of those these days, so I'm going to cherish every second of it.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Benjamin Zephaniah: Ode to Aston Villa" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YVOHu8qYSo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/read-only-memories-neurodiver-review-monolithium</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/read-only-memories-neurodiver-review-monolithium.872409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/read-only-memories-neurodiver-review-monolithium<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s been an uptick to the brightside lately, and that’s excluding the deluge of wholesome games that have become part and parcel of the indie scene as of late. Pessimism is no longer at the forefront, or at the very least, without a contextual reason to be uprooted - even our cyberpunk scene has to be hopeful. At the very least, <em>Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER</em> is an apt example of that.</p>
<p>This is the latest release from California-based developers MidBoss, and a sequel to their modest cyberpunk adventure game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/2064-read-only-memories-review-edited-memories"><em>2064: Read Only Memories</em></a>. Published by Chorus Worldwide Games, <em>Read Only Memories:</em> <em>NEURODIVER </em>fits rather snugly alongside their cozy adventure titles and point-n-click hybrids like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/coffee-talk"><em>Coffee Talk</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/space-for-unbound"><em>A Space for The Unbound</em></a>.</p>
<p>Taking place 6 years after the original’s story involving the breakthrough of sapient machines, <em>NEURODIVER </em>focuses on a new character, ES88, a psychic detective working at MINERVA, a secretive organization specializing in neurotechnology. Together with the genetically engineered and titular “Neurodiver” and potential android flame GATE, you’re tasked with tracking down “Golden Butterfly”, a rogue telepath who has hidden themselves away in various memories of the population of Neo-San Francisco.</p>
<p>In turn, you dive into those memories yourself to unscramble them and figure out Golden Butterfly’s ulterior motive.</p>

<p>From a visual design standpoint, <em>NEURODIVER </em>does well to be pragmatic, not just by paying lip service to similar games like <em>Snatcher</em>, but to the real world as well. It’s a nostalgic burst of escapism contending with what a world would look like with just these technical advancements. It’s too much for flying cars, but under the right conditions, you can have body modifications, and a trans-atlantic train journey to reach California.</p>
<p>Narratively, however, <em>NEURODIVER </em>seems to insist that you have at least a modicum of knowledge in regard to its predecessor. The memory ironically wanes when it comes to my personal recollection of <em>2064: Read Only Memories</em>, not because of its accessible and, quite frankly, endearing world, but because the voice acting was an order too tall to elicit endearment. Thankfully, it’s an option you can turn off, both in <em>2064 </em>and <em>NEURODIVER</em>.</p>
<p>It’s a side story, or at least, feels like one. <em>2064 </em>is a deluge of conspiracies, all surface-level, but feeding into one another to build upward thanks to characterization, punchy moments, and emotional resonance. <em>NEURODIVER</em>, by comparison, is an antithesis of established ethos - not a betrayal of set-up, but an undermining of character, creation, connections, and simple study that either doesn’t trust the player to understand or assumes that they’re not there for thought.</p>

<p>As a game, <em>NEURODIVER </em>takes a hatchet to the point-n-click elements that established <em>2064 </em>in favor of a solitary puzzle element. When ES88 dives into people's memories, it plays out like normal, with ES88 and the recipient in person providing commentary and thoughts about why it’s the memory chosen to be scrambled. Once the corrupted memory shows up, you pick up a small smattering of items found in the memory and jam them together until the memory unscrambles.</p>
<p>It’s a mechanic that quickly loses its luster once you realize just how little <em>NEURODIVER </em>cares about it to begin with. Indeed, once you begin to piece together the major players in the story, the game quickly deflates any expectation, as you don’t get a Neo-San Fran mystery to defy the ages, but a character study of impressively minimal proportions.</p>
<p>The result is a story that forces a static conclusion, one which fails to intensify its necessity and relies on remembrance, funnily enough. Maybe this is the issue when <em>2064 </em>offers up espionage, conspiratorial claims, and technological achievements that’d see Harlan Ellison throw a fit, and the best <em>NEURODIVER </em>can offer is a lack of workplace security. Even with returning characters like Lexi Rivers, TOMCAT, and Turing, the cast is paltry and fails to make a dent in establishing any new faces.</p>

<p>This clearly hurts the new protagonist the most, ES88’s painfully flighty demeanor and unintended arrogance constantly undermining the danger she finds herself in. Instead, <em>NEURODIVER </em>moves at the pace of a hypercar, 3 years going by in the blink of an eye, and ES88 manages to portray that she’s learned next to nothing in her time at MINERVA.</p>
<p>Still, this would all be fine if the writing wasn’t so childish. Characters supposedly learn lessons, providing answers yet it’s never taken to the test, always a cause, but never an effect, nothing connects when it feels like it should. One of the few major story choices that can define how characters view you from that point on has such an absurdly evil position to take, yet its opposite is one of such obvious intent, that ES88 has to crowbar in a moral dilemma.</p>
<p>What is MINERVA? What’s the point of their operations? We’ve seen a world with ravaging wars, androids working overtime so their newfound personalities and titanium alloy skin don’t go to waste, and the best <em>NEURODIVER </em>can offer is tantamount to the Mystery Machine. We’re just short of a talking dog, and a man behind the mask.</p>
<p>The only difference is that there is no mystery here, not at least one that coalesces into a conclusion. <em>NEURODIVER </em>does well to set up, but never pays off exactly what this means for ES88, for MINERVA, for Neo-San Francisco, for the world. This is a fan-fiction, an advert for posters, and a reminder that nostalgia conquers all, and should define each aspect of your position.</p>


<p>It’s easy to fall for <em>Read Only Memories: </em><em>NEURODIVER</em>. When its predecessor offers pronouns and preferences to directly suit you, it’s clear to see that MidBoss wants the world to cultivate you as much as you do it. Here, however, we have a character study of a supposedly sympathetic mule, one whose only parallels to humanity revolve around their taste in media.</p>
<p>Well, unless you work in the military-industrial complex, that is.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
A beautiful picture book with an intriguing mechanic that devolves into flavourless surface-level commentary of consent, character, and childlike curiosities. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p data-characters="344" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Once you’ve gotten a bit of headway into <em>Hades 2</em>, you’ll come across the Fated List, which has a huge list of challenges to complete. These range from using one of every <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-boons-for-the-moonstone-axe-in-hades-2/">Daedalus Hammer Boon</a> for a weapon to killing a certain amount of enemies a specific way. They’re like achievements, only you get more than bragging rights. </p> <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="192" data-injectable="false">One such Fated List item is confusing, even for those like me who’ve put a few dozen hours into the game. Here’s whether you can locate the Three Fates in the <em>Hades 2</em> Early Access.</p> <h2 id="h-can-you-speak-to-the-three-fates-in-hades-2" data-injectable="false">Can you speak to the Three Fates in Hades 2?</h2> <figure data-current-count="492" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">As of writing, the Three Fates have not been added to <em>Hades 2, </em>so this Fated List option is impossible to complete. No matter how much you scour any<em> </em>region or try to beat the final boss, the Three Fates will not appear to you. The closest you can currently get to them is speaking to Lord Moros, provided you’ve progressed enough to have him appear and hang out in the Crossroads next to the Fated List.</p>
 <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="false">While this is pure speculation (and spoiler territory, for those who aren’t far enough in the game), the Three Fates will likely be somewhere in the House of Hades at the end of a run. It’s mentioned several times that Chronos has managed to capture the Three Fates so it’d make sense he’d keep a group that powerful close to his home. Specifics are a little up in the air, but they may be in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-is-zagreus-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zagreus’s room</a> since that’s where you head after defeating Chronos.</p>

<p data-characters="336" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">From November 2023 until now, <em>Warzone</em> has already had several major updates, adding new limited-time game modes, maps, weapons, operator skins, and more. And while there’s only a few months to go before the next installment in the series debuts, Raven Software still has plenty of new events and weekly rotations in the pipeline. </p> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="194" data-injectable="false"> It’s a lot to keep up with. So, to help parse the packed schedule ahead, here’s our <em>Warzone</em> event calendar for ongoing and upcoming updates, seasonal events, and playlists in 2024. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Warzone schedule: Event and seasonal activities for 2024</h2> <p data-characters="151" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">Not every <em>Warzone</em> update entails a playlist or map shakeup.

In 2023, the first stage of WSOW qualifiers was held at the end of April. After qualifiers, the WSOW runs through the rest of the summer, meaning there will be plenty of action to tune into soon.

 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">Ever since <em>Warzone</em> introduced Ranked Play to Resurgence, players started to wonder when the game mode would also be added to Urzikstan.

                <p dir="ltr">Bungie is doing a huge pass on weapons in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> when its next expansion, The Final Shape, releases on June 4. The balance tweaks include a blanket buff to just about all weapons in PvE activities, as well as an adjustment to Divinity--a gun that's essential in lots of high-level play situations--that will probably make it a little more annoying to use.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer dropped an expansive set of details about how weapons are set to change <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/weapon_tuning_the_final_shape">on its website</a>. The big change players are likely to feel immediately is a buff to all weapons against enemies in different activities. That's the result of Bungie removing weapon "spec" mods that give you bonuses to certain kinds of enemies, like minor rank-and-file baddies or bosses. Instead of letting you spec for damage against a specific type of foe, Bungie is boosting the base damage of all your guns against all types of foes.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's Bungie's rundown of how things are changing:</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Increased base PvE damage versus all combatants</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Pulse Rifles: 20%  <ul><li dir="ltr">Exceptions: Graviton Lance and Revision Zero's Heavy Burst mode. (These both have an intrinsic PvE damage buff built in.)</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Pellet Shotguns: 10%  <ul><li dir="ltr">Exceptions: Legend of Acrius, Tractor Cannon, Conditional Finality, and The Fourth Horseman. (These are all already performing as intended.)</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Slug Shotguns: 9%</li><li dir="ltr">Fusion Rifles: 7%  <ul><li dir="ltr">Exceptions: One Thousand Voices. (This one was just buffed.)</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Sniper Rifles: 7%  <ul><li dir="ltr">Exceptions: Izanagi's Burden's Honed Edge shots and Cloudstrike's storm. (These are both performing well.)</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Glaive projectiles: 7%</li><li dir="ltr">Linear Fusion Rifles: 5%</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Increased damage versus Minors (red bars)--this stacks with the base PvE damage increase</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Sidearms, Trace Rifles, Scout Rifles, and Bows: 20%</li><li dir="ltr">Auto Rifles and Pulse Rifles: 15%  <ul><li dir="ltr">For Pulse Rifles, this is in addition to the above buff, and Graviton Lance and Revision Zero's Heavy Burst mode are included.  <ul><li dir="ltr">I.e. Pulse Rifles will do 1.2 * 1.15 = 38% more damage to red bars.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Submachine Guns: 10%</li><li dir="ltr">Hand Cannons: 5%</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Increased damage versus Majors (orange bars)</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Trace Rifles: 20%</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Increased damage globally, including PvP</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Machine Guns: 7%</li><li dir="ltr">Swords: 7%</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Bungie is also making more granular adjustments to various Exotic weapons, depending on how they perform in their designed roles and how players are using them. That mostly means that underperforming guns are getting a boost--but a few, like Divinity, are getting adjustments in the other direction.</p><p dir="ltr">Divinity is a trace rifle that helps teams out by creating a big critical hit spot on enemies, making it pretty crucial in some high-level activities. The trouble is, Divinity lets you get around the intended mechanics of a lot of fights, and it's so useful that it's basically required in certain battles, especially against enemies that move around a lot and are tough to hit. What's more, players have gotten pretty good at using Divinity as effectively as possible by "feathering" their trigger pulls to make ammo last as long as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie isn't changing how Divinity or feathering the trigger work on principle, but it is adjusting the effectiveness of the gun so that it takes longer to create the critical hit spot on an enemy. Divinity will be less efficient and the beam won't last as long, even if you're feathering the trigger, which means it'll be a little less reliable in tough content.</p><p dir="ltr">A few other Exotics and their perks are getting adjusted, mostly to make them more useful in PvE. Dead Man's Tale, Truth, Queensbreaker, The Colony, and Touch of Malice are all getting adjustments and tweaks that'll make them function better against various enemies. Osteo Striga, on the other hand, will be quite a bit less deadly--the poison-spreading submachine gun will now get a four-second cooldown on its poison effect, so you won't be able to blanket a room in infectious death just by killing a few weak enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">That will hopefully have the effect of making more of your guns useful across a greater number of activities. You can check out the full list of adjustments on <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/weapon_tuning_the_final_shape">Bungie's website</a>.</p>

            <p>
Absurd Ventures, the media company established by Rockstar Games co-founder and creative director Dan Houser following his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">departure from the Grand Theft Auto developer in 2020</a>, is working on an "open world action-adventure".
</p>
<p>
Absurd Ventures was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-returns-with-new-media-company-absurd-ventures">formally unveiled last June</a>,  with a mission statement of "building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres" across mediums including of live-action, animation, games, books, graphic novels, and scripted podcasts.
</p>
<p>
November bought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-studio-reveals-graphic-novel-and-audio-drama">news of Absurd Ventures' first two projects</a>, American Caper and A Better Paradise. At the time the company referred to them as two "universes" that would begin as a graphic novel and podcast respectively before expanding across a "wide range of formats and platforms". Both are due to release at some point this year.

<p>
And now, a <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/careers#4366082007">new job listing</a> on the Santa Monica company's website has confirmed it's also working on an "open world action-adventure game" that's aiming to deliver "best-in-class combat and third-person action across multiple game modes."
</p>
<p>
It's not clear if the game will be based on one of Absurd Ventures' previously announced universes, or something new. But it's likely still very early days for the project, given the company's <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/careers">careers page</a> reveals it's currently looking to fill a number of high-level roles, including art director, senior art director, lead designer, lead gameplay designer, senior producer, senior technical director, and technical director.
</p>
<p>
As confirmed toward the end of last year, Rockstar's former vice president of writing Michael Unsworth - who co-wrote both Red Dead Redemption games, and has contributed dialogue to the likes of LA Noire, GTA 4, and GTA 5 - has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-writer-joins-rockstar-co-founders-absurd-ventures-studio">joined Houser at Absurd Ventures</a>. Former Rockstar writer and producer Lazlow Jones is also onboard, serving as an executive producer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-racism<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vovkzbtYBC8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game</a> is set in feudal Japan, which is cool. It stars what appears to be a female ninja and a black samurai based on the historical figure Yasuke, which is also cool. Anyone who tries to argue about whether or not that’s cool is just not worth your time.</p><p>In case you haven’t been paying attention for the last ten or twenty years, video game culture tends to be a repository for the most tedious people on Earth. You know the type—these are the kinds of people who don’t consider mobile games to be “real games,” or who harass women who use their mics in online multiplayer games, or who argue about “historical accuracy” in a video game that has dragons or elves in it. These kinds of people show up in a lot of nerdy hobbies, like tabletop gaming or whatever it is people do on Letterboxd or even enjoying Greek and Roman history.</p><p>From the moment that the key art for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> depicted a black man in samurai garb, I knew that this particular brand of person was going to get ripshit mad. Just look at <a href="https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1790498838089789891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the replies to this tweet</a>. It’s absolute nonsense in there.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Image Source: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure><p>The most amusing replies are the ones that take into question the, of course, historical accuracy of this character. It may be tempting to try to argue with these people, for a lot of reasons, most of all that history and facts are on your side. This character <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appears to be based on Yasuke</a>, a real guy who actually existed in the historical record. He was an African retainer for warlord Oda Nobunaga, meaning that he was indeed a samurai. Yasuke is a well known enough figure that he’s the subject of a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80990863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix anime</a> that is named after him. He’s also a character in <em>Nioh</em>, which was developed by the Japanese studio Team Ninja. You can repeat those facts until you’re blue in the face to people who are determined to be angry about a black man having a leading role in this game, but it won’t matter. You should just save your breath and look forward to seeing whether or not Ubisoft fumbles this very easy layup.</p><p>Racism isn’t a logical position, so you cannot defeat it with logic. Facts just don’t matter to a racist, especially not the tedious kind of racist who makes their home in video game culture. There will always be a new hair to split, a new way for this kind of person to object to a black man being in this video game. You can bring up the other fantabulous aspects of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise that clash with history: the existence of the titular Creed and the Knights Templar; whatever the fuck was going on with the Apples of Eden; the series’ depiction of Karl Marx as a devotee of democracy rather than advocating for an armed revolution of the proletariat. It does not matter because the people who are mad about this have already made up their mind.&nbsp;</p><p>To them, Japan is a place that does not and has never had black people live there or make their homes there at any point in time—especially in history. The anger about “historical accuracy” is just a slightly more reasonable smokescreen for their real objection: having to see a black person at all. Unfortunately, blackness and black people have always been inescapable, both now and in the past. I’m not going anywhere, and I won’t be dragged into an argument about the value of my very existence.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24157588/x-men-97-morph-actor-jp-karliak</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/x-men-%E2%80%9997%E2%80%99s-morph-actor-wants-the-shapeshifter-to-find-love-%E2%80%94-just-not-with-wolverine.872340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157588/x-men-97-morph-actor-jp-karliak<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="dWL9eW">Voice performance has become isolating work over the years — these days, for an actor like JP Karliak, a day “on set” is completed from a home studio, and notes come in over Zoom calls. But the goals are the same: find the perfect sound to match a character, and relentlessly chase the perfect take. Karliak has done voice work across the animation and video game spectrum, and is no stranger to IP demands. He’s been in everything from <em>The Boss Baby: Back in Business</em> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24115481/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-joker-story-unlock-controversy"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></a>, where he played Batman’s nemesis, Joker. Taking over the role of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24102311/x-men-morph-kevin-sydney-97-marvel-nonbinary">Morph</a> in Marvel Animation’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24126226/x-men-97-genosha-e-extinction-morlocks-cassandra-nova"><em>X-Men ’97</em></a>, voiced in the original series by actor Ron Rubin, put him under high pressure from nostalgic fans. Still, alone in the room, he found it: his own pure voice.</p>
<p id="KkeAia">“My natural speaking voice doesn’t sound all that different from Ron’s original portrayal,” Karliak tells Polygon, “[and Morph] has a new look, he’s changing. And all these characters are going through all of this plot. For me, it was just sort of like, <em>Why don’t we just sit him in this grounded space, and not slap a character voice on top of it?</em>”</p>
<p id="A8imin">Along with giving Morph a character redesign, the <em>X-Men ’97 </em>writers evolved them into the animated property’s first non-binary character. Karliak, who identifies as genderqueer, was pleased at the change. In the 1990s, using he/they pronouns was less commonplace, but having Rogue make a point of properly addressing Morph in 1997 fits right into the show’s approach to doing whatever feels emotionally right, continuity and era be damned.</p>
<p id="EKvYRs">“We didn’t fly around and shoot lightning out of our fingers [in 1997 either], so whatever!” Karliak says. “I think the representation is still incredible. And I don’t think it takes away anything from who Morph is. Morph is on a gender journey that will unfold as time passes and he goes through the eras of terminology that we’ve lived through already.”</p>

<p id="0CkShJ">With such a stacked cast, the show doesn’t give Morph a ton of airtime, but their history in the series is deeply felt and considered in each line-reading. <em>X-Men ’97</em> remains in continuity with <em>X-Men: The Animated Series</em>, which saw Sentinels kill Morph in the first episode, only to have Mister Sinister resurrect the shapeshifter as a brainwashed X-adversary. When his friends rescue him, he disappears from the show again to deal with that trauma. </p>
<p id="eMr1Sy">Morph returns in <em>X-Men ’97</em> as a goofy but troubled soul finding a place in the world. Karliak says that even if Morph has three lines in an episode, he found himself running through every variation — pure fury, wisecracking, bawling his eyes out, near-deadpan — with voice director Meredith Layne (<em>Castlevania</em>), to give the director and writers what they need to connect the past with present. “As the comic relief of the show, I think he’s burying a lot of things,” Karliak says. “Having him say less was actually the smarter way to go for somebody who’s internalizing a lot.”</p>
<p id="rjOPi5">Along with voiceover work, Karliak runs the LGBTQIA+ nonprofit <a href="https://www.queervox.org/about-1">Queer Vox</a>, which strives to train aspiring queer VO artists and educate the industry about working with queer talent. He says one quirk of current Hollywood casting is that the group often encounters auditions asking for “non-binary voices,” which he finds funny, despite the attempt at allyship. “It’s like, <em>What does that mean?</em> There’s a lot of conflation of ‘non-binary means androgynous,’ which is not the case,” he says.</p>
<p id="XT3OkY">And what makes Morph enjoyable for Karliak to bring to life isn’t how the character fits a specific identity slot — it’s how his identity fits into the day-to-day drama at the X-mansion, and the greater global drama of <em>X-Men ’97.</em></p>
<p id="domBCV">“He’s a superhero who’s got some trauma, he’s got friends, he’s showing up, he’s doing the thing,” Karliak says. “He probably would like to have a significant other at some point — you know, hint, hint, nudge, nudge — and there’s all of that stuff happening. But there’s never a very special <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oRipJAlW5M">Jesse Spano episode</a> of, like, <em>This is the non-binary episode</em>. Because we don’t need it.”</p>

<p id="yDuuOi">Many fans have wondered whether Morph’s friendship with Wolverine could blossom into something more romantic in future seasons of <em>X-Men ’97</em>. But Karliak hopes it doesn’t, as much as he wants his character to find love. </p>
<p id="nrF82s">“As somebody who’s consumed a ton of queer media over the years — what coded things we had in the ’90s — I think there have been so many stories told about the queer person that’s pining over the straight best friend. Meh!” he says. “It’s kind of meh to me! I think it’s so much more interesting that they love each other like they’re <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/2021/1/27/22252377/return-of-the-king-frodo-sam-gollum-fight-scene-lembas-bread">Frodo and Samwise</a>, and that’s great. It doesn’t need to be more than that. And they can support each other. It makes Morph razzing Wolverine by turning into Jean Grey so much less about like, <em>Oh, I’m jealous, so I’m gonna, like, razz you about your girlfriend who I hate</em>, and more about, <em>Hey, buddy, I think this is harmful for you, and I just want to point this out, that maybe you need to move on</em>.”</p>
<p id="brzpZb">Karliak lauds the <em>X-Men ’97</em> writers room for breaking from obvious stereotypes and traditions to do its own thing. And the work is standing up to all kinds of scrutiny. When the news broke that Karliak would voice Morph as a non-binary character, the usual corners of the internet erupted with vitriol and found their way into his mentions. But now, with the season wrapped up, he’s hearing little pushback. </p>
<p id="lHsjIK">“There are properties, movies, IPs that have tried to do queer representation and done it more as checking a box, and it was received badly when it was announced, and continued to be received badly when the thing bombed,” he says. “And I think what’s great about this is that it’s done authentically, not only from the portrayal, but from the writing, like Beau [DeMayo], but also Charley [Feldman] and all of the other writers. There is a queer pedigree that’s going into this to make this right. So the people that shouted about it before it came out — once everybody saw it, and it’s just so universally lauded, it really silenced everything. You can’t argue with excellence.”</p>

As with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-where-in-the-edz-is-archie/">previous weeks</a>, Ada-1 will offer some insight as to his whereabouts. The Black Armorer indicates our hunt isn’t terrestrial and we should go speak to Eris Morn on the Moon for more info.</p> <h3 id="h-2-eris-morn" data-injectable="false">2. Eris Morn</h3> <figure data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-moon-eris-morn.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="211" data-injectable="false">Eris confirms Archie paid her a visit and was quite intent on playing fetch. In a curious move, Eris didn’t take time from her retirement as a Hive God to play and instead sent Archie to the lunar railgun.</p> <h3 id="h-3-the-lunar-railgun" data-injectable="false">3. The Lunar Railgun</h3> <figure data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-moon-railgun.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Archie’s pawprints can be found atop a small building in Archer’s line, West of Eris’ camp in Sanctuary. Look for where the railgun is collapsed and the two portions are embedded in the ground. The clue states Archie went to the temple where the Guardian woke the Hive.</p> <h3 id="h-4-temple-of-crota" data-injectable="false">4. Temple of Crota</h3> <figure data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-moon-temple-of-crota.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true">The temple in question is the Temple of Crota in the Anchor of Light, East of the Fallen encampment. There will be a group of Hive guarding the entrance, but aren’t much of a threat. Head inside the temple and proceed to the balcony directly across from the entrance to find the next set of pawprints. Just be mindful of the Ritualist of Xivu Arath guarding the spot. Well, that and the dead Guardians looming just outside the window.</p>
 <h3 id="h-5-the-hellmouth" data-injectable="false">5. The Hellmouth</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-moon-hellmouth.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="768" data-injectable="true">This next clue is a little confusing. Archie went to the place where Guardians “took a plunge to defeat a Hive Prince.” This is in reference to the first encounter of the Crota’s End raid. However, this spot can also be accessed in the open world. Go to the Western side of the Hellmouth to find a Hive plate facing the Hellmouth and a Fallen Ketch across the way. Archie’s prints will be right in front of it with a clue to the final location.</p>
 <h3 id="h-6-nezarec-s-pyramid" data-injectable="false">6. Nezarec’s Pyramid</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-moon-pyramid.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true">Archie went to check out the Pyramid hidden in the Moon. If you’ve been a longtime <em>Destiny 2</em> player, then you’ll remember how awe-inspiring this moment was during the <em>Shadowkeep</em> campaign. However, remembering where it is might be another story.</p>
 <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">Go to the Scarlet Keep in Sorrow’s Harbor. Rather than taking the right path like you would in the eponymous strike, go through the left door and follow it until you reach the Pyramid. With the Witness gone and Nezarec mixed in with an herbal tea, there’s no risk of Archie falling under the Darkness’ influence. Offer some pawsitive reinforcement and zip back to Ada-1.</p> <h3 id="h-return-to-ada-1" data-injectable="false">Return to Ada-1</h3> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="783" data-injectable="false">Ada-1 won’t offer much insight regarding Archie’s excursion. For players, it’s another nice trip down memory lane. As for the pooch’s gift, “A Cool Rock,” there’s not much that I can say about it. If it’s a reference, I’m not understanding it and the community isn’t going bananas about it. I guess it will make for a nice paperweight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/15/report-more-xbox-games-coming-to-ps5-as-part-of-the-latitude-project/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A&nbsp; report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Windows Central</a> written by Jez Corden has revealed that the codename for Microsoft’s plan to make it’s games multi-platform is ‘Latitude’. The name seems fairly on the nose as it means “scope for freedom of action or thought”, or in this case, freedom for Microsoft to put their games on rival consoles.</p>
<p>Jez goes on to say that “More upcoming Microsoft-owned games slated for PlayStation are already being developed. At least for now, they’re potentially obvious games you’d most likely expect.”</p>


<p>Games developed by Microsoft owned companies are limited this year, Hellblade 2 is just weeks away and then there is only Indiana Jones – which they have already <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/15/four-xbox-games-are-coming-to-other-consoles-but-not-starfield-or-indy/">said is not coming to PS5</a> – and Avowed from Obsidian.&nbsp; Further out we have the likes of Blade and The Elder Scrolls 6.</p>
<p>If they do want to make some money and not damage the Xbox brand too heavily it seems that Blade and Indy are the obvious games to go multiplatform, they are big names and will sell by the bucket load. Porting something iconic such as Forza, Fable, or Halo to PlayStation would not be popular with the Xbox community. However, “Microsoft is pushing for no “red line” for what games could come to PlayStation,” reports Jez.</p>
<p>There are plenty of smaller&nbsp;exclusive games not developed by Microsoft but published by them that could make the jump such as Ara: History Untold, Towerborne, and Contraband.</p>

<p>Rare’s Sea of Thieves has been a hit on PlayStation, topping the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/09/playstation-store-april-2024s-top-downloads/">download chart</a> in the EU and coming in at third place over in the United States.&nbsp; Obsidian’s Grounded also did well earning mid chart placing in both regions.</p>
<p>Microsoft have been sending mixed messages about their plans, “There is no fundamental change to exclusivity” said Phil Spencer, while Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has said “We are committed to meeting players where they are by bringing great games to more people on more devices”.</p>

Though <em>VGC </em>does highlight that the game’s box art only makes mention of needing an internet connection to <em>install</em> the game specifically, the move still reeks of bad business on Ubisoft’s part.</p><p>A mandate like this isn’t new for Ubisoft, though, as last year’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Avatar: Frontier of Pandora</em></a></span><em> </em>had the same requirement, and this summer’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-always-online-internet-install-disc-1851400377&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-always-online-internet-install-disc-1851400377"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a></span> will push it on players again. Still, it’s a frustrating tactic! Selling customers a single-player game that can’t be played without an internet connection is not only a big fuck up, it’s straight up anti-consumer. </p><p>The games industry doesn’t seem ready to reckon with the fact that not all of its consumers have internet connections. It’s bad enough that increasingly huge games have made it more work than it’s worth to set your console or PC to download a game that may or may not take the entirety of an evening (and in some cases a day or two!) to finish. In many parts of the world, internet connections aren’t necessarily stable or capable of constant service. Internet connections aren’t cheap either, and for some, maintaining the services of an internet service provider is simply too costly.</p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to Ubisoft for comment.</p><p>Past Ubisoft games with the same requirement suggest that the online connection will be leveraged to deliver a day-one patch that makes the game playable. What are folks without the internet supposed to do in this case, though?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-players-fear-the-worst-about-urzikstans-future/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=warzone-players-fear-the-worst-about-urzikstans-future<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="162" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Six months of waiting has <em>Warzone </em>players champing at the bit for Ranked Play to be added to Urzikstan, but anticipation has devolved into frustration and doubt. </p> <p data-characters="622" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1790761650481479748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warzone</a> asked players if they would be disappointed if Ranked Play wasn’t added to Urzikstan this year, and frustrated community members voiced their frustrations in the comment section. It also didn’t help that CharlieIntel added more fuel to the fire by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1790764640302932349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting</a> that the devs spoke about adding the game mode in January, but have been radio-silent since. Going back even further, in October, 2023, CharlieIntel <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1709993959924310389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that Ranked Play would be added to Urzikstan in 2024. As we approach late May, that release window appears to have been pushed back to the dismay of traditional battle royale fans.</p>
 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">In response to the mixed reports, <em>Warzone</em> content creator IceManIaac <a href="https://x.com/IceManIsaac/status/1790759206275944640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “We eagerly waited 3.5 years for the big map Warzone Ranked, only to have it removed 6 months later at the MW3 launch and still yet to have it back 6 months after that.” </p> <figure data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">At this point, some players don’t care as much about Ranked Play coming over; they want Warzone’s large map to receive new content in light of a recent drought of updates to Urzkikstan. “Ranked would be amazing, but just some BR attention would be even better,” Warzone Loadout argued. “New POIs, Specialist, Foresight, fan-favorite mode like Iron Trials or Buybacks, etc.” </p>
 <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">As part of the March Season 2 update, Treyarch introduced Ranked Play Resurgence to accompany the returning small-scale map Fortune’s Keep. Then, at the start of the Season in early April, the devs showed more love to Resurgence by bringing back Fortune’s Keep and moving Ranked Play over to the popular map. Urzikstan did not get any new POIs, substantial changes, or Ranked Play throughout both seasons, leading to questions about the map’s future. </p>
 <p data-characters="520" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="false">Resurgence established a passionate fan base because the small-scale map and respawn mechanics encourage fast-paced, easy-to-pick-up gameplay. Meanwhile, Urzikstan suffers from players not getting into as many engagements and players being forced to find a new match after dying. The <em>Warzone</em> devs have made it clear that there is more support for Resurgence at the moment as indicated by the wealth of new content, and it’s unclear if there any imminent plans to enhance the traditional battle royale experience. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2-the-pantheon-rhulk-indomitable-guide.872274/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-pantheon-rhulk-indomitable-guide/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=destiny-2-the-pantheon-rhulk-indomitable-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="315" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The third week of&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s The Pantheon has kicked off, with Rhulk taking the reins as head honcho. Naturally, players will still have to prove themselves worthy enough to face the Disciple by carving a path through the foes already faced in The Pantheon: Atraks Sovereign and&nbsp;The Pantheon: Oryx Exalted.</p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">The Pantheon is a four-week event centered around a Raid boss rush that increases in difficulty as each week passes. The first week pit players against four bosses led by Atraks at a -5 Power disadvantage, and week two presented five bosses led by Oryx at a -10 Power disadvantage. For The Pantheon: Rhulk Indomitable, players face a -15 Power disadvantage and six bosses, with Rhulk as the finale.</p> <h2 id="h-modifiers-matter" data-injectable="false">Modifiers matter</h2> <figure data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">As with previous iterations of&nbsp;The Pantheon, there are some modifiers to consider before rushing in to take on Rhulk Indomitable. For one, Class Warfare returns from the first week of The Pantheon. This buff is ultra important, especially with the -15 Power, as it provides a 10% damage buff and damage resistance after using a Class ability. Class Warfare can stack up to three times and applies to all Guardians near the player that used their Class ability.</p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">In addition to Class Warfare, The Pantheon: Rhulk Indomitable features an Arc and Stasis Surge, empowering weapons of either elemental affinity. This will undoubtedly mean players will have to change their loadouts and alter damage strategies to incorporate either Arc or Stasis weapons, ensuring the Fireteam makes use of the damage buff. Guardians will need it with the -15 Power disadvantage.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">The first five bosses</h2> <figure data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="272" data-injectable="false">Like The Pantheon: Oryx Exalted, the lead-up to Rhulk is paved with the challenges from previous weeks of The Pantheon. Players will face the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-pantheon-atraks-sovereign-guide/" rel="noreferrer noopener">four bosses from Atraks Sovereign</a>&nbsp;first, followed by the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-pantheon-oryx-exalted-guide/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oryx Exalted encounter</a>&nbsp;before they can take on Rhulk.</p> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">While there are no new surprises for the first five bosses, players will feel the difference of the -15 Power disadvantage. Damage must be coordinated and tight, especially if players aim for the par time on each encounter to unlock the Godslayer Title.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Rhulk</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">Rhulk mechanics</h3> <p data-characters="701" data-current-count="1001" data-injectable="true">Rhulk is the final boss in the Vow of the Disciple and the last obstacle in The Pantheon: Rhulk Indomitable. The arena is separated into two parts, with the first phase occurring downstairs, where the Rally flag and plate are, and the second phase up some stairs further ahead. For the regular version of the fight, the group will want to separate into three teams of two. One team will handle coordination and ad clear while the other two teams pass buffs around and dunk on the alters in the arena. Each buff team should have one runner and one player on plate duty. For ease of explanation, let’s call one plate and runner group Team 1, the other Team 2, and the ad clear/coordinators Team 3.</p>
 <p data-characters="668" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">Once the encounter starts, Rhulk will cast an orange bubble barrier over a large part of the arena.&nbsp;Rhulk will also summon a large Darkness Crux above him, and the Team 2 plate player should destroy this, providing the Leeching Force buff. If they stand on the plate with Leeching Force, two more Crux will appear — one on the left and one on the right. Now, each of the two Team 1 players can shoot a Crux to receive Leeching Force. Finally, the plate player on Team 1 should get back on the plate to create two more Crux for Team 2. After those are destroyed, Team 1 should have one player with Leeching Force, and Team 2 will have both players with the buff.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="586" data-current-count="886" data-injectable="true">While this is happening, players not actively involved in splitting Leeching Force should work on the ads appearing around the six Obelisks in the arena. A yellow-barred Glyphkeeper will appear at the closest Obelisks on the left and right side, and those are a priority so Team 3 can begin reading and coordinating the other teams. Once both Glyphkeepers are down, players with Leeching Force can read the left side, and players without can read the right. Team 3 wants to identify the common symbol between the two reads, which will determine which Obelisks Teams 1 and 2 can dunk at.</p>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">With the read ready and three players with Leeching Force, the next step is to dunk the buff six times. However, players can’t dunk Leeching Force as is. After the first split, Rhulk will begin moving to the arena’s left, right, or center rear to perform a giant laser beam attack. If runners with Leeching Force allow themselves to get hit by the laser, Leeching Force will turn into Emanating Force, and this buff can be dunked.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">Runners can start getting Emanating Force as soon as they have Leeching Force. Just remember to always ensure one plate player remains with Leeching Force, as Emanating Force cannot be split on the plate. If players accidentally end up without any player with Leeching Force, Rhulk will offer his large Crux one more time before wiping the Fireteam if the buff is lost a second time.</p> <figure data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true">It’s recommended that both runners with Leeching Force get Emanating Force together to double-dunk, speeding up the whole process. After the dunk, the lone plate player (Team 2) should get back on the plate with Leeching Force to start the buff juggling all over again. The Fireteam won’t need to worry about another set of Glyphkeepers, but the dunk positions will change to different Obelisks after each set.</p>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">Once six Emanating Force buffs are dunked, players can stop splitting their buffs and start to tread toward the stairs at the back of the room. Following one more push of adds, Rhulk’s barrier will disappear, and players can head up to the second floor. In this smaller chamber, Rhulk will be attacking players head-on. He has a charge attack, powerful kicks, and a multi-directional laser beam.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="652" data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true">Upstairs, players will want two runners and everyone else reading. Each time Rhulk charges, he’ll drop his glaive nearby. When one of the runners destroys it, they’ll get the Leeching Force buff, which can become Emanating Force by intercepting one of his lasers. Immediately after the glaive is destroyed, Guardians without Leeching Force will be able to see a symbol where the glaive was. This symbol corresponds to one of the four Obelisks in the corners of the square arena, where the runner must dunk their Emanating Force. I’d recommend assigning the L1 and L2 on the left side, with R1 and R2 on the right for ease of callouts.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="845" data-injectable="true">After each Emanating Force dunk, a piece of Rhulk’s armor will glow on either his arms or legs. This is the key to triggering the damage phase, which only occurs after four pieces of his armor are destroyed. Once that happens, Rhulk will change color, grow spikes out of his body, and begin attacking more aggressively, signaling that damage has started. When the damage phase ends, Rhulk will crouch down and begin casting his bubble barrier again. Players must retreat to where the plate is downstairs or risk getting tossed off the map.</p>
 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">When players manage to push Rhulk far enough, he’ll go into a final stand. This is functionally no different from his damage phase, but players will accrue Emanating Darkness, which starts to make things harder to see and kill players at ten stacks.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Rhulk changes</h3> <p data-characters="612" data-current-count="867" data-injectable="true">The most significant change for the Rhulk Indomitable fight is the presence of a Rhulk clone when players head up to the second floor. This clone appears shortly after Rhulk starts attacking players, spawning from a miniature pyramid. The Rhulk clone cannot be damaged and does not drop a glaive or shoot lasers to provide players with Leeching or Emanating Force. He does, however, follow Guardians around and try to kick them to death. And with the -15 Power disadvantage, those kicks&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;hurt. If players need a little extra help surviving those legs, try equipping a Melee Damage Resistance mod.</p>
 <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">Other than the Rhulk clone, Tormentors spawn on the first and third dunks downstairs. While Tormentors sound scary going in, Divinity and some concentrated fire make short work of the foes. Otherwise, it is just a battle to survive Rhulk’s dual assault and put out enough damage to bring him to a swift defeat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-90s-anime-and-how-to-watch-them/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-90s-anime-and-how-to-watch-them<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="276" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Remember the ’90s? It’s already been 50 years — provided you’re reading this in 2040, that is. Jokes aside, one of the best things to break into the American mainstream in the ’90s was anime, and it wasn’t just because the markets demanded so. </p> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="175" data-injectable="false">The ’90s saw the birth and growth of some of the greatest and most influential anime in existence, so let’s look at some of the best outings of that glorious time.</p> <figure data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Netflix</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-neon-genesis-evangelion" data-injectable="false">Neon Genesis Evangelion</h2> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">If you were a kid watching anime in the ’90s, it’s likely that <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> taught you the valuable lesson that anime, too, can introduce you to messed up-stuff you didn’t expect to see in cartoon form. Even that’s reductive, though, as <em>Evangelion</em> is so much more than just characters and viewers screaming into the void</p> <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="885" data-injectable="true">Its dark imagery and themes are at the core of what makes Gainax’s series special. <em>Evangelion</em> began its life as an answer to the popular mecha series of its time, in which there was always a super-powerful robot perfectly equipped to defeat all the enemies of humankind. Even when these mechas work well, there’s always a toll, physical or psychological, to the literal children piloting them. Give this one a try if you want to have a lot of “mecha” action fun <strong>and</strong> are ready to deal with the consequences.</p>
 <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="17" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Netflix</p> <figure data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Steam</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-serial-experiments-lain" data-injectable="false">Serial Experiments Lain</h2> <p data-characters="576" data-current-count="893" data-injectable="true">You might not know this series, but you’re very likely to have already seen the face of Lain, its protagonist, somewhere on the Internet. That’s a very interesting testament to the staying power of this ’90s anime about, among many other things, the random disconnect that some feared could engulf society with the predicted massification of Internet use. <em>Lain </em>was meant to serve as an inquisitive and thought provoking sci-fi tale, and it totally works as just that, but it’s also one hell of a cautionary tale, if that’s what you want it to be.</p>
 <p data-characters="35" data-current-count="35" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime</p> <figure data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Cowboy Bebop - Opening | Tank!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EL-D9LrFJd4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-cowboy-bebop" data-injectable="false">Cowboy Bebop</h2> <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="786" data-injectable="true">American anime fans who don’t care for American cartoons because “anime is made from the heart, whereas <em>Transformers</em>, <em>He-Man</em> and the like got shows because Hasbro and Mattel wanted to sell you toys” can’t say that about <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>. The legendary genre-mixing and bridge building anime got greenlit as a ploy to sell — you won’t guess it — <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/829618/the-original-plan-for-cowboy-bebop-was-nothing-more-than-a-cash-grab/">spaceship toys</a>, and it somehow still ended up as one of the best anime ever.</p>
 <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="224" data-injectable="false">Even though it’s over 20 years old now, the animation, the characters, the overall heart of the show and, obviously, the soundtrack, make <em>Cowboy Bebop </em>one of the most memorable experiences you can get out of all media.</p> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Hulu, Crunchyroll</p> <figure data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-initial-d" data-injectable="false">Initial D</h2> <p data-characters="738" data-current-count="738" data-injectable="true">Whether or not it’s the actual inspiration, watching <em>Initial D</em> for the first time nowadays might bring you to the realization that you’re watching <em>One Punch Man</em> with cars. Yes, while I expected something along the lines of the anime version of <em>Fast And Furious</em> — another series it might have greatly inspired — I ended up getting a hilarious multi-series story about a young driver so good that his main challenge in life is his failure to care about racing as much as all the drift sickos around him. The 3D-animated cars look a bit jarring at first, and the soundtrack is an acquired taste, but this classic never fails to bring in the laughter and the most thrilling racing moments ever put to the small or big screens.</p>

It follows the monster-of-the week structure you see in so many American tv shows, but then becomes so much more. It’s a comedy at heart, one that follows a legendary klutz who leads a great cast of characters, but, unlike the <em>Pokémon</em> series, <em>Sailor Moon</em> knows when to grow out of its original formula when the plot gets more serious towards the end of each season. </p>

I can, and, even though I’m not the biggest <em>Pokémon</em> fan, I must admit that it simply was a less fun place. <em>Pokémon</em> started its one-two-punch quest for global domination with the Game Boy video games, but its anime companion also played a huge role into making <em>Pokémon</em> the juggernaut that it seemingly will never stop being. The plot of each episode is simple and formulaic enough that you could probably get a random generator to make them, but the characters and the cuteness make Ash’s quest to become the greatest trainer in the world one of the most endearing series of all time.</p>

 <p data-characters="635" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">If there’s a neverending debate surrounding who’d win in a fight between Goku and Superman, that’s because Goku is the strongest fictional hero from Japan, yes, but also because he’s its most popular. There’s no comparison when it comes to a positive role model for men in anime (though there are far better parents out there!), nor a more influential shonen. Watch it for the legacy value, yes, but also because it remains an absolute blast to watch. Any person of my age can attest to that as we’re all cursed to not be able to spend a whole month without re-watching some banger <em>DBZ</em> clips online.</p>

The original <em>Berserk</em> anime doesn’t even have an actual ending, and its still one of the greatest anime of all time. This is one of the darkest and most well-realized anime ideations of European fantasy, and a known influence in the <em>Souls</em> series. Consider giving it a go so long as you’re ok with some considerably disturbing imagery and themes.</p>
 <p data-characters="35" data-current-count="35" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime</p> <figure data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Toei Animation</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-one-piece" data-injectable="false">One Piece</h2> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece</em> only began airing in 1999, so it didn’t really earn its juggernaut status in the ’90s. Still, it’s clearly the anime that learned more right lessons from <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, and the one that has been passing them on to so many other anime that came after. </p>
 <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking for a <strong>long-running</strong> shonen about pirates that will bring to you the biggest and coolest cast of characters and some of the most memorable moments in anime of the past three decades (and counting), then this is the one <s>piece missing in your life</s> for you.</p> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Crunchyroll, Hulu</p> <figure data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-digimon-adventure" data-injectable="false">Digimon Adventure</h2> <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">The original Digimon anime exists because of the success of <em>Pokémon</em>, but, like many of the greats, it’s less of a ripoff and more of response. Whereas <em>Pokémon</em> went no further than just showing the daily life of a boy in a quest, <em>Digimon</em> kicked the formula into high gear by throwing a bunch of kids into a cool but incredibly dangerous world. No more waking up to hopefully capture a new <em>Pokémon</em> and earn a new gym badge. </p>
 <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">These kids weren’t having fun trying to capturing <em>Digimon</em> — they were the ones captured by the world of <em>Digimon</em>, and the only possible quest here was finding a way to escape it. The cast is great, the monster design is edgier and arguably cooler than that of <em>Pokémon</em> and the fights were just much more brutal. <em>Digimon</em> is darker, scarier, and, thus not just a great alternative to <em>Pokémon</em>, but an all-timer on its own right.</p>
 <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Crunchyroll, Hulu</p> <figure data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-yu-yu-hakusho" data-injectable="false">Yu Yu Hakusho</h2> <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true">I haven’t seen <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em>, but editor Eric Van Allen warned me that the gods of old Anime might take offense from me not putting it on this list, so you can find his words on it below:</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true"> <p><em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em> is a classic, yet still somehow underrated compared to the other giants of shonen storytelling. Yusuke Urameshi’s journey into the afterlife, becoming an Underworld Detective immersed in cases surrounding demons and ghosts in our world, holds up surprisingly well to this day. The art and animation is fantastic, and each battle is a joy to watch, especially in the excellent Dark Tournament arc. Sure, Goku has the Kamehameha, but Yusuke’s Spirit Gun is its own kind of iconic. Anyone looking to understand how ’90s anime turned a generation of Toonami watchers into anime aficionados should spend some time watching <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em>.</p> <cite>– Eric Van Allen, known Toonami watcher</cite></blockquote>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamers-can%E2%80%99t-get-enough-of-king-charles%E2%80%99-new-portrait.872265/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/gamers-cant-get-enough-of-king-charles-new-portrait/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gamers-cant-get-enough-of-king-charles-new-portrait<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="289" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">King Charles III’s first official portrait was revealed to the world on Tuesday, May 14, and the Internet’s response has been<em> enthusiastic</em>. The painting, created by British artist Jonathan Yeo, has taken the web by storm, but few seem to love it more than the gaming community.</p> <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">To be fair to all parties involved, the King of England was on gamers’ radars well before his new portrait was unveiled. Charles’ May 6 coronation, a lavish ceremony even by royal standards, was <em>ruthlessly</em> memed about by gamers, many of whom compared the regalia-clad monarch to a high-level <em>Elden Ring</em> character. Fortunately for those invested, Yeo’s bold and controversial portrait of the United Kingdom’s new king has breathed new life into what was becoming a stale joke.</p>
 <h2 id="h-king-charles-portrait-fuels-a-memetic-inferno-that-s-been-burning-for-a-while" data-injectable="false">King Charles’ portrait fuels a memetic inferno that’s been burning for a while.</h2> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">Most onlookers agree that the painting, which features a striking backdrop many have likened to a veil of blood-red flames, is at least a little unnerving. Being who we are, gamers quickly compared it to the menacing portraits of villains that pop up in the late-game areas <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dark-souls-archthrones-souls-mod-demo-out-now/">of many FromSoftware titles</a>, which usually give the player a sneak preview of the foes they’ll face before the credits role. </p>
 <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true">On X (formerly known as Twitter), user Lathrix bluntly stated what was on many gamers’ minds, <a href="https://twitter.com/Lathrix/status/1790501443452989542" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioning in this post</a> that King Charles’s picture looks like something you’d run into in a <em>Dark Souls</em> game. Others felt that the portrait was more at home inside <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s Volcano Manor, while some likened them to the <em>Dishonored </em>series’ collectible Solokov paintings and “Target Assassinated” icons.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Post: Andrey Mironov</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true">FromSoftware titles aren’t the only games that King Charles’ painting has been dropped into. One X user, Senn, edited the portrait over <a href="https://twitter.com/senn_twt/status/1790518505634480157">one of the mind-meltingly isometric walls of the first <em>Doom</em> game.</a> The portrait has even been compared to artwork outside of games, like the still-lifes of artist Ivan Albright and the painting of Vigo the Carpathian featured in <em>Ghostbusters 2</em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Post: HappyToast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="false">The gaming community’s reception of King Charles’ portrait may seem harsh at first, but it’s tame compared to the response from other onlookers. If anything, the painting’s reception amongst games proves that it has impacted the public, for better or for worse.</p>

  <p id="2ay04j"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24094854/3-body-problem-review-spoiler-free">Netflix’s adaptation</a> of Cixin Liu’s novel <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24105247/3-three-body-problem-what-why-unsolvable-netflix-liu-cixin"><em>The Three-Body Problem</em></a> and its sequels is coming back for a second season, and potentially more, the streaming service announced on Wednesday. It seems that the renewal is for however many seasons the series needs to wrap up. The announcement came with a quote from the series’ showrunners that’s focused on the end of the series, though they don’t specify how many seasons that might involve. </p>
<p id="8Yozw4">“We’re thrilled that we get to tell this story through to its epic conclusion. Ever since we read the last page of Cixin Liu’s magnificent trilogy, we hoped we’d be able to bring the audience to the end of the universe with us. Here we go!” said a <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1790823262479437988">statement Netflix posted on X</a>, credited to showrunners David Benioff, D.B. Weiss, and Alexander Woo. </p>
<p id="2DZkIF"><a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/3-body-problem-renewed-season-2-netflix-1236004233/">According to Variety</a>, Netflix also said it will announce at a later date just how many episodes and seasons are left in the <em>3 Body Problem</em>, but for now, it seems like we can trust that the creative team behind the show will get to finish telling the story. While this isn’t a massive surprise, considering how popular the first season was, Netflix <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/why-does-netflix-keep-cancelling-its-best-shows-3530976">has a reputation for cancelling shows</a> just as they’re getting going. So the assurance that we’ll get a real ending for <em>3 Body Problem</em> should be reassuring to fans who have been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2017/6/12/15782150/sense8-netflix-cancel">burned by Netflix cancellations</a> in the past. </p>
<p id="zXZxZF">As for how many seasons the show might end up running, that remains up for debate. Given that the first season of the show covered the entire first book in the trilogy, as well as parts of books two and three, it’s entirely possible that Benioff, Weiss, and Woo could finish up the story in season 2. However it seems more likely that the show will run for three or four seasons, if <a href="https://collider.com/3-body-problem-season-2-netflix/">Benioff’s previous quotes</a> are to be believed. </p>
<p id="OObRQe">There’s no word yet on when <em>3 Body Problem</em> will return to Netflix, though it’s likely that it won’t happen until 2025 at the earliest. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-new-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>We all know there is a brand-new Call of Duty on the horizon. With the number of leaks and teasers indicating an upcoming reveal during June’s Xbox Games Showcase, it’s just a matter of counting down the hours. But is the new Call of Duty Black Ops 6?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-coming-soon">Is Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Coming Soon?</h2>



<p>As it turns out, according to additional leaks from a dataminer, references to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, codename Cerberus, indicate we’ll see a reveal sooner than the Xbox Games Showcase next month. Supposedly, we’ll see the reveal this month, in May, and yes, it’s Black Ops 6 and not Black Ops 5. For whatever reason, everyone believes it to be Call of Duty: Black Ops 5. They forget about Black Ops Cold War, the only one in the side series not to feature a number, but it’s still a Black Ops game through and through!</p>



<p>So, what about the Xbox Games Showcase in June? Supposedly, the upcoming Call of Duty game will feature at the showcase, likely with gameplay and additional pre-order information. Still, the reveal occurs within the next two weeks here in May. </p>



<p>Typically speaking, the first-person shooter franchise launches near the end of the year, usually between October and November, so we’ll likely end up with a Black Ops 6 release date in June and a full release at the end of this year!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">What is Call of Duty Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>If the previous leaks prove correct, Call of Duty Black Ops 6 aims to shake up the franchise. It’s set during the Gulf War, features an open-world campaign, and the studio behind this entry worked tirelessly to build the experience from nothing. It’s not a rehash of previous titles, with copy/paste maps coming to multiplayer, though I wouldn’t be surprised if we don’t see a few old-school Black Ops maps at or shortly after launch. </p>



<p>According to reports Insider Gaming discovered in February, players will use vehicles to traverse the game world. But if you don’t feel like wandering the world, there’s a fast-travel system in place.</p>

<p>What do you think about the new Call of Duty? Is it on your radar? In the meantime, check out what else Insider Gaming offers:</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Apex Legends: Altered Horizons Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Since joining the Apex Games, Horizon has had a singular goal: getting back to her son, Newton. Prior to joining the Games, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8evR9KmlrBU">Horizon was left for dead in a black hole by Ash</a>, and though she managed to escape it, she got back to her home on Olympus over 80 years too late. Her son had already grown up, lived a life, and passed away. Horizon now spends every spare second looking for a way to get back to her son and seems to think the Time Gauntlet is the answer. After finally getting her hands on it, she's spent months trying to get it functional, but all her attempts thus far have failed.</p><p dir="ltr">In today's trailer (titled Altered Horizons), new Legend <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-apex-legends-season-21-gameplay-trailer-reveals-alters-abilities/1100-6523154/">Alter</a> appears, interrupting Horizon's work, snatching up the Time Gauntlet, and transporting Horizon, Lifeline, and Mirage through various portals that lead to mysterious dimensions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4303559-yoink.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303559" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4303559-yoink.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303559"></a><figcaption>Using her ability to open portals, Alter snatches up the Time Gauntlet while Horizon is distracted.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4303559-yoink.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"They don't believe in you like I do," Alter sneers from her perch atop a guard rail after incapacitating both of Horizon's teammates. "<em>I</em> know what you are capable of."</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't know you!" Horizon pleads, clearly confused.</p><p dir="ltr">"But <em>I</em> know you," Alter replies with a sinister grin.</p><p dir="ltr">Having finally had enough, Horizon begins fighting back.</p><p dir="ltr">"Not bad, but you're not as exciting as all the <em>other</em> Mary Somers," Alter teases, confirming she's met various versions of Horizon before, and possibly implying Alter herself could even be a different version of Horizon.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Horizon gives Alter a swift kick to the tail before drawing her weapon and pointing it at the dimension-hopping enigma's head.</p><p dir="ltr">"Now <em>there's</em> the Mary Somers I'm looking for," Alter all but purrs. "I'm not your enemy, Doctor. Newton needs you."</p><p dir="ltr">"You wanna make that thing work? I have what you need," Alter explains, referring to the Time Gauntlet, which is now back in Horizon's possession. "If you want it, you know where to find me."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4303560-horizon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303560" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4303560-horizon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303560"></a><figcaption>Unfortunately for Horizon, time travel is a risky endeavor. One of Titanfall 2's NPCs is killed while attempting to use the Time Gauntlet.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4303560-horizon.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Alter produces a calling card featuring the infamous Predator logo--suggesting she may be involved involved with <a href="https://apexlegends.fandom.com/wiki/Apex_Predators" rel="nofollow ">the Mercenary Syndicate</a>--then disappears into her shattered-glass portal, leaving Horizon (and viewers) with countless questions.</p><p dir="ltr">When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-lead-writer-confirms-season-20s-ties-to-titanfall-teases-new-animated-series/1100-6520816/">GameSpot spoke to Apex Legends lead writer Ashley Reed</a> earlier this year, she confirmed that a new, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-apex-legends-animated-short-suggests-a-legend-may-die/1100-6519325/">Kill Code</a>-esque animated web series was on the way, along with a new villain who "may not be who [players] expect." Respawn has referred to Alter as the franchise's new villain in some of Season 21's promotional material, and after reaching out to the developer, GameSpot received confirmation that this new animated short isn't a late launch trailer. Instead, it's the first episode of the aforementioned animated series, which will seemingly focus on the relationship between Alter and Horizon--and the fate of Titanfall 2's infamous Time Gauntlet.</p><p>Will Alter actually help Horizon reach her son? Only time will tell.

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/06/the-division-heartland-announced-standalone-free-to-play-game-coming-out-in-2021-22/">The Division Heartland</a> has been cancelled by Ubisoft, with the publisher confirming the news in a statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">IGN</a>. The major reason for the cancellation is that Ubisoft will be redeploying its resources to focus on other projects like xDefiant and Rainbow Six. The team at Red Storm Entertainment, the developers of The Division Heartland, will be redeployed to the other projects.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Division Heartland: Cinematic Intro" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpgpc0pGLFE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the statement, Ubisoft said, <em>“After careful consideration, we have made the tough call to halt development on Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland, effective immediately. Our priority now is to support the talented team members at our Red Storm Entertainment studio, who will be transitioning to new projects within our company, including XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”</em></p>
<p>The Division Heartland was announced in May 2021 and was targeting a 2021 or 2022 release. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/11/the-division-heartland-closed-test/">Closed beta test sign ups were opened in September 2022,</a> but impressions were that Ubisoft’s free to play game still needed work and tweaking before it would be ready for release. Ubisoft has decided the time and cost to do that just would not be worth the return on the investment, it seems.</p>

<p>The Division: Heartland was going to take players outside of the cities of New York and Washington DC, to the small town of Silver Creek instead. The description said, <em>“This standalone free-to-play The Division game introduces new playable characters in a rural setting, far from the events in New York and Washington D.C. Silver Creek was once a pleasant town in the American Midwest, but it was left in ruins following the spread of the Dollar Flu. Players will take on the role of loyal Division agents from across the nation responding to a call for help. Fighting alongside and against other trained agents, players will explore the secrets of Silver Creek and provide hope to what remains of small-town America.”</em></p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has cancelled its upcoming free-to-play shooter The Division Heartland, as it moves to refocus its resources on "bigger opportunities".
</p>
<p>
The Division Heartland <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-the-division-free-to-play-spin-off-heartland">was announced for PC and consoles</a> back in May 2021, when it was original set to launch within a vague "2021-22" release window. Since then, it's resurfaced intermittently, and an open beta last summer - followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-heartland-has-been-rated-in-taiwan-hinting-that-a-release-could-be-imminent">Taiwanese ratings board sighting</a> - seemed to suggest a launch was finally drawing near.
</p>
<p>
However, three years after Heartland's unveiling, Ubisoft has now officially called time on the still-unreleased project. "After careful consideration, we have made the tough call to halt development on Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland, effective immediately," the publisher wrote in a statement announcing the news (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">IGN</a>).

In a note in its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/AwOkNohhzmR1qBmQ4Nj4h/096beaa470c05f39f77417742e4d25b8/Ubisoft_FY24_Earnings_PR_English_final.pdf">2023-2024 earnings report</a> released today, Ubisoft offered a little context for the cancellation, calling XDefiant and Rainbow Six "bigger opportunities" for the company.
</p>
<p>
The decision to halt development on Heartland is just the latest in a long line of recent cancellations at Ubisoft. Last July, it was reported an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/immortals-fenyx-rising-not-so-immortal-as-ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-sequel">Immortals Fenyx Rising sequel had been canned</a>, and that was after the publisher's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-project-q-cancelled">mysterious PvP battle arena game Project Q</a>, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-again">three unannounced games</a>, all officially got the chop. Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-vr-and-ghost-recon-frontline-cancelled">cancelled</a> Splinter Cell VR, Ghost Recon Frontline, and two other unannounced titles a year earlier.
</p>
<p>
Those cancellations - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-montreal-latest-studio-struck-by-layoffs">subsequent layoffs</a> - came amid <a href="https://staticctf.akamaized.net/8aefmxkxpxwl/3nCTlhd4Dke8pe308etZ6e/b11d0bfe9c5094f0eecd44541c6ba0b8/Ubisoft_update_January_23_English_Final.pdf">disappointing financial results</a> for the publisher, which last year admitted it was facing "major challenges as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and long-lasting titles".

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-the-latest-aaa-free-to-play-game-casualty.872217/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157512/tom-clancys-division-heartland-canceled-ubisoft<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="s5fGkJ">Ubisoft has ended development of <em>The Division Heartland</em>, the free-to-play game set in the universe of Tom Clancy’s The Division, the company announced Wednesday. The game was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22423089/ubisoft-announces-new-free-to-play-game-the-division-heartland">announced in 2021</a>. The publisher said it will divert resources elsewhere, specifically to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23680459/xdefiant-preview-release-date-tom-clancy-ubisoft"><em>XDefiant</em></a> and the Rainbow Six franchise.</p>
<p id="qcEr7D"><em>The Division Heartland</em> was set in the wake of a devastating pandemic that ravaged the fictional flyover town of Silver Creek. In the multiplayer game, developed by Red Storm Entertainment, players would have to cope with an ever-changing contamination, new survival obligations, and a deadly nighttime cycle in the free-to-play spinoff of The Division franchise. Ubisoft made a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23690197/ubisoft-the-division-day-heartland-mobile-resurgence-tom-clancy">big showing of <em>Heartland</em> at its Division Day event</a> last year, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23346149/the-division-heartland-test-registration-closed-alpha-sign-up">conducted closed playtests</a> of the game. But it appears that the publisher is following the direction of many other publishers who are canceling in-development projects or giving up on free-to-play live-service games.</p>
<p id="5r6mLd">In recent months, multiple AAA publishers and studios have canceled their in-development live-service games. That includes the long-in-development <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24002161/the-last-of-us-online-canceled-naughty-dog-tlou2-multiplayer"><em>The Last of Us Online</em> at Naughty Dog</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24050326/blizzard-survival-game-canceled-allen-adham-mike-ybarra">Blizzard Entertainment’s untitled fantasy survival game</a>. And just last week, Microsoft ended further development on <em>Redfall</em> inline with the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151045/microsoft-xbox-studio-closures-tango-gameworks-arkane-austin-redfall">closure of Arkane Austin</a>.</p>
<p id="ErNWmj">Still, <em>The Division Heartland</em>’s cancellation stands out, considering the publisher’s commitment to troubled projects like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24071025/skull-and-bones-open-beta-impressions-combat-quests"><em>Skull and Bones</em></a> — which had a decade-long development cycle — and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23736045/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-reboot"><em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</em> remake</a>. But diverting more resources to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22583452/ubisoft-tom-clancy-xdefiance-trailer-announcement-release-date"><em>XDefiant</em></a> may be just what that delayed, substantially reworked Tom Clancy game needs.</p>
<p id="VIwGzl">Ubisoft has two other announced The Division projects in the works: <em>The Division Resurgence</em>, a free-to-play multiplayer third-person shooter mobile game, and <em>The Division 3</em>, which Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/3QaNOAmSlbUJw2XbwsUk9x/3b4f38c22c0eafdffe10d14ae50a31a4/JG_Appointed_Executive_Producer_for_The_Division_Brand_FINAL.pdf">confirmed</a> was in the works last September.</p>
<p id="iJVLBQ"><em>The Division Heartland</em> is one of many cancellations Ubisoft has confirmed in recent years. In 2023, the company canceled three unannounced titles alongside <em>Immortals Fenyx Rising 2</em>. The year prior, it slashed four in-development projects that weren’t publicly announced.</p>
<p id="HeHQxL">Ubisoft’s lineup for the next year now includes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156633/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-release-date-codename-red"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> (officially revealed earlier today), <em>Rainbow Six Mobile</em>, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>The Division Resurgence</em>, and <em>XDefiant</em>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/how-helltide-works-in-diablo-4-season-4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-helltide-works-in-diablo-4-season-4.872214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-helltide-works-in-diablo-4-season-4/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>One of the most significant and exciting changes made in Diablo 4 Season 4 is the ability for anyone, even a low-level player, to join a Helltide. You must, of course, complete the campaign beforehand. But once that requirement is out of the way, you can harm the demons of hell without faltering. Here is how Helltides work in Diablo 4 Season 4!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-the-helltide-event-works-in-diablo-4-season-4">How the Helltide Event Works in Diablo 4 Season 4</h2>



<p>As mentioned, you must complete the game’s story mode before delving into the Helltide event in Diablo 4 Season 4. If you have previously completed the campaign and create a seasonal character, you’ll have a chance to endure the chaos of Helltides from the get-go. That’s right; you can join a Helltide from World Tier 1 if you want to farm experience points and level quickly this season. It’s no longer locked behind World Tier 4, as previously.</p>



<p>To participate in the actual event mechanics, wander the zone and clear the various objectives, like demonic structures and ritual sites. Eventually, you’ll collect enough <strong>Aberrant Cinders</strong> to unlock <strong>Tortured Gifts</strong>, the chests scattered throughout the Helltide.</p>



<p>Aberrant Cinders are a Helltide-specific currency only usable within the event zone to unlock the aforementioned Tortured Gifts chests. If you die in a Helltide, you lose half of your Aberrant Cinders. Once the event concludes, you’ll lose all of your acquired Cinders in your inventory. It’s best to use them on a chest before the timer runs out.</p>



<p>You should know that a <strong>Helltide lasts for 55 minutes and then enters a cooldown period of five minutes before infecting a new zone on the hour</strong>.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you slay monsters and unlock chests, you’ll acquire Helltide Threat, which you’ll note is in the top-right corner of your HUD next to the map and below your Aberrant Cinders counter. The higher your threat level, the more enemies will spawn around you and attack. Eventually, you’ll deal with a Hellborn—a challenging boss-type enemy surrounded by low-level mobs—that drops a <strong>Baneful Heart</strong>. Once you have three Baneful Hearts, you can summon the <strong>Blood Maiden</strong>.</p>



<p>Trust me when I say you want to farm Baneful Hearts to defeat the Blood Maiden, as she’ll drop some of the best loot in Helltides and Exquisite Blood!</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-helltide">Where to Find Helltide</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you open up your map and scan Sanctuary, <strong>you’ll note one region covered in a red hue with brilliant red icons dotting the landscape. This is the Helltide area</strong>, similar to the vampiric Blood Harvest event from Season 2. </p>



<p>Once you enter the zone, you’ll encounter hordes of demons, blood raining from the sky, and the occasional demonic worm emerging from the ground to spew a bloody mess and a handful of enemies on your position.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-join-a-helltide-event">How to Join a Helltide Event</h2>



<p>To join a Helltide, wait for the zone to appear on the map, then <strong>walk, ride, or teleport to the area. Once you enter, you’re part of the event.</strong> You can tackle most of the objectives solo, especially at World Tier 1 or 2 difficulty. Still, it’s faster to farm enemies and events with a group—even one additional player helps!</p>

<p>How much time will you spend farming Helltide in Diablo 4? While you wait for the next spawn, Insider Gaming has a few hot articles for you to check out:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Best Trick-Taking Games (2024)]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trick-taking-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-trick-taking-games-2024.872211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trick-taking-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Trick-taking, where a hand of cards progresses by one player leading a suit and others following, matching that suit if they can, is so old that its origins are lost. The earliest one we have records for in Europe is called Karnöffel, and it dates from 15th century Germany, but playing cards generally are far older and were developed in the far east. Such is the popularity of this mechanism that it’s still with us, and has blossomed into thousands of different forms, many of which you can enjoy with a standard deck of playing cards.</p><p>Needless to say, such a popular method of play has also made its way into any number of more modern, more specialized and more strategically rich games, and it’s those we’ll be focusing on to pick out the best. Designers have been able to adapt it into myriad forms, across competitive and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> play, and by marrying it with other mechanics to create longer games. But the real trick of trick-taking is that it’s so familiar that almost anyone can pick up and play these games with ease.</p><h2>Wizard</h2><div id="200655"><p><h3>Wizard Card Game</h3></p></div><p>Trick-taking is an old concept that dates back to playing card games, so it makes sense to start with this relatively old game that mostly uses a deck of standard playing cards. The magic comes from eight extra cards, four wizards and four jesters. The first wizard played always wins a trick, while jesters are the lowest value and are beaten by all other cards. While that not sound much like sorcery, Wizard also uses another common feature of trick-taking games: before each round you must bid the number of tricks you think you’ll win, and must match that number to score. The wizard and jester combo make this notoriously hard to predict, but also leaves you with the strategic flexibility to play defensively or offensively in attempts to shore up your score, or push for a sudden, thrilling win.</p><h2>Skull King</h2><div id="200656"><p><h3>Skull King Card Game</h3></p></div><p>Pirate-themed Skull King is the captain of the bidding game ship. There are three normal suits alongside a trump suit and, as usual, the highest card wins a trick. You start each hand looking at your cards and predicting how many tricks you’re going to win, scoring points if you hit the target but losing them otherwise, ensuring each hand comes down to a thrilling climax. But the deck is full of special cards to give the game some serious spice: pirates always win a trick, escape cards always lose and the terrible skull king himself lords it over everything, gaining a bonus if he scoops up any pirates. They’re easy enough concepts to learn, but fill the game with more than enough variety to ensure there’s lots of skill in making your bids.</p><h2>Sail</h2><div id="198567"><p><h3>Sail</h3></p></div><p>Staying with the nautical theme, Sail sees two of you working together to steer a ship across a course of islands while being chased by a ferocious kraken. It’s notoriously hard for trick-taking games to work as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player games</a>, but Sail’s ingenious ruleset not only manages it, but ensures a white-knuckle ride on every game. Each card has not only a suite and a value but also a symbol, and the pairing of symbols determines what your ship does that round, whether that’s moving, firing on the kraken or taking a smash from one of the thing’s tentacles. The round ends when one player wins five tricks, meaning you’ve got to balance the load while still taking the right action pairings, a task made doubly difficult by a ban on communication. Every attempt is an edge-of-the-seat challenge across six scenarios.</p><h2>The Crew: Mission Deep Sea</h2><div id="157130"><p><h3>The Crew: Mission Deep Sea</h3></p></div><p>If you want a cooperative trick-taker for more than two (this one ended up on our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">best four-player board games</a> as well), then it’s time to venture into the depths of the ocean as you attempt to keep your team alive in The Crew. The game plays through a long sequence of narrative scenarios of increasing difficulty, giving you more and more tasks to complete from a random and imaginatively varied selection. The basic formula is that a given player has to win a trick containing a particular card, but the concept blossoms into all kinds of demanding challenges, for example winning or not winning particular suits or numbers of tricks. This would be easy if you could share what’s in your hand, but that’s not allowed: you can only offer elusive hints. Success is thus a matter of tracking plays and trying to engineer situations where you can complete your assigned tasks. It’s harder than it sounds, highly addictive, and its cooperative nature makes it superb for family play.</p><h2>Brian Boru: High King of Ireland</h2><div id="154466"><p><h3>Brian Boru: High King of Ireland</h3></p></div><p>Most of the games on this list are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">fast-playing games</a>, but Brian Boru is a rare instance of a much deeper strategy affair that uses trick-taking. Players are competing to become the next King of medieval Ireland by controlling towns on the map, but control of any given town is decided by playing cards from your hand, which you’ll have picked via drafting at the game start. As usual the highest card value wins, from the suit matching that of the town you’re vying over, but there are some cool wrinkles. First, there’s a wild white suit that matches any color. Second, the lower value the card, the better rewards you get whether you win the trick or lose. This spatial control element married to those cunning inverse rewards give this a unique and engrossing strategic feel, while trick-winning is full of tension.</p><h2>Cat in the Box</h2><div id="200657"><p><h3>Cat in the Box Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Bidding games don’t come much more bizarre than this beauty, inspired by Schrödinger’s famous feline thought experiment. On the face of it, it’s a normal trick-taking game where you follow a color suit, one color is a trump, and the highest-value card wins. The twist is that the cards are not colored: you decide what color a card is as you play it. That pairing is then crossed off a grid because, after all, you can’t have two cards of the same color and value, right? You can even decide, at any point, that your hand is completely out of a particular color, allowing you to sneak in a trump, but you’ll never be able to play that color again! This can lead to paradoxes where you’re left with unplayable cards, and you lose points. But win or lose, the sheer, head-spinning innovation of this game will take your breath away.</p><h2>Ghosts of Christmas</h2><div id="200658"><p><h3>Ghosts of Christmas Board Game </h3></p></div><p>Another cleverly peculiar bidding game, this time inspired by Dickens’ famous Yuletide yarn "A Christmas Carol," Ghosts of Christmas lets you hedge your bets and bid numbers for tricks you think you might win, for a points penalty. But that isn’t its secret sauce. Rather, this is a game where you play hands at once, represented by the multiple time periods of the titular ghosts: past, present and future. Once a given time has a card lead in it, it’s fixed to that for the rest of the hand, so everyone gets a chance to lead, and the unfolding play sees you juggling strategy across several hands from the same pool of cards. Even Scrooge himself might have trouble doing that kind of accounting, although the result is no humbug but a top class, challenging title.</p><h2>Jekyll vs Hyde</h2><div id="200659"><p><h3>Jekyll vs. Hyde</h3></p></div><p>Another trick-taker for two, even if you are representing personalities in the same body as per the classic tale of gothic horror, Jekyll vs. Hyde manages to bring some thematic class to the genre. Each suit represents a negative character trait and, unusually, they’re ranked in the order of which they get played each round and, if a player can’t follow suit, a higher-ranked card will beat a lower-ranked one, a deliciously devious strategic flair. You can also dump out potion cards, which have unexpected effects depending on the suit it's paired with, resetting the ranks, swapping cards or even stealing a trick from your opponent. But winning isn’t always the point: at the end of a hand, you work out the difference between the two tricks and Hyde advance that many spaces toward his transformation, and victory. If he can’t manage it within three hands, good wins and Jekyll keeps his self-control, but you’ll have a fun time either way.  </p><h2>Inside Job</h2><div id="200660"><p><h3>Inside Job</h3></p></div><p>Imagine a cooperative trick-taking game like The Crew, but with slightly simpler missions and a time limit. Might not sound terribly appealing, but there’s a big surprise waiting in each game of Inside Job: one of the players is a traitor, trying to sabotage the group’s spy missions. Each trick won earns the winner an intel token, and if the traitor gets enough of these, they win instantly. The rest of the agents win if they clear a threshold of successful missions in time. Should neither happen, it comes down to a vote, with the agents winning if they can successfully identify the insider, or losing if not. Blending the best of trick-taking and hidden role games in an easy to learn package, this is genre blending at its most fun.</p><h2>The Fox in the Forest</h2><div id="162172"><p><h3>The Fox in the Forest</h3></p></div><p>Our final specialist two-player pick, The Fox in the Forest is a standard, simple trick-taker with one glorious twist that makes it stand out: you get points for winning either very few or slightly above average tricks, rather than sweeping the board. This necessitates a complete rethink of how you approach the game, as you’re no longer leading to win every time. Instead, you’ve got to consider what your opponent might be holding and mix things up so that you can win the requisite number of tricks to net the big points. To further mix things up, all the odd-numbered cards have special powers like changing the trump suit or the win conditions for a given hand, ensuring this is a game where you always have to think on your feet as you field the constant curveballs that it throws you.</p><h2>Seas of Strife</h2><div id="200661"><p><h3>Seas of Strife</h3></p></div><p>As you’ve probably noticed, many trick-taking games take the basic formula and succeed by making a small twist - that’s how addictive the basic recipe is. Seas of Strife, which unusually has different numbers across all its suits, has two. Firstly, you win by losing: that is, collecting as few tricks as possible. Second, if you can’t follow suit and have to dump a card, that card’s suit not only becomes valid but can win the trick if it’s the most common suit played. This makes the obvious tactic of dumping high cards extremely dangerous, and ensures that every hand has the unexpected in store right until the final card is played. At the same time it’s super-easy to pick up, and great fun for all ages.</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance board game and video game writer for IGN.
