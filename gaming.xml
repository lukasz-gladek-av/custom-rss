            <p>Atlus says it is "aware there is an optimisation issue" with ReFantazio - Prologue's demo on Steam.</p>
<p>In a brief statement posted to X/Twitter, the developer thanked everyone who had downloaded and played the demo thus far, and assured them it was "working to address this problem".</p>

<p>Fans have taken to Steam's review section to share their experiences, and whilst the demo sits on a "mostly positive" user review score from around 600 reviews, some have criticised the performance.</p>
<p>"I'm a big fan of Atlus games, and this has exciting potential, but the performance of this demo leaves much to be desired," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/jimmieramone/recommended/3130330/">said</a> one less-than-impressed player.</p>
<p>"My rig should not be struggling to reach 120 fps on a game with these specs. Hopefully it'll be addressed before release, in which case I'll happily change this review, but as of right now I cannot recommend."</p>
<p>"Just need a bit more optimisation, everything else is perfect," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199091685509/recommended/3130330/">added</a> another.</p>

<p>According to Oxford University's Internet Institute and PowerWash Simulator developer FuturLab, which collaborated on the study, players "consistently reported a higher mood after the first fifteen minutes of the play session compared to the start of each session".</p>
<p>Across the 162,325 "in-game mood reports" from players, the average player reported a more positive mood during play than at the start of each session.</p>
<p>This kind of change is "comparable with changes seen in other leisure activities such as reading, shopping, or listening to music".</p>
<p>"At present, short-term changes in video game players' moods are poorly understood. Gameplay research frequently relies on artificial stimuli, with games created or modified by academic researchers, typically played in a lab environment rather than a natural context. Instead, we wanted to know how real play in natural contexts might predict player mood on short timescales," said lead author, assistant professor Matti Vuorre, Tilburg University and Research Associate, Oxford Internet Institute.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Now that <em>Balatro</em> is out on mobile, I wanted to see what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">all the fuss</a> was about. And while it’s a great game, its tutorial doesn’t do the best job of setting you up for the kind of success necessary to hook you. In my first few hours, though I was completing the objectives laid out, it felt like I was stumbling my way to success instead of achieving it through strategy. Onboarding was a bit too abrupt, focused on the barebones of how to play instead of blending that with tips on how to play <em>effectively. </em>With that in mind, here’s some useful info and tips on how to get started.</p><p><h4><strong>I was told there would be no math</strong></h4></p><p>In <em>Balatro</em>, the main gameplay loop is amassing enough poker chips to beat a set chip total called a blind. To do that, you must create the ideal poker hand that maximizes the number of chips you can earn. I think what I initially had so much trouble with was understanding how scoring worked. Numbers were flying at me, and I didn’t know what they meant or where they came from. Knowing how scoring works is <em>critical </em>to maximizing your chip-earning potential.</p><p>Each hand you play is assigned a simple math equation: </p><p><em>Total chips earned = chip value of cards x multiplier score</em>.</p><div><figcaption><em>These are the math equations assigned to every hand. Using special cards, you can modify these base equations to increase your score.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Playstack</cite></p></div><p>The math equation is different for every type of poker hand, and the more powerful a hand is, the bigger the equation. You don’t have to remember hand hierarchies or their equation values — simply hitting the “Run Info” button will pull up a reference list. Now, here’s the important part: this math equation changes based on the cards you play and any modifiers you’ve earned. For example, the base equation for two pair is 20 chips x 2 multiplier score. If I play two queens and two 3s, I can figure out my score by adding the total chip value of my cards (10+10+3+3=26) to the equation’s chip value (20) and then multiplying that number by 2, equalling 92 chips.</p><div><figcaption><em>Scoring works by adding up all the chip values and all the multiplier values and then multiplying the two numbers together.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF: Playstack</cite></p></div><p>I’m loath to admit how long it took me to understand what was going on, but once I figured it out, everything clicked. I finally <em>got</em> what it was that makes this game hard to put down. Some of these blinds require amassing thousands of chips, so the main point — and honestly the biggest fun factor — of <em>Balatro</em> is beefing up those equations and your cards as much as possible. Which brings me to the next tip.</p><p><h4><strong>Cash rules everything around me</strong></h4></p><p>I wish the game took more time to explain that, early on, money is <em>everything</em>. For each blind, you have a number of chances or hands to earn enough chips, and if you don’t like the cards in your hand, you have a number of opportunities to discard cards in hopes of getting better ones. You earn the most money by beating blinds in the least amount of hands and with the fewest discards as possible. There are other ways to earn money, too, with special cards and perks you can get. Once you unlock it, use the special deck that starts you off with an extra $10 instead of the regular $4. Look for the perk (called a “tag”) that gives you $25 for beating “boss blinds” — or harder blinds that introduce some kind of negative effect like lowering equation values while requiring you to earn abnormally high amounts of chips. Bank as much as you can, as early as you can in order to...</p><p><h4><strong>Shop till you drop</strong></h4></p><p>The amazing thing about <em>Balatro</em> is that it’s managed to effectively reproduce the thrill of opening loot boxes without needing to spend a single dime on microtransactions. At the end of every blind, you get to visit the shop where you buy cards that add to or modify your deck, vouchers that impart powerful perks like the ability to increase your hand size, or jokers that have all kinds of score-modifying abilities. Go for the jokers that increase bonuses every round based on meeting certain criteria so your scoring potential can grow exponentially. My most successful run featured a joker that added a +1 to my multiplier every time I didn’t play a face card. By the end of that run, I was scoring upwards of 10,000 chips from the weakest hands played with the cheapest cards. If you see jokers that don’t work with your strategy, don’t forget that you can spend money to reroll the shop for new ones.</p><div><figcaption><em>In the shop, you can buy cards that modify other cards or increase the value of specific hands.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Playstack</cite></p></div><p>Unlike most other roguelikes that let you keep some abilities or items when you die, when you fail a run at <em>Balatro</em>, all your special cards, vouchers, perks, and cash go away. You can’t take cash with you, so spend it.</p><p>Lastly, if you want to make sure you have a good time with <em>Balatro</em>...</p><div><figcaption><em>Even </em>Balatro<em>’s developer knows this game is a problem.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Playstack</cite></p></div><p><h4><strong>Install an app blocker (seriously)</strong></h4></p><p>Runs in <em>Balatro</em> are short and seamless, making it trivial to get into a groove even after having to start over after a failed attempt. And if you’re an adult with responsibilities, that’s going to be a problem — especially on mobile. Three hours in real time feels like only 20 minutes, making <em>Balatro</em> the closest human beings have gotten to legitimate time travel. After wrapping up my first day with the game sometime around 5AM without feeling the slightest bit tired, I added it to my app blocker, setting it to cut off access every day at midnight. Those <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24255304/bye-forever-because-balatro-is-out-now-on-mobile">jokes about <em>Balatro</em></a> <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/141549/balatro-mobile-impressions">being a productivity problem</a> aren’t that far off the mark, so if you want to try to get some sleep or work done, put guardrails in place so you can.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, adapting a game like The Last of Us Part II is a bit different from adapting its predecessor, not just because it has a more complicated, fractured narrative, but also because it’s a (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-review"><u>phenomenal</u></a>) game with much more dramatic meat to explore, both in terms of sheer length and in the thornier dimensions it mines from its characters. To make a show that stands up to its inspiration, it most likely will have to make some major deviations from the source material. While diehard fans may cry foul, it might be the only way this adaptation can feel as vital as the game does.</p><p>It’s something co-showrunner Neil Druckmann, who is also creative director of The Last of Us games, agrees on. Talking to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/last-of-us-season-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-strictly-business-1236155347/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a> about the adaptation process, he noted that a common mistake is “staying so close to the source material that is built and designed and written for this other medium that has strengths and weaknesses, and trying to translate it as is, with no changes to this other medium that has different strengths and weaknesses.” Looking at the newly released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-debut-trailer-shows-joel-and-ellie-5-years-after-the-events-of-season-1"><u>first trailer</u></a> for Season 2, we can already see the first signs of how Druckmann and his creative partner Craig Mazin may have altered the original story to suit the television medium.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Max (@StreamOnMax) <a href="https://twitter.com/StreamOnMax/status/1839319097273889280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <h2><strong>Different Mediums, Different Priorities</strong></h2><p>With so many artistic mediums bleeding into each other these days, it can sometimes be hard to remember that video games and television are two very different things. Every medium for telling stories has pros and cons that are virtually inseparable from the form. The narrative techniques that make perfect sense in interactive fiction in regards to scene geography, atmosphere, environmental design, and use of player expression often don’t translate to something with a set runtime and no input from the viewer.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The narrative techniques that make perfect sense in interactive fiction often don’t translate to something with a set runtime and no input from the viewer.</p></div><p>That’s not to say you can’t try. The first season of The Last of Us meticulously rebuilt many moments from the game’s cutscenes, sometimes literally frame by frame. But what purpose does that really serve? The story worked excellently the first time around, the game is available in its best ever form with The Last of Us Part I Remastered, and the cutscenes are readily available on YouTube. If people want a truly faithful version of the story, it’s already out there and has been for years. If anything, taking this cutscene cloning approach, rather than allowing the show’s direction and cinematography to present the story’s most critical moments in a wholly new way, only highlights the ways the original games frequently veered away from the strengths of interactive narrative. And it’s developer Naughty Dog’s adoption of non-interactive storytelling technique that makes such scenes so easy to plop directly into a TV show.</p><p>I say this as a massive fan of both games: they kind of already were HBO shows. They do use the possibilities of interactive storytelling to their advantage, but in terms of basic construction and scene direction, even during playable segments, there’s liberal use of the techniques and stylistic conventions of prestige television. This is why it isn’t just ironic that the games were eventually adapted as an HBO show; it was so easy <em>to </em>adapt them because the games did a lot of the work already. This is not to discount any of the contributions from the show’s directors, writers or performers, but the blueprint for a successful television show was already baked straight into the game. So if the next season wants to be its best self, it would do well to find a new way to present the story many of us already know.</p><h2><strong>Expand and Explore</strong></h2><p>Even with its fealty to the original game, the first season of The Last of Us often benefited from the deviations it did make. Hiring Latino actor Pedro Pascal gave a strong new take for main protagonist Joel by adding a softer dad-like quality to him compared to Troy Baker’s gruffer edge, adding new characters like Melanie Lynskey’s Kathleen expanded the post-apocalyptic world explored in the original game, and devoting an entire episode to the unseen story of Bill (Nick Offerman) and his lover Frank (Murray Bartlett) led to what many considered to be the season’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-episode-3-review"><u>best entry.</u></a> Unlike a video game, which usually necessitates some kind of consistency to the player perspective through the controllable character, television affords the opportunity to shift focus more readily, and the show made great use of that in key areas.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Last of Us Season 2 Cast: Who's New and Coming Back to the HBO Show?</h3></div></output><p>The second season should use that technique to greater effect. One of the main structural conceits of Part II is playing through the same three days from both Ellie and Abby’s perspectives. Their separate paths don’t really cross over until the end of the three days, both of them going through intensely personal journeys of revenge and rebirth respectively, meaning that each lead character is essentially gone from the narrative for somewhere around ten solid hours apiece. This makes sense in a video game because jumping back and forth between protagonists each level would be jarring for a player, never allowing them to truly settle into the peaks and valleys of power and equipment a survival action game is supposed to foster. But do we really want to watch four or five episodes in a row without Ellie or Abby showing up?</p><p>Intercutting between their journeys and finding ways to draw thematic parallels between Ellie and Abby even when they’re not in the same physical space would help maintain emotional continuity and viewer investment in both characters. After all, the entire point of the extended lead-up to their confrontation is that it’s a battle we don’t want either side to “win,” because we’ve come to empathize with their experiences. It’s hard for an audience at home to go through that if a character is absent for several weeks of television. We also know that Season 2 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-showrunner-says-hbo-series-should-be-around-for-a-while-beyond-season-2"><u>won’t adapt the entirety</u></a> of Part II, which gives the creators plenty of breathing room to add or expand on characters, subplots and world-building concepts that could give the series a fresh feel. If the trailer is anything to go by, we may have already seen hints of the show going in this direction.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Trust the Process</strong></h2><p>It’s a small detail, but the teaser trailer hints at what could be a major deviation from the original game’s setup: it looks like Abby will spend time in Jackson with Joel and Ellie. After we see Abby’s first encounter with Joel and Tommy where they save her from infected trying to get at her through a chain link fence (a scene ripped straight from the game), we later see a shot of the three of them fleeing on horses before what appears to be a horde of infected slamming themselves against Jackson’s perimeter wall. There’s also an earlier shot of a large group of infected being spotted through binoculars as they run through snow, indicating that they are heading towards Jackson, the only area in the game where snow is featured. This all suggests that there could be a sequence where Abby and Joel get back to Jackson and have more interaction than they do in the game (perhaps even involving Ellie) before Abby kills Joel. Such a sequence would be a prime opportunity for more character drama, as well as also giving us more scenes with Pascal before he’s relegated to flashbacks.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The teaser trailer hints at what could be a major deviation from the original game’s setup.</p></div><p>Abby ingratiating herself within Jackson’s community (a story thread concept art for the second game confirms the developers considered) and perhaps even casting her as an ally who helps them overcome an infected attack would provide us more context and inner conflict, giving the scene where she finally reveals her true motives a greater sense of dramatic weight. We get little time with Abby before she kills Joel in the game, which is a shocking scene in its original form, but viewers at home might feel a little lost if someone they assume to be one of the series’ two leads is killed so abruptly in the first couple of episodes. Getting us into Abby’s headspace earlier so we know exactly what she’s planning and why is the sort of shift that would help smooth that plot development over. And let’s be real here, more Kaitlyn Dever is never a bad thing (Did you see <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollywood-please-release-your-horror-movies-in-theaters-not-on-streaming"><u>No One Will Save You</u></a>? She was very good in that).</p><p>Ultimately, we don’t know exactly how The Last of Us Season 2 will pan out, but based on the first season, it’s fair to say the creative team behind the show can be extended a little bit of trust. There’s a murderer’s row of talent involved in the production, and although a game series as beloved as this can engender strong protective feelings from its fans, it can be rewarding to let an adaptation of a story you already know surprise you. The game isn’t going anywhere. The story will always exist in that form. So let’s have a little faith and see what the differences in the new season will add to the story, instead of assuming they’ll only subtract.</p><p><em>Carlos Morales writes novels, articles and Mass Effect essays.

			<p>The high price ($699) of the PS5 Pro remains a hotly debated subject in the industry. While many fans are still disappointed with the pricing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-at-700-is-for-superfans-could-sell-13-15-million-in-total-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysts </a>and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-price-is-not-that-bad-says-zampella-youre-not-getting-the-same-performance-from-a-700-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game developers</a> have publicly said it makes sense, considering the market and what's in the hardware.</p>
<p>As for Sony itself, the company recently commented on the topic of pricing (and the decision to leave the disc drive as a separate purchase) in an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/interview-ps5-pro-toshi-aoki-specs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with IGN</a>. PlayStation Senior Principal Product Manager Toshi Aoki said:</p>
<p><em>Well, the technologies that I just mentioned that we are putting in to deliver new experiences for game players, and also not just the technological differences, but the SSD, the Wi-Fi 7, and the new technologies that surround the gameplay as well. So it's more of a full package that will give that exceptional value to the players... the most engaged players that we're targeting.</em></p>
<p><em>With the PS5 Pro, we are offering all these new tech innovations, and we added the two terabyte SSD, as well as the Wi-Fi 7. We believe as a full package that it offers for the most players. For the disc drive, it is an option for players. Not all players have discs, even though most players may...but we have the option for being able to add that for those players. So I think it's more of the balance of the value proposition that we're giving.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, Aoki also confirmed that Sony had been working on the PS5 Pro even before the base console launched in November 2020.</p>
<p><em>We started discussing it before the PS5 actually came out...because the PS5 specs were already locked in. We were ready to launch and everything. We knew, of course, as you mentioned, technologies evolve every year.</em></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro will be released on November 7 for $699 / £699 / €799, featuring 67% more Compute Units than the base PS5 as well as the machine learning DLSS-like antialiasing reconstruction technique called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR). Moreover, its ray tracing capabilities are vastly superior, thanks to improved ray tracing technology borrowed from unreleased AMD graphics cards <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-motivated-amds-development-of-advanced-ray-tracing-says-mark-cerny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following Sony's push</a>.</p>

			<p>Developer Shift Up has <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1839678161963114954" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> update 01.007.000 for Stellar Blade. This patch improves certain visual elements, mainly body collision for the protagonist, and adds a few quality-of-life features listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can still enjoy the "Summer Event" at the Oasis by turning on/off the summer event content toggle.</li>
<li>The summer event BGM (Don't Forget Me) is now available at the camp.</li>
<li>You can mark pins on the map by pressing □ button on the map.</li>
<li>You can use favorites feature on EVE's equipment.</li>
<li>New item "Ammo Package" is now available for purchase, which allows you to stock up on all ammunitions to max at once.</li>
<li>Purchase confirmation pop-up will be shown when spending over 15,000 golds to prevent any unintentional spend.</li>
<li>Visual improvements of conflicts between EVE's body.</li>
<li>Various other bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shift Up and Sony were recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-and-stellar-blade-developer-gets-sued-for-trademark-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted by a lawsuit</a> in the United States. The owner of StellarBlade.com, Griffith Chambers Mehaffey, has shared the following statement via his lawyer:</p>
<p><em>Mr. Mehaffey registered the&nbsp;<span>stellarblade.com</span>&nbsp;domain in 2006 and has used the STELLARBLADE name for his business for nearly 15 years. Given this long-standing and public use, it's difficult to imagine that Shift Up and Sony were unaware of Mr. Mehaffey's established rights before adopting their identical mark. We believe in fair competition, but when larger companies disregard the established rights of smaller businesses, it's our responsibility to stand up and protect our brand. The defendants’ far superior resources have effectively monopolized online search results for STELLARBLADE, pushing Mr. Mehaffey's long-established business into digital obscurity and threatening the livelihood he's built over more than a decade.</em></p>
<p>So far, neither Shift Up nor Sony have commented on the lawsuit. Meanwhile, the Seoul-based studio is <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing DLCs and a PC port</a> for Stellar Blade following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-developer-is-now-worth-as-much-as-koei-tecmo-in-market-capitalization-following-huge-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly successful IPO</a> (initial public offering).</p>

		<p>It’s Zelda O’Clock in Nintendoland, with the release this week of Echoes of Wisdom and the first actual Zelda-centric game in the series. It’s a lovely time, if you ask me, though sure to be a slightly acquired taste for the shift in gameplay style.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/blood-bowl-spike-journal-18-first-look-fire-breathing-little-freaks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For many a&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>&nbsp;fan, half the fun of the game is waiting to see what new armies will be brought out onto the pitch in a new issue of <em>Spike Journal</em>. And this time around, <em>Spike Journal 18</em>&nbsp;is truly playing to the crowd with the inclusion of Chaos Dwarfs into the game! Games Workshop provided us with a copy of&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl Spike Journal 18</em>&nbsp;to check out ahead of its release, so read on for our quick-look preview!</p>
<h2>Chaos Dwarfs Shine Like Hot Rocks</h2>
<p>Let's jump right in and talk about the Chaos Dwarfs, and the role they'll be playing in&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>. Fresh from the forges of Zharr-Naggrund, the Chaos Dwarfs erupt onto the field ready for some serious carnage. In fact, they're so good at duking it out with their opponents that they often forget to move the ball around. Luckily, a Chaos Dwarfs team can also field Hobgoblins, who do a lot of the ball carrying.</p>
<p>A Chaos Dwarfs team can employ the following units:</p>
<ul><li>0 - 16 Hobgoblin Lineman</li>
<li>0-2 Hobgoblin Sneaky Stabba</li>
<li>0-4 Chaos Dwarf Blocker</li>
<li>0-2 Chaos Dwarf Flamesmith</li>
<li>0-2 Bull Centaur Blitzer</li>
<li>0-1 Minotaur</li>
</ul><p>They also feature a brand new trait, "Breathe Fire (trait)," which states that Once per activation, instead of performing a Block action (either on its own or as part of a Blitz action), this player may perform a Breathe Fire Special action. When you do so, you choose one Standing opposition player and roll a D6, with a good enough roll, you can light them on fire and knock them down!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-spike-journal-18-chaos-dwarfs-painted-miniatures.jpeg?itok=y97035sy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-spike-journal-18-chaos-dwarfs-painted-miniatures.jpeg?itok=tFdlTRGE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>They also have an Updated Skill, "Iron Hard Skin (Mutation)," which reads: "Opposing players cannot modify any Armour rolls made against this player. In addition, the Claws skill cannot be used when making an Armour roll against this player."</p>
<p>I really love the flavor seen throughout the&nbsp;<em>Journal</em>, as we get a ton of lore and history around Chaos Dwarfs in the world of <em>Blood Bowl</em>. As always, the&nbsp;<em>Journal&nbsp;</em>is full of that classic wit and good sense of humor that adds some levity to this wonderfully ridiculous game.</p>
<h2>Star Players Make The Grade</h2>
<p>Contained within the pages of&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl Spike Journal 18</em>&nbsp;are three Star Players from the world of the Chaos Dwarfs! They each bring something unique to the game. Let's start with Zzharg Madeye, a Thrower who's a master of tinkering with the blunderbuss. His special ability, "Then I Started Blastin'!", gives him the opportunity to try and take a shot at an opposing player.</p>
<p>There's also H'thark the Unstoppable, a Bull Centaur Blitzer with the "Unstoppable Momentum" special ability that allows him to re-roll a single block die when he blitzes. I really like the look of this player, and love how the Chaos Dwarfs let you get some Bull Centaurs onto the field.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-spike-journal-18-chaos-dwarfs-close-up.jpeg?itok=TlnRgrHt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-spike-journal-18-chaos-dwarfs-close-up.jpeg?itok=a9KqR_Fk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally for the star players, there's Rashnak Backstabber, "The Hobgoblin Hitman." Rashnak is a Sneaky Stabba who's special ability allows him to add to his injury roll if he successfully breaks armor with a Stab action, because he's bringing poison onto the field. Each of these three Star Players of course also feature great stats, and a range of impressive Skills and Traits. All in all I think Zzharg Madeye is likely the most exciting of the group, but each plays a great role on the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pro Playbook Helps You Score</h2>
<p>Also of note is the very helpful Pro Playbook toward the back of the book, which helps you get to know the Chaos Dwarf crew and is useful in thinking about how to field your team. This is especially appreciated as, and even the&nbsp;<em>Journal</em>&nbsp;itself admits this, Chaos Dwarf teams can be tricky to field at first because of all the different moving parts.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-spike-journal-18-.jpg?itok=C3sPsUKl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-spike-journal-18-.jpg?itok=QDowLRSL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Because some of the players on a Chaos Dwarf team will invariably be slow (aka Dwarfs) while others are quite fast (like Centaurs and Hobgoblins), keeping your group more or less together will be key to success. With advice for how to field on offense (crunch the defense and then have your speedier players gain forward momentum) and defense (let none pass your little shield wall of stocky dudes), the Pro Playbook is extremely helpful.</p>
<p><em>Blood Bowl Spike Journal</em>&nbsp;<em>18</em>&nbsp;also features rules for&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Bowl</em>, tons of lore, and a classic comic strip. If you're interested in building up a Chaos Dwarf team, <i>Spike Journal 18</i>&nbsp;is a must!</p>

		<p>A new trailer for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake">Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake</a> has debuted ahead of the game’s upcoming release with preorders now live. <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> will bring the reinvigorated grand strategy game to PS4, PS5, PC, and Nintendo Switch late next month on October 24th.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS 8 REMAKE - Second Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6L-YjfVkQPc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The latest trailer gives fans an overview of the many systems and features at play. For those completely new to Romance of the Three Kingdoms, it’s an ongoing series of historical grand strategy titles that originated in 1985, allowing players to command armies during ancient China’s Warring States period. It’s the same setting used in Koei’s flagship <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> franchise which is being rebooted early next year with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/27/dynasty-warriors-origins-release-date-confirmed-watch-23-minutes-of-gameplay/">the launch of Dynasty Warriors: Origins in January 2025</a>.</p>
<p>ROTK fans each have their own favourite in the series, though 8 remains one of the most pivotal and popular instalments. Koei and developer Kou Shibusawa seem to think so, with Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake receiving more than just a simple remaster treatment. New content and features have been added to the game, deepening the web of strategic and roleplaying options, as well as the number of playable scenarios.</p>
<p>The newly added Wisdom trait will offer an additional layer of player progression that not only increases as you participate in battles, but also when you interact with fellow officers. The popular Duels features has also seen a significant upgrade, now complemented by Debates which allow shrewd strategists to take part in non-combat political showdowns.</p>

<h3>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every officer can be the hero! The “All Officers Play” of ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS VIII returns.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>More than 55 scenarios spanning over 80 years and featuring the largest number of officers in the series, from rulers to free officers. Play through a vast, deep, and turbulent Three Kingdoms period as you choose.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vivid depiction of the drama between officers. A variety of fascinating new features!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Many new features have been added to portray a variety of human dramas, such as “Tales” in which players can choose which events unfold. In addition, you can be linked by “Destiny” with other officers, and gain special relationships.</p>
<p>The relationship or “Links Forged” between each officer greatly affects how the gameplay unfolds. Changes in that relationship can be ascertained from the “Relationship Chart”.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphical enhancements</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to newly drawn officer graphics, the scenic beauty of the game is depicted using ink paintings, combining 2D visuals and 3D depth to create a beautiful visual experience of the world of the Three Kingdoms.</p>
