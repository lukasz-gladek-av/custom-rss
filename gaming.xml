            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-review-leitner-worthy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Statement begins. <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em> is based on a horror podcast that helped me get through a dark time in my life. The anthology series created by Jonathan Sims and Alexander J. Newall has a dedicated fanbase thanks to its blend of interesting characters, clinical office drudgery, dry British humor, and horror stories slowly weaving a tapestry of human suffering and cosmic terror. It, ironically, was a place of comfort for me during Covid lockdown.</p>

<p>So I had to see how Monte Cooke Games would adapt it into a TTRPG. The result is a game that is the Cypher System's answer to <em>Call of Cthulhu </em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-review-very-specific-but-good-gateway" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Arkham Horror</em></a>. Thanks to some smart design decisions and a dedication to the source material's core themes, this is a licensed RPG that manages to appease fans while giving general players room for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/good-haunting-beginning-horror-tabletop-rpgs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">their horrific imaginations</a> to run wild.</p>

<p>In <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em>, players take on the roles of employees at the Magnus Institute, an organization dedicated to archiving and investigating supernatural accounts.</p>

<p>But for every overworked college student who claimed to see a ghost or some conspiracy theorist going on about shadowy government dealings, there are statements that demand further investigation.</p>

<p>Missing persons cases. Serial killers with strange motives. A string of unexplained phenomena around urban legends or mysterious books. These are the statements where the players' skills are greatly tested.</p>

<p>As these investigations continue, the players will uncover dark secrets at the heart of the world. Cults. Artifacts on untold power. World-changing Rituals. All of these are tied in one way or another to eldritch horrors known as Entities. As the players dive further into this world of madness and horror, they will learn to fight back against these Entities and their followers, forever changing in the process. That is, assuming they survive that long.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-flood-of-spiders.jpg?itok=dXtiMYNL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-flood-of-spiders.jpg?itok=ZdWwzfMm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Obviously, go over Lines and Veils. Especially for the arachnophobes.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game – Gazing Into The Abyss</h2>

<p>Character creation in <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em> is similar to other games that use the Cypher System. Your character is determined by four Types: Occultist, Elocutionist, Investigator, and Protector, and are made more distinct with Descriptors and Foci. Each character has three stats each with a pool of points. These points can be spent to use certain abilities or provide bonuses to dice rolls.</p>

<p>Each investigation in <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em> is broken up into two parts. First is The Statement. This is a written statement submitted to the Institute by someone describing something unusual that happened to them. The statement can be written in isolation by the GM or it can be made collaboratively by all players at the table with final adjustments made by the GM.</p>

<p>The second part is The Investigation. Using the Statement as a reference, the players go into the field, checking areas of interest, interviewing eyewitnesses, or finding corroborating evidence. This investigation usually ends with the group encountering something supernatural, leading to a dangerous chase or fight for their lives.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-devouring-shadow.jpg?itok=gC9mC5xy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-devouring-shadow.jpg?itok=lXZUMnaJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Who would believe this? Even with video.</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, this structure is great at building atmosphere. <em>Magnus Archives</em> fans should be familiar with The Statement portion; it was the main structure of the podcast after all. The Investigation serves as the second half of a horror story where all the intrigue and suspense pays off with jump scares, existential revelations, or bloody violence.</p>

<p>It is where the <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> parallels are apparent. This is most obvious in the introduction of the Stress system. Players gain Stress from both minor and major events during an investigation. Getting lightly cut on broken glass. Witnessing a person sink into a pool of brackish water. Being trapped in a corridor that goes on forever. Reading a certain book.</p>

<p>When Stress hits certain levels, their skill rolls are hindered. At higher levels, Stress can cause physical damage or even outright kill players. Lastly, relieving Stress will take time, leading to persistent maintenance.</p>

<p>The Stress system is the mechanical highlight of <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em>. It's an elegant addition to the Cypher System that conveys the game's cosmic horror roots</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-cavern-of-monsters.jpg?itok=Z2Y7hcPY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-cavern-of-monsters.jpg?itok=5pMKv77A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's in your head. It can harm you. These facts aren't exclusive.</figcaption></figure><p>It doesn't undermine the core of Cypher thanks to small mechanical tweaks made in the system's foundation. For players, getting hurt doesn't drain a character's different resource Pools. Furthermore, reducing Stress is separate from a recovery roll, taking about an hour of in-game time.</p>

<p>On the GM side, there is a mechanic called Horror Mode. This mode, meant to signal a shift into danger and suspense for the party, can cause further Stress and even cascading complications if the dice turn bad. The result is that players can push their luck with more Effort but are harrowed by managing their mental health.</p>

<p>The latter is important since Stress can serve as a perverse form of character progression. Players are encouraged to keep track of how much Stress they have gained throughout a campaign, including the causes of that Stress. The reason for this is if a character gains a certain amount of Stress, they can gain access to supernatural powers. If they go further, that character may become an Avatar: a supernatural agent of an Entity.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-face-in-window.jpg?itok=q0QQyFVv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-face-in-window.jpg?itok=5V50Ole_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What happens to those who embrace The Darkness?</figcaption></figure><p>It makes for great drama. An extroverted character turns into an Avatar of The Lonely, isolating themselves from their peers until vanishing from sight. Highly individualistic investigators getting twisted into caricatures by The Stranger. The list goes on.</p>

<p>It's a well-thought-out system. Avatars have access to terrifying powers like boiling people from the inside or changing their bodies into deadly claws, but every time they call upon this power, they gain Stress. And Avatar or not, Stress can still kill.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-coffin-artwork.jpg?itok=aNpjAzp4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-coffin-artwork.jpg?itok=PgajGqsf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Do you listen to the warning, or the scratches coming from inside?</figcaption></figure><h2>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game – Adaptation and Inspiration</h2>

<p>Monte Cook Games' went the extra mile with The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game. As an adaptation of the source material, the book does a great job of portraying the world of the Magnus Institute and its various characters. The book is well-formatted, making rules reference quick and painless. The artwork is stunning, portraying iconic sequences from the podcast courtesy of Bear Weiter, Roberto Pitturu, and Javier P. Beltran.</p>

<p>On the fan service side of things, just about every iconic artifact and monster from <em>The Magnus Archives</em> is represented in this core rulebook. There's an entire section of the book dedicated to the library of Jurgen Leitner from <em>The Boneturner's Tale</em> to <em>The Seven Lamps of Architecture</em>. The book's bestiary also contains memorable monsters like the NotThem, the Monster Pig, and The Man Who Wasn't There. There are even entries for entities and artifacts mentioned in throwaway lines like a certain spooky wardrobe.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-man-who-wasnt-there.jpg?itok=MG18i47W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-man-who-wasnt-there.jpg?itok=GIAus2BW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh how I'd wish he would go away....</figcaption></figure><p>But these inclusions are expected for a licensed RPG. What puts <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em> on another level is how it uses the text of the source material to give its players carte blanche in its world.</p>

<p>One section of the book discusses the broad story beats of all five seasons of the podcast, including its apocalyptic finale. Near the end of this recap, it explicitly states that due to the nature of how the podcast ends, there are multiple parallel realities where the Entities are free to spread their terror anew. Essentially, every campaign in <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em> is an alternate reality where things play out differently.</p>

<p>That malleability is a persistent feature. Major characters don't have stat blocks; they are represented as archetypes. Jurgen Leitner is The Book Collector, Mikaele Salesa is The Artefact Dealer, Michael/Helen is The Distortion. This means your campaign can have different characters fill in these archetypes as you wish, keeping your campaigns interesting for both fans and newcomers alike.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-the-archivist.jpg?itok=rCYoCbmc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-magnus-archives-roleplaying-game-the-archivist.jpg?itok=naa0Q1QT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Archivist looking over records? Who is he? You tell me.</figcaption></figure><p>This extends to monsters as well. There are simple but effective rules for creating original monsters and mixing and matching elements of different Entities. The book even has suggestions for adapting famous myths like Bloody Mary or The Hat Man.</p>

<p>This express permission to adapt and change made my home campaign all the more memorable. Instead of working for The Magnus Institute, my players were hired by The Usher Foundation, the US-based sister institution. Thanks to some tweaks provided by the core rulebook, the switch in location and voice felt like a natural extension of the <em>Magnus</em> universe. For someone whose GM style errs more on creative expression than adherence to text, it is a design decision I cannot praise enough.</p>

It's polite to knock.</figcaption></figure><h2>Should I Pick Up <em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em>?</h2>

<p><em>The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</em> may just be my favorite cosmic horror TTRPG. It takes the foundation of the award-winning podcast series and expands it with both reverence and creativity. In addition, it adds a welcome layer of horror to Monte Cook's accessible Cypher System.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a new twist on stale Lovecraftian tropes, check this book out. Statement ends.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-dlc-and-roadmap-revealed-by-developers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The post-launch roadmap and DLC for Civilization 7 have been revealed. During a special 90-minute stream on Thursday, developer Firaxis announced the plans for the game through its first nine months.</p>



<p>The reveal came after a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-dlc-leaked-ahead-of-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">media outlet leaked details</a> of the first few post-launch leaders and civilizations ahead of the announcement. </p>



<p>Civilization 7 will launch in “early access” on February 6 and will include a Day 0 Patch for those who buy the Deluxe and Founders Edition of the game. For everyone else, it will be available starting February 11.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>From there come the planned “Collections”.</p>



<p>March brings the first DLC with the Crossroads of the World Collection. In Early March, Release 1 introduces Ada Lovelace as a new leader, along with Carthage and Great Britain as playable civilizations and four new natural wonders. A major update—Update 1.1.0—will also roll out, featuring the Natural Wonder Battle event and the addition of the Bermuda Triangle as a new wonder. Later in the month, Release 2 brings Simon Bolivar, along with Bulgaria and Nepal, plus more free content, including the Marvelous Mountains event and Mount Everest as a new natural wonder.</p>



<p>At some point between April and September, the Right to Rule Collection expands the game even further, introducing two new leaders, four new civilizations, and four new world wonders. Free content updates will also continue, adding new events, challenges, and updates for all players.</p>



<p>Firaxis also promised more updates for players in October and beyond for the first Civilization game in nine years. </p>



<p>A specific release date for the Crossroads of the World collection will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/god-is-a-geek-calvin-robinson-nazi-salute-elon-musk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you hadn’t heard of <a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/ideas/media/65518/conspiracy-theorist-cleric-calvin-robinson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">far-right, anti-immigration priest</a> Calvin Robinson before, he likely ended up on your radar this week when he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rightwingwatch.bsky.social/post/3lgvoqwtlcc2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performed a conspicuously Nazi-looking salute</a> – which conservatives are attempting to rebrand as “the Elon Musk salute” – on stage at the National Pro-Life Summit in Washington DC. Robinson has spent years making a name for himself on the right-wing media circuit, appearing on Britain’s GB News, popping up next to figures like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ChrsLybjm6u/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tucker Carlson</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCCCyhIRMkP/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump</a>, and responding to accusations that he’s a conspiracy theorist by calling the label a “<a href="https://x.com/calvinrobinson/status/1572549758614671361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">badge of honor</a>.” Before all that, though, Robinson was a games journalist, and he still owns a website he founded and wrote for, <a href="https://www.godisageek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God Is A Geek</a>. Today, the editorial staff of that site announced that they’re quitting.</p><p>God Is A Geek is a long-running site that focuses on gaming news, reviews, videos, and podcasts and <a href="https://www.godisageek.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prides itself on</a> “a diverse, passionate team with all manner of tastes.” Though GIAG’s following is relatively small, it regularly receives review, preview, and interview access from the video game industry, with its reviews appearing on Metacritic, as well as those fawning review score promo posters publishers love to trot out after games’ releases even though nobody’s heard of half the websites on them. GIAG’s coverage is standard stuff; the writing is not particularly hard hitting, but neither does it seem to have slipped down the <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI-obsessed rabbit hole</a> that its affiliation with Robinson might suggest.</p><p>According to GIAG’s <a href="https://www.godisageek.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy policy</a>, the site is owned by LDN.CM, a publishing company whose <a href="http://ldn.cm/team.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team page</a> lists just two members: Ruk Cooray and Calvin Robinson. Robinson <a href="https://www.godisageek.com/author/calvin-robinson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contributed articles and videos</a> to GIAG beginning all the way back in 2009, but has not done so since 2019, which is also when LDN dissolved, according to records viewed by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/game-site-denies-founder-has-day-to-day-involvement-after-he-imitates-elon-musk-salute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VGC</a>. While Robinson maintained ownership of the site after that, "Calvin Robinson has no involvement with the site on a day-to-day basis whatsoever," according to an unnamed representative of God Is A Geek who replied to Aftermath’s inquiries via the site’s PR email. I also asked if the site’s team would issue any sort of statement in response to Robinson’s salute or general conduct; the representative said that "The editorial team will make no further comment."</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Cooray and Robinson for more information about LDN’s ownership of the site and Robinson’s involvement in its operations, but did not receive a response as of this publishing.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.godisageek.com/2025/01/godisageek-official-statement-from-the-editorial-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a statement posted to God Is A Geek</a>, the site’s staff reiterated that Robinson did not actively participate in its operations, but that they nonetheless felt compelled by his recent actions to cease publication entirely.</p><p>“We have run the site independently of Calvin for several years now in the hopes that we would not have to lose the hard work we have poured into it, the access we have worked hard for, and the relationships we have developed,” God Is A Geek’s editorial team wrote. “However, it has become increasingly clear that we can no longer separate the site from the owner. As a result, the entire editorial team will be stepping down with immediate effect. We will create a new site and our future content will be published there, bereft of any connection to Calvin Robinson. It will be hard to start again, hard to walk away from the work we’ve done here off our own backs, but this is the right thing to do.”</p><p>At the National Pro-Life Summit, Robinson delivered his gesture to the audience with a knowing nod, saying “My heart goes out to you” before touching his hand to his chest and extending his arm. It was the culmination of a speech about “the last stand for the West” and “the last stand for Christendom” in which he positioned America as “the only country fighting for life.” The audience ate it up, laughing and cheering as if to demonstrate a clear understanding of what Robinson was going for.&nbsp;</p><p>Hours later, the Anglican Catholic Church revoked Robinson’s license.</p><p>"While we cannot say what was in Mr. Robinson’s heart when he did this, his action appears to have been an attempt to curry favor with certain elements of the American political right by provoking its opposition,” the ACC <a href="https://anglicancatholic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a statement on its website</a>. “Mr. Robinson had been warned that online trolling and other such actions (whether in service of the left or right) are incompatible with a priestly vocation and was told to desist. Clearly, he has not, and as such, his license in this Church has been revoked. He is no longer serving as a priest in the ACC."</p><p>Online, Robinson received the same reaction as Musk before him, the same one pretty much all far-right figures are going for when they deploy a Nazi salute: outrage, which they can then farm for more engagement by hopping on their high horse and feigning ironic distance from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/27/nx-s1-5276084/elon-musk-german-far-right-afd-holocaust" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ideals in which they very much believe</a>.</p><p>"Today I received hundreds of nasty calls, texts, voicemails and emails today from very bitter, angry, vile leftists," Robinson <a href="https://x.com/calvinrobinson/status/1884737392537403840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>, where he later went on to call the salute a "<a href="https://x.com/calvinrobinson/status/1884822896951857300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joke</a>." "They are often the very thing they accuse you of. I am not a Nazi.

            <p>
With Indiana Jones &amp; the Great Circle and Doom: The Dark Ages both waiting in the wings, Microsoft confirmed another of its first-party titles making the jump to PS5. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> is coming to Sony's console this "spring", and new content for all platforms is also on the way.
</p>
<p>
Forza Horizon 5 originally released back in 2021, taking the acclaimed open-world racing series to Mexico - or at least a fictional island amalgam, drawing extensive inspiration from the country's landmarks and features. Eurogamer called it "another gorgeous and enveloping pocket holiday" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-5-review-the-ultimate-big-tent-driving-game-cruises-to-mexico">our Recommended review</a>, highlighting its racing's "enviable tightrope-walk between structure and player freedom".
</p>
<p>
Which is to say it's another great former Xbox console exclusive for PlayStation owners to get acquainted with. Forza Horizon 5's PlayStation release will support cross-play with other platforms, and includes the same content as the PC and Xbox versions - with additional Car Packs and its two expansions, Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure, also available for purchase.

<p>
Additionally, Microsoft has <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-ps5">announced a free new content update</a> for all platforms, albeit one without a current ETA. Horizon Realms, as it's known, promises to give players the "chance to explore a curated collection of some of the community's favourite previously released Evolving Worlds", alongside some other "surprises".
</p><p>
Forza Horizon 5's leap to PS5 comes after Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-confirms-multiplatform-future-is-here-to-stay">confirmed its new multi-console release strategy</a> last year. 2024 laid the foundations with the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, and Pentiment on PlayStation, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 so far confirmed for 2025.
</p>
<p>
The start of this year also brought reports pointing to other Xbox games bound for PlayStation, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-getting-halo-and-another-big-xbox-game-with-microsoft-set-to-be-a-very-big-supporter">PS5 versions of Halo: The Masterchief Collection and Flight Simulator</a> claimed to be on the way. Previously, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">no "red lines"</a> when it came to the games Microsoft was willing to port to Sony's console.

			<p>It's been confirmed on the official website for Forza Horizon 5 that this previously Xbox-exclusive title will now be coming to PlayStation 5. This is a huge deal for those who were previously unable to play this game due to it only being on Xbox and PC. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-starfield-playstation-5/">rumors were circulating</a> months prior, fans will now be able to dive into this game on PlayStation 5 in the Spring.</p>
<p>Since the game was released, it has received over 40 thematic updates, with two expansions and other content added into the game to keep it fresh for the Forza Horizon fans. Now that it's coming to PlayStation 5, players will have access to the nearly 900 cars available in the game, where they will finally be able to drive along Mexico's roads and experience the Horizon Festival.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news post</a> on the Forza website, it was stated that the PlayStation 5 version of Forza Horizon 5 was developed by Panic Button in partnership with Turn 10 Studios and Playground Games. For those who may be worried about missing out on content, fear not. The game will come with all of the same content as the Xbox and PC versions of the title. Additionally, Car Packs and the Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure expansions will be available for PlayStation 5 users to purchase should they want to.</p>
<p>The news post also announced that there will be a special free update being added to the game across all platforms, titled Horizon Realms. Realm will allow players to explore a curated collection of the community's favorite previously released Evolving Worlds. There will also be "some other surprises," with details to be released in the future.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5 is now available to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist on the PlayStation Store</a> today, where players will be able to get updates about when the game is set to release.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be cross-play for all Forza Horizon 5 players across Xbox consoles, PC, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>With Xbox deciding to do away with console exclusives, it will be interesting to see what further Xbox exclusives are revealed to be making their way over to PlayStation 5 in the future. Whether this means PlayStation will see titles like Halo or Senua's Saga: Hellblade II remains to be seen, but we can only hope they will be ported over in the future.</p>

Sure, the game is young and there’s plenty of time for something to go wrong. But right now <em>Marvel Rivals </em>has a lot of goodwill and <em>Overwatch 2 </em>doesn’t.</p><p>I’m still hopeful that <em>Overwatch 2 </em>can rise from the ashes. Sure, fumbles by top-level management have pushed incredibly talented designers, artists, writers, and others out of a team that was once brimming with passion and promise, but I know there are still people in Blizzard who want <em>Overwatch 2 </em>to be the best version of itself. If it’s not going to be the feature-rich narrative sequel we were promised, I do hope that Blizzard can at least find something to bring the magic back. The team is no doubt aware that <em>Marvel Rivals </em>hangs over <em>Overwatch 2</em>. Every perceived misstep right now might feel like a point on the board for NetEase, and every underwhelming update or recolored skin looks like <em>Overwatch 2 </em>falling further behind.</p><p>I don’t know that a new PvP mode is the update <em>Overwatch 2 </em>needs to get back on top. Returning to the 6v6 format won’t wipe away the stench people associate with the game overnight,  and after gutting <em>Overwatch 2 </em>into a husk of its former self, Blizzard has to know the window to reclaim its place in the hierarchy of hero shooters is closing. The faded glow of its long-gone status as undisputed king has largely sustained <em>Overwatch 2 </em>through years of content droughts and failure to live up to its potential. In the volatile live-service market, you can only stay in the shadow of something else for so long before players stop searching for you on their desktops. I hope <em>Overwatch 2 </em>can find a way out of the darkness it’s found itself in.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There's only one thing worse than being chased across the desert by a sandworm in Dune: Awakening, and that's getting eaten by a sandworm in Dune: Awakening. Not only does the giant phallic cretin suck you down into the bowels of Arrakis, it eats everything you're carrying. Your clothes, your weapons, and especially your Spice Liquor. Suddenly you're respawning at your base in nothing but your underwear and are forced to do the run of shame across the sands to start rebuilding your inventory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to be sceptical about an MMO survival game set in the Duniverse, but after a few bouts of dehydration and sunstroke, the day I spent in Arrakis convinced me that Dune: Awakening is one to watch. More than that, if the developer can deliver on its plans for the endgame, it could see an EVE Online-style future for its hardcore playerbase. This massive project is the work of Funcom - the studio of the Conan: Exiles dong slider fame - and sets you on a path from broke-ass Arrakis hobo to an influential figure harvesting Spice on an industrial scale and pushing their personal agenda at the Landsraad. It's got everything you expect from an MMO - intricate skill trees, PvP mechanics, base building and character customization, but with ornithopters and mind-altering substances thrown in. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dune: Awakening - January 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dune: Awakening is set in a world where Lady Jessica had a Sliding Doors moment and chose to follow the instructions of the Bene Gesserit and have a daughter, Ariste, instead of the little twink we know and love, Paul Atredies. Cut to 29 years later and the Harkonnens and Atredies are at war over Arrakis, the Fremen have been (apparently) wiped out, and alternative religions have evolved to fill the gap left by Lisan al-Gaib. The alternate timeline isn't meant as a nipple twist to fans, Funcom needed the narrative space to make the player character consequential. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The alternate timeline isn't meant as a nipple twist to fans, Funcom needed the narrative space to make the player character consequential. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Obviously we did the somewhat controversial but I think very correct choice of creating the alternate history, which allowed us to detach a bit from what was going on in the movies and kind of focus on developing the game," explains producer Nils Ryborg. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's also been very helpful in that it allows us to bring a lot of the big-name characters that people really want to interact with back into the story. So in the books, a lot of the big-name characters die off quite early. With our story, we get to keep them around, which is really cool. There are obviously things that we want to include more of in the future that were very popular in the movies. We won't have sandworm riding at launch, for instance. But sometime in the future we'll look at that."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If it still doesn't sit right, Dune purists should know that Funcom got the blessing of the Herbert estate for the project, working with it and the makers of the current movies to keep everything true to the lore. It influences everything from the skills you can learn to the crafting progression, and it's a key part of trying to ensure that Awakening stands out in an ever-growing pack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Survival games are all over Steam right now, and I've tried most of them. Drop me naked in a jungle and I'll happily bash rocks and branches together for hours. Abandon me penniless in a fantasy landscape and I'll be crafting swords before breakfast. Dune: Awakening stands out the minute you exit character creation for one very stressful reason; Arrakis isn't exactly a tropical island or verdant forested ecosystem. In the opening area, Hagga Basin, there's no water, scarce wildlife and a distinct lack of coconuts. Oh, and the sun is like really, really hot and you're susceptible to sunstroke, there are scavengers who want to kill you everywhere, and did I mention the sandworms? For the first few hours my entire life hinged on dew drops, granite, and plant fibers, and the advice of an NPC with a pet bat who babied me through covering the basics of weapons, armor, and hydration until I could make it on my own. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You're not totally pathetic during this time thanks to a selection of abilities that you can unlock as you gain experience. I leaned into my manipulative wifey side and chose the Bene Gesserit skills, giving me the power to compel enemies towards me and to hang in front of me for a few moments before going back to trying to kill me. Don't get me wrong, I was still very much a toddler in the eyes of Dune: Awakening - one ability I unlocked was better sunstroke tolerance - but by the end of the day in Arrakis I had slightly better weapons and had mastered a super fast dash move that got me out of some trouble.  I could only dream of the wild combinations of ranged and melee combat, combined with passive and active abilities that could be swapped in and out according to need, shown off by the developers, but the skill point acquisition felt fast enough that I'll get there without too much hanging around once I'm playing at home. You won't be tied to your first specialty of choice either, so you'll be able to mix and match. The other starting classes are Trooper, Mentat (recon and strategy focused), and Swordmaster.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Spice of Life</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Another key element we only got a taste of was the very lifeblood of the Dune lore, Spice. Spice is powerful in the world of Dune: Awakening in every sense of the word, but it's also not easy to amass as a lone noob in the early hours. You'll find Spice Liquor and food in the world which unlocks a brief period of Prescient power -  though it comes with withdrawal symptoms - but later in the game you can build transports, harvesters, and automated Spice-collection systems to score the quantities you'll need for trade, serious crafting or managing a raging Spice addiction. I suspect the value of Spice to players, versus the pain of collecting it, will be something Funcom will be balancing long after the game is released. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think Spice is really cool. Obviously super important in the lore and we use it not only to… it has some story aspects that I won't get into, but it's also the fact that we can use it to improve the strength of our abilities and how well we get to interact with them," says Ryborg.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you're constantly high up on Spice, you will start seeing weird and wonky things.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"But then having the drawback of Spice addiction and needing more of it, and it's like constant need of more and more and more. A lot of the endgame systems being reliant on, 'Hey, can you get enough Spice to pay all your taxes for your huge base and to have the correct political sway that you need and build whatever endgame things that you need to build?' I feel that's been a very rewarding thing to pull off because we're now allowing all the iconic things that you think of from the Dune books to become natural mechanics that fit very well into the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you're constantly high up on Spice, you will start seeing weird and wonky things. I think it's fun, right? Because you're empowering your abilities, but you're also potentially putting yourself in a situation where you have worse possibilities. So you're balancing that whole act of, ‘Oh, I need to do this or this.’ And then also knowing that you need this resource for progression in other mechanics. So you're tapping into it now for a temporary boost for this fight but long-term I need this to pay taxes, gain political sway, and so on."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you've learned to live Arrakis style, you can start to focus on more than just beverages. There's a simple building system so you can start to construct your base, or sub-fief, and which you'll slowly start to fill with machines that automate the basics of survival. A machine to extract water from blood that you can harvest from enemy corpses, another to purify the ores you find. You'll need a fabricator to create armor and weapons. We only had access to very basic granite building blocks at the early stage of Dune: Awakening, but options for customization will increase as you progress. Personally I can't wait to build some severe mansion with Harkonnen aesthetics. You can also copy your base to move as your focus turns to new areas of Arrakis, so none of that tedious multiple base nonsense that survival players are sometimes cursed with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to picture my time spent in a loop of harvesting materials, completing side quests or contracts, and taking out Scavengers whenever I come across them. And I did come across them a lot. There are camps dotted around the map, and enemies will respawn there on a regular basis, so you'll always have some walking blood bags to exsanguinate when you need to. At times the enemies and the camps felt a little cut-and-paste. Early on I was passing the same camps over and over as I ran across the map, staying in the shadows to avoid the heat of the sun, and dealing with them started to feel like a grind.  Close to the end of the demo the development team took pity on us and spawned ornithopters, and it's easy to see how that issue won't reappear once you're not trudging back and forth across the map looking for a new supply of ore. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You're free to just wander the desert collecting twigs, but there are multiple story arcs - or Journeys - that push you deeper into the world. As well as bat boy's Arrakis 101 seminar, there's a Herbertian set of trials you're tasked with completing after a Spice Dream, and that's where things get trippy. No spoilers, but the first, the Trial of Aql, involves stealthing around a cavern to avoid the notice of a giant golden glowing eye. The weirdness was a welcome interlude in the cycle of harvesting materials, killing scavengers, and fulfilling basic contracts for the tradepost, and I'm hungry to know what the other trials have in store. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are multiple story arcs - or Journeys - that push you deeper into the world.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Some stuff we didn't get to try for ourselves were the more social aspects of Dune: Awakening. Prove your skills for survival and skulduggery in Arrakis and you'll get to the endgame, wielding influence at the Landsraat, where factions of players can make choices that will affect the world. Being as we were in the toddler end of the Dune: Awakening pool, we only got to experience the PvE part of the experience, which with everything else I was trying to deal with felt like a blessing. Ryborg says that while you can enjoy the game as a loner, those later social aspects will be vital to being an Arrakis Kingpin, from taking on the tough dungeon-style lab locations to trading for items.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So we've got the whole story and there's a lot of single player content but there are areas where you definitely need other people. If you want to get into the really tough ecological testing stations, some of the tougher ones, you definitely need people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But especially when you want to delve into the deep desert, the full endgame. If you want to engage in the endgame political loop, you will need more people. If you want to do the proper big Spice raids and actually get enough resources to really make a dent into the endgame, you will need people. But I think one way to think about it is you don't have to do that every second of the day. That can be like, let's plan a big event as a group of people, let's go do that. And then the rest of the time you can enjoy building your base and engaging with the story and building up your character in different ways."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It might not be easy, living in the world of Dune: Awakening, but as a Frank Herbert fan I'm confident that the experience is in good hands. It's a combination of solid mechanics that put a twist on the usual scenarios, and a deep deep obsession with the work of Herbert that strengthens the world building beyond the abilities of most narrative designs. Yes, I'm basically peeing in my Stillsuit with excitement, even after all the sandworm trauma. Now I just need Funcom to add an ability to make a Muad'Dib my in-game pet, rather than just another furry blood bag. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Rogers said they "were fooling themselves" thinking that plan would work. After PoE 2's early access release was delayed several weeks, the PoE 1 team continued to work on the sequel. Even after PoE 2 launched, it continued to run into problems, and Rogers said he couldn't justify taking the PoE team off the project until the fires were put out.</p><p dir="ltr">"How could we think about making a PoE 1 expansion, when we still had hundreds of thousands of people having bad experiences in PoE 2?" Rogers said.</p><p dir="ltr">It was after the developer's holiday break that it decided the goal was to get PoE 2 to a state where it didn't have major issues before moving forward with full development of PoE's new league. As a result, major work on PoE update 3.26 won't happen until a few weeks after the release of PoE 2 update 0.2.0, Rogers said. PoE 2 is currently on update 0.1.1, with no given release window for when 0.2.0 might arrive.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm really sorry for how this went down," Rogers said. "Honestly, I should have predicted the fact that taking the PoE 1 team off PoE 1 would lead to this outcome, and I probably should have resisted doing it. But at every stage I just kept thinking, 'We still have time, we still have time.' And then we didn't have time any more."</p><p dir="ltr">The silver lining is that some pre-production work on PoE update 3.26 is currently underway, and Rogers said once update 0.2.0 is out the door, the studio will devote as many resources as possible to releasing the new PoE league as soon as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">"We still have a lot to learn about how to run two games simultaneously," Rogers said. "We were overconfident. We still need to work out how to structure our studio to make this possible. But we do have a solid plan for what we want to do with [update] 3.26."</p><p dir="ltr">PoE 2's launch has largely been a major success story for Grinding Gear Games. The anticipated ARPG sequel saw <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-passes-over-1-million-early-access-players-dev-warns-of-server-struggles/1100-6528281/" data-ref-id="1100-6528281">more than 1 million players pay for early access</a> despite the fact that PoE 2 will eventually be free-to-play, and it's regularly one of the top-played games on Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">Its launch hasn't come without some unforeseen consequences, however. Grinding Gear Games stated its support staff was wildly unprepared for the amount of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-huge-early-access-launch-is-overwhelming-its-support-staff/1100-6528388/" data-ref-id="1100-6528388">support tickets related to PoE 2's early access launch</a>, and has had to double its support team to better meet demand.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/30/gran-turismo-7-update-1-55-adds-f3500-a-90s-inspired-formula-car/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Update 1.55 is out now for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>, and it’s got some great new cars and additions to the racing game, including a new formula car inspired by classic 90s F1 designs, and wider support for the Gran Turismo Sophy AI.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing the &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot; Free Update - January 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tLBtn5F5j2o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Four cars have been added in Gran Turismo 7 update 1.55:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gran Turismo F3500-A</li>
<li>Honda Civic Si Extra (EF) ’87</li>
<li>Hyundai IONIQ 5 N ‘24</li>
<li>Toyota C-HR S ’18</li>
</ul>
<p>All four can be purchased from Brand Central, giving us a modern crossover SUV, a rather popular electric car, an 80s touring car classic, and the original formula racing car as well.</p>
<p>The F3500-A is inspired by early 90s F1 cars, and I can definitely see shades of the Williams FW14B and FW15C, the McLaren MP4/8 and Jordan 191 in the curved from nose down to the front wing – there’s going to be some awesome custom liveries for this probably by later today! In-game, this will have a 3.5L naturally aspirated V12 that’s going to scream with high RPMs as you go through the 6-speed semi-auto gearbox.</p>

<p>Beyond the cars, there’s a new Extra Menu No. 43 for Group C cars, and there’s new World Circuit events:</p>
<p>Sunday Cup: Kyoto Driving Park – Miyabi<br>
Japanese FF Challenge 450: Sardegna – Road Track – C<br>
World Touring Car 600: Autódromo de Interlagos</p>
<p>Gran Turismo Sophy has also been expanded to two more circuits, no available to race against at Autódromo de Interlagos and Mount Panorama Circuit.</p>
<p>A strong update to start 2025!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mandragora">Mandragora: Whispers Of The Witch Tree</a> is a 2.5D Soulsvania from Primal Game Studio, in which you electrify, bisect or incinerate handsome, ravening night creatures in a world of heaped skulls and burning spires. Yes, I'm well aware that "2.5D" and "Soulsvania" are nonsense words, woven by pestilent market forces. Samuel Johnson is turning in his grave, I expect. He has risen from his grave and equipped himself with an ironbound dictionary and is even now making his way through the layers of the English language, hellbent on slaughtering every 'vania yet coined.</p>
<p>But never mind Samuel. Oversized rodents and spiders aside, Mandragora is notable for being written by Brian Mitsoda, writer of the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brian-mitsoda-has-been-fired-as-narrative-lead-on-bloodlines-2">former narrative lead for its sequel at Hardsuit Labs</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">lives on in the hands of The Chinese Room</a>. Primal have just announced a release date - 17th April. Here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Some plot from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721060/Mandragora_Whispers_of_the_Witch_Tree/">Steam page</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>"Mankind has surrendered the world to the monsters. The people of Faelduum hide away behind walls of brick and palisades of ignorance, constructed by their leaders. Joy and delight are coveted jewels, out of reach of the masses. This is not the world you were promised. Travel by night and take it back."</p></blockquote>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>You get a choice of classes and a set of nodular skill trees which look like blood spatter from a recent murder. You also get a travelling caravan you can populate with artisans who'll craft your kit. While some of the bigger munsters seem a bit spongy in the footage, I find them appealingly diseased and frenzied. I don't get the impression you'll be duelling many proud knights in armour. I also like the specific gradation of rotten beauty they're going for with the "painterly", seeping backdrops.</p><p>As for Mitsoda's contribution, you will "make devastating choices in a sinister and immersive story". He joined the project back in 2022. Here's an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1721060/view/3689050339694282320">interview from 2023</a> in which he breaks down what a narrative designer actually does, and offers some advice to game devs on "how to introduce a new world in a way that feels organic to the player". An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Don't wholesale copy something else, but feel free to mash up a bunch of influences. Figure out what you can do to make it different from other games in its genre while also appealing to fans of that genre. Focus on the characters - you can have a cliche plot, but the characters will keep people interested and keep the story relatable. Don't "magic" or "technobabble" for a solution - try to make sure everything in the game follows rules that are established and the player understands."</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps you'd like to wash that down with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/interview-without-a-vampire-bloodlines-b-mitsoda">one of our own interviews with Mitsoda about the craft of writing video games</a>, from way back in 2009.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
