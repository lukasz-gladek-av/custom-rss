            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/656169/wd-black-c50-xbox-storage-card-m4-macbook-air-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Maybe, like me, you bought the Xbox Series S with 512GB of storage and realized, after installing <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6,</em> that you don’t have much (or any) space left for any other games. And maybe, like me, you had to hunt for another drive so you could install other games to play.</p><p>If you’re still in that boat, you might want to consider Western Digital’s 2TB WD_Black NVMe solid state drive. It’s currently on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DK74LG91/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon for an all-time low of $179.99</a> ($50 off), or about 22 percent off the standard price, and will provide you with plenty of additional storage to work with. To put the price in perspective, it’s only $30 more than the 1TB version, which isn’t on sale. WD is also one of two manufacturers I’m aware of that make these easy plug-in cards — the other is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/5/23712516/xbox-expansion-cards-seagate-price-cut-deal-sale">Seagate</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->180</span></p><div><p>Western Digital’s storage expansion cards for Xbox Series X / S consoles are speedy, plug-and-play cards that match the performance of the consoles’ onboard SSDs. They offer a slightly lower-cost alternative to Seagate’s expansion cards, which were the only game in town for years.</p></div></div><p>There’s no fiddling around with screws or anything to get it to work, either. Just pop it into the back of your Xbox Series S / X, and bam, you’re good to go. Plug and play at its finest, baby.</p><p>But let’s pivot to another good deal real quick.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZD9S5GC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1883962-REG%2Fapple_mw123ll_a_13_macbook_air_m4.html%2FkZa17940ZSRrfIj%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjw5azABhD1ARIsAA0WFUGYcUxik6ZHlmds-QlwCWAQgyNHflK_dp8WpOc1Xjs6EEW8YhjAkFcaArdXEALw_wcB" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> are also selling Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review">brand-new M4 MacBook Air</a>, which just launched in March, starting at $899 (its best price to date). That’s $100 off Apple’s starting price of $999, which itself is already $100 cheaper than the entry-level price of the M3 model last year.</p><p>And, with the M4, you get 256GB of starting storage instead of 128GB, which is probably fine for most folks who don’t need a lot of local storage. Like me, for example. I’m using an M2 MacBook Air for work, and I only have 82GB used.</p><p>The latest M4 model also has a better 12-megapixel Center Stage camera that will follow your face around while you’re on camera (better said: it’ll keep you in frame) and 16GB of RAM. The design is unchanged from last year, which means you’re still getting just a MagSafe charger and two USB-C ports. But the update to M4 allows you to add two external monitors while also leaving the display open, for a total of three running screens. Good for multitasking.</p><p>It’s a MacBook Air. It’s the best MacBook for most people. You really can’t go wrong here.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Because of that success, many assumed a DLC expansion would be coming for the megahit RPG, but that doesn't seem to be the case--and in Larian CEO Swen Vincke's opinion, that's because the studio finds making DLC "boring."</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with GameSpot, Vincke mentioned that Larian is "not in the DLC business," pointing to Baldur's Gate 3's massive patches and updates as the way Larian prefers to update its games. When asked to expand further, Vincke called making DLC "boring" and said there's "no passion" in doing that at the studio.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="737228107" data-promo-id="0"

                <p dir="ltr">Machine-learning and artificial intelligence systems are some of the most-talked-about technologies in gaming--and across a variety of other industries. Some fear advancements to such systems might lead to negative consequences, while others predict a rosier future. Still others, like Larian Studios boss Swen Vincke, are trying to thoughtfully implement new technologies to help empower developers, not replace them. We caught up with Vincke recently, who discussed a range of subjects, including machine learning and AI. Watch the full interview below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9ss" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gy9P2HPF9ss" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tasks "Nobody Wants To Do"</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Vincke said Larian currently uses machine learning systems to help automate game-development tasks that "nobody wants to do."</p><p dir="ltr">"It's the obvious things, like a motion capture cleaning or voice editing or, something very specific. Retargeting. So that is basically if you play with different species, you want to be able to reuse an animation on a different species that are in different size, and then they're doing certain interactions with others," Vincke explained.</p><p dir="ltr">For these purposes, machine learning "works really well," Vincke said. Larian is also embracing the technology for what's called "white boxing," which is the term for how a studio like Larian iterates on ideas rapidly. "White boxing is essentially the stage before you actually do the real implementation," he said, noting that using machine learning can help speed up the process.</p><div tabindex="0"

traditional development circumstances, this might take "some time" before a developer can create something that's actually playable, but white boxing with machine learning helps "accelerate that."</p><p dir="ltr">But for Vincke's money, the most exciting implementation of machine learning is when it can be used for new gameplay elements. However, it's still early days, and Larian is "not there yet," or even close. But it's an area that Vincke is excited about because it could help the studio implement new RPG ideas faster.</p><p dir="ltr">"For an RPG developer, what you really want is something that helps with reactivity to agency," he said. "So, permutations that you did not foresee, reactions to things that the player has done, in the world, they will certainly augment the gameplay experience."</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke mentioned how in a game like FIFA (now called EA Sports FC), the under-the-hood procedural generation happens in real time, and that's what he's referring to in regards to how machine learning can impact gameplay.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Red Flags</strong></h2><p>For all of this hope and optimism about using new technologies like machine learning to help speed up and improve game development, Vincke said he understands there are "red flags" to consider. Some people have legitimate fears of machine learning and AI systems stealing their work or taking their jobs. However, Vincke said Larian is hiring more people, not fewer, thanks to new technologies. This is what others,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969"> like EA CEO Andrew Wilson and Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick</a>, have predicted.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's always going to be the people that are going to make a difference," Vincke said. "And so for us, it's super clear that we're investing heavily into the team and the human touch that's being added to that."</p><p dir="ltr">With more automation, human workers are freed up to create more, which in turn leads to the possibility of making "more complex things," Vincke said.</p><p dir="ltr">"When complexity goes up, things start getting really interesting. So it's fair to say that the games that are being made today are arguably more complex than they were in the past," he said. "The faster you can iterate, the faster you will get to a certain result. And then and the tightening of those pipelines should allow you, in theory, to make your games in a more efficient manner."</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>More Time To Be Creative</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Automation with machine learning AI is a "huge thing," Vincke said. People may not be aware of how much time an animator may spend on "stuff they don't want to work on." As such, thanks to automation, "It adds a lot to the time that they have to work on the creative stuff," Vincke said.</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke said it's "the wrong attitude" to assume that automation will replace various people and departments. Because automation should, in theory, allow people to do "more of what really matters and less of the stuff that they don't want to do."</p><p dir="ltr">"That's not necessarily cost reduction," he added. "But it's going to be an increase of ability, which is a good thing."</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What's Next For Larian</strong></h2><p>Following the huge success of Baludr's Gate 3 in 2024, everyone is wondering what Larian is going to make next. We know it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">won't be Baldur's Gate 4</a>, but instead a project codenamed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">Excalibur.</a></p><p>Beyond Larian's next game, Vincke is thinking even further out and has grand plans to create a "very big RPG" that will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-is-working-toward-an-rpg-that-dwarfs-it/1100-6522051/" data-ref-id="1100-6522051">"dwarf"</a> any of Larian's previous releases. "It's an inspirational goal. That's it. I cannot say more, because it needs to stay in that dream-reality," he said.</p><p>While Larian will not make Baldur's Gate 4, Hasbro has said it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">keen to expand the Baldur's Gate series with other teams. </a>"We're going to take our time and find the right partner, the right approach, and the right product," Hasbro previously said about the future of Baldur's Gate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-open-world-rpg-now-set-for-may-23-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Polish independent developer Questline has announced the full release date of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-open-world-rpg-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon</a>.</p>
<p>Questline previously launched <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1199030/Tainted_Grail_Conquest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tainted Grail: Conquest</a>, a hybrid game mixing deck-building roguelike elements with RPG, in 2021 to positive reviews.&nbsp;This one is much more ambitious, though. It's a first-person open world roleplaying game available on Steam Early Access for two years, now set to debut version 1.0 for PC and consoles (<a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-demo/9nql6tbgt1gc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>) on May 23.</p>
<p>The developers are promising a meaty experience that can take between 50 and 70 hours to be completed. Players will find the following content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three massive zones to explore:</strong>&nbsp;Horns of the South, Cuanacht, and Forlorn Swords.</li>
<li><strong>250 unique NPCs</strong>, fully voice-acted, adding depth and a personal touch to the world.</li>
<li><strong>Over 200 side quests</strong>, ensuring countless hours of engaging gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>More than 60 unique enemies</strong>, each presenting distinct challenges.</li>
<li><strong>70+ dungeons</strong>&nbsp;filled with secrets and dangers.</li>
<li><strong>A branching main quest</strong>&nbsp;with dozens of possible endings, offering deep replayability.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/utDgF27366E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Setting-wise, Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon is a dark fantasy reimagining of Arthurian legends. Players will journey into the heart of Avalon, a land shaped by 600 years of Camelot’s rule, to witness the epic conclusion of this era. With their choices, they will decide the legacy of King Arthur's reign.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 will introduce the community-requested third-person view. Questline has prefaced that it won't be perfect yet, but they're adding it in anyway since many users have problems with the first-person view (such as motion sickness). At this stage, it's more of an accessibility fix. Of course, there will also be brand new Achievements to mark the players' journey throughout Avalon.</p>
<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg, as the developers of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon hinted that version 1.0 includes so much content that it's 'crazy' and they would have 'laughed hard' if they were told the game would end up this big. However, the full patch notes aren't available yet.</p>
<p>As a side note, the team also shared a 'golden horse armor DLC' joke as a joke reference to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oblivion Remastered</a>, then added in a Steam post:</p>
<p><em>On a serious note, it is so good to see Oblivion coming back with such a style! It is one of the games that shaped us when we were kids/teens, and continues to be a huge source of inspiration. BIG congratulations to the team responsible for the remaster! We can’t wait to get back to Cyrodiil ourselves, but for now… well, we have a game to finish first! And we are honestly doing our best to deliver something unique that we hope you will remember for quite a long time.</em></p>

Loudness EQ levels out the game's high and low audio, minimizing loud and unnecessary sounds while boosting quieter ones like enemy footsteps.</p><p dir="ltr">As a PlayStation 5 player, I always assume my PC opponents can hear me from a mile away. I decided to try the new Audio Focus setting to remove some of their advantage with the sound in Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Admittedly, I was skeptical at first because this is a new setting and it doesn't offer as much control over the sound as PC's Loudness EQ. However, this definitely helped boost the footstep audio in Warzone, and I was able to catch enemies sneaking up on me from much greater distances. There were a few instances where I probably got reported as a cheater, because I could hear my opponent from such great distances and was instantly ready with my gun up.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few presets to choose from, but the one specifically for amplifying footsteps is the Boost High Pitch setting, which amplifies "high-frequency sounds like footsteps and metallic noises." Once you select it, you can then choose weak, medium, or strong.</p><p dir="ltr">Audio Focus definitely gives a competitive edge for PS5 players, but I wouldn't recommend using this Boost High Pitch on the strong setting, though, as it amplifies more than just the footsteps. Some of the metallic sounds it amplifies, such as the creaky metal from the planes in Boneyard, can really be painful on the ears.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the day, this is still an accessibility feature designed more for players with actual hearing loss. So, if you're not someone who needs the setting, it's best to try on the weak or medium strength. It's not worth ruining your hearing just to get a better jump on a Warzone opponent.</p><p dir="ltr">This Audio Focus setting also works in Black Ops 6 and should work for other competitive games on PlayStation 5 as well.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, a Call of Duty fan had their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tsa-seizes-call-of-duty-monkey-bomb-replica-from-passengers-luggage/1100-6531126/">Zombies-themed Monkey Bomb accessory confiscated</a> at the airport. I have this exact same accessory. It's just a solid mold of the CoD Zombies Monkey Bomb designed to hold a controller. This serves as a good reminder to myself and anyone else to not travel with any monkey bomb replicas.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> arrives this June, but there'll be an opportunity to check out its sandy survival action ahead of its full launch. Developer Funcom has announced it's holding the game's "largest beta yet" in May, with keys being made available to "tens of thousands" of players.
</p>
<p>
Funcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funcoms-open-world-survival-mmo-dune-awakening-gets-first-trailer">unveiled Dune: Awakening in 2022</a>, as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/conan-exiles-developer-funcom-lands-deal-to-make-dune-games">deal to make "at least" three games</a> set in the Dune universe. It whisks players to Arrakis for an open-world, multiplayer survival adventure drawing from Frank Herbert's sci-fi novels and Denis Villeneuve's film adaptations.
</p>
<p>
Dune Awakening has been in closed beta for over a year now, but with its full release now looming following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-delayed-for-last-minute-changes-from-beta-testers">brief delay</a>, Funcom is preparing one final, large-scale beta blowout that'll run from 9th-12th May. The studio is calling it Dune: Awakening's "largest beta yet... with a huge number of new players joining compared to previous closed betas".

<p>
It'll give players a chance to experience survival in the vast, wormy deserts of Arrakis, as well as "most of" Dune: Awakening's first story act - which Funcom says should equal around 20 hours of playtime. Unlike previous betas, there's no NDA to sign, and all gameplay can be shared.
</p>
<p>
To be in with a chance of taking part in the beta, players have a number of options. They can either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">visit Dune: Awakening's Steam page</a> and hit the 'Request Access' button, or tune into the Global LAN Party Broadcast on 10th May, which will include developer chat and more. Funcom says "tens of thousands" of keys will be handed out during the broadcast, and these can be used to gain immediate access to the Dune: Awakening beta weekend.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening gets its full Steam launch on 10th June, and an Xbox Series X/S and PS5 release is due at a later date. It's looking pretty promising too; Eurogamer's Robert Purchese came away impressed after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-proves-mmos-can-still-be-interesting-and-try-new-things">going hands-on with it earlier this year</a>, writing: "You can live out your Dune fantasy in the most faithful recreation of Arrakis we've yet seen in a game, pausing as the ground shudders from a nearby sandworm, ducking for cover as a sandstorm blows in, and searching crevices for the secrets of the world hidden within.... keep an eye on this one."

			<p>Sydney Sweeney is appearing in the news for video game to film adaptations for the second time this week. After a <a href="https://wccftech.com/michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney-have-reportedly-teamed-up-with-universal-to-make-a-film-adaptation-of-segas-out-run/">report from Deadline</a> that Sweeney would be teaming up with Michael Bay to adapt SEGA's Out Run into a movie, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney-jon-m-chu-video-game-1236377192/">Variety</a> reports that Sweeney is now teaming up with Wicked director Jon M. Chu to adapt Hazelight's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split-Fiction</a> into a film.</p>
<p>Sweeney is slated to be an executive producer and will also star in the movie. Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, the same writers behind Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, will write the script.</p>
<p>Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/">previously</a> reported that a Split-Fiction movie was happening, but now we know some of the key creatives behind the project. While Sweeney will play one of the lead roles between Zoe and Mio, characters named after Hazelight Studio head Josef Fares' daughters, it's not yet decided which role Sweeney will play.</p>
<p>In the case of a game like Out Run, it isn't easy to see what shape a film adaptation of that game will take. The opposite is true for Split-Fiction, which, despite having a predictable story, is ripe for a film adaptation with plenty of opportunities for big blockbuster movie moments in its fantasy and sci-fi settings.</p>
<p>The next big questions now are who will star alongside Sweeney, how Chu will bring some of the magic he brought to Wicked to Split Fiction, and whether the story can't be punched up in a new medium with its film version.</p>
<p>So far, in the renaissance of video game adaptations to movie or TV show adaptations, we've not seen an adaptation surpass the game in terms of storytelling. Some changes have been praised, but there hasn't yet been an adaptation where we could definitively say the story is improved in the adapted version. Split-Fiction feels like the perfect candidate to break that ceiling.</p>

It's being made inside CDPR by a dedicated team, Green added, noting that Nintendo staff helped with the project, too, when challenges or issues came up in development.</p><p>"Development still had challenges, of course, as any development process does, but we've been careful in picking tradeoffs to not compromise the game's vision," Green said. "We haven't had to fight with fitting into memory. And the speed of the data storage has helped alleviate some of those early streaming problems.

                <p>2023's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/" data-ref-id="1900-6418047">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a> had a lot of hype to deliver, but quickly became one of that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2023/2900-4922/#6" data-ref-id="2900-4922">year's best games</a> and a huge seller. It sold so much that, in fact, that <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250425.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Capcom officially announced</a> that it reached 10 million copies sold. Making it the fastest to reach that milestone than any other entry in the entire Resident Evil Franchise within just two years.</p><p>Capcom also compared the number of sales with the last few games of the series, starting with 2017's Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. Both Biohazard and the Resident Evil 2 Remake, released in 2019, have achieved over 15 million cumulative units sold. 2021's Resident Evil: Village has reached over 11 million cumulative units, while 2020's Resident Evil 3 Remake sold 10 million cumulative units.</p><p>Since the series launched in 1996, the company has sold 167 million units across almost 30 years of the franchise.</p><p>Resident Evil 4 was already touted as one of the greatest games of all time. Capcom raised the bar for what a good remake could be, all the while keeping the game's original legacy as a genre-defining experience intact. Of course, the memes of Ashley certainly didn't hurt, either.</p><p>It should be noted that Capcom didn't elaborate upon how the sales were broken down by platform, physical, digital, or any of that. Initial reports when the game was released had the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-sells-over-3-million-copies-in-2-days/1100-6512785/" data-ref-id="1100-6512785">selling three million in the first two days</a>, eventually reaching four million in the first two weeks. Those sales alone cemented it as one of the fastest-selling Resident Evil games ever.</p>

			<p>Players have asked EA for years to bring back the Skate series, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-4-announced/">four years ago</a>, EA finally answered those prayers with the official confirmation that the skateboarding series would indeed be coming back.</p>
<p>Four years later, we know that was just an announcement at the time and that this new Skate game was only beginning its development when EA confirmed the series' return. But now that we're <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-in-early-access-next-year/">approaching its early access</a> release sometime this year, we're learning more about it, and the latest bit of confirmed news is one that definitely won't go down well with fans.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-wont-be-playable-offline-to-offer-a-massively-multiplayer-sandbox-thats-always-online-and-always-evolving">Eurogamer</a>, developer Full Circle confirmed that the new Skate game will not have an offline mode. You'll always need to be online and connected to the game's servers when playing. In an FAQ section towards the bottom of a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-one">new blog</a> from Full Circle, the studio bluntly answered the question about an offline mode.</p>
<p>"<em>The simple answer: No. The game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving. You'll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities. In order to deliver on our vision of a skateboarding world, the game will always require a live connection.</em>"</p>
<p>It's disappointing news for veteran fans of the series, many of whom likely don't want to be bothered with the live service elements of the new Skate game. They were just looking to spend hours enjoying the skateboarding mechanics and feeling that only the Skate series provided back when the original trilogy was in its heyday.</p>
<p>While this new Skate game will launch in early access later this year, Full Circle also confirmed that more than 200,000 players have already gotten the chance to check it out in the game's closed alpha test that's been running since September 2024. If you want to join that number, you can still sign up for the playtest and hope to be selected. There's also always the hope that Full Circle will run an open beta ahead of the early access release closer to the launch.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-hit-500k-in-first-24-hours.1173903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive have revealed that turn-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has hit a major sales milestone within its first 24 hours on sale.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1915777375834452273" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Sandfall reveals that the game has hit 500,000 sales, despite only being available for less than a day. That's a pretty impressive milestone by itself, but the game is also available on Game Pass, so it's managed to hit that figure despite being part of a subscription service (for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">certain tiers</a>, at any rate).</p>

<p>Rather humbly, Sandfall and Kepler say the sales figure is "a milestone for us, reached sooner than we'd ever imagined", thanking those who've bought&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-boss.jpg?itok=-GXe246t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-boss.jpg?itok=DrYZhsfn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is selling very well indeed.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG set in a world inspired by Belle Époque-era France (in much the same way as the Soulslike&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/lies-of-p" rel="nofollow"><em>Lies of P</em></a>, although the two have very different gameplay).</p>

<p>The game is set in a world in which a figure known as the Paintress paints a number each year, and everyone of that age dies. Every year, the number gets lower, meaning more and more people are dying each time a number is painted.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, you're part of the titular Expedition 33, which refers to the number the Paintress will paint on the day following the outset of the game. It's up to you to stop her before she can claim more lives.</p>

<p>To do so, you'll engage in turn-based battles with real-time elements; you'll need to dodge and parry attacks with good timing, and some attacks also have&nbsp;<em>Shadow Hearts</em>-style quick-time events to increase damage.</p>




<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/clair-obscur--expedition-33/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/clair-obscur-expedition-33/9ppt8k6gqhrz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also part of Game Pass if you're subscribed to the Ultimate or PC tiers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-just-got-a-sneaky-teaser-by-capcom-fans-believe<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Capcom just dropped a clever Resident Evil 9 teaser right in front of our noses - or so fans believe.
</p>
<p>
Tilt your head and you can see the Roman numerals for the number nine - IX - appear in a video published today from Capcom that celebrates the success of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>.
</p>
<p>
As the video wraps up, we see a fresh paint on a sign added to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>'s iconic village scene, with writing that thanks fans for playing. But squint and the sign's shape is also a nod to what's next, fans think. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">Capcom already casually confirmed Resident Evil 9 was in development last summer</a> - with Resident Evil 7 director Koshi Nakanishi back at the helm.
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-11_T8hJCMM.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>
But details of Resident Evil 9 are otherwise scarce - we don't even know if Resident Evil 9, or IX, will be its title, though today's apparent teaser seems to suggest this may be the case. 
</p>
<p>
One report from veteran Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-will-be-open-world-leaker-suggests">suggested the next Resi game would feature more of an open-world</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We're making a new Resident Evil," Nakanishi said last year. "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after Resident Evil 7, but I found it, and to be honest, it feels substantial. I can't share any details just yet, but I hope you’re excited for the day I can."
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if you tilt your head the other way, Capcom is already teasing Resident Evil 11. But that seems a little soon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/25/oblivion-remastered-is-perfect-for-fans-on-the-long-wait-for-the-elder-scrolls-vi/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>“Stop right there, criminal scum!” Before it was a meme – in a time before memes – this famous quote yelled by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/oblivion">Oblivion’s</a> patrolling lawmen once filled me with dread. Probably because my Argonian rogue could often be found skulking Cyrodiil’s cities by night, my inventory chock full of stolen goods I’d later fence to a dodgy bloke in Bruma.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered - Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFJ3PZuAjK4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now, almost 20 years later those same words conjure a grin of familiarity, being just as comically melodramatic as I remembered. There’s no denying the colossal influence The Elder Scrolls IV had on the action roleplaying genre these past two decades yet, at its core, it’s a beautifully weird fantasy pantomime.</p>


<p>With its successor, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/skyrim">Skryim</a>, being playable on almost every household device, when people hear “The Elder Scrolls” they often think of battling dragons on snow swept battlefields, but there’s so much more to Bethesda’s long-running series. Returning to those older games, though, can trigger headaches, technically and gameplay-wise, despite their rich stories, settings, and characters boasting a timeless allure.</p>


<p>Developed by Virtuos in collaboration with Bethesda, what Oblivion Remastered offers is a more accessible way of playing The Elder Scrolls IV. Not only does it bring the game to modern systems, it features a slew of smart improvements that round off some of those rough mid 2000s edges. Thankfully, this isn’t just a top-to-bottom Skyrimification; sure, certain elements have been retrofitted, but they do little to diminish Oblivion’s unique identity. For example, character progression differs from Bethesda’s newer RPGs, giving players attribute points to tailor their playstyle, the level-up screen only activating once you’ve found somewhere in-game to sleep.</p>
<p>It’s clear to see that Virtuos has been careful not to alter core aspects of the Oblivion experience while trying their hardest to reduce friction and busywork. Inventory management has been streamlined with quickslots allowing players to seamlessly access weapons, spells, and other items without digging into menus. Oblivion Remastered even has a sprint button which purists may balk at, but it sure comes in handy when backtracking through dungeons or getting from A to B in Cyrodiil’s vast open world.</p>

<p>As for presentation, Oblivion has received a full makeover using Unreal Engine 5 and the results are mostly magnificent. Character models are bursting with life thanks to improved facial animations, lighting, lip sync, and textures, with Cyrodiil’s myriad landmarks and vistas given the same treatment.</p>
<p>For better or worse, one area of the game that hasn’t changed much is the core combat. Quality of life improvements have made Oblivion more tolerable for mages and rogues, though melee duels often result in mindless button-bashing, waiting to see whose health bar depletes fastest. In an age where almost every video game has a parry action, Oblivion’s combat feels stiff with little scope to pull off skill-based feats. Then again, if this was something Virtuos had changed, it may have been a bridge too far, fundamentally altering that core moment-to-moment gameplay.</p>

<p>This kind of restraint creates a game that floats between being a remaster and a remake, though the end result is still the same. Oblivion Remastered is the perfect nostalgia hit for fans of The Elder Scrolls eagerly awaiting the series’ eventual sixth instalment. It’s a revival that respects those gamers who loved the original, while sprucing it up enough to entice a new generation of players.</p>

			<p>With <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-stability-performance-improvements-mods/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> unsurprisingly shadow-dropped earlier this week, plenty of RPG fans began to feel concerned for <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-mod-removes-30-fps-cutscene-cap-fixes-ultrawide-resolutions-fov-issues-and-more/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, a brand-new RPG, from new studio Sandfall Interactive.</p>
<p>Those concerns ended up being unnecessary, as Sandfall Interactive <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1915777375834452273">announced today</a>, after Clair Obscur launched yesterday, that the game had already surpassed <strong>500,000 copies sold</strong>. A feat made even more impressive by the fact that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also launched directly into Xbox Game Pass, and hundreds of thousands of players still chose to spend the money to grab a copy of their own.</p>
<p>It's terrific news for Sandfall, with Clair Obscur being the studio's debut title. Along with the commercial success, Clair Obscur has found great critical success, joining <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-plus-extra-premium-april-2025-lineup-includes-hogwarts-legacy-blue-prince-battlefield-1-and-more/">Blue Prince</a> as one of the two games currently sitting at a 92 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Metacritic</a>. At this point, instead of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 getting overshadowed by Oblivion, you might even be able to say that the opposite is true, with Oblivion being the return of a beloved but also old RPG that millions of people have already played.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a new series from a new studio, offering a new experience to players that resonates with RPG fans. Of course by the end of the year it'll be interesting to see where Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 lands in conversations about what's the best game of the year, but already it seems like Clair Obscur could be 2025's version of a game like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, in that it's a new RPG on the scene that has people talking about it all year long.</p>
<p>It's also, like Metaphor, competing against a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/">legacy RPG series</a> and showing how far RPGs have come over the years.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening%E2%80%99s-first-20-hours-are-damn-impressive-despite-loads-of-bugs-closed-beta-impressions.1173855/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakenings-first-20-hours-are-damn-impressive-despite-loads-of-bugs-closed-beta-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I first saw a demo of Dune: Awakening over a year ago, I went from being skeptical that a survival game on the famously barren world of Arrakis could even work, to being absolutely hyped to get my hands on it. Now, after enduring the unforgiving conditions and hostile lifeforms of a desert planet for nearly 20 hours in the closed beta, I’m confident developer Funcom has the foundations of an absolutely stellar MMO that makes fantastic use of one of the greatest science fiction worlds ever created. Harvesting raw materials from the brutal wasteland, constructing bases, upgrading your character and loadout, and then bringing all of that to bear against raiders and rival houses is just about as good as I’d hoped for. That said, I still feel like I only got a small taste of the larger game, as all of the major social spaces, most of the PvP, and especially any of the all-important endgame areas were kept out of reach. And it’s also no wonder the release date for Dune: Awakening was pushed back a month while I was in the beta, as the build I played was absolutely rife with bugs and performance issues that will definitely need ironing out. Even so, I was quite impressed by the vast majority of what I saw, and am more optimistic than ever that they might just be able to pull this thing off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you only just recently got spat back up by a Shai Hulud, Dune: Awakening is an upcoming massively multiplayer survival game from the team of developers who gave us the quite underrated Conan Exiles. The premise is simple: you find yourself on Arrakis and have to find a way to not die there, and if you know even a little about the setting, then you should understand just how tall of an order that is. In typical survival game fashion, you’ll start off with almost nothing, and turn piles of rocks and scraps of metal harvested from the wilds into tools to help you survive, building shelter along the way to protect yourself from the harsh environment. While you might (and frankly, wouldn’t be blamed) for wondering how the heck jogging around a massive, featureless desert could possibly be fun, Funcom has actually done a great job of filling each region with shipwrecks to plunder, hidden caves and fortresses to blast your way through, and mountain ranges to climb. And while there’s plenty of empty space with nothing but unremarkable piles of sand to greet you, these spaces are actually used to great effect as obstacles keeping you from the next area, which must be navigated across quickly, lest you find yourself on the business end of a giant sand worm.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dune: Awakening - January 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, early on you’ll be limited to a very small area that’s cut off from higher level areas that contain better loot and materials you need to craft better equipment. But crossing the massive distance of sand that stands between you on foot is a death sentence, as you’ll undoubtedly draw the attention of an angry worm in the process. To get to the other side, you’ll have to go through the steps of constructing your first vehicle, a small motorbike, then race across the gap as quickly as you can. This clever use of empty space brilliantly turns what I thought would be a weakness in the setting into a strength, and finding ways to cross a completely barren area with a Shai Hulud hot on your tail actually made up some of my favorite moments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, the oppressive nature of the sun, which forces you to dart from shaded area to shaded area, turns the entire planet into a high stakes game of “the floor is lava” that can make otherwise uneventful jaunts from one place to another into an entertaining minigame. Refusing to take sun exposure seriously will drain you of ever-valuable water, wipe out your health, and kill you in pretty short order, which kept me on high alert, and since each region increases the heat level, you’re constantly having to invent new equipment back at your base to give yourself the best odds at survival. Sure, it can be a bit of a pain now and again when you hit the head and come back to find the sun’s shifted position and you’re now frying to death in the merciless heat, but hey, that’s just the price you pay for living on Arrakis, my friend, and I mostly enjoyed this little minigame that just made survival that much more tricky.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, in addition to crossing arid deserts and dodging sunlight, you’ll be fighting off bands of bloodthirsty raiders and exploring forgotten places with a gun or sword in hand. The third-person gunplay isn’t groundbreaking by any means, as you’ll duck behind cover, toss grenades, and and return fire in pretty by-the-numbers encounters, but for an MMO with a massive number of players on the server, it’s still quite admirable that they managed to pull off gunplay that feels this snappy. And with a whole bunch of skill trees to pick from and build into – like the tricky and stealthy Mentats or expert survivalist Planetologists – there’s tons of ways to differentiate your character from the rest of your guild. As for myself, I focused most of my skill points into the tried-and-true soldier, which I expected might be a tad boring, but was pleasantly surprised to find myself very happy to be grapple-hooking around and tossing deadly gadgets to and fro. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Running and gunning with friends at your side is especially entertaining, and there were moments, like when my co-op partner used her Bene Gesserit skills to force an enemy to walk out into the open, then I threw a grenade to take them out, where combat really shines. There was also just the tiniest sampling of PvP in the beta build, focused on a couple crash sites that allowed for player-on-player violence, but due to server populations being fairly low in the closed beta, it was hard to get a sense for how this aspect will shake out. In any case, the vast majority of PvP hot zones are in the endgame areas I wasn’t allowed to progress to, so it seems we’ll probably have to wait for the full game to get a good feel on PvP anyway.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a longtime fan of Dune, it also just feels so good to explore and learn more about a world that I’m quite fond of, and Funcom has clearly put a ton of effort into worldbuilding and lore, even despite taking quite a bit of creative liberty by placing Awakening within a parallel reality and canon than the books/movies. There are little details that have a massive impact on gameplay, like how incredibly valuable water is treated as the ultimate resource – you’ll drain blood from every fallen enemy, turn your own bodily fluids into water with a stillsuit, and take down bases just to pillage every drop of liquid gold they’ve got hidden away. And since water is required to make advanced materials used for crafting more higher level equipment, you’ll need to harvest and stockpile as much as you can, in addition to drinking it just to keep yourself alive. I won’t go into spoilers, but this kind of attention to detail touches just about every aspect of the world, including the factions and characters you meet along the way, which should be a treat for any fan of the setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s anything to be concerned about with this otherwise thoroughly engaging beta, it’s the fact that I encountered a whole heap of bugs and performance issues during my time with it, which included everything from crashes to framerate dips, characters and objects getting stretched out bizarrely, and more. With the final version set to debut very soon, I was then pretty relieved when, in the middle of the beta, Funcom announced a month-long delay, presumably to address these issues. As always, it’s tough to gauge how much of this is cause for concern when betas are sorta designed to help highlight and patch these sorts of issues, but the sheer number of problems me and my friends encountered while playing was definitely cause for alarm with the launch date so near.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Outside the core plot, there's a wonderful silliness - and self-deprecation - to Clair Obscur that, together with its outstanding art direction and unique battle mechanics, ensure the game is distinct," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>. "It's an ambitious yet impressive debut from the studio that, despite a somewhat fanciful narrative, is a pensive examination of grief and the power of art."</p>

		<p>A brand new trailer has been released for DOOM: The Dark Ages, and it introduces a brand new area called the Cosmic Realm. It represents a new type of location for the DOOM franchise, one the developers have wanted to explore for a while. At its core, the Cosmic Realm is a Lovecraftian dimension and in the DOOM universe it has formed an alliance with Hell.</p>
<p><iframe title="DOOM: The Dark Ages - Cosmic Realm First Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVBI55DbNQI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Cosmic Realm is more than just a new location for players to rip and tear through, as it is home to a host of new enemies. One of those new enemies is the Cosmic Baron who is a twin bladed brute that attacks quickly to put players under pressure. You won’t be safe if you get some distance from the Cosmic Baron either as he has psionic attacks which are able to block your attacks too. The Cacodemon is another enemy which floats and is able to immobilise you with shield attacks from range which can be followed up be tentacle attacks when it gets close.</p>
<p>Of course, it isn’t all gloom in the Cosmic Realm because within it is a brand new weapon. That weapon is the Reaver Chainshot. The Reaver Chainshot fires a ballistic mace. You can use it as a quick attack to take on a single enemy, or charge it up to unleash the Chaos Sphere. According to the development team, the Reaver Chainshot is unlike any other weapon found in the DOOM games.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>&nbsp;release date has been confirmed for 15th May, coming to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>&nbsp;and PC, and on day one with applicable tiers of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

			<p>Good Fun Corporation, formerly known as Black Matter and the developers behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-let-loose-wwii-strategic-squad-shooter-now-available-on-pc/">Hell Let Loose</a>, have shown off the first gameplay for their upcoming game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1752080/HUNGER/">Hunger</a>.</p>
<p>Hunger is a PvPvE extraction shooter that looks like its borrowing a lot of what made Hell Let Loose an impressive-looking game with a whole new setting. Instead of the World War II setting, Hunger drops you into Napoleonic Europe with a bit of a fantastical twist in a deadly Bacterium that's running through the region like a plague.</p>
<p>Hunger will feature an RPG progression system with what Good Fun Corporation describes will be "<em>a mix of methodical and frenetic ranged and melee combat as you enter a deadly and brutal dance with both the Hunger and other Living who seek to take what is yours. Find and equip armor, bags, trinkets, medicines, weapons, and shields to ready yourself for the different environments and battles ahead.</em>"</p>
<p>The new gameplay trailer shows off Hunger's mixture of firearms and melee weapons, with a short look at inventory management and the hub area you'll explore.</p>
<p><iframe title="HUNGER | OFFICIAL GAMEPLAY REVEAL TRAILER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y6ZSbX-iJd0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hunger is currently set to release later in 2025 as an Early Access title on PC, with three maps and over 30 weapons available at launch, with more to be added post-launch.</p>
