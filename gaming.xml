            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It only makes sense that the first room lighting system inspired by the world’s top anime franchise would be created by the world’s fastest-growing consumer electronics company. Govee has teamed up with Evangelion to create a visually stunning, deeply immersive gaming wall light setup inspired by <em>Evangelion: New Theatrical Edition</em>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3838/">it’s available at Amazon in a must-see Labor Day deal for just $120 — 40% off its regular price.</a> The easily installed Govee x Evangelion Gaming Wall Light set is easy to set up and even easier to control, and the effect it has on your gaming room is staggering.</p>
<p>The kit comes with six translucent dual-layer RGBIC wall lights and two connectors, all of which can be customized and controlled with the Govee Home smartphone app, and the system works with Matter, Alexa, and Google Assistant for hands-free control. The EVA-themed faceplaces and diffusion lines can be individually controlled to create amazing lighting effects that evoke the intense, fast-moving combat scenes from the <em>Evangelion</em> anime franchise. This $200 Govee light set is just $120 while this limited-time Amazon deal is in effect.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3838/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Complete Customization</h2>
<p>The shapes and patterns of the Govee x Evangelion Gaming Wall Light set are entirely up to you, and there are even expansion packs with more lights, connectors, and swappable faceplates available at Amazon, so your EVA-themed light show is only limited by your imagination and the size of your walls. The Govee app has 8 <em>Evangelion</em>-inspired lighting effects that replicate the battles and high points from the ultra-popular reboot series&nbsp;<em>Evangelion: New Theatrical Edition</em>. With an enormous menu of customizable colors and effects, you can create light show that evoke empowering your battlefield forces, elevating your defensive force auras, and intense battle ambience.</p>
<p>While it may sound like a huge undertaking to create a space like this, it’s actually exceptionally easy. Like all of Govee’s groundbreaking lighting setups, it’s remarkably easy to set up the Govee x Evangelion Gaming Wall Light set, and once it’s in place and connected, it stays there thanks to Govee’s superior construction and quality of both the lights and connectors. Once you decide on your pattern and have it in place, just pair the Govee Home App to your setup so it can recognize your spliced shape and set up the menu for you to customize, program, and control.</p>



<h2>Everything’s Included</h2>
<p>The Govee x Evangelion Gaming Wall Light set includes six light sections, one square connector, one triangle connector, a power adapter, nine connecting pieces, the control box, user manual, pre-installation cleaning cloth for your walls, and the EVA special lighting effects activation card that adds the&nbsp;<em>Evangelion</em> theme to the Govee Home App. The expansion kits and swappable faceplates are also available at Amazon.</p>
<p>Govee has only been around since 2017, but in those 8 short years they have transformed the home lighting space with well-priced, easily customizable kits that have thousands of colors and patterns and effects that deliver a truly transformational effect wherever you place them. Their collaboration with&nbsp;<em>Evangelion</em> is their latest brand extension, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3838/">anime fans won’t want to miss this 40% off limited-time Amazon deal that makes the Govee x Evangelion Gaming Wall Light set a total steal at just $120.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-co-op-split-screen-is-technically-feasible-says-ceo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-co-op-split-screen-is-%E2%80%9Ctechnically-feasible-%E2%80%9D-says-ceo.1285641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2’s CEO has stated that the split-screen co-op feature is technically possible and is on the developers’ list of features to investigate.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 is experiencing its best time since launch, with the game releasing for a brand new platform, the Xbox Series consoles, and hitting its highest concurrent player count on Steam since April 2024. Moreover, the game has also received the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-warbond-release-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legendary HALO ODST Warbond</a> recently.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-devs-have-co-op-splitscreen-on-their-to-investigate-list">Helldivers 2 Devs Have Co-Op Splitscreen on their ‘To Investigate’ List</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/helldivers-2-split-screen-co-op-ceo-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, a player recently asked about Helldivers 2 getting split-screen support on the game’s official Discord. The CEO of Arrowhead Studios, Shams Jorjani, responded, stating that co-op split-screen for Helldivers 2 is “technically feasible”, but isn’t sure whether this is a feature players really want. However, the feature has been placed on their “to investigate” list, so there’s a chance we may hear something about it, but players shouldn’t get their hopes too high.</p>



<p>Since the advent of online co-op, offline split-screen co-op has begun to disappear from games, with almost no recent games offering this feature anymore. Split-screen co-op could be a great addition for Helldivers 2, but it all depends on the execution. However, as it is a PvE title, a local co-op option might be something players might be genuinely interested in. Regardless, we will have to wait and see if Arrowhead takes action.</p>



<p>In other news, Helldivers 2 devs thought Fortnite’s new season <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-new-season-feels-like-we-have-helldivers-at-home-arrowhead-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">felt like</a> “we have Helldivers at home”. What are your thoughts on Helldivers 2 receiving split-screen co-op? Is that a feature you might be interested in? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/operation-night-strikers</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-operation-night-strikers-switch-m2-does-it-again-with-this-taito-themed-collection.1285629/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Operation ﻿Night Strikers Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158405/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Taito may be famous for creating the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/space_invaders">Space Invaders</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/bubble_bobble">Bubble Bobble</a>, but for a brief period at the close of the 1980s, it became the hottest name in arcades thanks to the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/operation_wolf">Operation Wolf</a>, a <strong>Rambo</strong>-inspired military shooter with a realistic Uzi strapped to its cabinet.</p>
<p>Ported to pretty much every home system of the era, the game was followed by sequels that expanded on the core gameplay but never <em>quite</em> achieved the same degree of fame. Fast forward to the present, and emulation specialist M2 has bundled up Wolf with <strong>Operation Thunderbolt</strong> and <strong>Space Gun</strong> — and thrown in the utterly superb <strong>Night Striker</strong>, a Super Scaler-style shooter inspired by the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_space_harrier">Space Harrier</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/3d_after_burner_ii">After Burner</a> for good measure — to create <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/operation_night_strikers">Operation Night Strikers</a>.</p>
<p>Mindless shooting is the backbone of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/operation_night_strikers">Operation Night Strikers</a>, then, and in lieu of proper light gun support, M2 has opted for a trio of potential control methods. You can use the analogue stick — which works well enough — or opt for using the Joy-Con's gyro controls. The third option involves a USB mouse.</p>
<figure><a title="Operation ﻿Night Strikers Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158413/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The gyro-aiming approach has been used in titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_remake">House of the Dead: Remake</a>, and it works better than you might imagine, thanks to the presence of an on-screen crosshair. This tends to drift as you play, but thankfully, you can recalibrate with a single button press during the action. Using a USB mouse will feel a <em>little</em> like cheating for light gun purists, but it is perhaps the best interface method of the ones available, assuming you've got a flat surface handy to rest it on.</p>
<p>All three light gun offerings here are excellent, with Operation Wolf giving you plenty to shoot at while its direct sequel spruces things up with more dynamic environments, all made possible by 2D scaling tech. Space Gun takes this to the next level, swapping out hostile military juntas for xenomorphs and cleverly simulating smoothly-scrolling 3D-style corridor sections with angled 2D sprites.</p>
<p>Night Striker is the outlier, as it's not a light gun game but one where you control a futuristic car which can instantly take to the air. It feels like a fusion of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/out_run">OutRun</a> (thanks to the branching pathways – although to be fair to Taito, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/darius">Darius</a> features those, too) and Space Harrier, combined with some amazing <strong>Blade Runner</strong>-style locations and a wonderful Zuntata soundtrack.</p>
<figure><a title="Operation ﻿Night Strikers Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158417/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>It's arguably the best game in this collection, and this pixel-perfect port even surpasses the one released on the Saturn and PS1 in Japan back in the '90s. It might be pushing it slightly to say the Night Strikers is worth the cost of purchase on its own, but it's certainly close – <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/m2s-night-striker-gear-gets-new-story-and-gameplay-trailer">and sets us up nicely for M2's forthcoming sequel.</a></p>
<p>Because this is an M2 release, you get the traditionally spot-on emulation as well as various CRT filters and other options, including online leaderboards. There's also a selection of information arrayed around the screen, which makes things like health and remaining bombs easier to parse; all of this can be toggled on and off at will. It's also possible to select between the US and Japanese versions of each game.</p>
<p>Also impressive is the fact that M2 has gone the extra mile and included the home ports that followed these coin-op releases (on my physical import copy, at least - they're available as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/operation-night-strikers-cs-pack-70050000060617-switch/">DLC</a> <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Operation-Night-Strikers-2890005.html">on the eShop</a>). For Operation Wolf, the Famicom, NES and Master System versions are present, but sadly, the PC Engine port isn't. Operation Thunderbolt's SNES conversion also makes the cut, but it's a pale imitation of the original game, despite offering six different characters to play as.</p>
<figure><a title="Operation ﻿Night Strikers Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158406/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Not all of the ports allow you to use gyro aiming, and there's often quite a notable gulf in quality between them and the arcade originals, but they're still interesting to play. For many of you, the nostalgic pull might be stronger with these versions, as they may well have been your first experiences of these notable arcade releases.</p>
<p>Night Striker's Mega CD port is included, too, and while it looks like a blocky mess when compared to the coin-op, the sense of speed is impressive, and the arranged soundtrack is fantastic.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The notion of picking up a collection featuring three light gun shooters and a relatively obscure Super Scaler-style game might be a little too esoteric for some Switch owners, but hardcore Taito fans will have a blast (no pun intended) with Operation Night Strikers. The emulation is perfect, the control methods are decent, and there's plenty of customisation on offer, making this another highly recommended M2 offering.</p>
<p>Longevity is going to be an issue for some — even with the online leaderboards in place — and some of the included home ports are a little rough around the edges, but players of a certain age will find a lot to like here, given the legendary status of Operation Wolf and the quality of the other titles included.</p></section>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape from Tarkov</a> is finally emerging from an early access period that will have lasted nearly a decade, when its full release on November 15th rolls around, and you'll soon be able to grab it on Steam.</p>
<p>Yep, it's taken yeaaaaarrrssss. Tarkov's initial alpha release came on August 4th, 2016, just a few days before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> arrived for the first time, and just after a little game called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> dropped. Think about what you were doing back then. I was a teenager, still far from the job-having husk I've since morphed into.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, old feeling aside, Tarkov's Steam page looks like it'll drop any day now, after Battlestate Games studio head Nikita Buyanov decided to tweet some things. First there was a <a href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/1961830502928724363">gif of an old bloke</a> holding a steaming iron on August 30th, which everyone took as a tease rather than an endorsement for getting the creases out of your favourite top from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> developerman. Said FPS developerman was also, er, rather forthright in his reply to someone who responded to that post with accusations of scamming.</p>
<p>Then, the next day, Buyanov dispensed with the pagentry. "Yes! The page on Steam will be available soon. All the details later," he posted, alongside a picture of said Steam page that'd be easier to dissect if it didn't have a great big Steam logo slapped on top of it. You know, just in case you don't know what a Steam page looks like, or had missed him saying that's where Tarkov's heading.</p><div>

</p></div>
<p>Will existing players who want to switch to Steam have to buy it again and start from scratch? That's what folks in Buyanov's replies wondered, and he doesn't look to have provided an answer. Don't worry, I'm sure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-escape-from-tarkov-pve-mode-exclusive-to-pricey-unheard-edition-despite-promises-of-free-dlc">everything'll work out ok</a>.</p>
<p>If it's been a while since you've escaped to Tarkov, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-from-tarkov-is-offering-players-in-game-currency-as-a-bounty-for-reporting-cheaters">cheaters</a> have remained an issue in it over recent years, but it's still on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">our top survival games list</a>. Also here's an excerpt from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-from-tarkov-has-sent-me-on-a-long-quest-for-some-toilet-roll">an article</a> about Craig Pearson hunting down some toilet roll in it:</p>
<blockquote>I stalked the corridors, cracking doors and checking rooms, closing them as I went, because I was taught to be respectful even during an apocalypse. I found piles of crap and burnt-out detritus, but no loo roll. When I discovered a body pile on the roof it was full of worthless military doodads. This is a world with more shotguns than sponge soft shitter sheets.</blockquote>
<p>Here's hoping he's located some loo paper in the years since 2020.</p>

              <p>Building your own custom gaming PC is a good way to save some money versus just outright buying a pre-built, but that doesn’t exactly mean it’s cheap. PC parts can be expensive and as you start adding CPUs, graphics cards, SSDs, and more to your cart, that number skyrockets pretty fast. If you can find any of those parts at a discount, it isn’t such a bad idea to pay them some attention. For instance, this ASUS TUF gaming motherboard is on sale over at Amazon as part of a limited time deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3837/">The Z790-Plus WiFi normally goes for $250, but right now you can grab one for 24% off. That saves you $64, bringing the price down to just $186.</a></p>
<p>With the ASUS TUF Z790-Plus WiFi, you’re getting onboard WiFi 6 as the name implies. Expect ultra-fast wireless networking speeds and improved capacity. The motherboard is also Windows 11-ready right out of the box.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3837/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>You’ll find your connection options are highly versatile. The TUF-Gaming Z790-Plus WiFi packs three different USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C ports on it with two in the rear and one in the front. You also have support for Thunderbolt 4.</p>
<p>There are four PCLe 4.0 M.2 slots which support up to two 22110 devices along with NVMe SSD RAID. The PCLe slots are reinforced with a metal sheath which keeps your cards firmly in place to ensure you don’t have issues with anything disconnecting, even when moving around your PC.</p>
<p>The PCLe slots are equipped with a quick release physical button. Custom PCs are sort of your own little Ship of Theseus in that you’ll find yourself making incremental upgrades throughout its life. Those quick release buttons will make upgrading your storage or graphics card much easier down the line.</p>



<h2>Cooler by Design</h2>
<p>Keeping your gaming PC cool can be an uphill battle. The ASUS TUF Z790-Plus WiFi motherboard has been engineered to help keep temperatures down. It’s armed with an enlarged VRM heatsink. Plus three M.2 slots along with the PCH feature heatsinks which help provide enough mass and surface area so heat can dissipate. The multi-layered circuit board allows it to spread out around the voltage regulators which improvs system stability.</p>
<p>So if you’ve been putting together a list of PC parts to consider for your custom gaming tower, this ASUS TUF Z790-Plus WiFi motherboard might just fit the bill. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3837/">It’s currently $64 off with that 26% discount. Instead of paying $250, you can get it for just $190 for a limited time.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-is-us">Hell Is Us</a> is a pretty fascinating game, but one that has me struggling to figure out if I really like it. I mean, I do fundamentally like it, and I think it does a good job of letting you explore and discover things on your own while offering puzzles that are simple enough that you’ll get all of the important ones done with very little issue. I also think it’s a game that respects your time by not being too long, but it then fails to respect your time by making some parts of the interface needlessly clunky. It’s a game that you’ll absolutely want to play with a notepad and pen nearby, and one where you’ll rapidly overcome the initial feeling of horror in favour of something closer to monotony at times.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell is Us | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X_8JCpFj2qM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hell Is Us has you exploring the country of Haldea, which is currently in the midst of a brutal civil war, resulting in overwhelming brutality to all sorts of people. Children are not safe from the horrors of mankind, nor are the pious or the kind. People die in wars, and Hell Is Us wants to constantly remind you of that fact. A big part of the game is dedicated to the evil of mankind, which does a good job of balancing out the horrors of the unkown calamity that’s also descending upon the country.</p>


<p>The calamity brings with it some wonderfully unsettling creatures that contain geometric infinites within them, along with the distilled feelings of grief and beyond. The combat is fairly standard stuff, although if you’re good at it you’ll never need to use healing items because you can actually heal after finishing a combo, sort of like in Nioh. I have no idea how that fits in, but it’s definitely very convenient. It’s probably because combat just doesn’t feel like the point of Hell Is Us. Instead it’s the investigation, exploration, and basic human kindness that are at its core.</p>


<p>You’re meant to wander around the beautiful and haunted landscapes, finding mysteries, people to help, and the odd dungeon to explore. I initially found all of this pretty exhilarating, and the game does a great job of making you feel like you’re clever enough to work all of this stuff out as well. However, a lot of the exploration ends up being restricted because of a knee-high obstacle you can’t cross, and a lot of the puzzles just turn into “where is the key I need for this specific door?” It loses its lustre pretty rapidly, and after only a handful of hours, I found myself more aggravated by each mystery instead of being excited to solve it.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that a lot of the clues you get just get chucked into your inventory, which takes longer than it should to open up, and then you’ll need to find the specific bit of paper you were looking for, take a picture of it on your actual phone and then use that to solve the puzzle from there. I really want to like the design here, and sometimes I do, but it feels like a punishment for not having an eidetic memory. I have ADHD, which is pretty close to being the opposite of that, unless you’re asking me to recall how to perform a Hadouken or some D&amp;D-related fact.</p>

		
		

<p>You’ll note that this means I’m a bit unconvinced by the two main ways the game lets you interact with it: both the combat and the puzzles. So, uh, you can see why I don’t love it. The characters and story are fairly interesting for the most part, and I do really like the general message of the game. I’m a sucker for anything telling us that the best way to save the world is to just help people out, and Hell Is Us does that a fair bit. I just wish it were less antagonistic towards the player.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Hell Is Us is a genuinely interesting game that many will adore for its commitment to letting you spend your time exploring mysteries and unlocking lore. The fact that you'll want a notepad near you will send some of you rabid, and that's great. For me though, Hell Is Us is a game that looks beautiful in every respect, but ends up feeling a little bit too paint-by-numbers when it comes to the actual mechanics at play. I like Hell Is Us well enough, but I don't know that I'll remember it.	</p></div>

<p>The real juicy part of this 'leak', however, is in the sets' supposed prices and piece counts. The post claims that one set will measure in at 587 pieces with a $59.99 price tag, another will cost $199.99 and will contain 2,050 pieces, while the last will feature... wait for it... 6,838 pieces for the eye-watering sum of $649.99.</p>
<p>There's no indication of what these sets will be, but for reference, that last one's piece count would make it the seventh-largest LEGO set released to date, putting it between the Star Wars AT-AT (6,785 pieces) and Millennium Falcon (7,541 pieces) sets. For those wondering, the largest is the World Map build, which measures in at 11,695 pieces.</p>

<p>But wait, there's more! In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1n47ptf/promopokemon_february_gwp_insiders_reward_source/">follow-up post</a>, CarterBricks04 shared that an 18+ Pokémon-themed gift with purchase (GWP) would also be arriving on 27th February, with a 12+ "Nintendo-related" Insiders Reward going live on the same day for 2,500 Insiders Points.</p>
<p>It's a very exciting prospect (even if our wallets are already judging us at the mere suggestion of that price), but let's try to stay realistic here. This is still nothing more than a rumour for the time being, and while the Legoleak group has been on the money about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/08/rumour-animal-crossing-lego-it-may-be-coming-next-year-according-to-leaks">Animal Crossing</a> LEGO sets in the past, the official details for the Pokémon collection go no further than the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/its-official-lego-pokemon-sets-are-finally-coming-our-way-next-year">initial announcement</a>.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping our eyes peeled for an <em>official</em> first look in the coming months, but until then, we'll cautiously start saving our pennies — heck, whatever form the collection takes, you know it's going to be a pricy one...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Lords of the Fallen II developer and publisher CI Games has already shared the game's PC system requirements, even though it may well be several months—if not a full year—before it actually launches. The specs have been listed <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-58d924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the Epic Games Store page</a>, although they do not include any target resolution, frame rate, or graphics preset, making them quite vague.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum Requirements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Operating System: Windows 11</li>



<li>CPU: Intel i5 8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li>



<li>Memory: 12 GB</li>



<li>GPU: NVIDIA RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 5700</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Recommended Requirements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Operating System: Windows 11</li>



<li>CPU: Intel i7 8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600</li>



<li>Memory: 16 GB</li>



<li>GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</li>
</ul>



<p>The store page also lists the languages in which the game will be subtitled: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish (Spain), Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, Polish, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), and Russian.</p>



<p>Like the previous game, Lords of the Fallen II will run on Epic's Unreal Engine 5. Hopefully, it will perform better than its predecessor did at its launch, taking advantage of <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-declares-great-hitch-hunt-rid-games-stutters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UE5's latest improvements to combat stuttering</a>.</p>



<p>Lords of the Fallen II was formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-debut-trailer-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> at Gamescom 2025 with a cinematic trailer and the confirmation of the 2026 target release window. The game will take place several centuries after the previous installment, retaining the dual-world mechanics. The world of the dead, Umbral, is said to be encroaching on Axiom, the world of the living, and players will have to find a way to stop it from consuming all existence.</p>



<p>The developers also vowed to take into account the community's feedback for this sequel, implementing several highly requested features and improving the combat balance, as already glimpsed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lords of the Fallen version 2.0</a>. Overall, CI Games hopes for Lords of the Fallen II to pull off <a href="https://wccftech.com/ci-games-lords-of-the-fallen-2-empire-strikes-back-dark-knight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an “Empire Strikes Back” moment for the fantasy action RPG franchise</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lego-pokemon-prices-have-possibly-leaked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-pok%C3%A9mon-date-prices-have-possibly-leaked-and-include-649-99-set-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1285593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The idea of LEGO Pokémon prices allegedly being expensive is as shocking as being unable to catch Mewtwo first go with a Poké Ball—it’s not. A new leak claims to have gotten wind of the first LEGO Pokémon date and prices, and while not official, it seems there will be at least one monstrous set.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-mario-kart-spiny-shell-set-promo-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO</a> acquiring the right to use the Pokémon license is a win for all. MEGA has done a great job with its range of products over the years—my house proudly displays a giant Gyarados, Eevee, and a Poke Ball! But it’s certainly exciting to see what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Pokémon</a> is in the works.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-pokemon-reportedly-arrives-in-2026-and-will-be-expensive">LEGO Pokémon Reportedly Arrives in 2026 And Will Be Expensive</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Welcome changes. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the popular and reliable <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LegoLeak</a> subreddit, the new LEGO Pokémon sets are releasing on March 1, 2026.</p>



<p>Three sets have been outed: 72151, 72152, and 72153. The first one reportedly has 587 pieces and will cost $59.99. The second set contains 2050 pieces and costs $199.99. The third and final set (72153) apparently features a whopping 6838 pieces and will set you back $649.99.</p>



<p>Again, this is a rumored leak, so take this information at face value for what it is. The fun part is now speculating what the sets could be. LEGO tends to have different versions of the same theme. The Millennium Falcon, for example, has three variations, and the main difference between them is size and price.</p>



<p>The three models mentioned in the leak could be Pikachu, but getting progressively bigger and more expensive. Either way, I can’t wait to see what LEGO Pokémon sets are in development.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Which LEGO Pokémon sets are you keen to see? Who’s your favorite Pokémon? I am desperate for a Gastly, Haunter, and Gengar set, personally. Let me know what you hope to see through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/blizzard-lawsuit-world-of-warcraft-turtle-wow/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard-had-filed-a-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-against-world-of-warcraft-turtle-wow-server.1285581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard has recently filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the <a href="https://wccftech.com/turtle-wow-2-0-server-will-bring-azeroth-to-unreal-engine-5-with-dlss-and-fsr-support/">Turtle WoW server</a>, highlighting in the suit how the server's operators have built their business on ongoing infringement of the company's intellectual property.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/08/30/blizzard-files-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-against-world-of-warcraft-rogue-server-turtle-wow/">Massively Overpowered</a>, Blizzard finally took action against the rogue World of Warcraft server with a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71235075/1/blizzard-entertainment-inc-v-turtle-wow/">lawsuit</a> that details how the server's operators have built their business on ongoing intellectual property infringement, profiting from the immense popularity of the popular MMORPG using protected vode and game assets.</p>



<p><em>"In the two decades since WoW first was released, Blizzard has invested an enormous amount of time and money into creating, maintaining, and updating the game,"</em> the legal complaint reads. <em>"But when unscrupulous actors such as Defendants seek to profit from Blizzard’s valuable intellectual property (including protected code and game assets) they undermine Blizzard’s own efforts to deliver classic and community-driven content, devalue the WoW experience, and cause serious harm to Blizzard and the many artists, programmers, game designers, and other creative professionals who have worked (and continue to work) tirelessly to create a unique and enjoyable gaming experience for both new and longtime players."</em></p>



<p>Everything considered, it's unlikely that the operators of the Turtle WoW servers will be able to prevent the complete shutdown of the server, all copies of the data from the project, a full account of the money earned by the project and the relinquishing of the domain to Blizzard as the company is demanding in the lawsuit, leaving players with no other choice but to play World of Warcraft classic to enjoy the vanilla WoW experience, although without the custom content the Turtle WoW server offered. The server operators, however, don't want to go down without a fight and have promised on the server's official Discord that Turtle WoW is here to stay and that they are prepared to take on the challenges ahead of them.</p>



<p>Speaking about the modern World of Warcraft experience, the long-running MMORPG will be expanded next year with the Midnight expansion. You can learn more about it in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/">interview</a> conducted during last month's Gamescom.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Approximately 40 minutes of Star Wars Outlaws gameplay, running on the Nintendo Switch 2, has leaked online.</p>



<p>The gameplay was uploaded by the YouTuber mataleao, who has managed to get the game early on the Switch 2 ahead of its September 4, 2025, release date. You can watch the gameplay below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws Switch 2 Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhNIf6ZWTwQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As pointed out by some users in the YouTube comments, the gameplay appears surprisingly good, with some users noting that it even looks and seems to run better than Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>“This runs amazing. It’s not 60fps and 1080p but it looks really smooth. The people complaining are just holding these ports to extremely high standards” says YouTube user Selfbaptized. “Looks way better than I anticipated,” says another user.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-star-wars-outlaws-on-switch-2-run-poorly">Does Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 Run Poorly?</h2>



<p>According to some media outlets, though, who were given the opportunity to play the game on the Switch 2 at PAX West 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-reportedly-performed-poorly-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws didn’t have great performance</a>. According to those in attendance, the game’s framerate dropped below 30 FPS on multiple occasions.</p>



<p>Media outlets were apparently not allowed to record gameplay, with those getting hands-on saying that the game was “king of rough”. </p>



<p>Whether the game runs well or not remains to be seen, but the 40 minutes of Star Wars Outlaws gameplay uploaded to YouTube do look like it runs rather well.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cancelled-star-wars-outlaws-sequel-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws sequel</a>, which Insider Gaming understands was in the very early stages of development, was canceled due to the game not meeting internal expectations. </p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws is set to launch on the Nintendo Switch 2 on September 4, 2025. Will you be giving it a play? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<p>Nintendo and Lego are back with yet another enticing collaboration; this time presenting a 421-piece replica of the iconic Game Boy.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>1st October 2025</strong> at <strong>£54.99 / $59.99</strong>, the new set will come with the Game Boy itself, two cartridges for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a>, and lenticular 'screens' that make it look like you're actually playing a game. Pretty cool!</p>
<p>Now, thanks to Lego reviewer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoCatarino/videos">Tiago Catarino</a> over on YouTube, we've got our best look yet at the upcoming set. The 9-minute review provides a solid overview of the components, noting how the size of the console and cartridges is remarkably close to the real deal.</p>
<p>We also get a glimpse at how the lenticular sleeves are inserted into the main device, along with a demonstration of how the face buttons and d-pad work – yes, you can press them. We reckon it's only a matter of time until someone mods this thing to play real Game Boy games.</p>
<p>Nintendo and Lego really knocked it out of the park with their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/07/nintendo_officially_unveils_the_lego_nes_console_launches_next_month">NES replica set</a>, so we've got high hopes for this one. It's also, dare we say, quite affordable compared to some of the stuff Lego has put out over the years.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-handles-star-wars-outlaws-surprisingly-well-in-docked-mode.1285560/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 seems to handle <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-1-6-rtxdi/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> surprisingly well, delivering a solid experience in docked mode.</p>



<p>Early docked footage of the open-world game released last year on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S surfaced online, providing a good look at how the console handles the game in both its linear and open-world segments. While the footage makes it clear plenty of compromises had to be made to get the game running on the new generation Nintendo console, Star Wars Outlaws seems to keep to its 30 FPS cap, resulting in a decent enough performance in docked mode. No handheld footage was shared, however, so it remains to be seen if the system will be able to deliver a decent experience on the go.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws Switch 2 Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhNIf6ZWTwQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In its launch window, the Nintendo Switch 2 is set to receive plenty of third-party ports, and some of them, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077 port</a>, have shown the level of image quality and performance the system can achieve with proper optimization. In the coming months, the next-generation system by Nintendo will receive a few other ports, and some of them are seemingly set to be at the opposite ends of the spectrum, in terms of quality. The Final Fantasy VII Remake Nintendo Switch 2 port will likely be among the best ports, achieving a higher level of quality than the original PlayStation 4 version, which is definitely impressive for a handheld system. On the other hand, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition already doesn't seem to be faring well, possibly due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-performance-cpu-limitations/">CPU limitations</a> and the fact that the game's engine will effectively be its first port for the ARM platform.</p>



<p>Though port quality may differ, the Nintendo Switch 2 offers a lot of improvements over its predecessor. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

For context, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valleys-huge-update-16-brings-new-items-pets-and-progression-and-more-players-in-co-op">Stardew Valley update 1.6</a> brought eight player PC co-op, new crops, a lot more NPC dialogue, a mastery system, new pets, and the ability to give those pets hats (which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-putting-hats-on-your-pets-asks-stardew-valley-creator">caused a few problems</a>). 
</p>
<p>"Okay, I revealed this at the concert last night and now the cat's out of the bag, so I will confirm for everyone: There will be a Stardew Valley 1.7 update," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1961864959484412104">wrote on Xitter</a> over the weekend. "No release date, no estimate. But it's happening."

</p><p>Barone is theoretically also working on a brand new game, the more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valley-devs-next-game-haunted-chocolatier-will-be-more-combat-focused">combat-focussed</a> RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, but Stardew Valley keeps luring him back, for there is always something else to fix or introduce, however daft. "It's just so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch," he said in May. "Because Stardew Valley, all the systems, the major systems, are already all done. That's the stuff that's not fun to do. When I make an update, it's like, throw in this, throw in that, let's add green rain. These random ideas I have. Whimsical ideas." 
</p>
<p>In Barone's defence, if I had made the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_PC_games">fourth best-selling premium PC game of all time</a>, I would feel in no great rush to move on from it. I would tinker for years. Well, I mean, I would actually take a lot of holidays. But in between all those trips to Alton Towers and when not playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/micro-machines">Micro Machines</a> in my bedroom-sized caramel fondue, I would do plenty of tinkering. Ah, I imagine George R. R. Martin wishes he could be updating the old GOT novels instead of writing The Winds Of Winter.

            <p>
Everwild's executive producer has a new role at Xbox, following the cancellation of Rare's long-in-development project.
</p>
<p>
Amidst layoffs at Microsoft in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's fantasy adventure Everwild was cancelled</a> and a number of employees at the British studio lost their jobs.
</p>
<p>
Now, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/rare-veteran-lands-new-role-at-xbox-game-studios-after-everwild-cancellation/">VGC</a>, the game's executive producer Louise O'Connor has moved to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> as its chief of staff, following 25 years at Rare.

O'Connor first worked at Rare on Conker's Bad Fur Day for the N64. She later worked at the studio as head of animation and its incubation director, responsible for innovation.
</p>
<p>
Everwild was first revealed in 2019 as the next big project from Rare. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-new-everwild-trailer">surfaced again in 2020 with a trailer</a> (above) featuring gorgeous environments and creatures, but little was seen aftewards until its cancellation.

<p>However, in the words of the developer, "if you enjoyed the teamwork, tension, and replayability of my past games, you'll probably find this one interesting".</p>

<p>Ah, a blockade</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We are mere days away from the Switch 2's next big port, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> gearing up for a hyperspace exit on <strong>4th September</strong>. Ubisoft has been pretty shy with Switch 2 footage so far (bar a sizzle reel appearance in the console's reveal Direct, and another brief look back in July), and if initial impressions are to be believed, there might be a good reason for that.</p>
<p>Outlaws' Switch 2 port has arrived at PAX West, giving all those in attendance the first chance to see how Kay Vess' planet-hopping adventure fares on the new Nintendo hardware. One such person to go hands-on with the game was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5JbnfU0SVs">GVG</a>'s Steve Bowling, who, despite revealing that Ubisoft allowed no direct-feed capture or over-the-shoulder recording during the preview, assembled his thoughts into a YouTube video. Unsurprisingly, it doesn't sound great.</p>
<p>According to Bowling, Outlaws runs "pretty poorly" on Switch 2, with both the game's resolution and framerate taking a hit to account for the scope of the open world and the technology under the hood. What's all the more concerning is that this comes despite the majority of the demo taking place in a relatively enclosed area — the early Imperial ship escape.</p>
<p>Even in these smaller environments, Bowling noted the "unstable, uncapped framerate", which apparently dropped below 30fps at several points during the demo. In a larger dogfight section, Bowling notes that the game simply "didn't look very remarkable", despite the ray-traced lighting and DLSS providing some neat visuals in more intimate moments.</p>
<p>All in all, it sounds like we might be in for a bumpy ride when this one arrives on Switch 2 later this week — heck, we have to assume that the PAX West demo is the finished version of the game with that tight of a turnaround. We'll be able to see it for ourselves soon enough, though we're getting those expectations tempered.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Team Cherry have confirmed release times and price points for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. It'll cost $19.99, €19.99 and ¥2300 at launch on Thursday 4th September, with pricing for other regions such as the UK to follow. As an indication, the above pricepoints equate to around £17, but I wouldn't be surprised if they charged £19.99 for it, purely for the sake of symmetry.
</p>
<p>It's traditional among games journalists to illustrate pricepoints in terms of high street chain cups of coffee. But this is Silksong, a game anticipated as fervently as the ancient Mayans once anticipated the coming of an eclipse, so I will resort to more ornate means of comparison: Silksong will cost you 4200000th as much as a B-52 Stratofortress. It will cost you three-sixteenths of your soul on a rainy Friday, or two-sixteenths if the sun is out. It will cost you considerably less than they could probably charge for it. I'm not saying we should be grateful, mind, but we can breathe a sigh of a relief that this isn't being published by EA, Take-Two or Microsoft.
</p><!--more-->
<p>The game will launch on 7am PT, 10am ET, 3pm BST, and 4pm CEST this Thursday. This means that North American players can take the whole day off so as to rise and shove their gloating faces into Hornet's adventure, very first thing. You won't even have to shower first, you bastards. Seething Brits and Europeans must twiddle their thumbs in apoplexy till mid-afternoon, while the poor, sleepless Japanese seemingly won't get access till 11pm Tokyo time, if I'm converting the timezones correctly.
</p>
<p>James was recently able to actually play Silksong at Gamescom, finding it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-faster-prettier-and-harder-yet-still-feels-like-a-safe-sequel">both enjoyable and familiar</a>. "The upside of playing it safe is that absolutely nothing has compromised what made the first game's action a tactile pleasure: its abnormally fine-tuned controls and pin-sharp audio/visual feedback on hits and jumps," James wrote.
</p><p>We had a bit of a ride with the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>. Back in 2017, John Walker (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-review">recommended that people play Ori and the Blind Forest</a> instead. This caused quite the hullabaloo over the subsequent eight years. My sage and considered verdict in hindsight is that they're both mid and you should play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>. Here's to another eight years!</p>

<p>Star Wars Outlaws is scheduled to release for the Switch 2 on September 4, 2025, and just days ahead of launch, the game’s performance might not be up to standard. </p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws for the Nintendo Switch 2 was announced during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partner Showcase</a> on July 31. Outlaws will be the first Ubisoft game to arrive for the new console. However, a new report reveals that the game’s performance is not the best, even with the release less than a week away.</p>



<h2 id="h-star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-framerate-dropped-several-times-below-30fps">Star Wars Outlaws Switch 2 Framerate Dropped Several Times Below 30FPS</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-version-performance-issues-low-frame-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameRant</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5JbnfU0SVs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GVG</a> was present at PAX West 2025, where they were able to try Star Wars Outlaws for the Switch 2. Their new YouTube video states that Nintendo had all the games from Gamescom 2025 on display at PAX West 2025, with the only exception being Star Wars Outlaws. They were able to test the Star Wars Outlaws at this event, but were not allowed to capture any gameplay footage of the demo version.</p>



<p>GVG was not allowed even to have over-the-shoulder cameras to record footage; the only option was to play it and discuss it. Once, they played Star Wars Outlaws on the Switch 2, and it was evident that the performance was “kind of rough.” The video adds that Star Wars Outlaws runs “pretty poorly on the Switch 2.” </p>



<p>The demo only featured close sequences that included a Star Destroyer and a space fight. No open-world sequences were available, and even in the closed sequences, the framerate dropped below 30fps several times. The video clarifies that there was no way to analyse the drops as no footage was recorded, but the drops felt significant. </p>

            <p>
Lego is set to release a collection of Pokémon-themed sets next year, which will reportedly be among the most expensive to date.
</p>
<p>
The collection was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-announced-coming-2026">officially revealed by Lego in March this year</a>, with an intended release in 2026. Now, in a post on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1n47qnb/pokemon_72153_piece_count_price_source_reddit/">Legoleak reddit page</a>, it's reported the sets will arrive on general sale on 1st March (with a 27th February release for Insiders).
</p>
<p>
What's more, the biggest of the three sets will be 6838 pieces and cost a whopping $649.99. The remaining two sets will be $59.99 for a 587 piece set, and $199.99 for a 2050 piece set.

<p>
It's unknown exactly what these sets will be, but if these prices and piece counts are correct, it suggests this won't be a simple Pikachu minifigure. Perhaps we'll see a single large character design, like the Bowser set? Or a huge gym or town display?
</p>
<p>
For reference, The Mighty Bowser set is £229.99 for 2807 pieces, while the Lord of the Rings Barad-dûr set is £399.99 for 5471 pieces, and the Zelda Great Deku Tree is £259.99 for 2500 pieces.
</p>
<p>
Lego and Nintendo have seen big success with their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-super-mario-kart-sets-will-be-ready-to-race-in-2025">Mario</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">Zelda</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kk-slider-coming-to-new-lego-animal-crossing-sets">Animal Crossing</a> sets. Clearly they're expecting the Pokémon sets to be even more popular.

        <p>According to Dee Keyes, the unofficial Oblivion remake's "become less a passion project and more of a crunch project"</p>

            <p>A long-standing member of unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">Oblivion</a> remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>'s development team has claimed the project is being "rushed out the door", and that its previously stated 2025 release goal is "pointless and unachievable".</p>
<p>These claims were made by modder Dee Keyes in a Twitter post put up over the same weekend that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">Skyrim mod</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-says-release-date-reveals-finally-getting-closer-as-oblivion-remake-mod-shows-off-revamped-intro">showed off its opening fifteen minutes</a> as part of Elder Scrolls modding showcase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CreationModCon/featured">Creation Mod Con</a>. Keyes is currently listed as a world designer on the <a href="https://skyblivion.com/the-team/">team page of Skyblivion's website</a>, having previously served as level design department lead, and has appeared in the likes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV2yDO7V8SQ">this dev diary</a> posted to project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel's YouTube channel in 2021.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Within the last 2-3 years the Skyblivion project has become less a passion project and more of a crunch project," Keyes wrote. "Where we used to explore options and put our heart and soul into an aspect of development, we're now being told left, right, and center that it doesn't need to be anything special or the usual 'no one is gonna notice this' excuse for rushing and laziness. It became harder and harder to talk to [project lead] Rebel about problems the project has or how little the developers are being told about lead decisions." </p>
<p>Keyes goes on to argue that announcing a 2025 release goal for the mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-skyblivion-gets-a-2025-release-window-and-new-trailer">back in 2023</a> was a "massive mistake", claiming that it was driven by YouTuber and Skyblivion implementation lead Heavy Burns not wanting "to make another trailer unless it was a release[sic] date trailer". They go on to allege that Heavy Burns has taken on a much more prominent development role at Rebel's request, having been originally brought in to make trailers and dev diary videos, to the point they argue it "now feels like to all the devs that he's the one in charge". Keyes accuses Heavy Burns of dismissing their input, as well as gaslighting them and accusing them of being difficult to work with.</p><div>

</p></div>
<p>"In the last few months it has been impossible for me or [other] developers to convince Rebelzize that this release date is not possible," Keyes continued. "After a last ditch effort to ask one of the lead devs who was also stressed by the project's mismanagement to voice the concerns, only for them to be ignored and forced to leave too, I felt like my time at Skyblivion had come to an end." They conclude by again accusing Rebel and Heavy Burns of working with the goal of the team's efforts being "rushed out of the door" to meet a "pointless and unachievable release date".</p>
<p>"We weren't asking for extra time to add extra features," Keyes added in a <a href="https://x.com/Keyecomposer/status/1962015089457774602">reply to their initial post</a>. "Just the time to complete the MVP [minimum viable product] but instead it seemed like the MVP became more and more minimum by the day in order to make December."</p>
<p>I've contacted Keyes, Rebel, Heavy Burns, and the Skyblivion team for comment.</p>
<p>A couple of Skyblivion devs have already responded to Keyes' post being shared to the mod's Discord server and Reddit page. "We've made it clear our goal is to release this year; that being said, there is still work we need to finish," wrote Skyblivion communications specialist Evan T. Flatt on the latter platform. "Ultimately, Skyblivion will be released when the team is confident with it—our goal has been to have it ready for release this year.</p><p>"Now, what is 'ready'? That is an ongoing conversation we have been having because the nature of a fan-made passion project is that there has to eventually be a cut-off of adding cool new things. Right now, we all agree Skyblivion isn't ready (otherwise we would release it today). Our aim is that it will be by the end of the year, if we as a team decide that it isn't we will be sure to share that."</p>

<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>"Discussions will be had about the points brought up," Skyblivion navmesh developer Novarleeir <a href="https://discord.com/channels/239801644076892160/239801644076892160/1411834128478896301">added on Discord</a>. "For right now, the goal stands at 2025. At the end of the day, we'd like to provide a fun and entertaining experience for existing and incoming fans of Oblivion/Elder Scrolls."</p>
<p>In light of Keyes' post, an number of Skyblivion fans have posted in both places that they'd have no issue with the modders delaying Skyblivion out of this year and taking extra time, if that's judged by the team to be necessary. Given how important a trouble-free launch will likely be for Skyblivion, following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/id-love-to-explore-more-of-fallout-londons-brilliant-world-but-it-keeps-crashing-every-few-minutes">bug issues</a> fellow massive mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> had on release last year, I'm very much inclined to agree.</p><p>Prior to Skyblivion's Creation Mod Con cameo this weekend just gone, project lead Rebel told RPS regarding the mod's release: "I'd say recent developments made us come closer to a potential date announcement, but we will be able to share more about that at a later date."</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-direct-will-take-place-in-september-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-direct-will-take-place-in-september-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1285515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reliable source has claimed that a Nintendo Direct is scheduled for the second week of September 2025. </p>



<p>The last Nintendo Direct was hosted in July 2025, and it was a partner showcase that featured 25 minutes of announcements from Nintendo’s publishing partners. Since then, SwitchForce has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-of-the-next-nintendo-direct-pick-up-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that another Nintendo Direct showcase is planned for the second week of September, and another insider has just corroborated the information. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-next-nintendo-direct-should-arrive-in-the-second-week-of-september">The Next Nintendo Direct Should Arrive in the Second Week of September</h2>



<p>The corroboration about September’s Nintendo Direct comes from the reliable leaker, NateTheHate, through his latest post on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1962214416339833244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). Nate has stated, “Yes, there is a Nintendo Direct in September.” The insider added that it will be held in the “second week of the month”. And, it would be “in the latter half on or around Sept 11 or 12th.” </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Yes, there is a Nintendo Direct in September. </p><p>When: The second week of the month, in the latter half on or around Sept 11 or 12th.</p></div>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1962214416339833244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In the same thread, a user has also asked whether the Red Dead Redemption 2 Switch 2 port will be announced at this direct. To which Nate responded, stating, “Maybe? Depends if Nintendo was able to court Rockstar.” The insider added that RDR2’s Switch 2 port is “bound regardless of announcement/reveal venue.” </p>



<p>It is hard to tell which games will be at this event, but we have several Switch 2 titles releasing in the October/November period, including Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Kirby Air Riders, Borderlands 4, Little Nightmares III, and more. Regardless, players should take the information about the Switch 2 Direct with a grain of salt as it doesn’t come from an official source. </p>



<p>In other news, Cyberpunk 2077 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sold-more-physical-copies-on-nintendo-switch-2-than-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold more physical copies</a> on the Nintendo Switch 2 than digital. Also, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade will release for the Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-intergrade-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2025</a>.

Games Montreal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the second high-profile exit of the summer, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-woes-continue-as-playstation-executive-jade-raymond-exits-fairgames-developer-after-external-test-sparked-concern]"><u>studio founder Jade Raymond also exiting back in May</u></a>, several weeks after an external playtest reportedly met a lukewarm response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As of this week, I joined WB Games Montreal Inc. as creative director," Drapeau announced in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358635412245868544/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>LinkedIn post</u></a>. "I can't wait to start this wonderful adventure with all the great people here at the studio. I also want to particularly thank Yves Lachance, Logan A. Lesage, and Bryan Theberge for their trust and support throughout the process. Now, let's do this!"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The news follows a rocky time for the game's development, and incorrect industry speculation surrounding its future. Last month, analyst Michael Pachter wrongly claimed the game had been canceled, though was later forced to <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1956792553954771444" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>walk back his statement</u></a> and admit he had "no info on the game at all."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither Haven nor Sony have commented publicly on Drapeau's departure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, the news will hardly restore confidence in PlayStation's embattled live service ambitions. Sony announced plans in February 2022 to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-by-2026"><u>launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026</u></a>, later saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstations-10-live-service-games-will-be-from-different-genres-and-for-different-audiences"><u>the push would bring games of different genres to different audiences</u></a>. It spent big on studio buyouts as part of the drive, bringing in Destiny developer Bungie, the now shuttered Firewalk Studios, and, of course, Haven Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Firewalk, you'll remember, was the studio behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord"><u>Concord</u></a>, one of the biggest disasters in PlayStation history. Just a couple of weeks after it launched to eye-wateringly low player numbers, Sony decided to kill the game entirely and shortly thereafter shut down its development studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Concord flop came after Sony had already canceled Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us multiplayer game. And earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony reportedly canceled two unannounced live-service games</u></a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flip side, Arrowhead’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> has been a breakout hit, and became the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fairgames — stylized as Fairgame$ — is described as "a competitive modern heist game where you team up to break into exotic locations and steal the cargo." The twist is that you not only need to outsmart guards and security systems, but you also need to compete against other teams, too. There's no word yet on when it'll launch.

Xbox recently priced the highly-anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> for $80 — the first of its games to break the typical $70 ceiling — but after a furious backlash, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers">ended up dropping the pre-order price to $70 "in line with current market conditions."</a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all, either. The team also revealed exactly when we'll get to play it, too: 7am PT, 10am ET, 4pm CEST, and 11pm JST. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Cherry finally revealed a release date for the long-awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong at gamescom: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date"><u>September 4, 2025</u></a>. We learned the news via a nearly two-minute new trailer dropped by Team Cherry, which showed a ton of new footage from the game. We see Hornet exploring, loads of new insectoid NPCs, dreary graveyards, swamps, a bustling city, new enemies, new bosses, an Ori-style escape sequence, and more. It'll be available on PC, Switch, Switch 2, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, we learned <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight"><u>the original game</u></a> has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-reaches-15-million-copies-sold"><u>managed to top 15 million copies sold</u></a>, a rare feat indeed for an independent game. And perhaps not coincidentally, Hollow Knight, eight years post-release, has repeatedly hit<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#48h" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> all-time high concurrent player counts on Steam (per SteamDB)</u></a> over the last two weeks, topping 70K just this past weekend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong is currently the most wishlisted game on Steam, but is it actually fun to play? We tried out two levels from the Hollow Knight Silksong demo at gamescom 2025, Moss Grotto and Deep Docks.

                <p>There's something deliciously smug about wielding the best <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/terraria/">Terraria</a> ranged weapons. While melee players are sweating it out in close quarters and mages are chugging mana potions like they're at an all-night rave, you're standing comfortably out of reach, raining down arrows, bullets, or bees with barely a scratch on your armor. It's the class for anyone who enjoys watching health bars melt while staying three steps ahead of the danger.</p><p dir="ltr">That's not to say it's easy. Ranged combat is a balancing act between conserving ammo, picking the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-terraria-accessories-for-melee-ranged-magic-and-summoner/1100-6533074/">best Terraria accessories</a> for your build, and stocking up on enough arrows or bullets to avoid the dreaded "click" of an empty chamber mid-boss fight. But when it all comes together, nothing feels quite as powerful. From simple ore bows to weapons that literally summon storms, the marksman's journey is one of precision, chaos, and plenty of smug grins.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Pre_Hardmode">Pre-Hardmode</a><ul><li><a href="#Platinum_Bow">Platinum Bow</a></li><li><a href="#The_Bee_s_Knees">The Bee's Knees</a></li><li><a href="#Hellwing_Bow">Hellwing Bow</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Hardmode">Hardmode</a><ul><li><a href="#Daedalus_Stormbow">Daedalus Stormbow</a></li><li><a href="#Onyx_Blaster">Onyx Blaster</a></li><li><a href="#Phantasm">Phantasm</a></li><li><a href="#S_D_M_G_">S.D.M.G.</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Pre_Hardmode">Pre-Hardmode</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554261-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-platinum-bow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554261" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554261-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-platinum-bow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554261"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554261-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-platinum-bow.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Platinum_Bow">Platinum Bow</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Damage: 13</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Knockback: 0</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Critical chance: 4%</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speed: 25 (Fast)</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Velocity: 6.6</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ammo: Arrows</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Forget the wooden twig you start with, as the Platinum Bow is your first taste of real power. Made from just eight Platinum Bars, it delivers enough punch to make the Eye of Cthulhu feel more like target practice than a boss fight. It's easy to craft, doesn't ask much of you beyond a bit of mining, and instantly transforms you from hapless survivor into a hunter who means business. Pair it with Flaming Arrows for a fiery upgrade or Jester's Arrows to pierce crowds, and you'll sail through those chaotic early nights.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not flashy, but that's exactly the appeal. Early ranged combat is about consistency, and the Platinum Bow never lets you down. Think of it as your training wheels before Terraria decides to throw a real challenge at you. You'll eventually outgrow it, but for a weapon you can forge on day two, it's absurdly good at keeping you alive and on the front foot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554262-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-the-bees-knees.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554262" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554262-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-the-bees-knees.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554262"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554262-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-the-bees-knees.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="The_Bee_s_Knees">The Bee's Knees</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Damage: 23</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Knockback: 3</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Critical chance: 4%</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speed: 23 (Fast)</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Velocity: 8</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ammo: Arrows</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Every ranged player remembers the first time they loosed an arrow with The Bee's Knees and watched the screen fill with buzzing chaos. Dropped by Queen Bee, this jungle treasure transforms plain old Wooden Arrows into swarms of homing bees that ricochet off walls and sting anything unlucky enough to be nearby. Suddenly, accuracy doesn't matter quite so much because you can just fire in the general direction of trouble and let your insect army handle the rest.</p><p dir="ltr">It's perfect for messy fights. Goblin Army invasion? Bees everywhere. Skeletron's skull and hands? Our friendly Bumbles chew through them like paper. Even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/">Terraria bosses</a> that usually require tight aim feel easier because your insect army simply doesn't miss. It's not the most elegant weapon, but it's certainly one of the most fun, and mid-game Terraria is exactly where a bit of spectacle makes the grind feel worthwhile.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554263-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-hellwing-bow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554263" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554263-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-hellwing-bow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554263"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554263-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-hellwing-bow.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Hellwing_Bow">Hellwing Bow</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Damage: 22</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Knockback: 5.5</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Critical chance: 4%</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speed: 13 (Very Fast)</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Velocity: 6</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ammo: Arrows</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">If you're heading into the Underworld, you'll want something with a bit of bite, and the Hellwing Bow more than delivers. Pulled from Shadow Chests, it transforms Wooden Arrows into fiery bats that pierce through everything in their path without slowing down. Suddenly, those cheap arrows you've been hoarding turn into deadly projectiles capable of hitting multiple enemies at once. When you're staring down the Wall of Flesh, those piercing bats feel like a cheat code.</p><p dir="ltr">It does take a little adjustment. The bats don't fly in perfectly straight lines like arrows, and their arcing paths can throw you off at first. But once you get the hang of it, the Hellwing Bow becomes indispensable. It's the ultimate pre-Hardmode boss killer, equipped with a single-click auto fire, which is usually reserved for Hardmode alternatives.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Hardmode">Hardmode</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554266-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-daedalus-stormbow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554266" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554266-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-daedalus-stormbow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554266"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554266-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-daedalus-stormbow.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Daedalus_Stormbow">Daedalus Stormbow</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Damage: 38</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Knockback: 2.25</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Critical chance: 4%</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speed: 19 (Very Fast)</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Velocity: 12.5</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ammo: Arrows</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">If there's one weapon that makes you feel like you've broken Terraria, it's the Daedalus Stormbow. Dropped by Hallowed Mimics, this unassuming bow calls down arrow rain from the heavens. Pair it with Holy Arrows, and suddenly you're orchestrating meteor showers of destruction. The Destroyer barely stands a chance as its segments are pummeled from above, each shot multiplying into falling stars. It's chaos, but the good kind.</p><p dir="ltr">What makes the Stormbow so beloved is that it rewards creativity. Build a flat arena, give the sky some clearance, and watch bosses dissolve under the deluge. Even with simpler arrows, it's wildly strong and feels almost unfair for early Hardmode.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554268-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-onyx-blaster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554268" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554268-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-onyx-blaster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554268"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554268-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-onyx-blaster.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Onyx_Blaster">Onyx Blaster</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Damage: 24</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Knockback: 6.5</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Critical chance: 4%</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speed: 48 (Extremely Slow)</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Velocity: 14</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ammo: Bullets</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Don't be fooled by the damage drop-off on paper; the Onyx Blaster steps up as your mid-Hardmode workhorse. An upgrade to the Shotgun with two Dark Shards and 10 Souls of Night, this beast spits out a spread of bullets and follows it up with a dark explosive blast for good measure. Crafted with Souls of Night and Dark Shards, it's one of those weapons that feels purpose-built for mowing down anything in your path.</p><p dir="ltr">The best thing about the Onyx Blaster is how adaptable it is. Load it with Ichor Bullets to shred boss defenses or Crystal Bullets to split each shot into even more damage. The additional explosive dark projectile guarantees impact even if your spread misses, which makes it forgiving in hectic battles. It's the kind of mid-game weapon you'll hold onto long after you technically have upgrades, simply because it's that satisfying to use.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554269-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-phantasm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554269" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554269-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-phantasm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554269"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554269-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-phantasm.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Phantasm">Phantasm</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Damage: 50</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Knockback: 2</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Critical chance: 4%</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speed: 12 (Very Fast)</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Velocity: 20</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ammo: Arrows</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Bonus: 66% chance to save ammo</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Near the top of the ranged food chain sits the Phantasm, a bow that spits arrows out in torrents. Crafted from 18 Vortex Fragments in an Ancient Manipulator, it launches rapid volleys, each shot spawning bonus homing arrows for free. The effect is overwhelming. Your screen fills with arrows, bosses evaporate under constant pressure, and suddenly you feel less like an archer and more like a living artillery cannon.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it's hungry. You have a small chance each shot to save ammo, but the Phantasm otherwise eats arrows faster than you can craft them. Some may say that's part of the charming challenge. Fortunately, you won't need many to humiliate your enemies, especially with Luminite Arrows in your pocket. This is the ranged endgame fantasy, granting you the smug satisfaction of watching the Moon Lord melt like butter.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554270-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-s-d-m-g.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554270" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554270-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-s-d-m-g.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554270"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554270-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-s-d-m-g.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="S_D_M_G_">S.D.M.G.</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Damage: 85</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Knockback: 2.5</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Critical chance: 14%</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speed: 5 (Extremely Fast)</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Velocity: 12</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ammo: Bullets</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Bonus: 66% chance to save ammo</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Beating the Moon Lord is no small feat, as the Space Dolphin Machine Gun is the perfect endgame gun to give you a pat on the back. Dropped by the big bad final boss, it boasts one of the fastest fire rates in the game and absurd base damage, meaning it can shred health bars before enemies even realize they're under attack. Despite its playful design, it's a powerhouse that turns bullets into a relentless stream of pain.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the S.D.M.G. has one big caveat: ammo. This thing chews through bullets faster than any other weapon, so keeping it fed becomes a logistical challenge. But when paired with high-end rounds like Luminite or Chlorophyte Bullets, the DPS is off the charts, so you shouldn't need to spend too many. It's strong, stylish, hilarious, and deeply satisfying to use.</p><p dir="ltr">Ranged combat is Terraria at its most efficient. Why risk your neck with other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-weapon-types/1100-6533073/">Terraria weapon types</a> when you can fill the air with arrows, bullets, or bees and watch enemies crumble from a safe distance? Sure, you'll burn through ammo and your piggy bank might feel the strain, but few things compare to the feeling of staying untouched while bosses drop like clay pigeons.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether you're orchestrating divine arrow showers or letting a space dolphin unload on the Moon Lord, the marksman's path is one of precision and spectacle. It's chaotic, stylish, and just a little bit cheeky.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A simple class that's also the most reckless, there's a skill curve to the best <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/terraria/">Terraria</a> melee weapons. Instead of hiding behind a staff or bow, you are charging face-first into danger, trading your health bar for glorious damage. It is the class for anyone who loves brute force, big crits, and feeling like a walking blender.</p><p dir="ltr">Getting up close and personal isn't just about swinging blindly. Terraria's melee arsenal is surprisingly diverse, ranging from oversized swords that cleave through entire boss arenas to yoyos, spears, boomerangs, and flails that control space. In true Terraria fashion, melee does not necessarily mean you need to be in the thick of the action. Plenty of the best blades sling projectiles across the screen when you jump from Pre-Hardmode to Hardmode, letting you play safe while keeping that melee identity.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Pre_Hardmode">Pre-Hardmode</a><ul><li><a href="#Terragrim">Terragrim</a></li><li><a href="#Volcano">Volcano</a></li><li><a href="#Sunfury">Sunfury</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Hardmode">Hardmode</a><ul><li><a href="#Terra_Blade">Terra Blade</a></li><li><a href="#Solar_Eruption">Solar Eruption</a></li><li><a href="#Zenith">Zenith</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Pre_Hardmode">Pre-Hardmode</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557928-best-terraria-melee-weapons-terragrim.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557928" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557928-best-terraria-melee-weapons-terragrim.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557928"></a><figcaption>Terragrim swings a small blade in front of the Terraria player's face.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557928-best-terraria-melee-weapons-terragrim.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Terragrim">Terragrim</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 17</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 3</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 25 (Fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Terragrim is the ultimate pre-boss jackpot. Found rarely in Enchanted Sword Shrines, it attacks at a speed so absurd that the modest damage stat barely matters. It is not craftable, it is not guaranteed, and it may never appear in your world, but if you are fortunate enough to stumble across one, it changes everything.</p><p dir="ltr">This blade's rapid swings chew through enemies before they can touch you, and against early <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/">Terraria bosses</a> like Eye of Cthulhu, you'll feel untouchable. Terragrim is not a weapon you plan for; it's a sword that happens to you, but it is the clearest example of the sandbox game rewarding exploration with outrageous power spikes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557929-best-terraria-melee-weapons-volcano.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557929" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557929-best-terraria-melee-weapons-volcano.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557929"></a><figcaption>Terraria player swinging the molten sword engulfed in fire overhead.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557929-best-terraria-melee-weapons-volcano.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Volcano">Volcano</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 40</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 6.5</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 40 (Very Slow)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Forged from Hellstone mined in the Underworld, the Volcano, otherwise known as the Fiery Greatsword on handheld platforms, is your midgame bruiser. It swings slowly but covers a huge arc, letting you tag multiple enemies at once while also applying the On Fire debuff for steady damage over time. Few pre-Hardmode swords feel as hefty in hand, and the extra reach gives you confidence against mobs that like to close space quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">More than just a strong weapon, Volcano is also a crucial ingredient in Night's Edge, itself the definitive pre-Hardmode sword. Even if you do not lean on it long term, crafting one is a natural step in melee progression. Think of it as a stepping stone and a statement that you are ready for Terraria's tougher encounters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557931-best-terraria-melee-weapons-sunfury.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557931" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557931-best-terraria-melee-weapons-sunfury.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557931"></a><figcaption>Sunfury flings a flaming mace forward toward a Slime.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557931-best-terraria-melee-weapons-sunfury.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Sunfury">Sunfury</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 64</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 6.75</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 11%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 45 (Very Slow)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Sunfury is the most damaging melee weapon you can grab in Pre-Hardmode, full stop. Found in Shadow Chests or fished up from Obsidian Lock Boxes, this fiery flail swings through walls, pierces multiple enemies, and inflicts the On Fire debuff in addition to its initial smack. It makes quick work of events and bosses alike, letting you hold your ground instead of constantly dodging.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the Volcano, Sunfury also keeps you at a safer distance. The extended flail chain allows you to swap out tankiness for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-terraria-accessories-for-melee-ranged-magic-and-summoner/1100-6533074/">best Terraria accessories</a> that boost damage, since you will not always be face-to-face with enemies. It is the definition of dominance before Hardmode, making the Wall of Flesh fight far less intimidating.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Hardmode">Hardmode</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557932-best-terraria-melee-weapons-terra-blade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557932" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557932-best-terraria-melee-weapons-terra-blade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557932"></a><figcaption>Terra Blade sends a green shockwave belting forward.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557932-best-terraria-melee-weapons-terra-blade.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Terra_Blade">Terra Blade</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 85</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 6.5</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 18 (Very Fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Terra Blade turns melee into safe pressure. Forged from True Excalibur, True Night's Edge, and the Broken Hero Sword, it fires a green wave on every swing, giving you full melee scaling while landing hits at range. The handling is crisp, the DPS is reliable, and it feels heroic from the first craft.</p><p dir="ltr">Use it to tidy post-Plantera progression, to farm Eclipse drops, and to steamroll events while you build toward endgame fragments. It is the Swiss Army Knife of melee weapons, blending crowd control with boss focus without asking for fancy setups, and just one of many ingredients for the best sword in the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557933-best-terraria-melee-weapons-solar-eruption.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557933" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557933-best-terraria-melee-weapons-solar-eruption.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557933"></a><figcaption>Solar Eruption ignores walls, bursting through the Jungle biome.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557933-best-terraria-melee-weapons-solar-eruption.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Solar_Eruption">Solar Eruption</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 105</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 6.75</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 20 (Very Fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Solar Eruption is a pillar craft that bends the rules in your favour. The flaming chain pierces, lingers, and hits through walls while applying the Daybroken debuff for even heavier damage over time than On Fire. Reach, safety, and uptime combine into a tool that trivializes many late fights.</p><p dir="ltr">Thread it through blocks to shred crowds and tag bosses from apparent safety. It is outstanding for events and pillar clearing, where cover and density would normally slow you down. Few melee picks match its blend of control and sustained damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557934-best-terraria-melee-weapons-zenith.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557934" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557934-best-terraria-melee-weapons-zenith.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557934"></a><figcaption>Terraria's Zenith swings multiple swords at range.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557934-best-terraria-melee-weapons-zenith.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Zenith">Zenith</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 190</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 6.5</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 14%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 30 (Average)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Existing between satisfying and showboating, Zenith is the victory lap. Crafted from a collection of ten iconic blades, including Terra Blade, Starfury, Seedler, Meowmere, Star Wraty, Influx Waver, The Horseman's Blade, Bee Keeper, Enchanted Sword, and the humble Copper Shortsword, it summons a storm of swords that chews through anything on screen. The performance is outrageous, and the animation feels like a reward for the entire journey.</p><p dir="ltr">Use it to close out moons, events, and farming with total authority. Zenith is deliberate excess, which is exactly the point. If you have assembled the lineage, you have earned the strongest toy in the sandbox.</p><p dir="ltr">Melee in Terraria is a journey from crude but satisfying swings to screen-filling spectacles. Pre-Hardmode gives you a taste of variety with blades that drop stars, flails that scatter mobs, and Night's Edge as the badge of progress. By Hardmode, your kit transforms into legendary blades and celestial crafts that let you fight from safety without ever losing the melee identity.</p><p dir="ltr">The appeal is simple. Compared to all other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-weapon-types/1100-6533073/">Terraria weapon types</a>, you are always in the thick of it, standing toe to toe with bosses rather than hanging back. Every upgrade feels like a tangible power spike, and the final reward in Zenith is a pure celebration of everything you have built. If you enjoy high stakes, close calls, and the satisfaction of carving through enemies with your own two hands, melee is the class that never stops giving.</p>
