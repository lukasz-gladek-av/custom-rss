		<p>Square Enix has announced that it is releasing Triangle Strategy as a VR title, and it will be released on Meta Quest 2 and 3. You will not have to wait too long to get your hands on Triangle Strategy in VR, as it will be launching on October 31st.

<p>In a description for the VR version of Triangle Strategy, Square Enix has said, <em>“You’ll get a better view of the battlefield with 360-degree movement that lets you see the conflict how you want. Controlling characters is a snap and incredibly immersive thanks to intuitive VR controls that let you place characters, take actions and define battle strategies with ease.Yes, the fate of Serenoa and his allies is now in your hands (well, in a pair of controllers technically, but you take our point).The game also supports Meta Quest’s Passthrough feature on Meta Quest 3 which lets you mesh the game’s environments with real-world surroundings. It’s fun, engaging and… well, just really cool.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/triangle-strategy/5340130476095884/">Pre-orders for Triangle Strategy</a> on Meta Quest 2 and 3 are live now, with the full price being £22.99. However, there is a pre-order discount of 13% which knocks the price down to £19.99 until it releases.</p>

<p>In our Triangle Strategy review, Dom said, <em>“Triangle Strategy is a beautiful and authentic tactical RPG. Fans of Fire Emblem in particular will love the involving narrative on top of the strategic action – just be prepared for a slow start as it sets its expansive story in motion.”</em></p>

<p>HBO is currently working on bringing the second season of The Last of Us to life, but there are still a few months before it’s ready to air. In recent weeks, we’ve seen set photos leak from inside the production, revealing costumes, locations, story points, and some of the newly casted actors in roles pulled straight from The Last of Us Part II (2020). </p>



<p>Recently, Neil Druckmann, the series’ creator and head at Naughty Dog, sat down with Variety to talk about the expectations for the second season of the award-winning live-action adaptation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-diving-deeper">Diving Deeper</h2>



<p>One thing that the first season did so well was setting up a little more meat on the bones in terms of backstories for the characters, both lead <strong>and </strong>supporting. There was an entire episode dedicated to the origin story of Bill and Frank, relatively understated characters in the game but the source of an intense and deeply emotional sub-story in the television series.</p>



<p>It was that episode that pulled in one of The Last of Us’ Emmy Awards.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/last-of-us-season-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-strictly-business-1236155347/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">speaking recently to Variety</a>, Druckmann suggested that the concept of diving into important backstories will surface again in the second season:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>And there’s stuff in this season that I’m really excited about — stuff that we hinted at — one scene in particular comes to mind that I think fans of the game will eat up, because it really kind of tells you a lot of backstory of this important character that there wasn’t really a way for us to even do that in the game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That could be any number of characters. The Last of Us Part II is diverse, lengthy, and brings together a wild cast of characters in a story that unravels over many hours. Many have suggested that it could be an exploration of ‘Lev’, a runaway ‘Seraphite’ in the game who forms a tight bond with Abby, one of the game’s antagonists.</p>



<p>Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin have been true to the source material of The Last of Us while at the same time pushing their creative license into new ways to portray the universe that was uncovered when the franchise began way back in 2013. There are very few faults with the first season, and the hype for the second remains consistent and high – I’m expecting great things.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Meta Quest 3S Finally Announced, Launches October 15]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/meta-quest-3s-revealed-vr/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meta-quest-3s-finally-announced-launches-october-15.992202/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/meta-quest-3s-revealed-vr/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Mark ‘The Zuck’ Zuckerberg has taken to the stage at Meta Connect, and one of the first items on his agenda was the official reveal of the Meta Quest 3S. This all-new virtual reality headset represents a more accessible entry point into the world of VR gaming and applications. It’s hitting the market on October 15, and given the specification and price point, it could be one of the best options for anyone picking up their first VR headset.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-bit-of-this-a-bit-of-that">A Bit of This, a Bit of That</h2>



<p>The Meta Quest 3S VR headset is a bit of a mix-and-match device that incorporates elements of the Meta Quest 2 <strong>and </strong>the Meta Quest 3. It features slightly older lenses that might not offer as solid a viewing experience, but it has the same chipset as the Meta Quest 3, which means there’s parity in terms of what it can play, display, and operate.</p>



<p>However, if we put the ‘older’ technology to the side for a second, we’re presented with a VR headset that sits at a very attractive price point. It was confirmed that a 128 GB version of the headset will be released in October for just $300, while the 256 GB version will run with a $400 price tag.</p>



<p>It’ll feature full-colour passthrough technology and a battery life that’s more or less comparable with the Quest 3, it just won’t offer as solid an experience from a viewing perspective, but that’s only because of the less sophisticated lenses.</p>



<p>It also uses the same controllers as the Meta Quest 3, which are easy to get to grips with an very responsive.</p>



<p>If you’ve been hurting for a relatively affordable VR experience, you can’t go wrong with a Meta Quest headset, and now that the 3S is on the horizon, you can get involved for even less. I picked up a Meta Quest 3 a few weeks ago after experiencing the terrifying wonder of Metro Awakening at Gamescom, and I can confirm that it’s the most immersive way to play games that you’ll ever witness.</p>



<p>At least, until we’re plugging ourselves into devices –  but that’s at least a few years away yet.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's financial disclosures this week don't have a lot of good news for investors, especially since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">Star Wars Outlaws</a> debuted to disappointing sales and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">Assassin's Creed Shadows has been delayed</a> to 2025. However, the company did offer an encouraging update about its relationship with Steam. Ubisoft has reversed its previous stance and will now release both Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin's Creed Shadows on Steam, along with other day-one releases.</p><p>In 2019, Ubisoft executive Chris Early explained why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-business-model-is-unrealistic-ubisoft-execu/1100-6469434/" data-ref-id="1100-6469434">the company had pulled back from Steam</a> and shared his thoughts on its business model. "It's unrealistic, the current business model they have," said Early. "It doesn't reflect where the world is today in terms of game distribution."</p><p>Instead of releasing games through Steam, Ubisoft dropped titles through its own online store and via the Epic Games Store. It was widely assumed that Ubisoft continued to support Epic because it takes a smaller percentage of game sales than Steam does. Ubisoft's decision to rethink its relationship with Steam may mean that the company believes it can increase its sales by utilizing that store's wider reach.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws will hit Steam on November 21, while Assassin's Creed Shadow will be released on Steam simultaneously with its debut on consoles on February 14, 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-of-providence-sets-bigmode-up-for-another-success.992187/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/star-of-providence-sets-bigmode-up-for-another-success<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New publisher <a href="https://bigmode.com/">Bigmode</a>, owned by the YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/videogamedunkey">videogamedunkey</a>, knocked it out of the park with the company's first title, <em>Animal Well</em>. This indie developed by Billy Basso exceeded expectations from press, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/animal-well-review-icebergs-worth-of-puzzles-deep-below-surface">TechRaptor included</a>. With such an outstanding reception, many are excited to see what comes next for Bigmode, and that game is <em>Star of Providence</em>.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: <em>Star of Providence</em> is already out. It's been out since 2017, and you can buy it on Steam right now. While not unheard of for games to get a new publisher after release, Bigmode's decision to publish this title seemed like a confusing one.</p>
<p>After playing a demo for <em>Star of Providence</em> at PAX West 2024, I wanted to get to the bottom of things.</p>

<h2>What's Bigmode's Role in <em>Star of Providence</em>?</h2>
<p>As it turns out, <em>Star of Providence</em> is insanely fun. How did I miss <em>Star of Providence </em>after so long? Well, the thing to keep in mind is that <em>Star of Providence</em> once went by the title <em>Monolith</em>, which might be one source of confusion. Leah Gastrow of Bigmode was able to provide more context to the publishing decision.</p>
<p>"<em>Star of Providence</em> is a game that, despite its initial Steam release in 2017 and having a dedicated and loving fanbase, we would consider a largely hidden gem," said Gastrow. "Our goals partnering with Team D-13 are broadly - supporting a Switch console launch, localizing to many new languages, funding as the team finishes work on a major content update they have had in the works for a couple of years, and bringing more eyes to the project. We really hope that we’ll be able to translate what’s so special and fun about the game, giving it its day in the sun!"</p>

<p>Bigmode's decision to publisher <em>Star of Providence</em> is a good lesson on the role of publishers in the industry; as Gastrow mentioned, Bigmode brings support in porting the game as well as bringing in a large update for both PC and the Switch version. Having the publisher attached should also create a new fervor for the title.</p>
<p>"It’s come a long way since then and been polished into a real masterwork," said Gastrow. "Some standouts you’ll notice are the buttery smooth controls paired with heart-pounding action and epic, vast soundtrack from Garoslaw. Members of the dev team have also worked with Toby Fox contributing to <em>Deltarune</em>, and all were testers of the game <em>Void Stranger</em>, a sokoban-style puzzle game released in 2023. Basically, they’re the real deal making a real-deal game that we want to do our best to shine a spotlight on and help achieve the success it deserves."</p>

<h2>But is it Fun? Yes, <em>Star of Providence </em>is Very Fun</h2>
<p>Based on my time with the demo from PAX West, <em>Star of Providence</em> is most definitely a special game. I went so far as to buy it on PC to do some <em>brief </em>research on this very article, and found myself addicted to its core gameplay loop. I see what Bigmode sees -- <em>Star of Providence</em> is another hit for the publisher.</p>
<p>To be concise, <em>Star of Providence</em> is a retro-inspired dungeon crawler with SHMUP and roguelite elements. The synthesis between these genres creates a harmonious gameplay loop, one that seems perfect for the portable nature of the Switch.</p>

<p>You pilot this little starship, exploring dungeons room-by-room a la the original <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. With randomized elements, obstacles and enemy placement vary as you progress and get progressively harder as you navigate different floors of the dungeon. No, it's not an unheard of concept, but the way it's executed is what makes <em>Star of Providence</em> so addicting.</p>
<p>Rooms take seconds to clear, so combat is extremely fast. You're constantly awarded with new treasures in the form of weapons, health, and ammo and even stronger upgrades as you progress, making it addicting.</p>
<p>Dying isn't the end since the metaprogression of <em>Star of Providence</em> assures players will have new weapons and other upgrades to play with in subsequent runs. Perhaps the strongest element of <em>Star of Providence</em> are its weapons, with various keywords that change the characteristics of your projectiles.</p>

<p>RNG can grant you this godkilling weapon that homes in on enemies and blasts them constantly with a stream of ridiculous damage, or a not-so-great weapon that's slow and takes time to charge. When you get that big weapon and plow through the rest of your run, that's where <em>Star of Providence</em> shines.</p>
<p>If there was any worry that Bigmode would have a sophomore slump with its next game, well, <em>Star of Providence</em> assuages any fears. Though it's already out, the big content update and launch on the Switch should be the best time to dive into what is possibly your next gaming addiction -- I already know it has <em>me </em>hooked.</p>

<p>It has been revealed that Microsoft intends to shut down the Xbox Game Pass mobile application in November, instead utilising a single application – the Xbox app – to house everything under one roof. Presently, you’ll likely have installed both Xbox Game Pass and the Xbox app on your mobile device – but within a few weeks, the former application will be sunsetted.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-in-one">All In One</h2>



<p>From November, there will be just <strong>one </strong>Xbox application on mobile devices, with Microsoft opting to scrap the Game Pass app. That means that everything from interacting with friends and downloading screenshots to remotely installing content on an Xbox console will be done through the new app. It’ll be a one-stop shop for all things Xbox-related, and that includes unlocking perks and other rewards.</p>



<p>In a blog post penned by Microsoft, it was confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>These updates will be available for Xbox beta members on mobile and will be coming to everyone soon. As part of these changes, we will no longer support new downloads of the Xbox Game Pass app, starting in November.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It still won’t be possible to stream games via the cloud to your mobile device using the application, but you can still use a mobile <strong>browser </strong>to accomplish that. It’s an awkward workaround, but it’s the best you’ve got until the dust settles around debates regarding cloud streaming.</p>



<p>It’s a small change that isn’t likely to move mountains, but it’s something of a quality-of-life improvement, and that’s just fine with me.</p>

<p>After what Ubisoft says was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-underperformed-ubisoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an underperforming launch</a>, the developers of Star Wars Outlaws have taken <a href="https://x.com/StarWarsOutlaws/status/1838971704820801966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to social media</a> to promise players continued improvements on the game.</p>



<p>In their post, the developers started off by thanking players for the support of the game since its launch. They went on to say that the team is “hard at work” on new updates to the game that will bring a number of fixes, features, and improvements.</p>







<p>“We’re hard at work creating multiple title updates, which will bring optimization, gameplay polishing and tweaks as well as quality of life changes including adjustments to combat and stealth gameplay,” the statement reads.</p>



<p>In addition to the promises of improvement, it was confirmed that the game’s first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card, will launch on November 21. That date coincides with the game’s release on Steam.</p>



<p>“[Wild Card] will see Kay and Nix infiltrate a high-stakes Sabacc tournament where they will face off against the legendary Lando Calrissian,” they said. “In addition, new contracts will be added free for all players.”</p>



<p>What do you think of the promises of improvement to Star Wars Outlaws by the developers? Do you think it’s too late for the game to turn things around?

                <p>Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom's release is tomorrow, where players can play as the titular character for the first time in the main series. Here, Zelda finds herself on a quest to save Link and the kingdom of Hyrule. Aiding her is the fairy Tri, who entrusts the princess with the magical Tri Rod that gives Zelda new powers for puzzle-solving and defeating enemies. The visual style is similar to that of the 2019 remake of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.</p><p>Available exclusively on the Nintendo Switch, Echoes of Wisdom takes players not only to Hyrule this time around but also the all-new Still World, which is connected to Hyrule through rifts that lead to a different section of it. It's a place where people, places, and objects are frozen in time. Much like many entries in the Zelda franchise, there are dungeons, each with a boss that must be defeated to progress the story. Many familiar faces of Hyrule lore appear throughout the game, including the Deku Scrubs, Gerudo, Gorons, and river and ocean Zora.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1556933038" data-promo-id="0"

            <p>
After a succession of leaks, Meta has officially unveiled its lower-priced Meta Quest 3S headset line-up, which launches on 15th October.
</p>
<p>
Meta Quest 3S starts at £289.99/$299.99 USD with 128GB of storage, but there's also a 256GB option priced at £379.99/$399.99. To put that into context, the 128GB Meta Quest 2 weighs in at around $199.99, and the 128GB Quest 3 now costs $429.99. However, Meta has confirmed it's phasing out Quest 2, the Quest Pro, and the 128GB version of Quest 3 - leaving just the 512GB Quest 3 (now slashed by $150 to $499.99) as an alternative.
</p>
<p>
As for specs, the Meta Quest 3S' innards are similar to those of the Meta Quest 3, and the inclusion of the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset means it'll be able to play previously Quest 3-exclusive games. The major differences, however - beyond a slightly larger form factor and no depth sensor - are a narrower field of view and a reduction in display resolution - with the 3S coming it in at 1832 x 1920 per eye, compared to the Meta Quest 3's 2064 x 2208.

<p>
At £290, though, the Meta Quest 3S still sounds like a strong proposition for the VR curious, particularly as it's bundled with the Quest 3's slick Touch Plus controllers, three months of Meta Quest+, and a copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-shadow">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a>. Eurogamer's Tom Phillips was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-shadow-might-be-vr-but-its-the-first-dc-game-since-arkham-knight-im-actually-excited-for">impressed by this new canonical VR instalment</a> of Rocksteady's acclaimed Arkham series when he played it earlier this year, and Meta clearly thinks it's winner too - it's also being bundled with all new Meta Quest 3 purchases made between now and 30th April next year.
</p>
<p>
Meta Quest 3S launches on 16th October, and <a href="https://www.meta.com/gb/quest/quest-3s/">pre-orders</a> open today.

		<p>Grizzly Games has confirmed that its minimalist strategy game Thronefall will be leaving Early Access on October 11th, and that it will be released on Nintendo Switch the same day. The full release of Thronefall includes new levels, taking the total to 10, new hero units balanced by new enemies, weapons, and perks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Thronefall Full Release (Trailer) - OUT NOW!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-3EK6fbkAH4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We’re so grateful for the attention&nbsp;Thronefall&nbsp;has gotten since we launched into Steam Access. The reception has been far beyond anything we had imagined,”</em> says Jonas Tyroller. <em>“With the most recent editions and the Nintendo Switch launch, we hope there’s something in it for everyone to enjoy and brings the game to more people; from the kid who’s playing their very first strategy game to the veteran who simply doesn’t have time to sink hundreds of hours into learning how to play something new..”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/03/thronefall-review/">Thronefall Review</a></h2>
<p>Since its Early Access launch, Thronefall has sold nearly a million copies, been wishlisted over 550,000 times, and received a lot of positive reviews. I played the early access release of Thronefall last year, and in my early access review, I said, <em>“Thronefall may be a minimalist strategy title, but it is big in heart and has a lot of depth to it. It is a game that is simple to play, but will challenge you at every turn. It is incredibly tough to put Thronefall down as it has that one more turn feel down to a tee. The challenge will be offputting for some, and there is a possible bug of enemies running around a wall, but other than that Thronefall is worth your time.”</em></p>

<p>In our Metaphor: ReFantazio preview, Dom said, <em>“A mouthful in all senses, Metaphor: ReFantazio, an original IP from Studio Zero – a team made up of Persona veterans – continues to stretch the word soup of game names to its limit. But what does it mean? Well, just like part of its namesake, it’s an idea, a comparison, and an image that is designed to take your mind to unexpected places. This becomes even more clear when you actually play it, with Metaphor: ReFantazio drawing on the grotesque and off-kilter ideas of the Persona franchise and spinning them out into an all-new RPG experience…Our hands on gave us a massive taste of the world that Studio Zero are building, and it looks utterly fantastic across the board. Persona fans, or those seeking this year’s freshest RPG experience, should be salivating at the prospect.”</em></p>

<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio will be releasing October 11th for PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

The AssCreed faithful have waited a thousand years for a sequel set in feudal Japan, birthplace of ninjas and samurai. Woe unto ye dreamers of Ubisoft takes on Tenchu, for you must carry that candle for a little longer. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has been delayed till next year. It was due to launch on 12th November 2024 - now, it will release on 14th February 2025.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The news comes in the shape of <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/25/2953181/0/en/Ubisoft-updates-its-financial-targets-for-FY2024-25.html">an updating of Ubisoft's targets</a> for the financial year 2024-2025, primarily in response to the "softer than expected launch for Star Wars Outlaws". According to Uncle Ubi, Assassin's Creed Shadows is "feature complete", but needs more time in the oven to avoid a similarly dismal showing.
</p>
<p>
"While the game is feature complete, the learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title," the statement reads. "This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition, notably by fulfilling the promise of our dual protagonist adventure, with Naoe and Yasuke bringing two very different gameplay styles."
</p>
<p>
In news that will delight the ears of people who think live service expansion roadmaps are the Devil's downloadables, Ubisoft are also "departing from the traditional Season Pass model", though players who preorder the game will be granted the first expansion for free. Shadows will also now "mark the return of our new releases on Steam Day 1" - it'll launch there rather than being exclusive at first on Ubisoft's own storefront. Makes sense - I'm pretty sure Steam has a larger audience than Ubisoft's own store, given that I'd forgotten they had one.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft haven't washed their hands of Outlaws just yet. They're going to update it extensively ahead of the Steam launch on 21st November. "In response to player feedback, Ubisoft's development teams are currently fully mobilized to swiftly implement a series of updates to polish and improve the player experience in order to engage a large audience during the holiday season to position Star Wars Outlaws as a strong long-term performer," reads the statement. The phrasing here puts me slightly in mind of British generals promising that WW1 will be over by Christmas, but I'm probably being unkind - I hear that Outlaws is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-review">quite good</a>, for a star war.
</p>
<p>
The principal audience for these statements are the investors, of course, from whom Ubisoft have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ubisoft-investor-wants-to-dethrone-ubisofts-founders-so-ubisoft-can-lay-more-developers-off">getting it in the neck</a> lately over their slumping share price and lower-than-hoped returns on blockbuster games. In some accompanying exec commentary, CEO Yves Guillemot acknowledges that "our second quarter performance fell short of our expectations" while promising a greater focus on "player-centric, gameplay-first approach and an unwavering commitment to the long-term value of our brands". He adds that "Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences" are Ubisoft's bread and butter. 
</p>
<p>
He also makes brief reference to the on-going, ermmm, discussion about the representational politics of Ubisoft's games. In case you missed it, Outlaw's choice of a female lead who doesn't look like an AI-hallucinated Jessica Rabbit has earned it the ire of certain internet misogynists, while Shadows is getting similarly dumped on by racists for having a Black samurai protagonist (if you dislike what you've seen of either game, please don't get mad at me in the comments - there are other reasons to dislike these games!). In keeping with time-honoured company exec practice, Guillemot deals with this by lifting his eyes to the skyline and benevolently refusing to agree with anybody at all.
</p>
<p>
"Finally, let me address some of the polarized comments around Ubisoft lately," he writes. "I want to reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda. We remain committed to creating games for fans and players that everyone can enjoy."
</p>
<p>
I saw Assassin's Creed Shadows up close at Summer Games Fest, and it seemed fine as Assassin's Creeds go, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-actually-two-games-competing-for-your-affections">an unusually hearty ratio of stealth and melee</a>. But I can definitely wait till 2025. Delaying an open world blockbusters these days is like postponing a solar eclipse, granting smaller games with no established brand presence a chance to bask in the heat a little. Enjoy the breathing room, uhhhh [checks calendar] <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slitterhead">Slitterhead</a>!

<p>Ubisoft had quite a few announcements today regarding Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Not only were fans informed that the upcoming RPG will be delayed until February 2025 (three months), but the company also released that they will be departing from the traditional Season Pass model.</p>



<p>So, what does this mean exactly?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-to-depart-with-traditional-season-pass-model">Assassin’s Creed to Depart with Traditional Season Pass Model</h2>



<p>In a recent announcement, Ubisoft announced that the new Assassin’s Creed Shadows will depart from the traditional Season Pass model. </p>



<p>Originally, the Season Pass was set to allow gamers who purchased it to play a bonus quest available at launch and then have access to two later expansions. While the Season Pass will still be there, fans who purchase the game on launch will be able to enjoy it in its entirety, regardless of whether they have the Season Pass or not.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The company also announced that those who preorder the game will have access to the first expansion once released, regardless if they have the Season Pass. The game will also mark the return of Ubisoft’s new releases on Steam Day 1.</p>



<p>As of now, however, this is all the information released about what Ubisoft means when saying they will be departing from the traditional Season Pass model. More could be announced as time goes on.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-will-the-game-be-released">When Will the Game be Released?</h2>



<p>So, when does Assassin’s Creed Shadows actually release? Well, with the new pushback, the game has been delayed to February 14, 2025. The game was set to originally release this November, meaning it is being delayed an entire three months.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this delay allows Ubisoft to polish the game and release one of the best Assassin’s Creed games of all time. Only time will tell, though.</p>

What’s now known as Dragon Age: The Veilguard began development in 2015 and in that time, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-past-and-present-of-dragon-age-4-1833913351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reports emerged</u></a> of Dragon Age 4 going the live-service route, with a heavy multiplayer component.</p><p>The eventual confirmation that EA would let <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-25/electronic-arts-pivots-on-dragon-age-game-removes-multiplayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>BioWare go full single-player with Dragon Age 4</u></a>, keeping with the series’ history, led to a major sigh of relief from many fans. And when I got my hands on the game last month for our IGN First coverage (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-exclusive-first-hands-on-preview"><u>read my full preview here</u></a>), I struggled to catch any whiffs of its multiplayer past in the gameplay, so I can only imagine the overhaul that was done behind the scenes.</p><p>But, interestingly, there was one thing that Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s creative director, John Epler, tells me never changed throughout the near-decade of development: “There was never a version of the story of Dragon Age 4 where Solas was not at the center,” he says. Basically, if you were worried that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay"><u>name change from Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</u></a> to The Veilguard would mean we’re not focused on Solas, think again.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Solas, of course, was once the companion to the player character, the Inquisitor, in Dragon Age: Inquisition. A mild-mannered, mysterious apostate, Solas (<strong>Spoiler warning for Dragon Age: Inquisition</strong>) disappeared at the end of the base game, only for a massive reveal at the end of the Trespasser DLC: Solas is actually the elven god known as Fen'harel, or the Dread Wolf, and he has plans to tear down what’s known as The Veil in order to restore the world of the ancient elves. Doing so will destroy the world of Thedas as we know it, essentially making your once-friend (or even romantic interest) the new big bad.</p><p>The “bones” of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Epler explains, were always going to come from where that story was left in Trespasser.</p><p>“When we ended Trespasser, we felt that we were making a promise, a commitment to our fans of, ‘This is the story we're going to tell. This is where we want to go with it,’” Epler says. “There were different versions of the story. There were versions of the story where maybe you didn't necessarily progress as far in your fight against Solas, but Solas has always been at the center of Dragon Age 4’s story.”</p><p>That much was evident in my own time with the game. When The Veilguard picks up, the customizable player character, Rook, has been recruited by Dragon Age series mainstay Varric to help stop Solas’ ritual. After Rook foils Solas’ plan (and accidentally frees two blighted elven gods in the process,<em> whoopsie</em>), the two have a heated confrontation, and it quickly becomes clear that Rook will have their own unique relationship with Solas, as the Inquisitor did before them.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“I think what's been fun for us, too, is trying to build Rook as kind of almost a mirror of Solas."</p></div><p>“Rook does get in Solas' way and now there's a connection between the two of them,” Epler says. “I think what's been fun for us, too, is trying to build Rook as kind of almost a mirror of Solas because that gives us a lot of opportunities to build some interesting interactions and reactions between the two of them.”</p><p>It’ll also give us ample opportunity to learn more about Solas. As has already been revealed in IGN First’s coverage and other previews, players will even get to see some of Solas’ memories firsthand.</p><p>“Solas wasn't always the character he is now. Thousands of years ago, he was a rebel,” Epler says. “He was the kind of person who stood up for the little guy. He still has a tremendous love for spirits who he sees as these beings that are being unfairly treated, unfairly maligned. So Rook became this character that we could explore some aspects of Solas' personality but also give you a protagonist that, because it's a BioWare game, you can shape to a large degree.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/24/da-ign-first-lore-illo-1-1727214231250.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Illustration by Julia Rago for IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>From the Inquisitor to Rook </strong></h2><p>The focus on Solas, the elven gods, and the connections to Dragon Age: Inquisition does bring up an interesting question: how will Dragon Age: The Veilguard ease in new players with its wildly expansive lore? The campaign starts with a surprisingly succinct and effective recap from Varric, but even as a longtime fan, I imagined it might be a lot for players new to the franchise (or even those who’ve forgotten some of the details after all these years).</p><p>It’s one of the advantages of having a relative outsider in Rook to lead the proceedings. Epler clarifies that, at this point, Rook has known Varric and Harding (a Scout from Inquisition who’s now a full-blown companion in The Veilguard) “for a little while.” But otherwise, Rook is something of a blank slate aside from the pre-written backstories that derive from one of six factions you can choose.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - 15 Exclusive Screenshots Taken Using Photo Mode</h3></div></output><p>But Rook marked an intentional pivot from the Inquisitor in other ways, too. It’s hard to deny a heavy presence of the classic “chosen one” trope in Dragon Age: Inquisition, as your character is the only one with a mark on their hand that can save the world. The Inquisitor becomes a religious figure (whether they choose to embrace it or not), essentially heralded as a messiah while amassing a wealth of political power as leader of the Inquisition. </p><p>Epler says that the team wanted to avoid not a “power creep,” but something of a “reputation creep” when it comes to the protagonist of The Veilguard.</p><p>“At the end of Inquisition, you are the chosen one,” he says. “Eventually you shut down the Inquisition or you hand it over to the Chantry because, through this almost mythological hero-building that's come around you as a character, it's become too big and unwieldy. With Rook, we wanted to give you an opportunity to see things from a different perspective in the world, someone who has to kind of earn their place. There's nothing about Rook that somebody looks at and is like, ‘Well, I wasn't going to trust you, but you've got this magic hand or these documents.’ Rook has to earn the respect, has to earn the trust of these different groups in Thedas.”</p><p>All of that being said, it’s not as if the Inquisitor has <em>zero</em> role in the proceedings. On the contrary, game director Corinne Busche even <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-allow-you-to-import-your-choices-from-previous-games-through-the-character-creator"><u>confirmed to us months ago</u></a> that players will be able to recreate their Inquisitor in the character creator.</p><p>“Bringing the Inquisitor into The Veilguard was simultaneously one of the most challenging and, I think, one of the most rewarding things we've done,” Busche tells me. “And the reason I say ‘challenging’ is because Dragon Age: The Veilguard is now about 10 years on from the events of Inquisition and Dragon Age: Trespasser, and even still, the fanbase has such an affinity towards their Inquisitors, the fan art, their stories. There is a certain reverence there about the Inquisitor that was very important for us to capture.”</p><p>For all the reveals that have been made pre-release, however, Epler, Busche, and the rest of the team are especially tight-lipped about what the Inquisitor's actual role will be. It’s something I’ve been particularly curious about, especially as an unabashed Solas romancer (or a “Solavellan” as the fanbase calls it, a combination of Solas with an elven Inqusitor’s surname, Lavellan).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I'd say the Inquisitor, to some degree, feels guilty or responsible for what Solas is doing to the world."</p></div><p>Still, I tried. “You’re going to want to see for yourself,” Busche insists when I ask the question of how the Inquisitor will show up. </p><p>“But [they’ll have] some very interesting contributions, given their history, their relationship with Solas, which can be quite complicated as a Solavellan player,” she says. “And don't judge me too hard, but as a Solavellan player, you know how complex that relationship between the Inquisitor and Solas could be. That is something we needed to pay off, and I'm happy to say, I think we did.”</p><p>Epler also acknowledges that the Inquisitor “obviously has a very personal relationship with Solas,” one that will need to be reckoned with in The Veilguard.</p><p>“Whether you're Solavellan and you've romanced Solas, or even just any other Inquisitor, you journeyed with Solas for quite some time,” he says. “And I'd say the Inquisitor, to some degree, feels guilty or responsible for what Solas is doing to the world. So while we're not going to get too far into details about what role they may play, they absolutely are somebody who is going to be interested and invested in the outcome of Rook's journey in The Veilguard.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/24/da-ign-first-lore-illo-3-1727214261179.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Illustration by Julia Rago for IGN</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>Decisions, Decisions</strong></h2><p>The Inquisitor is also somewhat representative of yet another big challenge facing The Veilguard: not only does Dragon Age have incredibly expansive lore at this point, but the player could, in previous games, make massive decisions that would impact that lore. How is BioWare grappling with not only the various decisions Rook can make in The Veilguard, but also the decisions the player has <em>already made</em> in past games? </p><p>Inquisition had The Keep, where players could import their saves from Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II to carry over their world states. The Veilguard, meanwhile, will allow players to select a few story decisions via tarot cards in the "Adventurer's Past" section of the character creator, where you can remake your Inquisitor. Those decisions are: who your Inquisitor romanced (with the options gender- and lineage-locked in the same way that they were in Inquisition), whether or not you disbanded the Inquisition, and whether you vowed to stop Solas or save him.</p><p>Granted, that might not seem like a ton of choices when it comes to a series like Dragon Age. There’s a couple of reasons for that: for one, the team focused on choices that they felt they could react to meaningfully – not just a cameo or one-liner. But it’s also part of the advantage of moving the setting up to Northern Thedas, Epler says, with the prior games in the series taking place in Southern Thedas, a significantly different region both geographically and sociopolitically.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“Our philosophy when it comes to integrating past player choices and world states is wherever possible we want to avoid contradicting what has happened before. We never want to invalidate your choices,” he says. “For Dragon Age: The Veilguard, among many reasons why we moved to Northern Thedas is it becomes a little bit more of a clean slate for us. There's not as many decisions you have made up to this point that have an impact on what's happening in Northern Thedas. And we don't have to speak directly to things like who is the Divine? Because again, that's happening in the South.”</p><p>“There's never a sense of, ‘Oh, that decision doesn't exist.’ But maybe we don't touch on it in this particular title,” he says. “Much like Inquisition didn't touch on every decision from Origins, much like DA2 didn't touch on every decision from Origins, it's kind of in that same vein of we're not going to contradict it. We just may not always reference it directly.”</p><p>Epler reiterates previous statements both he and the rest of the BioWare team have made about there not being an “official canon” when it comes to player choice in Dragon Age. Those choices, he says, are a large part of what makes Dragon Age such a “personal story” for fans.</p><p>“We don't want to ever imply that a decision is the wrong decision or the right decision,” he says. “We might <em>joke </em>about things like, ‘Oh, you let The Chargers die? Well, that's clearly the wrong choice.’ But again, it's not because it's canon. We want those stories to be personal.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"For Dragon Age: The Veilguard, among many reasons why we moved to Northern Thedas is it becomes a little bit more of a clean slate for us."</p></div><p>Clearly, it’s a delicate balance. But “wherever possible,” Epler says, the goal is to avoid contradicting the players’ choices – even if that means some of those choices won’t be referred to in specifics. </p><p>But all this talk about lore, choice, and story leads to something of a question mark for Dragon Age at large: are we building to some sort of endgame? Regardless of whether or not The Veilguard does well enough to justify a fifth game, will there ever be a shortage of stories to tell within Thedas, even after the Solas of it all is dealt with?</p><p>In response to that question, Epler brings up what he says is one of his favorite quotes from Inquisition’s Trespasser DLC: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r-F3EGCY54" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an optional line for the Inquisitor</u></a>, in which they yell in frustration, “could one thing in this f*cking world just stay fixed?” </p><p>That line is somewhat indicative, he says, of the larger story of the series as a whole: “Dragon Age has always been a little bit less about a very specific threat and more about a world in conflict.”</p><p>‘That's kind of the story of Dragon Age,” he says. “Things don't stay fixed forever. Things break. Because Dragon Age is a story about people, there's always going to be somebody who wants more power, wants to change the world for what they see as a good reason but ultimately is going to harm people. So there's always going to be that sense of conflict.”</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard releases on PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on October 31.</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

Progress made in the demo will carry over to the full version of the game when it releases in October.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo lets players check out the prologue of the upcoming fantasy-RPG and can be played repeatedly if desired. Metaphor's opening moments see the fully voiced protagonist and their fairy companion Gallica traversing to the Royal Capital, only for their caravan to be attacked. The two then traverse the wastes outside the city on foot, with the goal of enlisting in the royal military in order to deliver an important message. This detour serves as the game's way of introducing players to how Metaphor's combat and exploration work.</p><p dir="ltr">Those who have played Persona will instantly recognize Metaphor's stylish menus and UI, and its turn-based combat will also look familiar, though there are some key differences. When facing more powerful enemies, the game features turn-based combat where players will look to exploit enemy weaknesses. For low-ranked cannon fodder, Metaphor will let players quickly defeat them in real-time combat. Rather than using Personas, characters instead channel various Archetype classes, with more than 40 to choose from.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-is-a-fantastical-politically-charged-adventure-that-i-dont-want-to-stop-playing/1100-6526308/" data-ref-id="1100-6526308">Metaphor: ReFantazio hands-on preview</a>, we said the greatest praise we could give Atlus' latest was that we didn't want to put it down, and were intrigued by the game's metanarrative choices and its implementation of Persona's various social-sim systems.</p><p dir="ltr">Metaphor: ReFantazio releases October 11, and will be available on Xbox Game Pass day one.</p>
