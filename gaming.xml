			<p>Arkane Studios founder <span>Raphaël Colantonio was recently interviewed by PC Gamer and had the chance to share his own thoughts on a couple of topics, starting with the closure of the Austin office.</span></p>
<p>As you'll most certainly remember, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to shut down the studio's US branch (alongside Tango Gameworks) earlier this year, largely due to the failure of Redfall. Unsurprisingly, Colantonio wasn't a fan of the choice, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/microsoft-closing-arkane-austin-was-a-dumb-move-says-founder-and-former-president/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calling </a>it 'stupid':</p>
<p><em>I think if you look a little bit, it's obvious that Arkane Austin was a very special group of people that have made some cool things and that could pull it off again. I think it was a decision that just came down to, 'We need to cut something.' Was it to please the investors, the stock market? They're playing a different game. The rules that they play, we might not understand them. It's a different thing. It's hard to know why they did what they did. The only thing that I stand by is saying that the specific choice of killing Arkane Austin, that was not a good decision.</em></p>
<p><em>Recreating a very special group like that is, I would dare to say, impossible. It takes forever. When you have that magic of Harvey Smith and Ricardo Bare etc that all come together, it's a specific moment in time and space that just worked out this way, that took forever to reach. Those people together can really make magic. It's not like, 'Doesn't matter, we'll just rehire.' No, try it. That's what big groups do all the time. They try to just hire massively and overpay people to create those magic groups. It doesn't work like this. So to me, that was stupid. But what do I know?</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Colantonio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dishonored-raphael-colantonio-leaves-arkane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> Arkane over seven years ago precisely because Bethesda had planned a switch towards live service games. Dishonored and Prey hadn't sold as well as they hoped, so there was a push towards live service (which didn't end well).</p>
<p>Colantonio also <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/one-of-the-biggest-names-in-immersive-sims-reckons-theyre-easier-to-sell-if-you-call-them-something-else-but-one-day-theyll-be-invading-every-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> with PC Gamer why immersive simulations never went mainstream:</p>
<p><em>If you don't hit the market, it doesn't matter how good your game is. Prey is a good example of that, where it was sold as an immersive sim. It's an immersive sim in every way one can imagine. But because of that, there were a lot of marketing points that were spent in trying to explain to people with an immersive sim is. Nobody wonders what an RPG is. We might debate whether the Bethesda RPGs are an immersive sim or not, but who cares? The market just understands what an RPG is. Same with Baldur’s Gate. If you say, ‘This is an immersive sim,’ you're going to have a tiny percentage of people that are super excited because they know what it means.</em></p>
<p><em>And then the other ones, they're going to be like, ‘What is an immersive sim?’ And then you're trying to explain to them what it is and they say, ‘Well, that sounds like most games. Every game is trying to be cohesive. Every game has possibilities. What are you talking about?’ It's like, ‘Nah, man, if you don't know, you don't know.’</em></p>
<p>Still, the veteran game designer (whose credits while at Arkane include Arx Fatalis, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Dishonored, and Prey) believes immersive sims might simply start to seep into every genre in the future, rather than being shoehorned into a category that not every gamer fully understands.</p>
<p>That is, after all, what Colantonio's WolfEye Studios did with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weird West</a>, which was an isometric action RPG with immersive sim elements. Following that debut game, the studio is now <a href="https://wccftech.com/weird-west-developer-gets-investment-for-its-ambitious-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making</a> a more ambitious title in the first-person action RPG genre, and we can bet it'll have plenty of immersive sim features. The game will enter limited Alpha testing in 2025, and you can sign up for it <a href="https://wolfeye-studios.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>.</p>

		<p>A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to join the team from Nihon Falcom at a preview event to talk about and play Ys X: Nordics and Trails Through Daybreak II. It was incredible to play both of these (at the time) unreleased titles, and the day gave me a not-inconsequential desire to play more of Daybreak II, but I have to wait until February 2025 for that! Another part of the day was getting to sit down with the president of Nihon Falcom, Toshihiro Kondo, to discuss these two upcoming games and his role within the company. As a huge Ys fan, I was more than happy to oblige, and you can find this full interview below. Please note that this interview was performed via an interpreter, and as such I have made some amendments for brevity and clarity.</p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: Thank you so much for inviting me in and allowing me to come in and chat with you both. It’s been an amazing day. And, wow, there’s now games that I need to play, and that’s a problem. I’ll start with a kind of, like, really kind of big open question, and I’ll kind of make it a little bit more specific. </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">I think one of the biggest questions, and one of the things I always find really interesting to ask folks in the games industry, especially people in your position, is what inspires you as a games industry veteran. Are there any particular kind of movies or other games or anything that kind of really inspire you when it comes to your work?&nbsp;</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: So that’s a difficult question. A lot of the inspiration comes from the anime and manga that I read and watched as a child. Another thing would be recent films or things that I’m exposed to when working on a given game. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In the case of Ys, which has kind of a pseudo history theme going with it, there’s a lot of history things that I will reference when working on it. This then becomes inspiration as things like this are probably impossible to avoid in daily life. Whatever I have been watching or reading at the time would kind of have a way of creeping into my work as an inspiration.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: Okay, awesome. Following on from that because I did a little bit of research, you joined Nihon Falcom after creating the very popular fan site, The Saga of Tirasweel. How much you can speak about this, I don’t know, but how did you find that transition between being a fan writing about games to actually being a developer and creating the games?</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: At first, I couldn’t believe it. I thought I was actually in a dream that I had joined the company. From there, however, obviously, I kind of went face to face with reality. I had this dream about the way it would be, but then the reality obviously was very different. A</span><span data-contrast="none">t that point in time, I had actually talked to the owner of the company, who told me that, a lot of times, people who join the company who really love the games kind of break when they’re confronted with the strict reality of what it actually takes to make games and game development and quit. </span><span data-contrast="none">So, he said, please don’t quit, don’t break.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">I had a lot of rough, difficult conversations with the people who had been in the company longer than him and who had told him all these things. It certainly ended up being a little bit more difficult than I thought, but that’s what game development is.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The interesting thing, though, is that Falcom is a very unique company in that I, for example, entered the company, supposedly in the finance division because I studied economics in school. However, as soon as I joined, I didn’t work in the finance department. I actually got put in charge of running the company’s servers, which I did for a year. I</span><span data-contrast="none"> expected to be moved to finance or something, given that that was my background.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">But from there, I was given the opportunity to write an additional scenario for a game that had already come out; so, I tried my hand at scenario writing. It turned out I was good at that, so was able to do scripting for certain event scenes in the game. E</span><span data-contrast="none">ven though this was completely not in my wheelhouse, I was given the opportunity to do these things. B</span><span data-contrast="none">y doing them, it turned out I’m actually good at these things meaning I was able to do more of it.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Another example of this one of my then co-workers, Shinkai Makoto, you might be familiar with his work in anime. When he knew him, he didn’t know how to draw. He wasn’t necessarily known as an artist, but working at Falcom, he was given the opportunity because he was interested in it, to draw and to be able to animate. By giving these opportunities, people can find out what they’re good at and what they can actually accomplish. Falcom is an interesting company because it offers those opportunities to people within the company regardless of what they supposedly join the company to do specifically.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: It’s really good to hear that there’s a company that still fosters these sorts of these allowances to kind of play with your role. </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: Yeah, it’s the kind of company where the company won’t necessarily go as far as to necessarily say, “oh, if you want to try this, you can”. But it’s more that if this person has the will and the desire and the guts, they’re given this opportunity and they can see how far they can go by just doing it because they want to, which is amazing, in itself. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: So, I wanted to move on to a couple of game specific questions. The first one I wanted to ask, as a huge fan of Ys as a franchise, is that – with the Trails franchise – there was a very clear intent from the beginning that this would be a continual story in the same world with the same characters, and it would kind of grow out from there. </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">I know that Ys began before you joined the company, but I was wondering whether the decision to keep Adol was the central focal point of Ys was a conscious decision or it’s just something that’s just ended up happening? In other words, did Adol end up being the main focus, or was that a decision from the beginning?&nbsp;</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: So, the thing is, there’s no hard and fast rules in the company that the main character of Ys has to be Adol. However, there’s a feeling in the company that Ys kind of *is* Adol. I specifically took over the Ys games from Ys Six and looking at that, it was like, well, these are Adol’s adventures. </span><span data-contrast="none">These games purport to tell the stories of this one adventurer and his adventures. </span><span data-contrast="none">So, it makes sense that he’s the main character. But one of the most important things about the Ys games is that Adol is kind of “the player” in a lot of situations.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">We talked about it briefly in the main presentation and the Q&amp;A; but a lot of times, Adol is more of an avatar for the player a</span><span data-contrast="none">nd the things that are happening in the games are happening to the player. When the heroine, for example, is speaking to Adol, they’re speaking to you as the player. These things that are happening to Adol, and Adol’s experiencing, you should be experiencing as the player as Adol is your avatar.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Because Adol, as this character, lends himself to this method of storytelling, this has then become intertwined with what an Ys game is and with Ys’ storytelling. So, it stands that Adol continues to be the main character. The thing is, and again this is something that was mentioned during the Q&amp;A session, it’s because of Adol the player is able to exist, and the game world is able to exist.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">It all stems from the player and their relationship to and their role within this world through the vehicle of the playable character. In the Trails series, the characters are already built, and they have their own really strong personalities and motives and goals and things like that. The player is on the outside, looking into the story and watching the story. Whereas, in the case of Ys, the player is an actual participant. Even if Adol wasn’t the main character, it would probably end up being the same style because that is what Ys is at its fundamental core, something the player interacts with while in this world.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The only example which kind of breaks this rule is the game called Ys Origin, which has its own separate main characters. It’s got two main characters, Yunica and Hugo, and they both have their own personalities, they both have their own stories, and they always have their own world and things. So, it’s a little bit different because you are, as the player, kind of looking into their world rather than being a part of it. Other than that, all the rest of the games in the series have this very strong, distinct image of you as the player.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: So, it’s like a difference between the playable character and the main character? The example that comes to mind from a game outside of Ys is Final Fantasy X, where the playable character is Tidus, but the main character of that story is Yuna.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: Unfortunately, I’m not super familiar with the Final Fantasy games, so I can’t agree necessarily to the example that you gave. But to talk a little bit further, I’d say this is an old-style game, like Dragon Quest or – as a modern example – Persona. Persona has a non-speaking main character. This is all with the goal of getting you, as the player, to see yourself within this world, so that you can kind of dive into the world head-first and be a part of it. That’s what makes Ys. At its heart it’s a very old-style game that tries to bring the player in through this method.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: And it succeeds. </span></b><b><span data-contrast="none">One thing that makes the Ys franchise so engaging and so interesting for me is that Adol has been the protagonist for so long; and because the games are written in the way they are, the world feels realistic and believable because previous events that have happened within the actual chronological timeline will be referenced.&nbsp;</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">If someone was jumping in at, say, Ys VIII, they wouldn’t necessarily know the events of Celceta, but they’re mentioned in-game. So, if you have played Memories of Celceta, it’s something that long standing players of the franchise can actually pick up on. These events actually happened in this world, this world is thought out and that thought process translates across to Trails as well. There’s a clear consistency and breadth of thought given to the world itself as well as the characters.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: Yeah, you’re right. One of the big differences between the two series is that with Trails it almost becomes a requirement for the player to know. They’re built in this way where the games constantly reference themselves and what’s come before. So, for the players there’s a necessary level of “you need to meet us here in terms of understanding what came before” to really dive into this game. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Whereas with Ys, by contrast, you do have what you mentioned, which is like “oh my god, I remember that. </span><span data-contrast="none">That happened in, you know, this game”. Alternatively, e</span><span data-contrast="none">ven somebody new, they’ll still get this sense of “oh, okay, something happened”, but they’ll still be able to continue to play the game and enjoy it because it just becomes this thing where it’s like “oh, they’re referencing something”. It makes this world feel alive, but you don’t necessarily need to know it in order to enjoy the game. That’s kind of the big difference because the Ys series demands a lot less of you, as the player, in terms of having played everything that came before to really delve into it and to enjoy the world.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: I’ve played bits and pieces of Trails over the years. But I think that’s probably why it never gelled with me because there is clearly this thing that I hadn’t realized where there’s this underlying current of story that’s running through the whole thing and I think that’s why it didn’t grab me.

<p><b><span data-contrast="none">I’ve gone back and played Celceta, Ys 1 and Ys 2.

<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: It’s kind of what makes both of these series unique and enjoyable is that there is the fun, which hopefully you’ll be able to discover though the Trails series being so connected and everything being so reliant on what’s come before and hinting towards things in the future. That’s the real great joy of playing those games.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">On the flip side, you have something where you can jump in anywhere and you can enjoy yourself, and you can jump around and go back to different places. You’ll be able to find a lot of enjoyment within that and seeing those small references, but still being able to enjoy the adventure at hand and knowing it’s going to be complete within itself. So there’s really no good or bad for either. They both have their merits and their fun points.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: Don’t get me wrong, I really enjoyed Trails like, gameplay wise is flawless, but I felt completely lost plot wise, you know? Sticking with Ys still for a moment, one thing that I was really curious about was the naval combat because, in Ys X, this is the first time there’s ever been naval combat in the Ys franchise. You mentioned earlier in the Q&amp;A that there is always this consideration between gameplay and narrative; did</span></b><b><span data-contrast="none"> the naval combat fall in as a gameplay thing first or a narrative thing first.?&nbsp;</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: Actually neither. What it actually came from is that there was this desire to have ship exploration to begin with, which is something that the team and I wanted to include in this game because, over the years, you don’t really see it anymore. I remember as a kid playing Dragon Quest 2, and when you get the ship, the ability for you to go more places is greatly expanded upon and you have more freedom as the player. </span><span data-contrast="none">If you see a little island somewhere, you can go to it.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">I remember loving so much seeing a little island on the map and sailing to it, then getting off and seeing what the island discovers. It brought me a lot of enjoyment and, because games don’t really do this anymore, it’s something he wanted to bring back. At the same time though, I was watching the Vikings TV show, and these kind of just miraculously worked together and came together, which is where you get ship combat.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: I will definitely say as someone who has played a few hours of Ys X: Nordics, that feeling of exploration has been completely nailed.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: The thing about the Ys games is that they always start from a concept of – “What will this adventure be like?”. What kind of adventure do we want to make? For example, with Ys Seven, the first thing we had was the key word of the Five Dragons of Altago. This is actually a term that came out in the manual for Ys 1. This is all we had. So, we had to think, well, what are the dragons? Then from there, we developed this whole adventure around this region of Altago and what these dragons did, and what the player had to do. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Similarly, with the adventure in Ys VIII, we had the idea of an unpopulated island, an island all by itself with, you know, no one. What would happen on this island? What kind of adventure would Adol have if he were to go to an island that supposedly was unpopulated? So, you’ve got the adventure that happens with Ys VIII.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">With Ys IX, the idea actually came from one of the designers saying, “look at Ys VIII, we had to make so many assets that are in nature. Can we please do something that’s not nature? Can we do something that’s a little bit more urban?”. T</span><span data-contrast="none">herefore, you have the city setting. W</span><span data-contrast="none">ithin that, too, there was this idea of, up until that time, most of the Ys games had essentially the flat with a little bit of jumping. So they said, for Ys IX, what if we explored verticality? </span><span data-contrast="none">What if we had differences of level but still made it fun for people to traverse going from one level to another? </span><span data-contrast="none">How can we incorporate this into the game? That’s where you get the idea of the Monstrums and the Monstrum powers that came with Ys IX.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Then finally with Ys X again, it’s like, well, even though we’ve had Ys VIII being on an island and Altago being a water-based region, we’ve never really had Adol on a ship. We’ve never had him exploring via boat. Though the joke is that Adol gets on a boat, the boat sinks, the adventure begins, we thought what can we do with this that we’ve never done before? Thus you have Ys X. That’s how, essentially, all of these games are created. What adventure is Adol going to go on? Then we just let that idea inform what the game becomes.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: That’s an incredible insight, and it does explain why each game feels so self-contained, because they each start from that one idea. O</span></b><b><span data-contrast="none">ne question I wanted to ask about Trails, specifically Trails through Daybreak II. T</span></b><b><span data-contrast="none">here’s this very clear narrative thread, as it’s been discussed multiple times, that runs through the Trails series. But one of the key things with Trails through Daybreak II is time and the manipulation of time. </span></b><b><span data-contrast="none">How does the manipulation of time mess with that entire coherent thread of narrative that you have running through</span></b><b><span data-contrast="none"> the world of Trails?&nbsp;</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: It is a difficult question to answer, but mainly from the aspect of it ends up being super spoilery. This is absolutely directly related to what will come after in the series. So, this element of the story is there purposefully, and it was never necessarily something which could kind of ruin what came before. When you introduce time travel and time elements to a story, you can have paradoxes happen. But this is something that’s been very carefully planned out, and to say anything further would be a spoiler. So, please just look forward to it in the game. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: Oh, yeah, I won’t ask any more. It’s just always interesting when time mechanics, or manipulation of time, is introduced into a narrative. It can be a concern, but that answer just perfectly solves the point that it has been included within the considerations for the story. </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: That was an incredibly insightful question and a good question. Honestly, t</span><span data-contrast="none">hat specific question is something that will be addressed in the game that just came out in Japan, and coming to the West in the future.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: That’s so exciting, and also something that doesn’t need to be considered with Ys because they’re all self-contained. You could have a time travel one and it wouldn’t really affect anything and that’s the wonderful thing about Y, isn’t it? I mean there was, and not getting too much into spoilers, but in Ys VIII there’s alternate dimensions at one point, isn’t there? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: That’s a really good point. The thing about the Ys world – the world of Eresia – is that each area has its own specific powers that exist there, and their influence basically only extends to those areas. So that kind of helps it be self-contained. Also even though you might have like gods or godlike figures, they’re called by different names in different areas and their powers kind of extend in different ways. The setting is very different and it lends itself really well to these self-contained adventures because of how compartmentalised certain aspects of this world can be in terms of what power governs one individual region or has sway over individual region. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: As president of Nihon Falcom and someone who’s overseen both Trails and Ys, do you have a specific game in mind that you say to start for new players to each series? </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: Even though I very much love Ys 1 and 2, I don’t know whether or not they would really be well received by everybody given their, you know, very unique nature. Therefore, to choose something more recent that was generally really well received by everybody, I would have to point to Ys VIII. That’d be a great jumping on point.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">For Trails, that’s a really hard question. There’s lots of onboarding points, but the thing that would probably be the best right now would be Daybreak 1, simply because it’s a brand-new location within the world, meaning it has a brand-new cast of characters. Also, the system has been completely revamped over what’s came before, so it really lends itself well to being a good jumping on point.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: Speaking as a player, I’m going to take that on board and that’s going to be my jumping on point for Trails. Oh, and also Ys VIII is the one that I use to convince people to play Ys; it’s a very good jumping on point. </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">So, a slightly lighthearted question for you. I know there’s a lot of characters across Trails and Ys, but is there a particular character that sticks out from those two franchises that you would call your favorite?&nbsp;</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: Like one from each or one from everything? </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: Either/or. If there’s one from each that speaks fantastic, but if there’s one particular character that really stands out, that’s also golden. </span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: It’s difficult because if it’s a character that I actually created, it can be really embarrassing. W</span><span data-contrast="none">hen it comes to the Trails series,</span><span data-contrast="none"> that’s the first game that I worked on as an original in the company. It’s the first game that I had a chance to come up with the world and the characters and everything. So, within that, the main character of that series is a young woman named Estelle Bright. She was one of the first ones I did and she was the first main character. She was essentially the first female character that came out. Because of that she is very near and dear to me. So that’s the character I would choose from Trails.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">So, this is a little embarrassing because it is a character I created, but from Ys my favourite would be Dana from Ys VIII. The reason for that, as I mentioned in the talk earlier, was because of Feena from Ys 1 and 2 who was a character that the fans loved. I often saw on message boards and among fan communities that they’re never going to beat Feena in terms of creating a heroine. They tried over the years, as there’s plenty of games where there have been heroines that come out, but none of them have never been able to compare to Feena.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">So, one of the goals for Ys VIII was the “Beat Feena” goal, or at least the “Reach Feena” goal to make a character who is beloved as Feena. T</span><span data-contrast="none">he thing that makes this so difficult though, too, is that Feena also has this historical baggage that comes along with her. Now you’re fighting not only against the character of Feena, but you’re fighting against the memories that the players have created, having played this long ago and having all these deep feelings towards the character of Feena.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">So, we thought how can we do this? One way to do that was that Dana first appears, as, you know, in Adol’s dreams. As Adol, you play as Dana in these dream sequences, which was very interesting and novel, because Adol’s the main character. This is something they hadn’t really done before. Within that, as you know, the story grows and we learn about Dana’s character throughout the course of the game.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">When it came out, a lot of people said, “Oh, they’ve done it. They finally beat Feena”. It was really difficult coming up with that character. T</span><span data-contrast="none">he actual idea for this whole setting came out with this idea of h</span><span data-contrast="none">ow to beat Feena. But, all that hard work was worth it because, at the end of the day, a lot of players actually gave me this feedback of “You guys, you finally did it. You finally got a character to beat Feena”.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="none">TSA: I mean, Dana is incredible.

<p><span data-contrast="none">TK: Actually, I’m pretty much really into orthodox rock. I’m really kind of old school.

            <p>One of my lesser quality tests for an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is whether the shopkeepers complain at you for not buying anything. Grumpy shopkeepers, good RPG. This most specific of litmus tests has served me well, although I must admit that I’d happily upgrade it to ‘shopkeepers you can attack’, would that not disqualify 99% of games. But not turn based dungeon crawler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/THYSIASTERY">Thysiastery</a>, it turns out. This “dungeon crawler RPG featuring traditional roguelike and turn-based gameplay” apparently trusts you enough to let you recklessly batter its friendly wandering lizard merchants. You’d be a monster for it, of course, but it’s nice to have options.</p>

<p>“Command a party of bearers of the Brand, drawn into a vast Labyrinth. Recruit while exploring the Labyrinth in hope of finding a way out, and its secrets will be revealed as you delve deeper,” reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3140180/THYSIASTERY/">Steam page</a>. The basic premise here should be familiar to anyone who’s played old-school dungeon crawlers like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/dungeons-dragons">Eye Of The Beholder</a>, or modern revivals like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legend-of-grimrock">Legend Of Grimrock</a>. Your party of four shuffles around in first person, turn-basedly slaying monsters with attacks like ‘femur breaker’ and ‘lobotomise’. You’ll level up, hoover up shinies, make discoveries. You know. Adventure shit. Here are some more details:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Turn-based combat in which your choices allow you to capitalize on chance and weakness - or be similarly exploited.</li>
<li>Classic roguelike features such as permadeath, procedurally generated areas and randomly generated characters that provide a highly replayable game.</li>
<li>A great number of skills for characters to learn and discover, then teach further to other characters.</li>
<li>A number of difficulty modifiers to amp up or down the difficulty.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>No solid release date on this one just yet - it’s slated for “Q2 2025”. Maybe the merchant will tell you if you rough ‘em up a bit? There’s always <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-and-darker">Dark And Darker</a> in the meantime if you like a little multiplayer looting with your dungeon crawling.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Put your hand up if you'd forgotten that every Assassin's Creed game is, strictly speaking, set in the present day. I know I had. That's not the actual distant past you're parkouring through. That isn't actual Renaissance architecture you're clambering on. It's a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA's fault, not Ubisoft's. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.</p>
<p>We can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, however, they're planning to bring back the modern day setting in a big way, though details are scanty.</p><!--more-->
<p>"Ending Desmond's arc was a difficult decision, and afterward, the modern storyline struggled to find its footing," Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté observed last week at a BAFTA event <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond">attended by Eurogamer</a>. The series has experimented with a new Animus wielder, Layla Hassan, but Coté feels Ubisoft have failed to weave an impactful and consistent narrative around her, not least because the overarching AC plot of warring Templar and Assassin orders has become a lacklustre hunt for ancient alien McGuffins.</p>
<p>"The continued focus on characters hunting for Isu artefacts made the narrative more predictable," Coté went on, "and reduced the conflict between Templars and Assassins to a straightforward pursuit of control over - let's be honest - magical relics. This shift pulled focus away from what had always been at the heart of the franchise: exploring our history. </p><p>"As this approach became repetitive, both players and critics felt the modern day storyline had become a secondary concern, more of a side-quest, rather than an integral part of the overall experience," he said. "Furthermore, the compounded complexity of 15 years of lore built in this parallel storyline created a cognitive load that made the franchise difficult to approach for newcomers." </p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will be the first step on the road toward putting "history back at the centre of the players' experience," Coté explained, with a modern-day narrative that "will serve to enhance, rather than overshadow, the historical journey". You can expect a "meaningful contrast between past and present". </p>
<p>To be more specific, "the modern day storyline will explore deeper themes of memory, identity and autonomy, how the past shapes who we are, and how controlling this past can impact our future.</p>
<p>"These themes will allow us to reflect on contemporary issues: freedom versus control, the power of knowledge and the tension between individuality and conformity, all through the lens of history," Coté concluded. "The groundwork for this new direction will take shape with Assassin's Creed Shadows, which will lay the foundation for this narrative evolution that will grow in the years to come." </p><p>It all sounds very grand. The less grand practical reality is that all the modern-day stuff will sit within a new Assassin's Creed meta-game hub, a project previously known as Assassin's Creed Infinity. If I were a cynical man, and I do try to be, I'd say Assassin's Creed's modern-day component is coming back as a set of animated cyberpunk wallpapers for a bog-standard game launcher.</p>
<p>I was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-actually-two-games-competing-for-your-affections">cautiously enthusiastic</a> about the 30 minutes of choreographed Shadows footage I saw at Summer Games Fest this year. I tend to be cautiously enthusiastic about anything that whiffs of Tenchu, mind. The new open worlder was recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">delayed into 2025</a> following an Ubisoft share slump abetted by "soft" sales of Star Wars Outlaws. I'm not sure a rejuvenated modern-day component is the secret sauce, here, but I'm interested to see what they mean by "reflect on contemporary issues". Just please don't bring back Desmond.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>G2 has just swept Team Spirit in the grand final of the BLAST Premier: World Final event in Singapore to net the $500,000 prize. In this blink-and-you’ll-miss-it tournament, eight teams landed in Singapore to fight for the lion’s share of the $1 million prize pool. This event effectively marked the end of a year-long BLAST Premier schedule.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unstoppable">Unstoppable</h2>



<p>G2 Esports has had a pretty good year in the Counter-Strike space, except for <strong>that blip</strong>. In June, the squad picked up the top spot at IEM Dallas, beating Vitality in the GF to win $100,000. From there, things got a little choppy. </p>



<p>The team won the BLAST Premier Fall Final event and scooped $200,000, and then barely one week later, the squad fell out of IEM Rio in <strong>last place</strong> after winning <strong>nothing </strong>and ending up securing a prize worth just $4,000.</p>



<p>And now in another switch-up, the team has won the BLAST Premier World Final and picked up half a million dollars.</p>



<p>If that’s not representative of the volatility of the esports business, I don’t know what is.</p>



<p>G2 had a nice run in the group stage, but a stellar performance from Astralis meant that the future was almost written. Astralis netted a +24 map count during the groups, which was more than three times the performance of any other team – G2 included. It fell apart in the semifinals, though, as Team Spirit forcefully ejected Astralis from the running.</p>



<p>In the grand final, it came down to Spirit and G2, but in a wondrous spree, the latter team produced a 3 – 0 scoreline, sweeping Spirit clean out of the competition and picking up the trophy.</p>



<p>That’s not it for Counter-Strike esports, though. We’ve still got the Perfect World Shanghai Major to unravel later this month, which bears a massive $1.25 million prize pool. Can G2 end the year on even more of a high by claiming the top spot there as well?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mongolz-wins-thunderpick-world-championship/</link>

<p>The LVL Dome Arena in Berlin played host to the Thunderpick World Championship over the last week or so. On a lucrative stage, 16 of the world’s top CS2 teams descended upon Germany for their shot at winning the $500,000 grand prize. By the time the dust had settled, it was The MongolZ – a ten-year-old Mongolian organisation – that secured the trophy.</p>



<p>It has been a mixed bag of a year for MongolZ. In June, the team claimed the top spot at the YaLLa Compass event in Abu Dhabi. That was the biggest win – by cash value – that the team had ever secured, until now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-getting-prestigious">Getting Prestigious</h2>



<p>The MongolZ has been competing in the Counter-Strike space for more than a decade, and this marks the squad’s biggest win by value as the organisation walks away $500,000 better off.</p>



<p>In front of a remarkably small audience in Berlin, The MongolZ produced a perfect record in the group stage and then breezed through the playoffs, effortlessly defeating Imperial, 3DMAX, and finally, Heroic, in a best-o-f-five grand final showdown. This underrated event might not pull in the numbers on streaming platforms, but it’s super impactful for teams and their communities.</p>



<p>This was a huge win for The MongolZ, as the favourite to slam the tournament was Heroic. In the group stage, Heroic produced the best map record, and then in the playoffs, the team didn’t drop a single round until they clashed against The MongolZ. </p>



<p>On social media, the team celebrated its win:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>First of all, GG WP to HEROIC! </p>



<p>Secondly, thank you to everyone involved in making the Thunderpick World Championship 2024 possible. </p>



<p>Lastly, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you to everyone who came to Berlin to support us. It means the world to us. </p>



<p>Your boys did it!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is only the second iteration of the Thunderpick World Championship, which is sponsored and backed by the betting platform of the same name. Last year, the $500,000 event was won by FaZe Clan – and for that event, The MongolZ didn’t even receive an invitation.</p>



<p>The Thunderpick World Championship will return next year.</p>

It was only a matter of time before someone pulled that off, but what I didn’t expect was that when it happened, it would be playable.</p></div><p>That’s exactly what hacker GaryOberNicht, who recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283916/sound-the-alarmo">figured out how</a> to run custom firmware on the Alarmo, did in a video <a href="https://social.treehouse.systems/@garyodernichts/113414373708017840">posted to Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://x.com/GaryOderNichts/status/1852753537001718021">their X account</a> yesterday. In it, they play by turning or pressing the mushroom-shaped blob on top of the Alarmo to move and pressing the other buttons to shoot or open doors. Here, have a look:</p><p>Gary <a href="https://social.treehouse.systems/@garyodernichts/113414374157540351">said</a> it’s “possible to load the shareware version of Doom entirely from USB, without modifying the Alarmo.” And they’ve put the software and instructions for running it <a href="https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/alarmo_doom">on Github</a>, so almost any sufficiently knowledgeable and determined Alarmo owner can do it, too. Best of all, it can be done without opening the clock up at all.</p><p>How did they pull this off? Gary explains in a <a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html">blog post</a> that after another person called Spinda <a href="https://x.com/_spinda/status/1845279277304119318">hacked the Alarmo</a> (with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23433594/flipper-zero-hacking-gadget-wireless-pentesting-open-source-antenna">Flipper Zero</a>) and dumped the firmware from memory, Gary worked out a method that uses a USB mode and the USB-C port to point the Alarmo to custom external firmware, instead. </p><p>Given how easy it appears to be reproduce what Gary has done, Alarmo software modding almost certainly won’t just stop at <em>Doom</em>. Of course, how far any online community efforts to turn the Alarmo into a bizarro game console will get probably depends on how Nintendo, which has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">particularly active</a> with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">copyright</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259791/nintendo-ryujinx-switch-emulator-gdkchan-removed-downloads-github">disputes</a> lately, feels about it. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Longtime fans have theories on everything from Springfield existing in its own space-time bubble, to Marge’s family financially supporting them, to the idea that they’re actually all geniuses. One particular theory that’s become popular on TikTok is that the family is Black.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,197298,197284" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Technically, producers have never confirmed a specific race for the Simpsons, but most viewers assume they’re meant to be white. However, Black fans have been watching closely over the years and have been picking up on some interesting cultural traits.</p><p>TikTok user <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@cocoabutterofficial/video/7262069050564529450?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7432343879984645662&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cocoabutterofficial/video/7262069050564529450?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7432343879984645662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cocoabutterofficial</a></span>, pointed out that Marge has an afro, which is why she and the kids have textured hair that grows upward. The clip also notes that Marge’s sisters, Patty and Sema, are “two cigarette smoking Black aunties” who have no time for the way Homer treats their younger sister.</p><p>We’ve also got theories about Marge’s hair, as we’ve seen her change it up in flashbacks and special episodes, much the way Black women like to do. Plus, the way Marge holds her chaotic family down gives Black mom energy. </p><p>Meanwhile, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@iamthekayelle/video/7205686816358288682?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7432343879984645662&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@iamthekayelle/video/7205686816358288682?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7432343879984645662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iamthekayelle</a></span> also has ideas about Marge’s hair, reminding everyone that she wears bonnets to bed. But the real proof is found in a scene where she cuts the kids’ hair and saves it in the freezer. They think this could point to her creole origins.</p><p>In the post’s comments, someone brought up Marge’s family as proof, replying, “her sisters? her Mom, yeah they black.” While another pointed to her original last name, Bouvier, writing, “She creole fa sho w that French maiden name.”</p><p>Perhaps the most obvious example of them all comes in the Season 21 episode “The Color Yellow.” While working on a school project, Lisa discovers that her ancestor Eliza tried to help Virgil, a runaway slave, escape North. When the child fails, her mother Mabel is the one who gets him to Canada, where they married and start a family. These are the Simpsons they’re actually descended from. So apparently, it’s already canon that they have a Black ancestor.</p><p>Here’s the thing, we’re talking about cartoon characters in a fantastical setting where ridiculous things are constantly happening. Honestly, the Simpsons can be whatever you need them to be. So, if you need Homer to secretly be rich, or for it to all be a dream taking place in his head, or for the whole series to be one giant time loop, that’s fine. The important thing to remember is that my version of Springfield and its residents doesn’t diminish yours, so there’s no need for more intense fans to go on the attack just because we’re having fun exploring a cool, interesting fan theory.</p><p>If this has put you in the mood for a rewatch, you can relive the series’ entire run on Disney+.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on Tuesday, November 1.</em></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, with 2014’s <em>Inquisition</em>, it seemed more vital than ever that BioWare not do this, as the studio ended that game with a devastating cliffhanger that saw your hero, the Inquisitor, locked in a battle of ideals with Solas, the elven mage party member who, at the game’s conclusion, is revealed to be an elven god. Surely, I thought, switching to a new protagonist now and sidelining the hero through whom we’d become so engaged in this conflict would result in a failure to do right by this story I’d been waiting a decade to see conclude. I’m happy to say I was wrong. When I rolled credits on <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, I felt something I hadn’t felt for <em>Dragon Age</em> in a long time: hope. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3a586d690f89455b8a64cc834559de46" data-recommend-id="image://3a586d690f89455b8a64cc834559de46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucanis looks up at Rook from a bench." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lucanis looks up at Rook from a bench." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3a586d690f89455b8a64cc834559de46" data-recommend-id="image://3a586d690f89455b8a64cc834559de46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucanis looks up at Rook from a bench." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Many of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s</a></span> choices are personal and focus on your team’s relationships and life paths.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Dragon Age Origins is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, November 3, 2024. Below, we examine its role as a daring, if awkward, attempt to use sex as a central theme and mechanic.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Sex and video games have always had an uneasy relationship. Playing smut on the Atari 2600 feels like looking at middle-school scrawlings. Much of the pornography peddled on Steam is embarrassing and unattractive. Even more mainstream games in the modern era have had a fraught relationship with sex. The tame scenes in Mass Effect infamously got a paranoid Fox News report. Recent years have seen recording romantic scenes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-investigating-annoying-and-uncool-xbox-bans-for-baldurs-gate-3-explicit-video-uploads/1100-6520116/">Baldur's Gate 3 net players temporary Xbox bans</a>. In such an environment, it is hard to imagine a mainstream game having a bold depiction of sex. But 20 years ago, Dragon Age: Origins took a daring, if flawed, swing at it.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Age: Origins is still a weird mix. The basic plot is downright Tolkien-esque: a fellowship of warriors from across the land are driven together to stop "the blight," a horde of demon creatures dedicated to destroying all free life. In practice, however, the game takes most of its dramatic cues from A Song of Ice and Fire (the books, not Game of Thrones). Nobleman Loghan leaves boy king Cailan to die, triggering a violent succession crisis. Magic, while more commonplace than in Westeros, is marginalized, feared, and policed. Even the blight itself resembles the white walkers, i.e. a fundamental existential threat from the natural world.</p><p dir="ltr">In other words, Dragon Age: Origins, even as it holds on to high-fantasy ideas like ancient elves and underground dwarven metropolises, has a strong dark-fantasy bent. This extends somewhat to its treatment of sex and romance. Like its influences, DA:O's approach is largely heterosexual, interested in bloodlines, parentage, and, well, impregnation. This manifests in fairly tame ways, like companion Templar Alistair's claim to the throne, and in absurd ones, like the witch Morrigan begging the player to impregnate her with the spirit of the archdemon, leader of the blight. If you play as a man, she propositions you directly, but if you are a woman you must, even more comically, find someone else for her to sleep with.</p><p dir="ltr">In this moment, sex is transactional. It serves a purpose but is not necessarily about romance or love. Morrigan propositions a male player character even if she's left the party. She'll sleep with characters she finds despicable and unattractive. It's a means to an end. In some sense, this is not exactly remarkable. Most sexual encounters in video games are treated as rewards for kindness and play out in endgame cutscenes. The romance is a reward for playing correctly.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1569115518" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Origins is no exception to this. In fact, it's perhaps an egregious example of how shallow this kind of narrative design can be. No matter how much you antagonize or bully party members, you can win their affection with a set of gifts. There's even paid DLC which fills your inventory with trinkets that max out your party's affections. You can quite literally buy your way into their hearts.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Dragon Age: Origins is good at grounding its characters in politics and a culture that exists outside them. Morrigan's utilization of sex to get power comes from her background as a mage forced to hide from the oppressive church. Mages are discouraged from having children; the prevailing belief is that the more mages there are, the more force must be expended to police them. Morrigan's ritual to trap the archdemon is a massive defiance of that restriction. In other words, the choice to go through with Morrigan's ritual is one that has implications beyond just sex. But the heart of it is the push and pull of consent and vulnerability.</p><p dir="ltr">Morrigan is the most successful example of this kind of characterization, but not the exception. Both of the possible queer romances--the bard Leliana and the assassin Zevron can be romanced by a warden of either gender--are foreigners, hailing from places where the sexual culture is freer and easier. Though religious, Leliana rejects the celibacy of the church. Zevron was raised by sex workers. Alistair's status as a virgin is openly commented on and mocked. All this is to say, Dragon Age: Origin's companions each have a sexual history (or conspicuous lack thereof). This history informs how they treat you and their overall attitude toward sex. Zevran is easygoing and flirtatious, for example, while Alistair is insecure, deflecting, and sarcastic. None of these characters are defined by their sexual orientation or experience, but both inform their characterization throughout the game's entire runtime.</p><p dir="ltr">This is not to say that Dragon Age: Origins handles all this well. To put it lightly, DA:O is immature. In its lighter moments, it has a frankly juvenile sense of humor. It uses sex and violence as a cheap and mostly ineffective means of shock value. Characters stroll out of regular combat encounters soaked in blood, which is so comical that any actual gore has no impact. In the City Elf origin, DA:O handles sexual assault and racist violence callously, as trauma backdrop for the player character's blank slate. Jokes about sex are plentiful, but mostly amount to high-school health-class fodder.</p><p dir="ltr">The encounter with the pirate Isabella is most emblematic of both the game's successes and shortcomings. If you pass a persuasion check, you can sleep with Isabella to earn a subclass (yes, it's all transactional). Other party members can join you. It's not as if there aren't a few big games that feature group sex--you can have a foursome with drow twins in Baldur's Gate 3 after all--but there are fewer where the exact configuration of the encounter depends not just on whether the player character and their partner are game, but on a chain reaction of character psychology and choices. For example, If Alistair and Leliana have been "hardened" by the outcomes of their personal quests, they'll join in. If not, they won't. Isabella will always ask Zevran to participate, regardless of his romantic status with the player. He'll happily oblige... unless Alistair is there, like a bitter bisexual rejecting the advances of a couple at a bar. This moment is better conceptually than in practice, funnier and stranger to read about than to experience. But it also reflects a deeper thinking about each character's sexual ethics and how it relates to every other character.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a further problem, however: Dragon Age: Origins is visually ugly. It is just as dirt brown as a Gears of War game, but without the brutal, comic-book starkness that franchise has. It's going for a kind of grounded grimness but ends up just feeling dirty. Sex scenes are stitled and awkward beyond even the regular woes of the uncanny valley. Characters posing in underwear doesn't feel romantic or erotic as much as it resembles the intimates section of a Sears catalog–albeit with a rustic, medieval theme. Mods can help with this, though they can also yassify the characters beyond all recognition or render DA:O aesthetic far afield from its creators' original intentions.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, despite these shortcomings, DA:O engages with sex in a way that is rare for games of its size and budget. Outside of a couple moments, Baldur Gate's 3 is interested in sex and romance as a vector for character arcs (good!) and as plain wish fulfillment (bad! <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/josh-sawyer-doesnt-like-baldur-gate-3-style-romances-and-thats-part-of-why-he-doubts-a-new-pillars-of-eternity-would-be-a-hit-i-feel-like-im-kind-of-out-of-touch-with-that-audience/" rel="nofollow ">Josh Sawyer shares my assessment</a>). Despite some standout moments in Cyberpunk 2077 (Judy Alveraz's set of side quests are perhaps the best romance of their kind in video games, period), it is also largely juvenile. The streets of Night City are plastered with annoying and tasteless ads, not provocative as much as silly.</p><p dir="ltr">To be sure, there are bright spots. Games like Disco Elysium and Pentiment don't feature the traditional mode of video game romance, but are plugged into their respective worlds' sexual mores and practices. Nevertheless, even in its crassness, its ugliness, Dragon Age: Origins took steps towards a more adult landscape. I can't help but feel that AAA games have regressed since.</p>

At the beginning of this year, after more than a decade as a creator, he decided to open a coffee shop. And still keep being a creator. Somehow.</p><p>I spent an hour with David talking about all this, which turned into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/20/24273515/coffee-check-david-cogen-unlockr-vergecast"><strong>a really fun episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></strong></a>. But I left David still wondering how he balanced it all —&nbsp;and wondering what I might be able to tell about his priorities from his homescreen. So I asked him to share!</p><p>Here’s David’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:</p><p><strong>The phone: </strong>Pixel 9 Pro. I always switch fully into whatever phone I am making a video about, and as I am very behind on reviews (see the <em>Vergecast</em> episode for more on that), that’s the next one on the docket.</p><p><strong>The wallpaper: </strong>The one that comes on the phone by default. I switch phones so often that I usually don’t change the wallpaper unless it’s obnoxious. In that case, I’ll still grab something minimalistic from Google’s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wallpaper&amp;hl=en_US"><strong>Wallpapers</strong></a> app (maybe a landscape to remind me what outside looks like).</p><p><strong>The apps: </strong>Spotify, Phone, Gmail, Chrome.</p><p>I generally have the multiple-clock widget, as it automatically shows me my current time and time back in NYC, which I find incredibly helpful while traveling as much as I do. Otherwise, the tools section has <a href="https://www.notion.com/product"><strong>Notion</strong></a>, which I’m a heavy user of after Evernote got worse and worse over time — it has replaced that, along with Airtable.&nbsp;</p><p>That folder has since expanded recently thanks to the coffee shop as I now have <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.joinhomebase.com%2F"><strong>Homebase</strong></a> for scheduling my baristas, <a href="https://www.poplin.co/"><strong>Poplin</strong></a> to get our cleaning rags picked up and delivered, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopify.com%2F"><strong>Shopify</strong></a> for inventory / POS / sales / obsessive data analyzing, <a href="https://ring.com/"><strong>Ring</strong></a> for all the cameras in the space and to make sure milk deliveries show up on time in the middle of the night (we use a service called <a href="https://odeko.com/"><strong>Odeko</strong></a>, which has a key and brings supplies in / puts the milk in the fridges for us), and <a href="https://www.peerspace.com/"><strong>Peerspace</strong></a> to make sure I can respond to inquiries to rent out the back space.</p><p><em>I also asked David to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back:</em></p><div><ul><li>Probably comes as no surprise, but coffee. Particularly, I’m going to start roasting<strong> </strong><a href="https://coffeecheck.nyc/"><strong>in the coffee shop</strong></a> soon and so I’m looking forward to sourcing beans from various places, getting better at roasting those beans, and tweaking roasts to get different flavors out of them.&nbsp;</li><li>I’m also wanting to take more classes and attend more coffee events to try and learn more about the coffee world and what people in that world are also experimenting with. And eventually figuring out how to balance these two worlds of coffee and YouTube but, you know, first things first.</li></ul></div><p><h3>Crowdsourced</h3></p><p><em>Here’s what the </em>Installer<em> community is into this week.

It came down to <a href="https://brave.com/"><strong>Brave</strong></a> and <a href="https://vivaldi.com/"><strong>Vivaldi</strong></a> to try as a daily driver for a while, but I’ve settled on Vivaldi. Loving it. It is much snappier than the last time I tried it, plus it has the advantage of Chrome extensions and plenty of customization while locking down privacy.

The way that you get sucked into the characters and that every book builds on the previous ones, it has become one of my favorite series that I can’t recommend enough.” – Travis</p><p><h3>Signing off</h3></p><p>It’s Election Day on Tuesday! Wild, important, fascinating, terrifying, causing me to feel a lot of feelings.

        <p>"That attitude has remained consistent throughout my works and in Slitterhead."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Slitterhead creator Keiichiro Toyama says that he and the team at Bokeh Game Studio are committed to "originality", even if that comes at the cost of a game being "a bit rough around the edges".</p>
<p>Toyama - who created <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gravity-rush">Gravity Rush</a>, Silent Hill, and the terrifying Siren series - hasn't released a new game since 2008's Siren: Blood Siren, making this week's launch of Slitterhead especially exciting for horror fans.</p>

<p>Talking to <a href="https://gamerant.com/slitterhead-horror-game-like-silent-hill-toyama/">GameRant</a>, Toyama stressed that he has always fought to ensure that his games feel fresh and unique above all else.</p>
<p>"From the very first Silent Hill, we have maintained a commitment to freshness and originality, even if it means being a bit rough around the edges," Toyama said.</p>
<p>"That attitude has remained consistent throughout my works and in Slitterhead."</p>
<p>Quite what, exactly, Toyama thinks is "rough" about Slitterhead remains to be seen, but thankfully, we don't have to wait long - the highly-anticipated action horror is out later this week, coming to PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 4, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 8th November 2024.</p><p>Slitterhead was first announced back in 2021. We first got a good look at it last summer, when a developer diary revealed new details about its inaugural title, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterheads-unique-mechanics-include-a-playable-dog">including a sneaky peek at some of the game's enemies, abilities</a>, and - surprise! - the ability to play as a dog, something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterheads-release-date-and-trailer-have-popped-up-online">reprised in leaked footage in June</a>, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
