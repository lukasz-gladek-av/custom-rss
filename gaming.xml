            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you’re into anime, chances are you’ve watched Solo Levelling. It’s been one of the best shows of recent years – albeit one that’s a massive power fantasy, but then, aren’t they all? One of the most anticipated RPGs of next year, Solo Levelling: Arise Overdrive, looks to bring that power fantasy to life in stellar fashion, and publisher Netmarble will certainly be pinning a lot of their hopes on its success. Things are definitely looking good though, and in preparation for the game’s appearance at TwtichCon San Diego in the US, the developers have dropped a brand new gameplay trailer showing off some of the game’s combat features.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE] Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-DbLH3OKvBc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Solo Levelling centres on Sung Jin-Woo, the weakest hunter in a world where hunters fight off otherworldly threats. After an encounter in a mysterious dungeon, Sung Jin-Woo discovers that he’s become a ‘player’, experiencing the world like a video game, and able to grind and improve his hunter level – something that should be impossible. What’s great about the series is that he spends the first couple of series hiding these newfound abilities, but there’s definitely the sensation that things might take a turn for the worse in the near future, as he gets more and more powerful.</p>
<p>There’s lots of levelling up and fighting off fantastical creatures in Solo Levelling, so it’s little surprise to see Arise Overdrive focusing on that. As it’s a series based on the idea of a world that’s being experienced like a video game, it’s a perfect match, and one which I can see Netmarble doing a good job with. Combat looks swift and flashy, and there’s definitely some similarities to be found with Square Enix’s Final Fantasy XVI, taking on huge creatures with melee weaponry and visually impressive special moves. </p>


<p>Solo Levelling: Arise Overdrive is due to launch on November the 17th for PC via Steam and Xbox Series consoles. If you fancy checking the game out before that at Twitchcon San Diego, that’s going to run over this weekend, from the 17th to the 19th of October. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> has some tough-as-nails fights, especially if you’re coming to the strategy RPG formula for the first time. <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster</a> ups the ante with a new Tactician difficulty mode that stacks the odds even more against your burgeoning squad of heretical recruits. As someone who’s played the game a dozen times before, I love the new layer of challenge even if some of the encounters kicked my ass.</p> <p>Importantly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228"><em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> adds</a> some helpful features for navigating the game’s underlying difficulty. Unlike in the original, it’s generous with auto-saves and lets you flee any battle at any time. No more getting trapped in multi-encounter missions with no other save files to escape to. You can also dial the difficulty up or down throughout the campaign and, like in the original, every story mission <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-guide-xp-jp-grind-tips-2000633724">lets you over-level</a> if you’re diligent enough.</p>

 <p>Even so, some of these fights get tricky! Here’s my ranking of the toughest battles in<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em> and some tips for how to beat them.</p> <h2>10. Dorter Slums</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636206" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636206"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636206">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> It’s early in the game, your characters are probably under-developed, and the map layout heavily advantages the enemy, which includes an Archer high up and two Black Mages. Most kick-ass battle music in the whole game, though.</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> The easiest strategy is to have Ramza hang back and use Focus a couple of times until he’s able to move in and take out one of the Black Mages in a single hit. Make sure he has battle boots and Move +1 equipped. A fully outfitted Knight to tank damage is useful but you can really get away with just Chemists and Squires as long as you focus on staying healed until Ramza can go on a rampage.</p>

 <h2>9. Fovoham Windflats</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636209" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636209"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636209">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> Any fight against a character with Holy Knight abilities is bullshit, and the game throws this one at you super early. Wiegraf can immediately take your party down to critical HP if they stay bunched up, and his backup will start killing you from there.</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it: </strong>This is the one battle I’ve never tried to beat without cheese. Just make sure you have at least a couple of ranged attackers and Ramza (preferably as a Monk) is able to get one hit on Wiegraf before dying. Focus exclusively on him until you get him to flee.</p>

 <h2>8. Finnath Creek</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636202" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636202"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636202">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> This is the first time you see a Red Chocobo. Cute, right? Not when they start one-shotting your party with ranged Meteor attacks. It doesn’t help that they already have incredible movement range and the river is hard to navigate. Give them even a moment to breathe and the Yellow Chocobos will have them all healed up.</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> Put your party back as far as possible to try and prevent any of them from being hit in the first round. Then prioritize sniping them from afar with Holy, Flare, or actual guns. Have tanky characters move just far enough in front to act as decoys while using X-Potion to keep themselves alive.</p> <h2>7. Ziekden Fortress</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636207" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636207"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636207">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> This fight is great because you finally get to kill Argath. What sucks is he now has Auto-Potion at a point in the game where few of your attacks will be hitting for more than the 30 HP he gets healed. In addition, there are three tanky Knights and two Black Mages. Plus he will pick at you from afar with a crossbow.</p> <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> The battle has you start with characters split between the two sides of the fort but you should just immediately bring the group that doesn’t include Ramza over to the bottom corner of the map where he is. Have Ramza use Focus and hang back. Get an Archer with Jump+1 to climb the tower and use an Aim+3 on Argath and try to lure him in close so you can hit him with a magic attack. Ideally, you can get one of his own Black Mages to target one of your characters and then move them right next to him before it goes off. Once Argath is dead, the battle is over.</p>

 <h2>6. Walled City of Yardrow</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636203" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636203"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636203">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> You meet Rapha during this fight and if she dies you automatically lose. What makes that extra challenging is that it’s very easy for her to die before you even get a turn. Plus there are multiple Ninjas and Summoners to contend with, and a city wall that’s a pain to traverse.</p> <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> Assuming Rapha survives (there’s a chance the Ninja Throw attacks can miss her, so keep resetting if that doesn’t happen), have a Chemist or White Mage heal her up and then hope she runs to the corner and stays out of trouble. A Lancer is good for this fight to scale the walls and block the Ninjas’ attacks. A Summoner can also hit lots of targets as they bunch up near the entrance. Agrias is also clutch in this fight. Just plop her down in front of the entrance to keep the enemies inside and buy yourself some extra time.</p>

 <h2>5. Golgollada Gallows</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636210" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636210"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636210">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> It’s a trap! Not only do you have to fight Gaffgarion and his goddamn self-healing Night Sword attack, you also have to deal with being surrounded by a bunch of enemies including Knights and Archers. But mostly that Night Sword thing.</p> <p><strong>What to do about it:&nbsp;</strong>As with any Sword Magic-based enemy, you can try to burst them down as quickly as possible or just use the Knight’s Sword Break ability to try and destroy his weapon. If it doesn’t work, reset and try again. Eventually you’ll be able to neutralize him within the first few turns. If you don’t want to be a coward you can use Mustadio’s <span id="Arm_Shot">Arm Shot</span> ability to disable him, or the Mystic’s <span id="Hesitation">Hesitation</span> equivalent.</p> <h2>4. Lionel Castle Gate</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636208" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636208"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636208">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard: </strong>Gaffgarion’s back and this time he’s got Ramza trapped on the other side of the gate. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> loves these little duels but they completely subvert the normal strategies the game usually incentivizes. In addition to being stuck in a one-on-one, the rest of your team is thrust into a Summoner meat grinder with basically no cover.</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> If you’re a try-hard you can teach Ramza Teleport and have him simply leave Gaffgarion behind to be dealt with last. You can also use that Weapon Break trick again. Personally, I like to have Ramza as a Monk keep himself healed with Chakra while a Time Mage on the other side of the gate casts Haste on him. Eventually you can either have him get down to open the gate and let everyone else through, or stack enough extra speed with Tailwind to just overpower him. A Summoner with Bahamut or Cyclops can make quick work of the rest of the enemies.</p> <h2>3. Riovanes Castle Roof</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636201" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636201"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636201">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> It’s time to keep Rapha from dying again, only this time she’s in the middle of a brawl with the most busted enemies in the whole game: Celia and Lettie. Before you even get a chance to move, she’ll be near death.</p> <p><strong>What to do about it:&nbsp;</strong>Hopefully you’ve had someone learn Teleport by now. The key is being able to act before she gets killed. Try to get as many of your characters in range to draw the enemy’s attention or use a skill that has a chance of casting Confuse on Celia, Lettie, or Elmdore. Characters with higher speeds get to act first, so having Ninja unlocked on someone helps, as does having a pair of Sprint Boots equipped.</p> <h2>2. Lost Halidom</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636205" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636205"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636205">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> Dragons. So many dragons. Plus they can fly and cast magic. Also two guys with magic guns. And a giant chasm through the middle of the map. RIP.</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> I don’t have much good advice for this one. You can try to rely on Mustadio to keep Barich and his Chemist from being able to act. Dealing with the dragons is still a pain. You can roll a couple of Mediators to try and tame them which will not only absorb a lot of aggro but also dish it back out. One big plus is having a movement skill equipped on Orlandeau so that he can quickly get across the ravine and keep up the attack. Just make sure your characters stay on spots with adjacent squares of the same elevation. This will stop the dragon’s magic attacks from only targeting a single square and increase the chance they miss entirely. Otherwise you’ll be getting one-shot all across the map.</p> <h2>1. Wiegraf and Belias</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636204" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636204"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636204">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:&nbsp;</strong>Another one-on-one fight with Ramza, except this time you can’t escape. Wiegraf will kill most players in two turns, giving you little room to heal and attack him. Plus the fight goes directly into the Belias showdown and Ramza doesn’t get healed in between. Nasty!</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> Not to sound like a broken record but you can try to break Wiegraf’s sword. The Full Restore reactive ability also comes in handy here since he’ll almost always get you down to critical. This will effectively keep you at full health and free you up to just attack him. Ramza Monk is still the best option for this fight. Or if you want to play a game of Chicken, you can go the Thief or Ninja route and keep using the Tailwind Mettle ability plus Haste to slowly raise your speed and start stacking extra turns.</p> <p>Okay, but what about Belias? On Tactician, this is actually the harder part of this two-pronged encounter. It’s the one that gave me the most trouble in my recent playthrough, and I only finally beat it on my ninth try with a bit of luck. Mostly, it came down to a Summoner with Short Charge using Bahamut and wiping out all of Belias’ accompanying Demons in one turn. From there you’ll want to keep whaling on him but keep your party spread out. Once he’s out of magic he’ll start using Petrify so watch out. A Lancer with Jump comes in handy here, as long as the timing syncs up right.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Time to level up.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The November 17 release date on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2373990/Solo_Leveling_ARISE_OVERDRIVE/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive/9mvhcq7cjx01" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Xbox PC</a> for action RPG Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE is quickly approaching, and to celebrate, it will have a booth at TwitchCon in San Diego this week where players can try out a new demo and win special merch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE lets you step into the world of the massively popular Solo Leveling franchise, centering on protagonist Sung Jinwoo. It’s been built for PC and console (it’s scheduled to release on consoles in 2026) and includes the original story along with new adventures that are exclusive to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with the series, it takes place in a world where people with supernatural abilities known as Hunters must protect mankind from a never-ending onslaught of monsters. Usually, Hunters’ abilities and strength level are determined when their powers first manifest. But Jinwoo gets a unique ability: he can level up. So even though he starts off as a low-tier Hunter, he can grow more powerful the more foes he defeats. And now he’s on a personal quest to become the world’s strongest Hunter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It should be pretty obvious why this premise lends itself to a game, it basically already has RPG progression systems baked in. Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE builds on that base with a skill tree that branches into eight different job advancements. Through the course of the webtoon, Jinwoo transforms into the Ultimate Monarch of Shadows, and now you can experience his evolution for yourself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can see in the video above, Jinwoo can switch between weapons and combine basic attacks with flashy special abilities to build up combos. But you can’t just mindlessly attack, you need to keep an eye on enemies and respond to their strikes and AoE attacks. You can execute perfectly timed parries or dodges to cancel out damage and unleash powerful counterattacks to keep the fast pace flowing and combo meter climbing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However you defeat enemies, they’ll drop loot that you can use to craft new weapons, including ones pulled directly from the original webtoon, like Kasaka’s Venom Fang and the Demon King’s Daggers. There are several weapon types available, and your combat style will be determined by your weapon and skill tree choices. That makes for a variety of styles, like in the original story, giving you the opportunity to try out different options and figure out what works best for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll face off against a ton of enemies and bosses solo, but some are too strong for even a leveled-up Jinwoo to deal with. That’s where multiplayer comes in. You can team up in four-player co-op raids to take on commanders that series veterans will recognize, and you can play as Jinwoo or one of the other available Hunters with their own set of unique skills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re interested in seeing more, don’t miss TwitchCon, which starts Friday, October 17 and will be open until Sunday, October 19. The Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE booth is open to the public, so any in-person attendees can come by and try out the demo. And there will be some popular streamers playing the game at the booth (<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/iitztimmy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">iiTzTimmy</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/RDCGaming" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">RDCGaming</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/esfandtv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">EsfandTV</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/agent00" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Agent00</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/extraemily" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">ExtraEmily</a>, and more). The booth will also have activities available, and people who complete them can earn exclusive merch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not able to attend in person, no worries.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-entire-yakuza-franchise-is-on-sale-on-steam-right-now.1327117/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Boy howdy, there sure are a lot of<a href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-the-kotaku-review-1845822473"><em> Yakuza/Like A Dragon</em></a> games to play! Perhaps, like so many others, you’ve been wanting to hop into the elaborate and wild franchise all about Japanese gangsters and bizarre side characters. Well, a big ol’ <em>Yakuza</em> franchise sale, happening now on Steam, might help you finally check out this popular series.</p> <p>20 years ago, in 2005, the very first <em>Yakuza</em> game launched on PS2. Since then, there have been over a dozen entries in the franchise, including remasters, re-releases, spin-offs, and even a weird non-canonical entry featuring zombies. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/LikeaDragonFranchiseSale2025">And (almost) all of those games are currently on sale on Steam</a> as part of a big <em>Yakuza</em> franchise sale that ends on October 23.</p>

 <p>I say almost, because the zombies spin-off, <a href="https://kotaku.com/prepare-to-yakuza-in-2012-with-dead-souls-452566043"><em>Yakuza Dead Souls</em></a>, isn’t included as it has never been ported to PC. The other odd duck here is<em> Yakuza 3 Remastered</em>, which isn’t on sale despite being included in the sales event page. Perhaps Sega made a mistake, and it will be marked down to $11 like most of the other <em>Yakuza</em> games in the sale. Who can say? Regardless, if you’ve been waiting to hop into the <em>Yakuza</em> series, this is a great time to snag a few (or all!) of the games and start enjoying them. As former <em>Kotaku</em> writer Luke Plunkett recommended in the past, <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-yakuza-games-to-play-after-yakuza-0-1792025738">you should probably start with <em>Yakuza 0</em></a> if you’re hopping into the series for the very first time. After that, check out <em>Yakuza</em> <em>Kiwami</em> and <em>Kiwami 2</em>.</p> <p>Here are all the games currently on sale as part of the ongoing <em>Yakuza/Like A Dragon</em> sales event:</p> <ul> <li><em>Yakuza 0</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza Kiwami</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza Kiwami 2</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza 3 Remastered</em> – $20 – Not on sale… I guess??</li> <li><em>Yakuza 4 Remastered</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza 5 Remastered</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza 6: The Song of Life</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza Complete Series</em> Bundle (0-6) – $77 ($140)</li> <li><em>Yakuza: Like A Dragon</em> – $8 ($20)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> – $21 ($70)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</em> -$18 ($50)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon: Ishin!</em> – $12 ($60)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</em> – $33 ($60)</li> <li><em>Judgment</em> – $12 ($40)</li> <li><em>Lost Judgment</em> – $15 ($60)</li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’m very early in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, but I just found something in Lumiose City I had to tell somebody about, or I might explode. The RPG’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-small-boring-map-how-big-time-to-walk-around-2000636148"><span>map is small</span></a><span>, but if you’re not looking in every corner, you might miss a hole-in-the-wall establishment that could enrich the game for you. That’s what nearly happened to me, but luckily, I did stumble upon the Lumiose Museum in the northeast corner of the city.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000636163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636163"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636163">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure>  <p><span>If you’ve played <i>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</i>, you’re gonna want to stop by this place and check out one of this museum’s exhibits. As I passed by, a citizen remarked that it had a showcase of artifacts from the Hisui region, which was enough to make me spin on my heel and beeline into the building. </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>players will know that Hisui is the previous name of the Sinnoh region from </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i><span>, and the historical setting of the last </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game. Anyone who played </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>to the end knows </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-story-dlc-lucas-dawn-ingo-volo-1850415489"><span>it ended on a bittersweet cliffhanger</span></a><span> that seemingly doomed its isekai’d main character and others to a primitive point in history, even while they had friends, family, and Pokémon waiting for them in the present day. However, the Lumiose Museum’s exhibit may give us at least a few details about what happened after </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>’ conclusion.</span></p>

 <p><span>Once you’re there, head to the second floor and you’ll see several familiar artifacts from the Hisui region. There are hieroglyphics of legendary Sinnoh Pokémon, hand-crafted early Poké Balls, and a few outfits previously worn by characters like </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>’ protagonist, the surprise villain Volo, and Commander Kamado, an ancestor of Professor Rowan from </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i><span>. While we don’t see anything belonging to him, one of the displays mentions a man named Ingo who would train people in Jubilife Village in the ways of Pokémon battles, but long-time fans will know that he was much more than that.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636162" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636162"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636162">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Ingo made his debut in </span><i><span>Pokémon Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>as an elite trainer at the Battle Subway alongside his brother Emmet. His appearance in </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span> indicated he’d been shot through time just as the protagonist had been, only to have gradually forgotten his previous life in the modern day. It was an incredibly dark and tragic fate for a Pokémon character, and because </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>ended without either of these displaced trainers going back home, fans have spent the past three years assuming they lived out the rest of their lives in Hisui and never saw their loved ones again. In the case of Ingo, at least, that doesn’t seem to be the case.</span></p>

 <p><span>The diagram of Ingo’s old training grounds has an accompanying text that says Ingo one day “simply vanished” after telling the people of Jubilife that it was “time for [him] to return.” Though we haven’t seen Ingo in any games since, it sounds like he did get to go home to his brother and friends eventually.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636161" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636161"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636161">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The long-lost time traveler isn’t the only character we get an update on in the exhibit. Volo, the ancestor of </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl </span></i><span>champion Cynthia and a surprise religious zealot intent on usurping Arceus’ power for himself, also gets an epilogue of sorts in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. You can find his final boss outfit in a glass case next to statues of legendary Pokémon Palkia and Dialga, and one of the museum’s patrons says that the person who wore it donated it to the exhibit personally. He also apparently looked at some of the sketches on display “with this nostalgic air,” implying that Volo has, somehow, persisted into the modern day. Is he time-traveling? Is he immortal? Will we see his crazy ass again? I have so many new questions.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever happened to Volo and Ingo, it also stands to reason that </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>’ protagonist was likely able to return to the modern day as well, though I haven’t been able to find any direct mention of their whereabouts. Their uniform is on display here, though. So one way or another, history has not forgotten them and what they accomplished in Hisui all those years ago.</span></p>

<p>If a new Nintendo patent is true, we may be seeing DS games on the Nintendo Switch 2 soon.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, the Nintendo Switch 2 has become one of Nintendo’s best-selling consoles. With its catalog growing each month, with the latest being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-preview-the-new-battle-system-could-become-the-new-standard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, there’s a lot to enjoy. For those who pine for the past, the Nintendo Switch Online brings a treasure trove of classic titles from the Game Boy and N64. Even with the most recent addition, Virtual Boy, being outside the box, it seems it may get ever crazier and cooler, thanks to a newly discovered patent.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-ds-games-may-be-next-for-nintendo-switch-online-with-new-patent">Nintendo DS Games May Be Next for Nintendo Switch Online With New Patent</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo DS coming to NSO Confirmed! Patent Discovery of a lifetime! Breaking News! The following patent shows how Nintendo will manage the dual screen situation on Switch 2. You will have 3 options. <br>1. Dual Screen (Parent screen, child screen)<br>2. Single Screen Mode (Picture in… <a href="https://t.co/MH1Ytv4Kfo">pic.twitter.com/MH1Ytv4Kfo</a></p>— Mike Odyssey (@MikeOdysseyYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1978839968895074613?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post from user <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1978839968895074613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MikeOdysseyYT</a>, they discovered a new patent from Nintendo. The images they provided show the Nintendo Switch drawn up to have a second screen show up during gameplay. What’s interesting is that each image correlates to one of the ways you could do a dual screen, like picture-in-picture and dual screen. While it could just be for new mechanics, it’s more than likely that it’s a possible way to bring Nintendo DS titles to the console. </p>



<p>For many, the Nintendo DS was home to dozens of amazing titles and one of the coolest ways to experience a game. If true, it’ll be interesting to see how it plays in action. Most games on the DS used the second screen for a map or, in Pokémon’s case, the action menu. Given it’ll likely be all Nintendo-branded titles, they’ll likely tweak some things here and there to make it look good, much like they did for the other NSO games. As it is a patent, nothing is yet confirmed by Nintendo, so be wary.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Microsoft announced a substantial price increase for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. If you're a subscriber in the US, you will now be charged $30/month, a $10 bump from the previous $20/month rate. The new price is effective immediately, so you may have already paid the increased rate if you were billed already this month. That said, there is a way to avoid the price increase: prepaid codes. The price of prepaid membership codes hasn't changed--at least not yet. Over at Amazon, you can <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 3-Month Membership codes for $55</a></strong> (was $60), which breaks down to $18.33/month. Based on Microsoft's new subscription price, you're <strong>saving $35 across three months</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1-Month prepaid codes are sold for $20</a> at Amazon, so you're saving an additional five bucks every three months with Amazon's deal. Amazon's prepaid codes can be redeemed by existing and new subscribers with a US Xbox account. Once you enter a prepaid code, your next billing date is pushed. So if you redeem a 3-Month Membership in October, you won't be billed again by Microsoft until January.</p><p>The discount on prepaid codes becomes more glaring if you buy multiple. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate can be stacked up to 36 months. For instance, if you were to buy four prepaid 3-Month codes, you'd save $140 on a full year of Game Pass Ultimate. Here's a breakdown of the savings from buying Amazon's prepaid code deal versus subscribing directly through Microsoft. Note: The numbers in the Amazon column are based on the 3-Month Membership deal, but even if the price jumps back to $60, you're still saving a ton of cash.</p><h3>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate: Microsoft Store vs. Prepaid Codes</h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Duration:</th><th scope="col"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Xbox+Game+Pass+Ultimate+Deal+-+Save+%2435+On+3-Month+Membership&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-10-16+12%3A59%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-16+12%3A59%3A20&amp;fnarticle_id=6535504&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.xbox.com%252Fen-US%252Fxbox-game-pass%2523join&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now%2F1100-6535504%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft:</a></th><th scope="col"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Deal:</a></th><th scope="col">Savings:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3 Months</td><td>$90</td><td>$55</td><td>$35</td></tr><tr><td>6 Months</td><td>$180</td><td>$110</td><td>$70</td></tr><tr><td>9 Months</td><td>$270</td><td>$165</td><td>$105</td></tr><tr><td>1 Year</td><td>$360</td><td>$220</td><td>$140</td></tr><tr><td>2 Years</td><td>$720</td><td>$440</td><td>$280</td></tr><tr><td>3 Years</td><td>$1,080</td><td>$660</td><td>$420</td></tr></tbody></table><p>It's unclear how long retailers will stick with the old $20/month rate. Amazon's $55 deal is new this week; earlier this month, Amazon was charging $60. For what it's worth, Amazon has historically held out longer than other retailers when prices have changed in the past. The retailer was selling the 3-Month Membership code for $45 long after Microsoft increased the price of Game Pass Ultimate to $17/month. The latest price change for Game Pass Ultimate is by far the biggest of the three price hikes the service has experienced over the years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to information that wasn’t part of the leaks earlier this week, Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave will have a turn-based battle system. </p>



<p>For those living under a rock, The Pokémon Company and Game Freak have experienced a massive leak, with tons of data about their upcoming games surfacing. We already have an idea about Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story, setting</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mechanics</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-leak-reveals-boss-fight-and-mmo-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boss fight, and MMO details</a>. Now, new details about Gen 10’s battle system have surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-legends-z-a-s-real-time-battle-system-might-not-make-it-to-gen-10-wind-and-wave">Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s Real-Time Battle System Might Not Make it to Gen 10 Wind and Wave</h2>



<p>According to a new post by CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978632737541271993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), some of the information that wasn’t a part of the Teraleak has now surfaced online, revealing details about Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave’s battle system. The post explicitly states that “the game is turn-based,” and if players like the new real-time battle system in Legends Z-A and want it to return for the next mainline instalment, then they should let the devs know. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We have some new information about Pokémon Wind and Wave that wasn't part of the Teraleak documents released this week:</p><p>– The feature to ride all Pokémon has been scaled down significantly<br>– The character bios / story have changed a lot<br>– The game is turn based, if you enjoy the…</p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978632737541271993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The post also discusses another feature from the Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave leaks. The leaks had stated that all Pokémon could be ridden or touched; however, the new update states that the feature to ride all Pokémon has been scaled down significantly. Lastly, there’s another point in the post which states that character bios/story have changed a lot. </p>



<p>In other news, the leaks have also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-games-and-dlc-roadmap-allegedly-revealed-in-new-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed the roadmap</a> for upcoming Pokémon games until 2030. Additionally, did you know that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shinies-dont-disappear-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shinies don’t despawn</a> in Legends: Z-A?

                <p>Earlier this week, Team Cherry <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-stomps-out-more-bugs-adds-dualsense-edge-support/1100-6535403/" data-ref-id="1100-6535403">released a patch</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and now the developer has already dropped a new beta patch that's currently in the works. For now, this update appears to be even smaller than the last patch, with a focus on localization and control issues.</p><p>One of the most notable improvements is that rumble features have now been implemented. The devs also note that they are using a new script with an updated Chinese translation, which will be further refined "based on player feedback." The previous Chinese translation was wildly unpopular and led to the game getting review-bombed. </p><p>Most of the other fixes in this beta patch are fairly minor quality-of-life improvements. The update from earlier this week had more compelling features, including DualSense Edge support. Team Cherry has previously shared a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577">patch to lower Silksong's difficulty</a>, but fans who need additional help making their way through the game may be better served by checking out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-already-has-a-bunch-of-mods-that-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534541/" data-ref-id="1100-6534541">Silksong mods</a> that make it easier.</p><p>The beta patch 1.0.28954 is currently available to Silksong players through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. But it's not automatically added to your game. If you want to opt into the beta patch, you need to follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Right-click the game in your library</li><li>Select Properties</li><li>Go to the Betas tab</li><li>Select the current beta branch option</li><li>Download the new update</li></ol><p>Team Cherry hasn't disclosed its sales figures for Silksong yet, but one analyst suggests that the game has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-already-surpassed-4-2-million-in-sales-report/1100-6534845/" data-ref-id="1100-6534845">surpassed 4.2 million in sales</a> across consoles and PC.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/16/five-quick-tips-to-get-the-most-out-of-pokemon-z-as-early-game/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Look, we know, you just got the game, you don’t want to spend hours reading tutorials. So we won’t keep you long, but here’s a couple of tips to make life easy in a handful of key ways, and set yourself up for success in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>!</p>
<h2><b>Save like you’re quicksaving</b></h2>
<p>The autosave feature cannot be turned off in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, much to the chagrin of shiny-hunters around the world. But fear not, because if you manually save often enough, you can actually get around this… Just bring up the in-game menu with X, and then tap the left bumper for a manual save.</p>
<p>You can save whenever you’re not in battle or motion. Want to attempt a jump off a roof? Save first. Want to catch that annoying Alpha Pokémon? Save first.</p>



<h2><b>Catch Alpha Pokémon the easy way</b></h2>
<p>Alpha Pokémon can be a bit of a pain to get to actually stay in the Poké Ball you throw at them, but what if there was a way to have a second, third or more bites of the apple? Well, did you realise there’s a very brief save window while the Pokémon is stunned?</p>

<p>The trick is to KO all non-Alphas in the area before you tackle the big bad. Then, as soon as you see the dancing stars above its head – the sign that you have reduced its HP to zero – quickly do a manual game save, and <em>then</em> throw a Poké Ball. If you see it pop out of the ball, immediately hit the Switch’s Home button, quit and reload your game. You’ll jump back in right where you left off with a stunned Pokémon waiting for a Poké Ball to bounce off its noggin once again.</p>
<p>Note: we haven’t tried this with shiny Pokémon. Also note: feel free to practise on less important mons so you can get your timing down.</p>
<h2><b>Smash (and spend) those shards</b></h2>
<p>Mega Shards are everywhere in this game, which is great because you’re going to need them! Mega Shards are eventually needed to trade for Mega Stones, with the initial shop’s worth having 3000(ish) Shards’ worth of inventory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can only hold 999 at a time, so as soon as you unlock the shop, you should spend as much as you &nbsp;possible can and then check in your Satchel often to make sure you’re not maxing out.</p>

<h2><b>Don’t worry about missing with your Poké Balls</b></h2>
<p>You don’t have to fret if your aim is a little bit off with your Poké Balls. There’s actually a creeping ninja who follows you around picking up your dropped Poké Balls. You’ll then get to catch up with him at every Pokémon Centre.</p>
<p>He’s a lifesaver, especially when you accidentally lob your last Quick Ball at a Mega Shard because you clipped the wrong button. He doesn’t just pick up simple Poké Balls, but all varieties of Poké Ball (note: we haven’t tried this with a Master Ball).</p>
<p>The one exception is that if your Poké Ball connects and the Pokémon escapes, you don’t get it back, but don’t worry about the ones you simply chuck on the floor for no reason!</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PokemonLegendsZA-absolmegaevolution.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="709379104" data-slb-internal="0" data-slb-group="464874"></a></h2>
<h2><b>Make boss fights easy</b><b></b></h2>
<p>There’s a lot of Rogue Megas you need to fight throughout the course of the game. These are very similar to the boss fights in Arceus in terms of gameplay, except this time you have Pokémon backing you up in Z-A’s take on real-time combat.</p>
<p>You can only really damage Rogue Megas when you have your Pokémon Mega evolved themselves, or are using their Plus Moves. This means your choice of Mega is crucial to your victory.</p>
<p>You know what else is crucial? Not dying! You need to dodge attacks like Patches O’Houlihan is throwing wrenches at you because if you black out (and the boss will actively try to target you), you lose.</p>
<p>But you also need to keep your Pokémon alive. If you see a flood of purple particle effects coming from the enemy, withdraw your Pokémon so it doesn’t take damage from the incoming hail mary. You can then watch your buddy’s Pokémon be needlessly KO’ed, safe in the knowledge you’re smarter than an AI.</p>
<hr>
<p>And those are our five quick tips. Enjoy playing Pokémon Legends Z-A!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has put out its report for which PC and console games in September 2025 led the industry in terms of revenue and monthly active users. Unsurprisingly, EA Sports FC 26 sat at the top of the charts in terms of revenue, though curiously it didn't even crack the top 10 for monthly active users. Elsewhere, Hollow Knight Silksong beat out one of September's major triple-A releases to crack the top 5 on the revenue charts.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-reportedly-hits-10-million-copies-sold/">EA Sports FC 26 at the top of the revenue charts</a>, coming in second was NBA 2K26, followed by Borderlands 4 in third. Fourth place went to Fortnite, which was three spots down from where it was in August 2025, but fifth in the charts was Hollow Knight Silksong, which shows just how impactful and successful a launch the game has had after years of players waiting for it.</p>



<p>Behind Silksong was Counter-Strike 2, and then in seventh place, September's other major triple-A release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">Dying Light: The Beast</a>. Helldivers 2, EA Sports Madden NFL 26, and Valorant round out the rest of the top 10 in terms of revenue in eighth, ninth, and tenth place, respectively.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Newzoo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite EA Sports FC 26 leading the charts in terms of revenue, it was not one of the two EA games that made the monthly active users charts. Those spots were hit by Skate, which made the list in sixth place, and last year's FC game, EA Sports FC 25. It's odd to see EA Sports FC 25 this high on the charts in the same month that EA Sports FC 26 came out, but that's likely due to the fact that FC 26 only had four days in September to rack up user numbers, since it came out on September 26.</p>



<p>The rest of the monthly active users charts largely remained the same, with Skate being the only new game to make the list, and the other nine shuffling around in the top 10. Fortnite and Call of Duty stayed in their same spots at number one and number two, while Helldivers 2 found its way back into the list by hitting the number nine spot, thanks in part to its arrival on Xbox in August.</p>



<p>Outside of the top 10, No Man's Sky jumped 34 spots in terms of monthly active users to 18th, thanks to its new Voyagers update, and in regard to revenue, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">Hades 2</a> made the top 20 at number 20, thanks to its 1.0 launch last month. </p>



<p>Here's Newzoo's full overview for the top games on PC and consoles for September 2025:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Sales Top 7m in First Week]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>has enjoyed the franchise's biggest launch to date, having sold over seven million copies since launching last week.</p>

<p>In a press release, EA says that the latest entry in the long-running first-person shooter series "hit all-time highs for franchise sales during the first three days of launch", confirming the aforementioned sales figure, as well as the game's "172 million matches played online" <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">in that weekend</a>.</p>

<p><em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>franchise general manager Byron Beede says this is "just the beginning" for the game, with the first season just twelve days away. For his part, executive VP Vince Zampella expresses his "sincere gratitude" to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>fans while also looking forward to what's to come "in the weeks ahead".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-sales-7m-soldier.jpg?itok=Xqe9Xcs1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-sales-7m-soldier.jpg?itok=GWWpWQcW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA says&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>has enjoyed the series' best launch yet.</figcaption></figure><p>As for why exactly&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>has been so successful, there could be a number of factors. The fact that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-no-80-pricing" rel="nofollow">won't cost you $80</a>, remaining instead at a far more sensible $70, probably doesn't hurt to begin with.</p>

<p>There has also been a growing discontent with&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>and its range of colorful skins from various different franchises. In the run-up to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s launch, EA promised that the cosmetics it sold for&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>would be more <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sober and realistic</a> than those of its closest competitor.</p>

<p><em>Battlefield 6</em> has also received pretty positive reviews across the board, averaging 83 on Metacritic on both <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/battlefield-6/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/battlefield-6/critic-reviews/?platform=pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> (and 86 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/battlefield-6/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, where EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-xbox-series-s-development" rel="nofollow">put in a little extra effort</a> to ensure the game ran smoothly).</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, it looks like Activision will have to step up its game for the next major&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>release if it wants to compete with a resurgent&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-round-up-switch-2-metacritic-2000635309"><em>Pokémon Legends Z-A,</em></a> the newest entry in the long-running Nintendo RPG franchise, is officially out today on Switch and Switch 2. And while many are excited to hop in and start catching pocket monsters, many fans aren’t happy with <em>Z-A</em>‘s small and boring map, which lacks the environmental variety found in past <em>Pokémon</em> games.</p> <p>While <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A&nbsp;</em>technically didn’t launch until today, October 16, fans have been playing leaked versions of the game for <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leaks-switch-2-image-mega-evolution-2000630717">a few weeks now</a> and have begun sharing their thoughts online about the game’s map, which is the entirety of Lumiose City, located in the Kalos region. This location first appeared in 2013’s <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y.&nbsp;</em>In those games, Lumiose City was just one of many locations included in the large open world. However, in <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142">Z-A</a>,</em> Lumiose City is essentially the entire playspace, and that’s proving to be a disappointing fact for some players.</p>

 <p>Over on the <em>Pokémon</em> subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1o7tmfh/it_takes_less_than_7_minutes_to_run_the/?share_id=JYaiqjNJddNjichD9iq1V&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">a popular post with over 3,000 upvotes claims</a> that you can walk around the entire city in less than seven minutes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-long-does-it-take-to-run-around-the-entire-pokemon-legends-z-a-map-weve-tested-it-and-its-shorter-that-youd-think"><em>Eurogamer</em></a> tested this out and confirmed that, yes, if you sprint around and avoid battles, you can run around the whole circular city in just about six minutes and 20 seconds. Now, a smaller map isn’t entirely a bad thing. Some open worlds don’t need much space to be wonderful. <em>Grand Theft Auto 3</em> feels pretty dang small when you go back to it in 2025, but it packs a lot in its limited sandbox. However,<em> Z-A’s</em> map isn’t just small, it also lacks visual variety. This is demonstrated perfectly <a href="https://youtu.be/Q-HGlHqkd3M">in this short video from YouTuber 101Leafy.&nbsp;</a></p>

  <p>On Reddit and YouTube, you can find comments from players lamenting the small map’s lack of visual variety. For a franchise that used to be about discovering new cities, towns, biomes, and environments, <em>Z-A</em>‘s focus on one city, filled with reused buildings and props, is disappointing to many. And while some of the complaints are clearly from fans who have long been done with the series but can’t stop torturing themselves, the more you look at screenshots and videos of <em>Z-A</em>, the more it becomes clear that, yeah, there ain’t much here.</p> <p>At least if you buy the game on Switch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-switch-2-comparison-framerate-upgrade-2000635404">it mostly looks the same as the Switch 2 version</a>. Don’t worry, everyone gets to enjoy the same copy-pasted buildings regardless of their platform of choice. That’s nice.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It appears that the development of Project Ethos will move forward as 2K has hired a new studio head at developer 31st Union. According to a report from Variety, Ben Brinkman has been hired away from Respawn Entertainment to lead the game.</p>



<p>Brinkman comes in to replace former 31st Union president Michael Condrey, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-fires-31st-union-president-after-project-ethos-poor-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who was fired back</a> in February.</p>



<p>A memo to staff, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/project-ethos-update-31st-union-ben-brinkman-1236553878/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">acquired by Variety</a>, from 2K President David Ismailer called the community feedback to Project Ethos “enlightening.”</p>



<p><strong>“It affirmed the promise of a roguelike shooter but told us we still had work to do,” it continued. “It uncovered the need for a more distinct identity. It’s been inspiring to see how far you’ve come. You took the feedback to heart and reimagined Project ETHOS with a renewed vision – one that’s poised to deliver on its promise to our players. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“Our confidence in Project ETHOS grows every day. To further the incredible progress you’ve made, I’m excited to welcome Ben Brinkman as the new Studio Head of 31st Union. After several months of conversations, Ben officially joins us on Monday, October 20.”</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned, Brinkman comes to 31st Union from Respawn, where he served as an executive producer on Apex Legends since 2020. Before joining Respawn, Brinkman was a producer at Activision and Treyarch, working on the Call of Duty franchise since 2008. He’s been in the industry since the late 1990s, with other stops at EA and 2K over 20 years ago.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/16/battlefield-6s-conquest-matches-are-getting-shorter-patch-notes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-conquest-matches-are-getting-shorter-in-first-balance-tweaks.1326985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Even with the barnstorming launch success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, the multiplayer side of Battlefield Studios, led by DICE, are already starting to tinker with the game’s balance alongside early bugfixing patches.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o809hi/battlefield_6_update_1016/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=Battlefield&amp;utm_content=t3_1o6uuwp">Update 1.0.16 is now live</a>, described as, “This minor Quality of Life update focuses on backend stability to help us prepare ahead of the upcoming Battlefield 6 Season 1 update.”</p>


<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o76u27/bfcomms_update_on_bullet_damage_registration_1510/">A hotfix</a> has also been applied to try and address inconsistent bullet damage registration.</p>
<p>However, the more significant change is a shift to Conquest mode, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7bxf9/bfcomms_conquest_ticket_count_update_1510/">reducing the starting ticket count from 1000</a> to as low as 700, depending on the map.</p>
<p>“We’ve reduced the starting ticket count across all Conquest maps so matches finish at a more natural pace,” the team explains. “Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets. We’ll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right.”</p>

<p>The ticket counts are now as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Empire State from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Liberation Peak From 1000 to 800</li>
<li>Manhattan Bridge From 1000 to 800</li>
<li>Operation Firestorm From 1000 to 700</li>
<li>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700</li>
</ul>
<p>This has led to no small amount of consternation amongst fans on Reddit,&nbsp;<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7wtxs/700_tickets_on_operation_firestorm_is_a_crime/">causing </a><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o87ap7/change_the_tickets_back_to_1000/">uproar</a> in the game’s<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o84gyu/revert_ticket_count_back_to_1000_in_conquest/"> vocal community</a>, who are calling for the change to be reverted. It comes alongside some broader critiques and preferences for a slower pace of game again, shifting back toward &nbsp;the pace of older titles, and for larger maps that are less infantry and city warfare focussed – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/">something I noted in our review</a>. It’s possible that DICE will revert or rebalance this again given the pushback, but with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/16/battlefield-6-races-to-franchise-record-7-million-sales-in-first-weekend/">7 million copies sold</a> and so many more players than the franchise has ever had before, they have a vast wealth of telemetry to call upon to back up their judgment.</p>
<p>Really it’s a call of whether they actually need to make this change. Are they seeing people drop out of games before they’ve concluded? Are players actually sticking through to the end regardless because they’re having fun? After all, back in the day, players would gladly log in for vastly inflated ticket count grind fests on Operation Locker and stuff, so there’s no doubt appetite for longer matches amongst series veterans.</p>
