            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-runtime-fee-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unity has announced that it's canceling its controversial runtime fee policy, reverting instead to a seat-based subscription service while also increasing prices for Pro and Enterprise customers.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a blog post</a> on the official Unity website, company CEO Matt Bromberg says the decision to cancel the runtime fee was made "after deep consultation with our community, customers, and partners".</p>
<p>Bromberg goes on to say that his company's mission to "democratiz[e] game development" can't be achieved if the company is "in conflict with our customers", and that price increases, while necessary, "needn't come in a novel and controversial new form".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unity-runtime-fee-canceled-ui.jpg?itok=yOSdLhYX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unity-runtime-fee-canceled-ui.jpg?itok=MwT-QOpr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Unity is canning its controversial runtime fee policy.</figcaption></figure><p>Unity Personal, the lowest tier of Unity's pricing model, "will remain free", and the revenue and funding ceiling will be doubled from $100,000 to $200,000. Additionally, the Made with Unity splash screen will be optional for games made using Unity 6, which <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/introducing-unity-6-the-next-major-release-of-unity/933629" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launches later this year</a>.</p>
<p>Things are a little different for the Pro and Enterprise models, however. Pro subscriptions will jump by 8% to $2,200 per year, effective from January 1st, and if your game has more than $200,000 in revenue and funding, you'll need to use this tier.</p>
<p>The Enterprise tier, meanwhile, is for customers with more than $25 million total revenue and funding. The price of this tier will jump by 25%, but Blomberg says he and his company will contact customers on this tier in the next few days "to discuss customized packages".</p>
<p>Unity says it'll return to this pricing structure every year to decide whether it needs to be increased or not, but that if the Editor changes "in ways that impact you", you can keep using the previous version "as long as you keep using that version".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-builders-journey-unity.jpg?itok=O0Za3oRK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-builders-journey-unity.jpg?itok=tWzde9zN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Unity has been used to create all kinds of games, including&nbsp;<em>Lego Builder's Journey</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what Unity's controversial runtime fee is (or was), it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-developers-outraged-after-major-pricing-change">a policy announced</a>&nbsp;last year that charged developers based on the number of installed copies of their game.</p>
<p>As you can probably imagine, indie developers reacted with outrage;&nbsp;<em>Garry's Mod&nbsp;</em>developer Garry Newman estimated that he'd have paid the engine "about $410k more" for&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>, for instance, while indie dev legend Rami Ismail said the changes made developing in the ecosystem "a straight-up financial risk" on a number of levels.</p>
<p>Unity quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-apologizes-for-confusion-and-angst-due-to-runtime-fee-policy-promises-changes">apologized for the "confusion and angst"</a> it had caused developers, promising changes to the policy, which it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-announces-revised-pricing-policy-following-massive-backlash-from-developers">announced a few days later</a>. Those changes didn't scrap the runtime fee, but they did make it a little less punitive for smaller developers.</p>
<p>The controversy saw then-CEO John Riccitello <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-after-runtime-fee-controversy">stepping down from the company</a>, and Unity subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-layoffs-core-business">laid off a huge number of workers</a> in January this year. That move may or may not be related to the runtime fee controversy, but said controversy certainly can't have helped.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if these changes restore trust in Unity among the developer community. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eu-organization-says-premium-currency-is-purposefully-tricking-gamers.979218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/eu-organization-premium-currency-complaint<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An EU consumer watchdog organization has submitted a complaint to EU authorities regarding the use of premium currency in games, which the organization says "maximizes consumers' spending" and constitutes "manipulative spending tactics".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/consumer-groups-denounce-video-games-manipulative-spending-tactics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release summarizing the complaint</a>, BEUC (Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs, otherwise known as the European Consumer Organization) says games like&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>engage in "unfair practices" via their premium currency systems.</p>
<p>The group's director general,&nbsp;Agustín Reyna, says the group has "identified numerous cases where gamers are misled into spending money", and that "deceptive practices must be stopped". BEUC is calling on the EU to "ensure that traders play by the rules" and provide safe environments for gamers and children.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eu-premium-currency-complaint-beuc-minecraft.jpg?itok=EZolaEL6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eu-premium-currency-complaint-beuc-minecraft.jpg?itok=_440aACX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>is one of the games BEUC says is engaging in unfair practices with regards to spending.</figcaption></figure><p>BEUC says it's identified four main problem areas with regards to premium currency in gaming.</p>
<p>The first is that consumers "cannot see the real cost of digital items" when premium currency is sold in bundles or the price of the currency is not transparent. The group therefore recommends all in-game purchases be displayed in real-money terms.</p>
<p>According to the group, companies that claim players prefer in-game currency "are wrong"; BEUC says its data shows consumers "find this unnecessary step misleading" and would prefer simply to use real money for their purchases.</p>
<p>Third, BEUC says consumers "are often denied their rights" when making premium currency purchases, and that publishers often tie these purchases to "unfair terms favoring game developers".</p>
<p>Finally, the group says children are "even more vulnerable" to the unfair practices it's complaining about. It points to data showing that children in Europe make around&nbsp;€39 worth of purchases per month in games (that's about $43).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-eu-complaint-premium-currency-beuc.jpg?itok=n6j5dFz6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-eu-complaint-premium-currency-beuc.jpg?itok=PFHBEn7X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sorry,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, but you're in BEUC's crosshairs as well.</figcaption></figure><p>BEUC's full report makes a number of recommendations to combat this problem, including assessing a potential ban on premium currency sale for in-game and in-app purchases, as well as "stricter transparency requirements" in EU consumer law and "stronger consumer protection and regulation".</p>
<p>If this seems like a waltz we've danced before, that's because it is, specifically with regards to predatory practices implemented with systems like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/uk-asa-loot-boxes-ea-jagex-miniclip">loot boxes</a>, microtransactions, and battle passes.</p>
<p>In-game monetization, especially in single-player games, is becoming a dirty term among players, leading to games like&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-no-microtransactions">pledging not to include any</a>&nbsp;(although that doesn't stop games like&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-capcom-statement">locking features behind microtransactions</a>, bizarrely).</p>
<p>If you'd like to, you can read BEUC's <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/sites/default/files/publications/BEUC-X-2024-061_Monetising_play_Regulating_in_game_and_in_app_premium_currencies.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full report here</a>. Of course, it's not legally binding right now; it remains to be seen whether EU authorities will make changes based on this report or not, but its conclusions are pretty compelling.

<p>It’s been more than one year since the launch of Starfield, and we’re finally getting the game’s first story expansion pack. It’s a big one, delving into the mysteries of Va’ruun, with countless new locations and mechanics to explore. For those excited about the prospect of more space exploration, here is everything we know about Starfield Shattered Space!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-shattered-space-release-date">What is the Shattered Space Release Date?</h2>



<p>You don’t have to wait long to play the first Starfield expansion; Shattered Space launches on <strong>September 30</strong>. As far as we know, there is no advanced access for buying the expansion early, so everyone who purchases the DLC will receive it on the same day.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-shattered-space-cost">How Much Does Shattered Space Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you purchase Shattered Space separately, it costs <strong>$29.99</strong>. However, buying the Starfield Digital Premium Edition for $99.99 includes the expansion and a few other in-game goodies, including the soundtrack and cosmetic weapon skins. If you previously bought the Premium Edition, you <strong>do not need to buy</strong> Shattered Space again! It will be automatically added to your library on release!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-shattered-space">How Big is Shattered Space?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bethesda hopes to reignite the fan base with its first Starfield expansion by offering an expansive story to explore. Shattered Space includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>More than 50 all-new locations across Va’ruun’kai</li>



<li>Brand-new grenades, which you can now craft</li>



<li>Additional enemies and creatures, such as Redeemed and Vortex Horrors</li>



<li>The return of the Zealots, Spacers, and Crimson Fleet</li>
</ul>



<p>That said, it’s unclear precisely when the expansion will take place in the game. It appears that Va’ruun’kai is an end-game planet meant for high-level characters with considerable time in the game. If that’s the case, it will prevent many new players from accessing the content straight away. Surely, however, Bethesda thought of that.</p>



<p>In any case, Shattered Space is a story-based expansion, though as you can see from the 50 new locations promised, it’ll offer considerable exploration opportunities, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-will-shattered-space-be">How Long Will Shattered Space Be?</h2>



<p>There are no official confirmations from Bethesda regarding the length of Shattered Space. However, some estimates place it between 7 to 10 hours to complete. You can stretch out your time in the new content by exploring all 50 unique locations, the entire planet of Va’ruun’kai, and interacting with every new character. But if you solely want to focus on the story content, I would estimate around 8 hours. I could be wrong, and I’ll happily eat my words and update this piece once we know more!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-shattered-space-available-on">What Platforms is Shattered Space Available On?</h2>



<p>Like the base game, Shattered Space will launch on PC and Xbox Series X|S. There’s still no word on whether Starfield is coming to PS5, and it’s doubtful they will backport the game to Xbox One or PS4.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-shattered-space-the-last-expansion-for-starfield">Is Shattered Space the Last Expansion for Starfield?</h2>



<p>No! At least, we certainly hope not. Previously, Todd Howard said they intend to release annual story-based expansion packs for Starfield well into the future to extend the game’s lifespan. They didn’t want to leave everyone hanging for a decade, like with Skyrim, while awaiting their next major release.</p>

To ensure this never happens, a Distillery is being added to the game along with a recipe for Molotov cocktails, as well as Bazookas (a new raid weapon which will replace the old boring grenade launchers).</li><li><strong>Watery Resources</strong> – Platforms have appeared on the water’s surface. No one really knows where they came from, but ducks can gather supplies from them.</li><li><strong>Dynamic NPC Behavior</strong> – The human NPCs (Non-Plumed Characters) will become smarter, faster to act and more aggressive.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="DUCKSIDE | Everything new In the FINAL beta | Early Access Release Date" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CE8epjJo6w0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ahead of its launch next month, Sony has revealed a few more details on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/until-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-616356">Until Dawn</a> remake's PC release, including its system requirements and recommended specs. Similar to the PC ports of other PlayStation Studios games, Until Dawn will benefit from advanced graphical features, customizability, and accessibility features. Developer Supermassive Games has designed the remake to run on a variety of PC configurations, with presets ranging from a 720p 30fps mode that uses low graphical settings, up to a 4K 60fps mode.</p><p>For the least-demanding presets, you'll be able to experience the interactive horror game with an Nvidia GeForce 1660 or a Radeon RX 470 graphics card. If you're aiming for a consistent 1080p 60fps experience, you'll need to have a GeForce RTX 2060 or Radeon RX 6600XT GPU installed and at least 16GB of RAM. For anyone looking for a stable 4K 60fps mode using very high presets, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/until-dawn-pc-features-and-specs-revealed-out-october-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Supermassive recommends</a> a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti or a Radeon RX 6900XT GPU.</p><h2>Until Dawn PC Minimum and Recommended Specs</h2><hr><table dir="ltr"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Preset</strong></td><td><strong>Low</strong></td><td><strong>Medium</strong></td><td><strong>High</strong></td><td><strong>Very high</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Average performance</strong></td><td>720p 30fps</td><td>1080p 60fps</td><td>1440p 60fps / 4K 30fps</td><td>4K 60fps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i7 4790K / AMD Ryzen 5 1500X (or similar processor with AVX support)</td><td>Intel Core i5 8600 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</td><td>Intel Core i5 8600 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</td><td>Intel Core i7 11700K / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 / Radeon RX 470 (or equivalent card with minimum 6GB VRAM)</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 6600XT</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800XT</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti / AMD Radeon RX 6900XT</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>8GB RAM</td><td>16GB RAM</td><td>16GB RAM</td><td>16GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>70GB on SSD</td><td>70GB on SSD</td><td>70GB on NVMe</td><td>70GB on NVMe</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10, 11</td><td>Windows 10, 11</td><td>Windows 10, 11</td><td>Windows 10, 11</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><p>The common thread between all the available graphical options is that you'll need an SSD with 70GB of storage capacity available--and an NVMe one specifically for the higher graphical presets--a fairly large amount of space but thankfully <em>much </em>less demanding than the chunk of storage that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-specs-revealed-along-with-hefty-storage-requirement/1100-6525645/" data-ref-id="1100-6525645">God of War Ragnarok will require</a>. If you've got the hardware to support the game, Supermassive says you can expect ultrawide monitor support, cinematic aspect ratios, a curated set of ray-tracing features, and both upscaling and frame-generation support through Nvidia DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.1.</p><p>Full DualSense controller support on PC will also be available, and Supermassive says you'll be able to feel the heartbeat of the characters during intense sequences alongside several other haptic feedback features.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawn-remake-is-out-october-4-puts-it-on-collision-course-with-silent-hill-2/1100-6525780/" data-ref-id="1100-6525780">Out on October 4</a> for PS5 and PC, Until Dawn is a remake of the 2015 game and features a substantial number of changes to make the game feel more cinematic in nature. Remade entirely in Unreal Engine 5, the game features updated character models, environments, interactable props, visual effects, and animations. Supermassive has also upgraded its gore effects, as the game features "realistic real-time fluids" and more convincing injuries for its cast.</p><p>This is just one of several horror games launching in October, and fans of the genre can also play the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-will-let-you-turn-off-ui-apply-old-school-90s-filter/1100-6526267/" data-ref-id="1100-6526267">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-quiet-place-game-finally-revealed-and-it-looks-terrifying/1100-6524309/" data-ref-id="1100-6524309">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadows-of-the-damned-is-getting-remaster-12-years-after-it-was-released/1100-6514997/" data-ref-id="1100-6514997">Shadows of the Damned remaster</a>.</p>

For example, the widgets include being able to quickly see console storage, Trophies, and battery levels at a glance. For US players, the Welcome Hub will be replacing the current Explore tab. The feature will be gradually released to other regions outside of the US, starting with Japan and select countries in Europe, then the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Players can also change the background of their Welcome hub, and can pick from a variety of preset backgrounds or choose a screenshot from the Media Gallery. Within the next few weeks, the PS5 will let players share party voice chat links on any messaging or social media app. This feature lets players invite their friends to join a party voice chat, even if they're not listed in your friend list of PlayStation Network. By opening the link on their mobile device, the friends can join the party on their PS5 or from PlayStation App.</p><p>Back in July, Sony was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ps5-beta-update-adds-adaptive-charging-remote-play-settings-and-more-3d-audio-options/1100-6525257/" data-ref-id="1100-6525257">testing some other features</a>, such as a personalized 3D audio profiles, individual remote play options, and adaptive controller charging. Now, those features are rolling out globally today. It's also important to note that the adaptive controller charging feature is only available for PS5 Slim and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">newly announced PS5 Pro.</a></p>

The change isn't happening in a vacuum. Unity is also raising prices on Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscriptions, and according to CEO Matthew Bromberg, it's part of a plan to "become a fundamentally different company."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's a bold statement for the chief executive of a publicly-traded firm to make.

Bromberg deployed a version of that line in that conversation, saying the company needs to "be better at listening" in the future.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-is-killing-its-controversial-runtime-fee" target="_self">Exclusive: Unity is killing its controversial Runtime Fee</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Runtime Fee reversal is an outcome of that process, he said. He apparently spent his first 100 days at the company speaking with Unity customers, which include the popular Unity game engine and its affiliated marketing and monetization platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When pressed about feedback from employees, many of whom reportedly raised concerns internally about the impact of the Runtime Fee and how it could hurt Unity users, Bromberg said the same listening process has been taking place inside the company. He said this decision followed a cross-functional group of employees weighing in on where the company should go.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He also acknowledged ongoing concerns about Unity's stability and tech debt, a growing concern among developers frustrated by Unity's rising prices while still experiencing quality-of-life issues with the engine. He said a key goal for Unity is to make a "stable, well-performing" product that will make the company a better "partner" for developers who use it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some, like Godot cofounder Juan Linietsky, have pointed out to Game Developer that Unity's IPO-driven acquisition spree saddled the company with new tools it would be responsible for maintaining for high-value customers. Bromberg said Unity has also been looking at that challenge, and referred to its decision to to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-is-eliminating-265-jobs-and-terminating-weta-fx-partnership">end its partnership with Weta FX</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as one example of how it can ease the technical load it had taken on (here, with the cost of 265 jobs).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There is progress we can make on integrating some of the capabilities those acquisitions provided into our core flow of game building," Bromberg said. For now, there will be a renewed focus on improving and maintaining Unity 6 as a reliable game development tool.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unity's shift is also about &quot;getting back to where it began&quot;">Unity's shift is also about "getting back to where it began"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bromberg's description of Unity's future seemed far afield from Riccitiello's promise of making the best "Real-time 3D" (often shortened to RT3D) engine for companies across the world, which implied a future where Unity would be extensively used outside the world of game development. He repeatedly referred to his past experience as a game developer, and painted a picture of the company working closely with developers to give them the tools they needed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity will be doing so with stronger competition. Tools like open-source game engine Godot have become more popular with developers in the last year, with Godot in particular </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.godotes.com/issue-51-almost-there/">biting at Unity's heels</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a leading engine used in game jams.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's unclear what, if anything, Unity will be directly adapting from developers' increased enthusiasm for Godot. Bromberg did say he doesn't take developers' trust for granted, and that the company "wants to get better" to retain that trust.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want everyone to want to use Unity," he said, also acknowledging that the company is in a competitive market and it will need to labor under pressure from competitors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Addressing concerns investors may have about the company not having revenue from Runtime Fee-generated revenue in the future, Bromberg said the "simple, predictable pricing" the company has laid out will provide "more than enough growth" for the company with its pricing model.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity's previous far-reaching promises of game engine growth previously extended all the way to the US government, with the company signing some contracts with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-signs-multi-million-dollar-contract-to-help-u-s-government-with-defense">technology firms</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to provide support for the United States Department of Defense. Developers concerned their use of the engine could in some way support weapons manufacturing or wartime software development have maintained criticism of Unity for making these agreements, largely to little avail.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bromberg held firm on said contracts. "My view in general is that it is not inappropriate for American companies to have business with the American government," he said. Developers might raise their eyebrows at how that comment goes further than the Department of Defense.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The U.S. government aside, Bromberg's pitch seemed squarely aimed at Unity's original customers: the game development community. He and his peers will have a chance to make that pitch next week at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://unity.com/events/unite">Unite 2024 in Barcelona</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where he said he sees a chance to "take a breath, clear the decks, and reconnect" with customers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After two years of conversations with Unity executives, there was another interesting shift in Bromberg's rhetoric worth noting. Previously, Unity execs Marc Whitten and Jim Rearden referred to Unity users as "creators," alluding to a wide range of customers that went beyond game developers. The phrase seemed to align with Riccitiello's established vision of Unity as an "RT3D" tool versus its role as a game development tool.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bromberg didn't use that phrase, going instead back to "developers" and "customers," more generic terms describing those who use Unity. It also doesn't appear in Unity's blog announcing the Runtime Fee reversal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The absence of the term may mean nothing, but it may be one sign Unity is re-narrowing its vision to first and foremost, serve a business focused on making games, not generalized 3D software.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If developers report a better relationship with Unity in the months and years ahead, it will certainly be a sign that Bromberg's strategy is working. The challenge will be—as it long has been—to ensure that strategy us profitable and sustainable for the company, so that sustainability can be a strong foundation for the game development community.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

		<p>The theme parks of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/10/planet-coaster-console-edition-review-ps5-ps4-xbox-one-series-x/">Planet Coaster</a> are ones of pure joy. Here, during our very first hands on with the sequel, the vibes were immaculate, and it’s heartening to find that at least in this crucial way, nothing much has changed. That’s it though, as Frontier are ascribing to the bigger, better, wackier and wetter school of sequel-building, pushing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a> straight to the top of our park-building wish list.</p>
<p><iframe title="Planet Coaster 2 | Gamescom Water Flume Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L_y0yRk00YI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Planet Coaster 2, much like its predecessor, aims to capture the wonderful world of the theme park. Rich Newbold, Game Director sets out, “We wanted to build on the amazing foundations of the first game, allowing players a place to build those amazing dream theme parks and water parks and combine them with the amazing coasters.”</p>
<p>It’s water parks that are the watchword here, and through our hands-on time we focused on the key addition of lots of water-based fun and frivolity. That means lots of pools, lots of waterslides and, somewhat unsurprisingly, lots of changing rooms too. The team had to step in early on to point me in the right direction when all of my theme park visitors were standing aimlessly at the ladder to a particularly tall flume – “They need somewhere to change!” they explained. Once I’d found and placed the relevant building things swiftly became right with the world as my digital visitors could now slip into something a little less concealing, and immediately leap into the nearest pool. Here, a half-naked customer is a happy customer.</p>


<p>Richard says, “We wanted to add that great experience of going to a water park into the game. All of those amazing fun days that the team have had, or people in the community, of going to a water park, and experiencing all those things that water parks have: those big swimming pools with wave machines and jets (which you can build in Planet Coaster 2), the lazy rivers and all the amazing different types of flumes, and all the special pieces that you have on the flumes, have been inspired by the amazing days we’ve had.”</p>
<p>You can customise your rides and features more than ever before here, right down to the individual components of different buildings. If you want to remove a balustrade from a building, or just take the whole roof off, you can, and that’s before you alter the colour of every component or swap out the statue on the top.</p>
<p>Just as with the original, the controls and building tools are straightforward and welcoming for both newcomers and younger players, but if you want to be particular, there’s untold levels of depth to help you craft a park that looks truly incredible. There’s been key improvements to the path tools, with more options to dig deeper into both your control over and the laying of those crucial pathways, ensuring that your visitors can get where they need to, but also that it looks exactly how you envisioned it as well.</p>

<p>Planet Coaster 2 looks simply lovely, and the addition of water-based rides and scenery just pushes things even further. The water sloshing around in each of the pools and pouring out of the flumes looks so inviting that at times you might wish you were actually able to visit the park you’ve created. It’s unequivocally bright, colourful, and characterful, with each of the visitors and the other characters you encounter, captured in the chunky, distinctive style that Frontier have honed over the years.</p>
<p>Structurally, there’s a lot here that’s shared with the original game, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/22/planet-zoo-review/">Planet Zoo</a> as well, with the central campaign taking you through a series of different park scenarios and having you solve a specific set of problems. Our playthrough saw our somewhat hapless colleague caught up in some kind of park-based hazing, with a rival park owner hiring our services in an attempt to show us up. Obviously, we didn’t let that stand, but it was nice to see the light humour still running through the campaign, and providing something a little bit different amongst all of the park building.</p>
<p>And there’s <em>so much</em> park building to do. Outside of the central campaign, there’s the sandbox mode, which is likely where the most dedicated fans will spend most of their time, utilising the never-ending funds they have on tap to make something spectacular and without constraints. We only had a short couple of hours to get our park started, but I was undeniably happy with what I’d been able to make in that space of time.</p>

<p>There’s a bunch of new themes and landscape options, and the Resort and Mythology options let you turn your park into a mini-Olympus (with water slides), or simply your dream vision of a spectacular waterpark. Whichever you choose, Planet Coaster 2 gives you the tools to make it one of a kind.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to get into the nitty-gritty, Planet Coaster 2’s Blueprints mean that you’ve immediately got access to a fantastic set of pre-made rides – many of which have come from the community – so you can still create a sprawling park oasis, but in record time. Richard told us, “There’s those people who really want to get down to the detail, and there’s tools there for that, but the Blueprints are there for people to very quickly get their theme park up and running. But, if you want to, you might want to customise those Blueprints, so they might also be a great first step for people to make a good theme park.”</p>
<p>It’s clear that Planet Coaster 2 comes from a place of love, and Senior Producer Adam Woods picks up on that. “We’re massive theme park fans, and we knew what we wanted to add to the second game, as well as listening to the community. A big shout out to the team, because I think you can see the passion, the enthusiasm, the expertise that comes out in the game, because we’re theme park fans.”</p>

<p>Everything here supports that idea. You just can’t come away from Planet Coaster without a massive grin on your face, humming the cheerful tunes that accompany your park building, while dreaming of your next step on the way to park-building nirvana. You might as well prepare now, as Planet Coaster 2 is going to provide the park-building ride of your life. No judgement if it turns out to be the lazy river.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-13-releases-on-pc-adding-amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-3-support/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Patch 2.13 for Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty is officially being rolled out on PC, adding support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 with Frame Generation. The official Cyberpunk website has the<a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/50818/patch-2-13" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> full list of changes being made</a>, and it will most likely affect those who use mods for their game. This happens in any game, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-optimized-path-tracing-mod-40-performance-improvement/">mods</a> typically end up broken from an update. However, since this update is focused on adding support for AMD FidelityFX as well as Intel Xe Super Sampling, it feels like it'd be unlikely to disturb any mods.</p>
<p>For those who want to know more about how AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 impacts your game, they have made an article that explains it all. In short, it combines image upscaling with frame generation technology so that you can have the smoothest possible gaming experience by generating high-resolution frames at fast frame rates. This option can be enabled or disabled depending on whether you feel your game could benefit from the technology. There is additionally a separate setting to enable FSR Frame Generation.</p>
<p>To be able to use FSR Frame Generation in game, you have to have AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 upscaling enabled. CD Projekt Red has decided to keep support for both FSR 2.1 and FSR 3 so that players have as much flexibility as possible when it comes to choosing the visual quality and performance for their gaming session. The website states, "this allows them to experiment and find what fits their gaming style best."</p>
<p>While AMD FSR 3 is compatible with&nbsp;<span>many different GPUs, other system requirements must be met for it to be able to be utilized. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/technologies/fidelityfx/super-resolution.html#tabs-c1d1ec273c-item-683977caaa-tab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD website</a> has a list of all GPUs that are compatible with it, so you can check whether your rig will be able to utilize the technology</span>.</p>
<p>To get the most out of AMD's FSR 3 capabilities in Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty, it's recommended that the game run at a baseline of 60 FPS. Lower frame rates make visual artifacts more prominent and can cause frame pacing issues if you enable them.</p>
<p>To have the most visually stunning experience, CD Projekt Red also recommends playing on a higher refresh rate monitor (120 Hz and above), as using a lower refresh rate monitor can lead to frame time issues.</p>
<p>If using this technology is something that you want to pursue, making sure your GPU drivers are up to date is imperative. Below are the versions you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD: 32.0.11037.4004</li>
<li>NVIDIA: 556.12</li>
<li>Intel: 32.0.101.5972</li>
</ul>

Now, “The Flappy Bird Foundation Group” will relaunch the game on Android and iOS in 2025.</p><p>But it’s unclear whether the original creator of <em>Flappy Bird</em>, Dong Nguyen, is a part of the game’s relaunch. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to Nguyen with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back. His account on X and the website for his game development company don’t show any recent updates. The Flappy Bird Foundation said it acquired the rights to the game from Gametech, LLC, which isn’t associated with Nguyen.</p><p>Following <em>Flappy Bird</em>’s sudden shutdown in 2014, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones">clones started flooding app stores</a> while companies attempted to snap up its trademark. Even though <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/flappy-bird-creator-bringing-game-back-this-summer-76325/">Ngyuen expressed interest</a> in relaunching the game at the time, Apple’s App Store rules may have prevented him from doing so. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/remove-an-app/#:~:text=Removed%20apps%20can%20only%20be,ID%20can't%20be%20reused.">Under the rules</a>, developers lose ownership of an app’s name when they remove it, and they can’t relaunch it under the same name if another developer is using it.</p><p>Still, as someone who was a big <em>Flappy Bird</em> player back in 2013, I’d love to see the game brought back to life.</p><p>While the new game will feature the original <em>Flappy Bird </em>character, future updates will introduce new game modes, characters, and “massive multiplayer challenges.” The <a href="https://flappybird.org/">new <em>Flappy Bird</em> website</a> shows what we might expect, with a new “rivals” mode where you can challenge 99 other players and another that has you shooting birds through basketball hoops. There are some new characters as well, like “Peng” the penguin, and the rainbow mohawk-sporting “Quirky.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Flappy Bird is making a victorious return to devices worldwide more than a decade after it was pulled offline. In 2014, the app’s creator scrapped the game despite raking in the cash after stating that it was ruining his life. He remarked that it was a serious success, but it wasn’t worth the upkeep.</p>



<p>Following the shutdown, people were spending thousands of dollars on mobile devices that still had the game installed and working, but the craze died off relatively quickly.</p>



<p>Now, the hyper-addictive title is making a grand comeback.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-flappy-bird-is-back">Flappy Bird is Back</h2>



<p>By the end of October, Flappy Bird will be back, landing first on web browsers and then as an iOS and Android application in 2025. It has been pieced together by The Flappy Bird Foundation, which is made up of a squad of fans dedicated to reviving the legendary mobile game. </p>



<p>It took a while, but The Flappy Bird Foundation secured the trademark for the game from Gametech Holdings LLC, per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/10-years-after-it-was-pulled-offline-viral-mobile-game-flappy-bird-is-coming-back" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a report from IGN</a>.</p>



<p>The team is assembling a next-generation version of the game, which’ll include new modes, character customisation, and progression – plus <strong>multiplayer</strong>. Imagine the frustration of competing against your friends in Flappy Bird and having the ability to knock them down out of the sky – it’s sure to shatter friendships.</p>



<p>In a statement, a representative of the team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are beyond excited to be bringing back Flappy Bird and delivering a fresh experience that will keep players engaged for years to come. We have big plans for our little Bird!</p>
</blockquote>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a series of images, the new features were explored, revealing new locations, special modes featuring sports-themed crossovers, and a faithful replication of the original game. </p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the return of Flappy Bird?</p>

Fan modder MerigoldMariobor has found a few lost moments of dialogue from one of The Witcher 3's endings, and has released a new mod that restores a little more closure for Geralt and Ceri.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-mod-restores-cut-endings" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, the ending in the game features a favorable outcome for Geralt and Ciri as he presents her with a sword signifying her status as a fellow Witcher. However, there were two lost moments of dialogue that added more to the scene. First, Ciri finally gets a chance to react to having a Witcher's sword of her own, before she and Geralt make plans to reunite with either Yen or Triss, depending upon whom Geralt is romancing in the game. The video below adds both of those moments back into the narrative.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHcqUeftAoM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="3">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HHcqUeftAoM?start=3" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The final expansion for The Witcher 3, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine-review/1900-6416443/" data-ref-id="1900-6416443">Blood and Wine</a>, seemingly wrapped up Geralt's storyline.

            <p>Ballistic Moon's Until Dawn remake is set to release on PC this October. Ahead of this, the studio has shared its PC requirements for the upcoming teen-horror.</p>
<p>When Until Dawn makes its PC debut, it will boast "advanced graphical features, customisability, accessibility features and run on a wide range of hardware," the studio <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/until-dawn-pc-features-and-specs-revealed-out-october-4/?sf274611440=1">said</a>.

<p>Other features coming to the PC version of Until Dawn include full DualSense controller support, Ultrawide Aspect Ratio and Ray-tracing support (if you have the hardware).</p>
<p>The DualSense's haptic feedback will allow players to feel the characters' heartbeats pulsating through the controller during Until Dawn's Don't Move sequences, adding to the intensity. Additionally, Ballistic Moon said the controller's adaptive triggers will allow players to "feel the weight of [their] choices".</p>
<p>As with Sony's other PC releases such as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc">forthcoming God of War Ragnarök</a>, a PlayStation Network account is required.</p>
<p>Along with PC, Until Dawn is also set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-gets-suitably-spooky-pc-ps5-release-date">release on PlayStation 5 on 4th October</a>. If you didn't play Until Dawn on its original PS4 release, I would recommend giving it a bash. Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-review">Until Dawn review</a> from 2015 called the game "weird, gory and surprisingly moving".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Star Wars Jedi Survivor patch is now live on PC, bringing some welcome performance and quality-of-life improvements</p>
<p>Patch 9 mainly focuses on performance and quality-of-life improvements, introducing framerate improvements for various hardware configurations and fixes for several sources of framerate hitching. The patch also optimizes ray tracing for CPU usage and should now scale better for high-end GPUs.</p>
<p>The new Star Wars Jedi Survivor patch also introduces some quality-of-life improvements, such as an improvement for the "Optimizing Game Files" screen and improvements for mouse and keyboard functionality. Lastly, the patch introduces some bug fixes and removes Denuvo DRM. The full patch notes can be found on the game's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-survivor/patch-notes?isLocalized=true">official website.</a></p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi Survivor is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. The game will launch on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One next week, on September 17th. Learn more about the second entry in the series by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor-cannot-change-the-past/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>While Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a surprise journey when it was first released, the time spent apart hasn’t made Cal Kestis’ adventures any less enjoyable. A similar framework in unfamiliar territories helps to establish Jedi: Survivor as a quality sequel to the original release. Jedi: Survivor still plays it safe in comparison to the prior game. It may be difficult to give Jedi: Survivor full marks for its individuality, but compared to the predecessor focused on Cal’s time as a Jedi Padawan, each title can stand up on its own merits, and Jedi: Survivor polishes up much of the experience as it propels the narrative ever forward on Cal Kestis’ journey to Tanalorr.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infamous-mobile-smash-hit-flappy-bird-returning-this-year.979080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/flappy-bird-returning-this-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>? It's back, in expanded form. The game so addictive it caused its creator to destroy it for fear of what he'd unleashed on the world is making a return, and it's hitting browsers this year, with a mobile version to follow in 2025.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://flappybird.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new official website</a> for the little yellow bird and its infuriating pipe-based gameplay,&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>will be available for iOS and Android, as well as browsers. Rather confusingly, the game's <a href="https://linktr.ee/flappy_bird" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linktree page</a> says it'll be playable "exclusively on Telegram".</p>
<p>A description on the site claims that&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>is "refreshed, reinvigorated, and ready to soar again", and that this will indeed be "the official&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>game", so this isn't one of those cheap imitators that sprang up in the wake of the original's disappearance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/flappy-bird-returns-gameplay.jpg?itok=miwzCPux 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/flappy-bird-returns-gameplay.jpg?itok=TrrVLO2z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>is back, with all the modern trappings you'd expect from a 2024 revival.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this being a 2024 revival of&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>, you can expect all the usual modern mobile game trappings. The relaunched version of the game will come complete with "new game modes, characters, progression, and massive multiplayer challenges", according to a press release.</p>
<p>Those modes include a basketball-based mode in which you guide the lil' bird through hoops, as well as an honest-to-goodness&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>battle royale (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/flappy-bird-battle-royale-is-thing-apparently">no, not that one</a>).</p>
<p>Said press release also confirms that the browser-based versions of&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>, which include a version for mobile web browsers, will launch this fall, and that the iOS and Android versions will follow next year.</p>
<p>It looks like original&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>creator&nbsp;Dong Nguyen won't be involved with this revival. Instead, the group spearheading the game's relaunch calls itself Flappy Bird Foundation, and the group says it will "revamp the game's ecosystem" while retaining the "familiarity of the game design" enjoyed around the world.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>was released in 2013, but its meteoric rise to fame came in 2014, at which point it gained millions of players and attained the number one spot in the iOS download charts.</p>
<p>However, just a couple of weeks after its sudden surge in popularity, creator Dong Nguyen <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/432227971173068800" rel="noopener" target="_blank">took the game down</a>, claiming he couldn't "take this anymore" (referring to the game's overexposure).</p>
<p>Whatever Nguyen may think of&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>, it seems Flappy Bird Foundation disagrees, and that's why you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>once again in your browser this year and on your phone next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>An upcoming "survival experience" from the makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">Eve Online</a> got its first trailer today, teasing spaceships against stellar backdrops. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-frontier">Eve Frontier</a> was previously known as Project Awakening and is set in a faraway sector of the Eve universe. The developer calls it "a sandbox which focuses on self-reliance, skill-based tactical gameplay and third-party development". Huh? Third party development? Oh, I see. It has a bunch of blockchain cryptocurrency horseshit attached to it. Great. </p>

<p>We've known the game was in development since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-onlines-developers-are-making-a-blockchain-game-in-the-eve-universe">its announcement last year</a>, and it saw a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-online-dev-ccps-blockchain-survival-experience-project-awakening-is-getting-a-closed-playtest-in-may">closed beta test</a> a few months ago. But this marks the moment it has been christened with a real name. "In creating EVE Frontier, we wanted to make a new type of survival game," say developers CCP in a press release, "testing not just the individual survival of players, but the survival of civilization itself within a sandbox simulation."</p>
<p>That sounds fine. I love to survive amid the hellish collapse of interstellar civilisation. What sounds less inviting is the horrendous soup of cryptochatter that follows. There is mention of "L2 Blockchain", "ERC-20 tokens", and a programmable in-game building mechanic called "Smart Assemblies" which seems to let players make little shops that sell in-game materials, presumably to fellow blockchumps for various crypto doubloons.</p>
<p>"Players will be able to turn their assets (ships, items, resources), their services (e.g. providing bodyguard services to a fellow player, maintaining third-party development environments), and their reputation (“as a renowned player, my members pay me to lead their clan”) into real-world value through the in-game economy and in-game currencies."</p>
<p>In other words, it's the grubby "play-to-earn" idea baked into the EVE universe. I'll pass, cheers.</p>

</figure>
<p>If the blockchain bullshittery is not featured in the trailer (or even mentioned in the video's description), it is likely because even those who indulge in unwise cryptocurrency speculation have to concede it is often interminably boring and invites immediate derision and skepticism from all quarters, save the cryptobro hardcore. Unlike vague images of spaceships flying coolly through space to warbling music, it does not make for exciting marketing material. Try to read this sentence, also included in the press release:</p>
<p>"Using Solidity, players can code functionality through smart contracts (on-chain code) and connect infrastructure to decentralized applications (DApps), programs through which you can modify how that infrastructure functions and behaves."</p>
<p>Is this a video game? <em>What is this?</em> Eve Online as an MMO can be a difficult game to approach as a new player, but at least it exists as an interesting landscape of cyber-skulduggery and a complex simulation of cutthroat economics. I have fond memories of rushing into battle as a dirt poor frontline fighter in a larger fleet, trying to orbit and electronically disable a much bigger, deadlier ship, like a buzzing fly trying to lasso an rhinoceros. I even have fond memories of manipulating the space stock markets with play money. </p>
<p>But that is the key thing: the ISK of Eve Online is play money that everyone agrees is play money. By contrast, Eve Frontier looks like an ill-fated attempt to pump $40 million dollars of real world money into a black hole. </p>
<p>But who knows. Maybe it will do better than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-ccp-havent-stopped-trying-to-make-an-eve-online-shooter-for-15-years">the first-person shooter they have made four times</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Helldivers 2’s upcoming Premium Warbond has unveiled new weapons, cosmetics, stratagems and more that will have players embracing their inner bug exterminator. Chemical Agents Warbond arrives for Helldivers 2 on September 19. Learn more details about it below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting with the offensive stratagems, players have a new weapon, the TX-41 Sterilizer, which can spray high-pressure chemical gas on the Terminids. Additionally, players can unlock the&nbsp; AX/TX-13 “Guard Dog” Dog Breath, a support drone that hoses enemies down with corrosive gas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chemical Agents adds 2 new Utilities for Helldivers 2, the P-11 Stim Pistol and the G-4 Gas Grenade. The P-11 Stim Pistol is the perfect choice for friendly fire, as this time, you won’t be killing your friends but healing them. The G-4 Gas Grenade is a throwable that instantly brings a cloud of corrosive chemical gas around your enemies. Additionally, players will receive 300 credits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lastly, a new Mustard pattern has been unveiled, and players can use it for Hellpods, Pelican-1 and the suit. Also, Helldivers 2 Chemical Agents has introduced a new player title, Expert Exterminator.&nbsp;</p>
