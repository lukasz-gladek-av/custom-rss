              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-reviews-metacritic-roundup-ps5-2000616275"><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> </a>is set on the island of Sicily. Despite your proximity to the Mediterranean, however, there’s no swimming in the latest, not-quite-open-world gangster game. A clip showing the new blockbuster’s lack of “swimming physics” quickly blew up on social media, spurring a debate about whether <em>The Old Country</em> cuts corners. In actuality, I wish more games were fine with cutting junk that doesn’t matter.</p> <p>Swimming is one of the ways an open-world game proves just how premium and expensive it is. Falling in water meant instant death in <em>Infamous 1</em> and <em>2</em>, while in <em>Second Son</em> it merely returned you to the last hard surface you were standing on. But in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, light swimming mechanics became part of exploring the world. You couldn’t swim in <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> until <em>San Andreas</em>. One of the more controversial aspects of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> games is that, while you can swim on the surface of the water, you can’t dive underneath like in previous games.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">In case you were wondering, Mafia: The Old Country doesn't have swimming physics just like previous Mafia Games <a href="https://t.co/oUA13X64Q1">pic.twitter.com/oUA13X64Q1</a></p> <p>— NikTek (@NikTekOfficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1953894404588179783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Swimming was never a thing in the <em>Mafia</em> games <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-the-makers-of-mafia-iii-lost-their-way-1825242177">until <em>Mafia 3</em></a>, which took place in a canal- and swamp-filled version of New Orleans called New Bordeaux. So it might have made sense to expect that to remain part of the feature set in <em>The Old Country</em>. But the new game is also more streamlined, focusing on its characters, missions, and world rather than on the kind of sandbox bloat that can be fun to mess around with but ultimately doesn’t add a ton to the overall experience. <em>The Old Country</em> is $50 and only 12 hours long. To some that’s a raw deal. But for advocates of quicker, cheaper, more sustainable game development, it seems like the perfect antidote to <a href="https://kotaku.com/former-sony-exec-calls-for-shorter-games-that-are-cheap-1844150846">a lot of the big-budget excess</a> that weighs down so many other projects. So, instead of letting you spear fish or dive for treasure, <em>The Old Country</em> warps you back to land anytime you fall in deep water.</p>

 <p>“This reminds me of when we showed <em>BG3</em> to someone (exec or whatever)–a wealth of mechanics–and with zero emotion he just goes ‘can you swim in the game?’ Like bro this isn’t mechanical whack-a-mole, endlessly layering on mechanics maketh a good game not,” Larian Studios publishing director Michael “Cromwelp” Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1954131668215693599">wrote on X</a> in response to the debate over <em>Old Country</em>‘s old-school swimming band-aid. “The realities of game design are such that each feature has a cost. Manpower-&gt; time-&gt; budget. ‘Why not just[…]’ can set a producer on fire. Try it, its funny. Better to not swim if you’re not going to do anything with it, than to add it simply to have it.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Engagement baiters show invisible walls and "no swimming" but conveniently they forgot to show areas where the need to swim was thought of, and very obviously decided against. Many other games teleport you back to the shore and no one is complaining. <a href="https://t.co/HRfJiU5ARE">pic.twitter.com/HRfJiU5ARE</a></p> <p>— Silent (@__silent_) <a href="https://twitter.com/__silent_/status/1954547676625641537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Douse pointed to day-and-night cycles as another example. While occasionally pretty and immersive, most games don’t actually do much with them, like change how characters act at night or what enemies you might face. It’s one of those back-of-the-box bullet points that can get wheeled out in pitch meetings to impress a publisher but can end up leading to more headaches and a less focused game in the long run.</p> <p>“I feel like I’m aging out of the gaming sphere because I see this and ask myself ‘Does this game even need a swimming? Should dev time be devoted to it’ and people in the comments are saying ‘This is unacceptable for a 2025 game’ Idk I just don’t think games need every mechanic,” read <a href="https://x.com/Actually_Tina/status/1954232748044112165">one viral response</a> to the swimming debate from X user ActuallyTina. “I would much rather devs spend time on mechanics that actually engagement the player a lot then a big empty world with nothing in it or swimming that is just there because idk its 2025 and you need swimming.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/peak%E2%80%99s-first-major-update-adds-a-new-biome-items-and-more.1267317/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Peak has received its first major content update today, The Mesa, which adds a new biome, some new items, new badges and more mysteries. </p>



<p>Aggro Crabs and Landfall’s latest co-op climbing adventure, Peak, has been going strong on Steam ever since its launch, selling more than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-5-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 million copies</a> within its first month. The developers have been <span>working diligently on the updates, too, and have recently </span>added the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-adds-cannibalism-in-its-latest-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cannibalism</a>&nbsp;feature. However, the latest update has a lot more to unravel. </p>



<h2 id="h-peak-s-the-mesa-update-is-live-now">Peak’s ‘The Mesa’ Update is Live Now</h2>



<h4 id="h-new-peak-content">New Peak Content</h4>



<p>Peak’s latest <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1954936000045805590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update</a> adds a new biome called The Mesa. The Mesa will be replacing Alpine and will be present in every run next week. Post that, maps will rotate randomly between The Mesa and Alpine. As this is a new land to explore, there are 10 new badges to collect, with some providing players with fresh cosmetics as rewards. </p>



<p>As players are now visiting a “sandy terrain under the blistering sun” with Peak’s The Mesa update, they will need new items to keep them safe in the undiscovered environment. These items include Balloons, Scout Cannon, Parasol, Sunscreen, Aloe Vera and Dynamite. Players will also find a surprise waiting for them at The Kiln. Moreover, a tornado was also mentioned in the new trailer. </p>

</p></figure>



<h4 id="h-new-options-and-balancing-changes">New Options and Balancing Changes</h4>



<p>The update also adds a new ‘Bug Phobia Mode’ which is designed for players that don’t do well with “arachnids and other creepy crawlies” as there will be plenty of those in the Mesa. Players can now navigate through the Settings menu with the controller. The fog will now rise slightly slower in the Tropics. The heat status now decays faster, but takes a bit longer to start. Also, hot rocks in the Caldera inflict more heat on the players. </p>

<h4 id="h-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>



<ul>
<li>Improved performance across the board on the mountain.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where players could teleport after a rusty piton they were hanging onto breaks.</li>



<li>Fixed players sometimes obtaining the Naturalist Badge despite eating packaged food.</li>



<li>Prevented players from interacting with their backpack while passed out.</li>



<li>Adjusted luggage collision to prevent players from getting their legs stuck in it</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the Bugle of Friendship would still play its audio and visual effects when out of juice.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where biome-specific loot could sometimes show up in luggage in the wrong biome.</li>
</ul>



<p>Regarding future updates, the developers have stated that they “aren’t quite sure yet” and don’t want to promise something they can’t deliver. They will update the community as soon as they have something new going on, but for now, it will only be bug fixes and stability patches for Peak. </p>



<p>In other news, Peak developers would rather <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-publishers-prefer-piracy-to-roblox-slop-ripoff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players pirate their game</a> than play a Roblox rip-off. What are your thoughts on Peak’s The Mesa update? </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/battlefield-2042/battlefield-2042-review-the-battle-of-the-bugs">the bug-riddled launch of Battlefield 2042</a> back in 2021, EA has been working to revitalize the Battlefield series’ name, placing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/12/02/respawns-vince-zampella-becomes-head-of-battlefield-amidst-wider-franchise-changes-that">Respawn’s Vince Zampella as its head amidst the creation of a wider Battlefield universe</a>. If the recent Battlefield 6 beta over the weekend is any indication, those efforts are paying off. Not only did the beta surpass Call of Duty’s all-time player count, but it also reached a new concurrent peak for the Battlefield series.&nbsp;</p><p>EA calls the Battlefield 6 open beta <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/lock-and-load-for-the-open-beta">its biggest ever</a>, and Weekend 1 (Aug. 9-10) just wrapped up. Throughout the weekend, and on Aug. 7 and Aug. 8, when invite-only players could hop in early, I saw screenshots across social media showing queues stretching into the hundreds of thousands – a lot of people were playing this game.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Using SteamDB, a database that tracks Steam concurrent player counts, that checks out. On Saturday, the Battlefield 6 open beta peaked with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">521,079 players</a>, which is also an all-time peak for the entire Battlefield series. That number eclipses <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/">the peak of Call of Duty at 491,670, </a>too, though it’s important to note these are just Steam numbers and console players could sway this observation in either direction.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, the point stands – Battlefield 6 is something players are excited about. The real test will be how many of these open beta (see: free) players will convert into paid players when Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/24/battlefield-6-gets-debut-trailer-multiplayer-reveal-set-for-july-31">watch the Battlefield 6 debut trailer</a> and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/08/01/familiar-yet-cinematic">our preview of Battlefield 6’s multiplayer</a> after going hands-on with it.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Did you hop into the Battlefield 6 open beta this weekend?

			<p>In the future, there is a perfectly safe sport where you jump into a warp tunnel and then use rockets on your hands to manoeuvre around asteroids, lasers, and other obstacles at breakneck speeds, or blast them out of your way with your space guns. This all sounds like a thoroughly thrilling spectator sport, I’m sure you agree, but donning your VR headset to play Space Drop is sadly rather dull.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Drop PS5 / PSVR2 Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0YA2PwairFI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Depending on what difficulty you start on, your first impressions may vary. If you start on the easiest difficulty you’re going to be totally underwhelmed by the lack of challenge. I’d recommend starting on the hard, the third difficulty, where you can get used to things with a little challenge. Ultra, the final difficulty, is just ridiculous. It’s not impossible to beat by any means, just incredibly frustrating instead as trial and error is the only real path to success.</p>


<p>The bigger issue is that the obstacles – the asteroids, spinning lasers and laser grids – are all the same regardless of the difficulty, it’s just that there’s more of them. It’s incredibly repetitive after a few runs and only gets more so from there. It’s a bit of a shame because there’s maybe thirty minutes when you first start playing where the game feels like it has some real potential. During this brief window, as you first master weaving through obstacles and blasting others out of the void, you can almost reach a sort of flow state – everything is so quick there’s no space for focusing on anything else. It’s just that after the first few experiences you’ve seen everything the game has to offer, just in slightly different combinations and closer together.</p>


<p>There are a couple of control options, one where you hold a button and aim your guns to move around and another where you don’t hold the button, the latter of which is superior unless you want cramp in your trigger fingers. Movement at least works well enough, giving enough fine control to fit between two lasers whilst still allowing you to quickly get over to the other side of the play area if needed. The guns are at best serviceable, though. They do what they’re supposed to do, though I’d recommend turning off the laser sights if you want any level of challenge.</p>
<p>The game looks relatively good. It’s set in space, obviously, and there’s planets and asteroids to briefly marvel at before each level begins, but even then it’s not like you can stop and enjoy them in a level without getting an asteroid to the face. The music is both incredibly repetitive and completely unremarkable, like the music you’d find in the background of a sci-fi themed mobile game, and whie the sound effects do their job well enough, they also aren’t that notable.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		It's hard to recommend Space Drop. It's very basic in just about every way and quickly becomes too repetitive as you continue playing. Perhaps sidestepping to the rhythm action could have spiced it up, or most kinds of environments and obstacles, it would have kept my interest. As it is, it's just too dull.	</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-heretic-hexen-switch-two-fps-cult-classics-masterfully-revamped.1267293/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Heretic + Hexen Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157962/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>I’m really beginning to wonder just how Nightdive Studios manages to fit in so many awesome projects. Last year, we had no less than <em>five</em> major releases from the team, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thing_remastered">The Thing: Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_wars_dark_forces_remaster">Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster</a>, and it’s clearly looking to achieve a similar degree of prolificacy in 2025. So far this year, we’ve had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_have_no_mouth_and_i_must_scream">I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a>, and now – straight out of QuakeCon – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/heretic_plus_hexen">Heretic + Hexen</a>.</p>
<p>The latter, published by Bethesda Softworks, is a revamped bundle containing two ‘90s shooters from developer Raven Software (now one of the main studios cranking out <strong>Call of Duty</strong> titles for Activision). In addition to Heretic and Hexen, you’ve also got both games’ additional content, respectively titled <strong>‘Shadow of the Serpent Riders’</strong> and <strong>‘Deathkings of the Dark Citadel’</strong>. Much like its work on DOOM + DOOM II in 2024, Nightdive Studios has also produced two completely new episodes with <strong>‘Heretic: Faith Revived’</strong> and <strong>‘Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur’</strong>.</p>
<figure><a title="Heretic + Hexen Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157956/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a compelling package, then, with lots of content on offer. I could lament the lack of <strong>Heretic II</strong> and <strong>Hexen II</strong>, but it does make sense to limit this new release to the two id Tech 1 titles. I suspect the sequels may yet return later down the line, should id Software or Nightdive decide to tackle them.</p>
<p>So let’s take a closer look at each main game. <strong>Heretic</strong>, originally released in 1994, gained reasonable popularity compared to most so-called ‘Doom Clones’ back in the day thanks to its more unique fantasy setting and inventory system. The core gameplay remained instantly familiar though, and under the watchful eyes of producer John Romero, Heretic became something of a cult classic.</p>
<p>With the new Nightdive release, the basic experience remains largely the same, albeit enhanced with the studio’s usual modern gameplay conveniences (like gyro aiming, of course) along with some thoughtful changes made to the basic design. For example, the enemies in the original were relentless bullet-sponges, and often made for a frustrating gameplay experience. Here, they’ve been nerfed considerably, which improves the moment-to-moment pacing of the game, but retains a decent sense of challenge. Basic level aesthetics have also been improved, making for a more visually-pleasing experience.</p>
<figure><a title="Heretic + Hexen Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157957/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Moving over to <strong>Hexen</strong>, this pseudo-sequel originally launched in 1995 (with an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/hexen">N64 version</a> following in 1997) and made some pretty drastic changes to its predecessor. You can choose between three classes: Fighter, Cleric, or Mage, with each demonstrating their own strengths and weaknesses. The levels were also fully interconnected, meaning changes made in one area would also reflect in another.</p>
<p>Again, Nightdive has made some welcome improvements to the overall design of Hexen, including the ability to change your class in-game via designated ‘terminals’; this is a great way to mix things up a bit if you’re getting a bit bored of one particular class. The biggest improvement, however, might not seem so drastic on paper, but it makes a huge difference: map markers.</p>
<p>Thanks to the interconnected levels, Hexen can often feel a little confusing and overwhelming. New players might find themselves just running into walls and pressing ‘Y’ in the hope that you might activate something elsewhere. Adding markers to the maps doesn’t eliminate this entirely; you still have to figure out how to navigate the environment and actually reach your destination, but it does at least remove the sense of trial and error that plagued the original release. If you’re a veteran, you can disable this via the options menu, if you wish.</p>
<figure><a title="Heretic + Hexen Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157955/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned, both Heretic and Hexen gain brand-new content courtesy of Nightdive Studios. These expansions are both excellent and really demonstrate the developer’s understanding of what makes the original games tick. The levels are exceptionally well-designed and, honestly, you’d be forgiven for thinking they were cut content from the main games. I would have been happy to just play Heretic and Hexen with modern improvements, but the additional content here really elevates the package to a whole new level.</p>
<p>In terms of presentation, Nightdive has included all the usual enhancements I’ve come to expect from its remasters, including the ability to toggle between widescreen and 4:3 aspect ratios, various levels of resolution scaling, and even six different crosshair designs. Performance is locked to 60fps and it feels great, though a part of me does wish that we got a native Switch 2 release with 120fps. One step a time, though; I'm sure it'll come eventually.</p>
<p>Music is also given special treatment here: you’ve got the original soundtracks in all their glory, but you can also swap to an fm synth version, midi synth version, and a completely remixed version from Andrew Hulshult, who also gave us the updated soundtracks for DOOM + DOOM II in 2024. This new version is excellent, and my go-to from now on.</p>

<p>Multiplayer is also included in both titles, and it works pretty well for the most part. You can hop into an online match fairly easily, just be prepared for a bit of jank. You might find yourself teleporting around depending on where your teammates are, while character models can judder around a bit if the connection isn’t stable enough. It’s not the most ideal way to play Heretic or Hexen, but if you’re able to get some pals together, it makes for a pretty fun time.</p>
<p>Finally, a huge shout-out goes to the Raven Vault, a collection of behind-the-scenes documentation for both titles that provides some key background information. It’s not quite as exhaustive as what you might find in the recent System Shock 2 remaster, but you’ve got a good selection of enemy designs, texture sheets, key artwork, and more. Definitely worth checking out if you’re a fan of the originals.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Heretic + Hexen is yet another slam dunk for Nightdive Studios. This new release revamps both titles with modern controls, bonus content, and thoughtful changes to the core design that make each game a delight to play. Granted, these are still FPS titles from the mid-'90s, so your mileage will definitely vary, but for returning fans and those with a particular fondness for old-school 'boomer shooters', you really can't go wrong. Now let's get a native Switch 2 port with 120fps please, Nightdive.</p></section>

			<p>Mike Ybarra, the current chief executive officer of daily fantasy sports betting app <a href="https://www.prizepicks.com/">PrizePicks</a>, who you're more likely to recognize as the former president of Blizzard Entertainment, has some thoughts about <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> taking on <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> this fall, predicting that EA's shooter will "<em>boot stomp</em>" the latest entry in the annual series that helps keep his former company afloat, and that FPS fans will be better off for it.</p>



<p>"<em>Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year</em>," his post on X (formerly Twitter) reads. "<em>But the real win here is CoD won't be lazy anymore, and we'll all get better FPS games for it</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year. But the real win here is CoD won’t be lazy anymore, and we’ll all get better FPS games for it.</p>— Mike Ybarra 😇 (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1953621587993014620?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1953622553894785366">Replying</a> to someone commenting on his post, Ybarra expanded on his thoughts and criticism of the Call of Duty series dating back to 2016, saying, "<em>CoD has gone downhill for years since then</em>. <em>It's a mess. Cheating, heavy UI/install, rainbow colors. People are sick of it. Luckily BF will force them to change it</em>."</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1954586377036628253">another repl<strong>y</strong></a> to someone accusing him of being "<em>bitter</em>," Ybarra writes, "<em>CoD will get better because BF will be</em> <em>great. You're blind if you don't see that. Bitter? No, glad I'm not part of the end of Xbox. Upset they can't lead teams to make good games? Yes. Because they layoff all those people for leaderships mishaps.</em>"</p>



<p>Strong words from someone who was at the top end of company leadership at Blizzard for a few years, and who also worked at Microsoft for almost two decades before that. Ybarra left Blizzard and subsequently Microsoft in 2024, alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/">massive 1,900-employee layoff at Activision Blizzard King</a> that came shortly after Microsoft officially closed on its acquisition of ABK.</p>



<p>Between his time at Microsoft, then Blizzard, and then Microsoft again, Ybarra was on the leadership end of his fair share of mishaps that resulted in layoffs. That's not to say they were all directly his own mishaps, but it feels odd, to say the least, to hear him generalize leadership in this way, as if we're meant to think he wasn't around for any of the bad stuff at Blizzard and Microsoft.</p>



<p>All that said, he has a point that an incredible Battlefield game that gives Call of Duty some serious competition in the shooter market can only make Activision and the Call of Duty team work harder to beat Battlefield the next year, and the same goes for Battlefield Studios working to get the better of Call of Duty. </p>



<p>Healthy competition in the market means better games for players, but for that to happen, Battlefield 6 has to stick the landing when it arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 10, 2025.</p>



<p>At least it's had a strong start, since, on Steam, Battlefield 6 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">surpassed</a> the record concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/">Call of Duty</a> in just its first open beta.</p>

            <p>Former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> executive producer Mark Darrah has discussed pitching remasters of the first three games in the series to EA, and made clear in the same interview that he's encourage the developers of the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> game to "scapegoat" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> "as much as they need to".</p>
<p>Darrah's offered a lot of insight into life at BioWare since departing the studio back in 2022, with the veteran dev having done plenty of that via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-dragon-age-producer-posts-tell-all-video-about-the-messy-birth-of-ea-and-biowares-anthem">his own YouTube channel</a>. This time, though, he was interviewed by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0">MrMattyPlays</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Just past the ten minute mark of the chat, Darrah was asked whether he thinks the next Mass Effect game will likely face a "less messy" development cycle than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-dragon-age-the-veilguard-report-reveals-more-about-turbulent-development-including-forspoken-prompted-shift-from-snark-to-seriousness">the likes of Veilguard have suffered</a>. "To be frank," he responded, "the Mass Effect team is going to be able to point to The Veilguard and say 'We should steer away from some of these things because look what happened.' I would honestly encourage that team to scapegoat Veilguard as much as they need to, to get what they need from the organisation, whether it's true or not."</p>
<p>So, not giving Veilguard's developers - whom Darrah <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/biowares-mark-darrah-thinks-veilguard-is-the-first-dragon-age-where-the-combats-actually-fun">worked with as a consultant</a> and stood up for following the game's release. Instead, just pointing to it in an effort to get dumb execs to stop pushing yet another project in the same problematic directions and learn from some past mistakes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, slightly further on, Darrah added that he thinks the next step for the Dragon Age series should be remastering the first three games: Origins, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Inquisition</a>. He also revealed that remastering these games as a "Champions Trilogy" was discussed and soft pitched to EA while he was there, but didn't end up happening for a few reasons.</p>
<p>"EA's historically been and I don't know why, but they've even said this publicly — they're kind of against remasters," Darrah explained, "I don't really know why, and it's strange for a publicly-traded company to seemingly be against free money but they seem to be against it. So that's part of it.</p>
<p>"The other problem is, Dragon Age is harder than Mass Effect to do. To some degree unknowably harder, maybe only a little bit harder, maybe a lot harder. One of the very earliest things for Joplin [the codename for BioWare's earliest version of Dragon Age 4] was let's do Frostbite tools, and then let's find a mod house that seems talented, and just uplift them, and pay them to do a remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>."</p>
<p>However, as Darrah went on to outline, that wouldn't fly, because of the "advantages" the series about banging ok has over Dragon Age in terms of being easy to remaster:</p>
<blockquote>One, it's all Unreal instead of two different engines. But actually, just the fact that it's Unreal [engine] means that you can remaster Mass Effect essentially for money. If you're willing to spend money on it, you can go to an external house and they can do most of the work, which is sort of what happened with Legendary Edition. There were a bunch of people at BioWare working on it...I don't know remember how many, but it was not a ton. Whereas, if you're going to do [Dragon Age], you either have to spin up a brand new team that's going to learn this really, really crotchety old tech base, or you've got to do it all in-house.</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a tough sell to spending-averse execs who Darrah suggests elsewhere in the interview have historically struggled to see the Dragon Age games as potential mainstream hits. Regardless of where it's that or something else, here's hoping Veilguard doesn't end up being the last we ever see of BioWare's lizard era.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-5-devs-should-scapegoat-veilguard-and-a-dragon-age-trilogy-remaster-was-pitched-to-ea-says-ex-bioware-producer]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Over the weekend, <em>Weapons</em> made a killing at the box office, opening with an impressive $42 million and in the process helping movie studio <a href="https://kotaku.com/wb-warner-bros-discovery-split-hbo-max-ceo-david-zaslav-1851784086">Warner Bros.</a> do something no other studio or distributor has done before in history.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-cases-loose-discs-bf6-resident-evil-persona-spider-man-news-2000616874#:~:text=Weapons%20Director%20Says%20His%20Resident%20Evil%20Movie%20Will%20Be%20Weird">Zach Cregger’s latest horror film, <em>Weapons</em></a>, tells the story of a group of kids who all left their homes in the middle of the night and never returned. The strange and creepy movie has received high praise from critics, with a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes. And that certainly helped <em>Weapons</em>, with a budget of only $38 million, draw in a ton of people over the August 8th weekend, beating out<em> Fantastic Four</em> and <em>Freakier Friday</em>, two Disney-produced flicks. This is now the sixth film in a row from WB to pull off a $40-million-or-more opening weekend at the box office.</p> <p><a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/weekend-box-office-weapons-racks-up-another-big-win-for-warner-bros/">As reported by Rotten Tomatoes</a>, this is apparently the first time a movie studio has ever been on such a hot streak. It all started with <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345"><em>A Minecraft Movie</em></a> in April. Since then, WB has been on an impressive and historic box office run. Here’s the full breakdown of each movie the studio has released and how much it made during opening weekend:</p> <ul> <li><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> – April – $162 million</li> <li><em>Sinners – April</em> – $48 million</li> <li><em>Final Destination: Bloodlines</em> – $51 million</li> <li><em>F1</em> – $51 million</li> <li><em>Superman</em> – $125 million</li> <li><em>Weapons</em> – $42 million</li> </ul> <p>Making this streak all the more impressive is that half of these are original movies, not sequels, reboots, or spin-offs. This seems to fly in the face of how Hollywood has operated over the last decade, where at times it’s felt as if nearly every movie is some kind of continuation of an existing franchise. Warner Bros., on the other hand, seems to be spreading out its budget across new ideas as well as making IP plays, like <em>Minecraft</em> and its <em>Final Destination </em>reboot.&nbsp; It’s a strategy that’s working. Oh, and <em>Weapons</em> also marks the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/1mmlqv4/wb_is_having_quite_the_year_weapons_is_the/">seventh film in 2025 from Warner Bros. to open at number one</a> at the domestic box office, which is also a first for a movie studio as far as I can tell. (<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2465301249/?ref_=bo_wey_table_28"><em>Mickey 17</em></a> wasn’t a huge hit for WB, but it did open at number one during the first weekend of March.)</p> <p>Will this streak continue? Maybe. WB’s next big movie to hit theaters is <em>The Conjuring: Last Rites</em> on September 5. This likely won’t win over critics like <em>Sinners</em> and <em>Weapons </em>did, but the franchise has been a consistent moneymaker for the studio, and horror flicks are hotter than ever right now. So it’s possible that both of WB’s historic streaks at the box office continue. Meanwhile, you have to imagine execs at Disney, MGM, and Sony are watching closely and looking at their upcoming projects to see if they need to inject a bit more originality into their future film slates.</p>

            <p>
Civilization 7 didn't get off to a great start when it launched earlier this year, quickly becoming mired in complaints around its controversial gameplay choices, lack of features, and clumsy UI. But while developer Firaxis is still struggling to win over series fans - particularly on Steam, where its user reviews remain "mixed" - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick believes Civilization 7 is still on track to hit its lifetime "value" projections.
</p>
<p>
Civilization 7 released back in February - Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">called it</a> a "competent [series] entry with some poorly executed ideas and a striking lack of personality" at the time - and criticism from customers soon followed. Complaints were loud enough, particularly among the series' more visible base of PC players (Civilization 7 also launched on consoles), that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-acknowledges-civilization-7-issues-fixes-incoming">Firaxis quickly moved to address fans</a>, promising a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-will-improve-its-much-criticised-ui-across-multiple-future-updates">roadmap of fixes</a> that's still ongoing.
</p>
<p>
And it appears these early troubles have contributed to what Zelnick has now acknowledged to be a "slow start" for the 4X strategy series' latest entry - but he remains optimistic about its future. "I think the key thing is that Civ has always been a slow burn," he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-insists-projections-for-the-lifetime-value-of-civilization-7-are-very-consistent-with-our-initial-expectations-for-the-title-despite-slow-start">told IGN</a> in a recent interview. "It's always been a title that had - I'm not really a big believer in the long tail theory of the entertainment business - but Civ is an example of that theory. And right now our projections for the lifetime value of the title are very consistent with our initial expectations."

<p>
"So while we were off to a slow start," he continued, "and while we have had to make changes - and there are more changes coming - I feel like consumer uptake is better and better and we feel really good about the title. I think over time it's going to take its place in its Civilization pantheon in a very successful, credible way."
</p>
<p>
Civilization 7's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/498327545507219278?l=english">most recent update</a>, officially referred to as version 1.2.3, brought UI and quality-of-life adjustments, alongside a first round of changes aimed at improving the game's controversial Age Transitions - changes intended to introduce a greater sense of continuity and connection as Ages shift. It sounds like Firaxis' most meaningful revisions are still to come however, with the studio confirming it's currently "in the middle of some deeper work on systems like Ages, replayability, and how players connect with their civ across history". However, these, it admitted, are "going to take time".

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-battlefield-6-beta-queues-stretching-around-the-block-a-substantial-increase-in-server-capacity-should-just-have-helped">open beta</a> is over, and encouraging whispers of its oo-rahhable player count – peaking at over 500,000 on PC alone, so sayeth <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">SteamDB</a> – have been tempered with widespread <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cheaters-already-spotted-in-battlefield-6-open-beta-despite-secure-boot-requirement">reports of invading cheaters</a>. That’s despite BF6’s new and unusual requirement to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">enable Secure Boot</a>, a BIOS-level security feature in Windows, ostensibly to prevent such do-badding.</p>
<p>In response, a <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/update-battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803">forum post</a> attributed to EA’s anti-cheat team has played up successes in tracking and catching the beta’s cheaters, whose crimes allegedly range from classic wallhacks, speed hacks, and aimbots to cheats that reduce recoil or display enemy health and weapon info. However, it also concedes that Secure Boot "is not, and was not intended to be a silver bullet" – and in doing so, highlights the immense, perhaps impossible task that developers have of keeping cheater users out of their games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I don’t mean to suggest that cheat makers are a breed of impressive technogeniuses. They trade in malevolence for profit, making them almost as big a bunch of loser babies as their customers. But they are persistent, and prideful, so attempts by publishers and developers to big up their latest anti-cheat as being particularly difficult to crack is often seen as a challenge as much as a deterrent. Vanguard, the AC system Riot Games use for their tactical FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a>, holds a kind of grudgingly respected reputation among players for its relative efficacy, yet cheaters still show up now and then to spoil its shootouts.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's true that EA, or BF6 developers DICE, never claimed that requiring Secure Boot would keep hackers out for good. The feature is also just one component of the game’s wider AC protection, named Javelin, which that forum post boasts of having stopped 330,000 cheating and tampering attempts like they were .22 rounds pinging off a tank’s backside. That’s about three successful interventions for every five players, which suggests two things: one, Battlefield 6 faces an absolutely enormous number of malicious actors, and two, if you played the open beta at the weekend, there’s a very good chance that at least one of your games was saved from a cheating attempt.</p>
<p>Some of those numbers were undoubtedly passed around BF6 headquarters as evidence of Javelin’s great success. Except it was also beaten, in a matter of hours, and by a fairly wide variety of different cheats. And anti-cheat systems are a lot like Premier League goalkeepers: you can keep out attempt after attempt, but let just one through and people will think you're rubbish.</p>
<p>I’d argue, then, that the biggest challenge facing multiplayer developers isn’t the pursuit of creating a truly hacker-free game. That, based on current evidence, looks close to impossible. Instead, it’s expectation management: what’s a publicly acceptable proportion of hackers to breach the system, and maybe more importantly, how much can you ask of rule-abiding players before they start getting genuinely pissed off by your AC requirements? What’s a palatable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone%27s_ratio">Blackstone’s ratio</a> of inconvenienced innocents versus catchable perps?</p>

<p>So far, there haven’t been any recorded instances of EA – or Riot, whose Vanguard system also goes rooting around in the deepest depths of your PC – using kernel-access anti-cheat for anything untoward. But having to manually enable Secure Boot, especially if you’re not a frequent BIOS spelunker, is enough of a faff that for someone, somewhere, it’s going to chip away at goodwill. There have been recorded instances of user-end problems after the fact, too. The most ironic of which being that Battlefield 6’s anti-cheat can actually <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mlwcbl/battlefield_6_just_told_me_to_uninstall_valorant/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-faces-issues-with-val">clash with Valorant’s</a>, like two hench bouncers trying to fit through the same doorframe. Last year, a more extreme case of 'acceptable loss' calculations saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat">Steam Deck players booted permanently out of Apex Legends</a>, on the grounds that the handheld's Linux-based OS was making it too hard to keep cheaters away.</p>
<p>For now, developers seem to be weighing security more heavily than convenience. Respawn would later, with barely concealed pride, <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1865148176275247312">wheel out an "infection rate" graph</a> as evidence that dropping Linux support was a worthy sacrifice. And as for Battlefield 6... well, their beta just got half a million concurrents. For all the grumbling about Secure Boot, it sure does look like players are happy to go along with it.</p>
<p>Provided, anyway, that it’s in service of an anti-cheat system that broadly works – or at least one that enough people <em>perceive</em> to work. Secure Boot might not be a particularly strong turn-off, but the one thing that gets players quitting faster than being lasered by some prick with X-ray vision is the belief, justified or otherwise, that he or his ilk will show up in the next game too. Battlefield 6 can’t stop every single cheater. But it’ll need to keep quiet the ones that do.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-battlefield-6-betas-hacking-problem-shows-the-difficulty-in-playing-cat-and-mouse-with-cheaters]]></content:encoded>

              <p><span>On August 8, Grass Wonder, a real-world racehorse which gacha game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/umamusume-pretty-derby-horse-girl-gacha-game-ludwig-1851785849"><i><span>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</span></i></a> <span>based one of its anime horse girls on, died at the age of 30. According to </span><a href="https://www.bigredfarm.jp/post/%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AF%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC-%E6%AD%BB%E5%8E%BB"><span>the official obituary</span></a><span>, the horse (who is male in real life) passed due to multiple organ failure. The official </span><i><span>Umamusume</span></i><span> social media accounts </span><a href="https://x.com/uma_musu/status/1953773211667009804"><span>paid tribute to Grass Wonder</span></a><span> upon news of his death, and fans decided to pay tribute to the horse through </span><a href="https://x.com/Neshaa_3450/status/1954207604743254457"><span>a piece of pixel art</span></a><span> on </span><a href="https://wplace.live/"><span>Wplace</span></a><span>, a world map that users can paint and collaborate on. However, things nearly went awry when fans realized the art they were attempting to recreate was AI-generated, until the community rallied to change things up and pay a more honest tribute to Grass Wonder.</span></p> <p><span>If you’ve never heard of Wplace, it’s an interactive world map that lets you paint over any location, and people use it to create some pretty incredible digital art. It’s a living canvas that anyone can draw on, and that includes making a tribute to race horses who are no longer with us. A group of Umamusume fans started creating a piece on the map around Dolores, Quezon in the Philippines, where many of the organizing fans are based. The artwork depicts Grass Wonder walking through a field with a bouquet of sunflowers in hand. The text “Farewell, Grass Wonder” is shown above her in a blue sky. While it’s a lovely gesture, the group project got a bit more complicated when it was discovered that the original reference art </span><a href="https://x.com/scalizo_art/status/1954353052322058262"><span>was AI-generated</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The project began on a </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/kabayongbabaepilipinas"><span>Philippine</span></a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/kabayongbabaepilipinas"><span>Facebook fan page</span></a><span>, and once people realized the original artwork was AI slop, the group’s admin </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/kabayongbabaepilipinas/posts/1427845951603157/"><span>put out an apology statement</span></a><span>.</span></p>

The game originally launched in Japan in 2021 before rolling out in other Asian territories over the following years. </span><i><span>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</span></i><span> finally launched worldwide back in June, and has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/umamusume-pretty-derby-horse-girl-stable-guidelines-1851786102"><span>become a viral sensation</span></a><span> after big streamers like Ludwig and Northern Lion played it on their channels.</span></p>

            <p>A collaboration between The Pokémon Company and McDonald's has ended early due to scalping and food waste.</p>
<p>An exclusive Pikachu trading card was available as part of a Happy Meal promotion, from 9th August until 11th August. However, this ended after less than a day of availability "due to sales exceeding expectations", according to a <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0809b/">statement from McDonald's</a>. "We sincerely apologise for not being able to meet the expectations of our customers who have been looking forward to it due to the early end of distribution."</p>
<p>However, as reported by <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/08/amid-chaos-mcdonalds-japan-sells-out-of-pokemon-tcg-promo-cards-in-less-than-a-day">Poké Beach</a>, the promotion resulted in chaos - long queues, card scalping, and food waste. Images show uneaten food left on the streets to rot as customers seek only the special card.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on eBay, the Pikachu promo card is being sold for around £25 each, while the full set of six cards is double that. There are also reports of McDonald's employees illegally selling boxes of the cards.</p>

			<p>Earlier this year, Embark Studios, the team behind popular free-to-play FPS The Finals, was heavily showcasing its upcoming third-person extraction shooter, ARC Raiders, with a large-scale public playtest this past April, followed by a <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-october-2025/">major release date trailer</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, we've not seen anything more of the game, and Embark Studios has just confirmed that we'll continue to see nothing until we're much closer to its October 30th launch date. In a statement published to the game's official X account, Embark Studios has confirmed the team is in a heads-down state leading up to launch.</p>



<p>There won't be another public playtest for the game before launch, and Embark won't be featuring the game at Gamescom 2025, which is a little more than a week away at the time of this writing. </p>



<p>"<em>Our focus is now on polishing and expanding the experience, and putting all the learnings from TT2 into action ahead of release</em>," the statement reads. "<em>Just so you know, we're not planning additional public tests before launch. We've learned from our last announcement that it's crucial to keep expectations in check, so we also want to be clear that we won't be at Gamescom. But don't worry, our launch campaign will kick off before you know it!"</em></p>



<p>"<em>We'll have many more updates for you in the lead-up to launch. Thank you for all the support and encouragement you've been sending our way! It means the world</em>."</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo got to check out ARC Raiders earlier this year</a>, and in his preview noted it as a "<em>promising</em>" title, though of course there's only so much that can be gleamed from public playtests ahead of launch. That said, Alessio marked that "<em>Embark seems to have mixed in enough familiar and new elements to create an exciting recipe.</em>"</p>

<p>The<i> Puyo Puyo Tetris</i> series combines two classic puzzle franchises into a single fun and vibrant experience, and it tends to be a pretty damn good time. With the Nintendo Switch 2 now out in the wild, fans of the series can get their hands on <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i>, an enhanced version of 2020’s <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</i>. You can tell it’s enhanced because of the “S”, which is the universal way to know something is extra cool, I think.</p> <p>Anyway, this new version of the game brings a variety of upgrades and new features, such as the new 2v2 Doubles Mode, a bunch of additional characters, and even mouse controls. But if you’re a diehard fan, you’ll probably be checking out the Adventure Mode, which sends you off on a journey across an overworld map to compete against foes for some puzzle mayhem. How long will you spend seeing things through? How does its mouse mode work? And what should you consider before grabbing a physical version? Let’s take a look.</p> <h2><span id="how-long-does-it-take-to-beat-puyo-puyo-tetris-2s%e2%80%98s-adventure-mode"></span>How long does it take to beat <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i>‘s Adventure Mode?<span></span></h2> <p>So, let’s get something out of the way: <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i> is a puzzle game with endless replayability, so how many hours of fun you get out of it will be based on how much you enjoy <i>Puyo Puyo</i> and <i>Tetris</i>. However, the Adventure Mode tells a story with missions to tackle, speaking more to folks who like a campaign to tackle. And that campaign is finite, naturally.</p>

 <p><b>Simply reaching the end of </b><b><i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i></b><b>‘s Adventure Mode can take 10-15 hours</b>, depending on your skill level. But you can stretch things out much further by trying to tackle every optional mission and side story the game has to offer. Additionally, completionists will want to aim to get a full four-star rating on every mission to show they know their shit. Not me, though, because I’m equally dreadful at <i>Puyo Puyo</i> and <i>Tetris</i>.</p> <p>Speaking of being bad at puzzle games, you can mess with the difficulty to help set you up for success if you’re not making any headway in the campaign. I don’t feel much shame admitting that I’m just not very fast or good at stacking all this colorful stuff, and neither should you.</p> <h2><span id="how-well-does-mouse-mode-work-on-puyo-puyo-tertris-2s"></span>How well does mouse mode work on <i>Puyo Puyo Tertris 2S</i>?<span></span></h2> <p>Not only does the <i>2S</i> version of this game toss in the 2v2 Doubles Mode, it also allows you to use the Switch’s “mouse mode” to move your blocks around. In this mode you’ll use your shoulder button to rotate the block, while pulling down with the mouse will accelerate how fast the block falls. While this adds a level of physicality you might otherwise not expect in <i>Tetris</i>, it can be a challenge to pull the mouse down in a perfectly straight line, so don’t be surprised if the blocks land a little to the left or right when using this mode.</p>

 <h2><span id="puyo-puyo-tetris-2s%e2%80%99-physical-version-comes-on-a-gamekey-card"></span><i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i>’ physical version comes on a Game-Key Card<span></span></h2> <p>If you were hoping to grab a physical copy of this game, you should know that you’ll still need to download the full game with an internet connection. The card that ships in the case is only a key for a license to download the game and doesn’t have the full data available for you to play.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-survey-game-key-carts-2000614465">Switch 2 Owners Are Leaping On A Survey To Express Fury Over Game Key Cards</a></p> <p>On the flip side, you can still share or resell this Game-Key card, which you can’t do with a “digital” version. <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-survey-game-key-carts-2000614465">Game-Key cards are an ongoing frustration</a> for Switch 2 fans, and <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S </i>is no exception.</p> <hr> <p><i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i> is available now on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>He’s the leader of the bunch, you know him well, but where is Donkey Kong in the roster of <i>Mario Kart World</i>? When you load up the game and try to find the newly-redesigned DK, you may be disappointed to not be able to find him. Luckily, you can find him without too much trouble! Here’s what you need to know to unlock Donkey Kong in <i>Mario Kart World</i>, which tracks he’s best on, and what karts you should use when playing as him.</p> <h2><span id="how-to-unlock-donkey-kong-in-mario-kart-world"></span>How to Unlock Donkey Kong in Mario Kart World<span></span></h2> <p>To unlock Donkey Kong, you only need to complete the Mushroom Cup in the Grand Prix mode. It might seem like a massive oversight to not have Donkey Kong unlock for completing the Banana Cup, but considering the Mushroom Cup culminates in the track DK Spaceport, it’s a good place to find him.</p> <p>Placement is irrelevant here; you only need to complete the grand prix to qualify. Whether you end up in first place or 24th, you’ll be able to add DK to your playable roster. You might want to try playing the cup again if you ended up in 24th, though.</p>

 <h2><span id="which-karts-are-best-for-donkey-kong"></span>Which karts are best for Donkey Kong?<span></span></h2> <p>There are at least four karts that will serve Donkey Kong well against other racers. Chagrin’ Truck is easily one of the fastest, but the Baby Blooper sacrifices top speed for some increased handling you may find useful. Following these two karts, the Reel Racer and Stellar Sled offer a nice combination of speed and handling.</p> <h2><span id="donkey-kong-unlockable-costumes"></span>Donkey Kong Unlockable Costumes<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616899" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616899"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616899">© Screenshot: Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Unfortunately, as if making him unlockable wasn’t enough, the DK disrespect continues with his unlockable costumes. He has one costume for players to find out in the open world. This puts him barely above minor drivers like Cow and Snowman, and below the main cast of characters. I don’t know how it happened that costumes for King Boo somehow rank above the ape that started it all, but here we are.</p> <p>Donkey Kong’s only unlockable costume is All-Terrain. You can find it by eating quite a few different foods from around the map; try out a variety and you’re bound to find it before long. It’s a great looking costume. Just try to block out any memories it surfaces of 2022’s disappointing Mario Strikers: Battle League.</p> <h2><span id="what-tracks-favor-donkey-kong"></span>What tracks favor Donkey Kong?<span></span></h2> <p>For the most part, other heavy-class characters like Bowser might be the pick to hit the best times. But tracks like Crown City, Desert Hills, Wario Shipyard, Koopa Troopa Beach, Dandelion Depths, Choco Mountain all typically favor the heavy class, so Donkey Kong should perform well here.</p> <hr> <p><i>Mario Kart World </i>is available now on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The price of the PlayStation 5 in the United States promises to remain stable for the immediate future, as Sony has already taken measures to limit the impact of tariffs.</p>



<p>During the Q1 2026 Earnings Call a couple of days ago, as transcribed by <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4810238-sony-group-corporation-sony-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript">Seeking Alpha</a>, Sony CFO Lin Tao confirmed the company is diversifying their supply chain, and production has already been transfered outside China for units to be sold in the United States to limit the impact of the tariffs. Regarding peripherals, the shift is still ongoing and will be completed by the end of the first half of the fiscal year. Regarding the company's pricing strategy for consoles, the Sony CFO couldn't make a definitive statement, as factors like annual profit, lifetime value, sell-in volume and expected content sales will be considered, as well as how consumers react to prices. As such, the strategy remains flexible.</p>



<p>The current worldwide economic situation is making it challenging for console manufacturers to keep prices down. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">April</a>, the price of the PlayStation 5 was increased in Europe, the UK, and Australia, and although it hasn't in the United States, there's no certainty it will at some point, judging from the statement above. Nintendo, however, did not manage to keep the price of its previous generation system, as the Japanese company has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-us-price-changes-nintendo-switch-2/">increased</a> the price of all of the original Nintendo Switch models in the US, with price increases ranging from $30 to $50.</p>



<p>Economic uncertainty is definitely influencing how the next console generation will shape up. According to leaks, Sony is designing the PlayStation 6 to deliver a 4K, 120 FPS experience while keeping costs down, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/">a proposition that would be enticing at any price below $900</a>, according to a former AMD employee.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/date-everything-sales-hit-half-a-million-team17-announces.1267185/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 and developer Sassy Chap Games have announced that their dating sim<i>&nbsp;Date Everything!&nbsp;</i>has managed to hit a major sales milestone in the weeks since its release.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-date-everything-release-date-summer" rel="nofollow">finally released back in June</a>, has sold 500,000 copies across all the platforms on which it's currently available. The game isn't playable as part of any major subscription services, either, so this figure does refer exclusively to sales and not just "players".</p>

<p>As part of celebrations for reaching this sales milestone, Team17 and Sassy Chap Games are giving away a washing machine (yes, you read that right), because, well, as the studios say, "people need washing machines [and] some people clearly like dating washing machines". Can't argue with that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/date-everything-sales-500k-himbos.jpg?itok=cv7b-u8V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/date-everything-sales-500k-himbos.jpg?itok=kaoihnIB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has hit a big sales milestone, and there's a rather quirky giveaway going on to celebrate.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to enter this giveaway (which, I'll remind you, will result in you receiving a real washing machine if you win), all you need to do is send a custom description or drawing of your custom&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>character to Team17 and Sassy Chap. You can read more about how to enter <a href="https://www.team17.com/competition/date-everything-washing-machine-competition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's a dating sim that allows you to date...okay, not quite everything, but certainly a lot of things you can't date anywhere else. That includes your washing machine, but also a candelabra, a piano, and even the concept of existential dread.</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-dating-sim" rel="nofollow">announced in July last year</a>, it was due for release in 2024, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day" rel="nofollow">delayed to Valentine's Day this year</a>, which would have been the best possible release date for it. Unfortunately, it was then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">pushed back again</a>, eventually finding its permanent launch day in June.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/date-everything/9n0ccpmbljq8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/date-everything-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (and therefore also Nintendo Switch 2 via backwards compatibility).</p>

He joined in 2018.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Let’s be honest, Gigabyte. Your marketing for the <strong>Aero X16</strong> is giving Razer Blade, from the colors and font of the spec slides to the thin design of the space gray laptop itself. While we haven’t tested out this model to see how it stacks up to Razer’s gaming machine, its price is certainly a <em>lot </em>more attractive. At <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgigabyte-aero-x16-copilot-pc-16-25601600-wqxga-amd-ryzen-al-7-350-1tb-ssd-32gb-ddr5-ram-geforce-rtx-5070-space-gray%2F6632266.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, you can get a capable midrange model with AMD’s Ryzen AI 7 350 CPU, Nvidia’s RTX 5070 graphics chip, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $1,299.99 (normally $1,649.99).</p><p>Whether you’re in need of a laptop built mainly for gaming, creative work, or work tasks, there’s a lot to like with this Aero X16 configuration. It has a 16:10 aspect ratio QHD screen, which affords a bit more vertical space than your average laptop screen (letting you read more lines at once without scrolling, for example). It has a lot of other specs that I’m happy to see in a laptop that costs less than $1,500, like a 165Hz high refresh rate screen, a capable RTX 5070 GPU, plus the ability to easily add more RAM (two slots, with support for up to 64GB DDR5 5,600MHz) and storage (two PCIe 4.0 slots) after purchase.</p><p>Comparing this Gigabyte model to its closest Razer Blade 16 equivalent isn’t exactly apples to apples, of course — there’s some features you just won’t see in the Aero X16. The<a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2Frazer-blade-16%2FRZ09-05286EN3-R3U1" rel="sponsored"> RTX 5070-equipped Blade 16 </a>is $2,399.99, and likewise comes with 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD, but you’ll also get a QHD OLED panel with a 240Hz refresh rate by default, not to mention a more polished design.</p><div><p id="other-deals-to-get-your-monday-going"><h2>Other deals to get your Monday going</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>-inspired Xbox wireless controller</strong> that’s covered in Doom Slayer design flair is $54 at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwalmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Wireless-Controller-DOOM-The-Dark-Ages-Limited-Edition%2F15128257819" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, down from its original $79.99 price. If you’ve always wanted a controller with a blood splatter painted on, and its ABXY labels replaced with in-game glyphs, this is the gamepad for you. Looking past the unique design, it’s a standard Xbox wireless controller, with replaceable AA batteries, reliable connectivity, and Bluetooth support for seamless pairing with PCs, phones, tablets, and more.</span></li><li><span>A bunch of PS5 disc games are discounted at Best Buy for seemingly no apparent reason — not that a reason is ever required for good discounts.

              <p><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-assassins-creed-tv-show-ubisoft-plot-date-1851786489">isn’t the only hit Ubisoft blockbuster</a> getting a TV series spin-off. <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-6-the-kotaku-review-1847830444"><em>Far Cry</em></a> will be adapted as well, according to a recent leak on the publisher’s website. But the psychological horror series for FX will be helmed by an unlikely individual: Rob Mac of <a href="https://kotaku.com/always-sunny-frank-danny-devito-last-of-us-mash-up-fx-1851021540"><em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em></a> fame.</p> <p>A news post that seemingly went up early <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2YgRby0tgbIWL7K03LKN4t/far-cry-series-adaptation-in-the-works-at-fx">on Ubisoft’s news site over the weekend</a> before being quickly deleted indicated (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/">according to Reddit</a>) that a <em>Far Cry</em> show will be coming from <em>It’s Always Sunny</em>‘s home network, FX, with Mac joined by <em>Fargo</em> TV creator Noah Hawley, who also recently launched <em>Alien: Earth</em>. Hawley will be showrunner, while Mac reportedly stars in the “anthology” style<em> Far Cry</em> show.</p> <p>The FX house style is probably a good fit for the franchise, though it remains to be seen what a TV version of sneaking through outposts and blowing them up with gas tanks and RPG launchers ends up looking like. Mac isn’t a completely left-field pick either. Ubisoft has been working with him up through the cancellation of <a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-tv-mythic-quest-rob-mcelhenney-season-4-date-1851698983">Apple’s <em>Mythic Quest</em></a>, the workplace comedy about game development created with Megan Ganz and Charlie Day.</p> <p>Ubisoft has a new <em>Far Cr</em>y sequel currently in the works, and with previous entries being best-sellers, the open-world FPS franchise is an obvious candidate for the current video game-to-TV pipeline gold rush. And unlike <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, each <em>Far Cry</em> game features completely different characters and scenarios, giving the show’s writers and producers lots of creative flexibility with how to present the loose franchise’s pillars of carving up animals for inventory upgrades and cult-leader villains.</p>

<p>The principal game designer at DICE is asking players to share video examples of unexpectedly fast time-to-death (TTD) during the Battlefield 6 open beta. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s first open beta was a resounding success, becoming the franchise’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-biggest-ever-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest open beta</a> yet and also beating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty’s concurrent record</a> on Steam. However, players encountered several bugs during the weekend, but nothing that couldn’t be fixed. The developers have already begun investigating BF6’s unexpectedly fast TTD bug. </p>







<p>Battlefield 6’s open beta is now over, and the developers have started addressing the bugs players encountered over the weekend. Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/as-the-dust-settles-on-battlefield-6s-first-beta-weekend-devs-confirm-theyre-looking-into-unexpectedly-fast-kill-times-in-the-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Florian Le Bihan posted on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954811982399381685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) earlier today, informing players that the developers are already in the office reviewing BF6’s open beta feedback. Soon after, Le Bihan posts <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">again</a>, asking players to share video examples of suspected super bullet / unexpectedly fast TTD” they might have experienced during the Battlefield 6 Open Beta. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If some of you have some video examples of suspected super bullet / unexpectedly fast TTD that you've recorded in the Battlefield 6 Open Beta – send my way 🙂</p>— Florian – DRUNKKZ3 (@DRUNKKZ3) <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Many players shared video examples, and others shared their experiences in reply. One player <a href="https://x.com/Mokonoise/status/1954848559708221684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> videos of two such instances: one where they were fighting under cover and were shot down instantly, and another where they took delayed damage after downing an enemy. For those unaware, TTD or time-to-death refers to the duration it takes for the player to die after taking damage. </p>

                <p>Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is coming in May 2026, and it's expected to be a gigantic success. But Strauss Zelnick, the head of Rockstar parent company Take-Two, isn't willing to bank on it being a success ahead of launch. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-the-firms-most-robust-release-schedule-and-preparation-for-gta-6s-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>, Zelnick said, "We run scared around here."</p><p>"We're looking over our shoulders. We take nothing for granted and we don't claim success until it occurs. So while I couldn't be more optimistic than I am, all of us have to do the work. We have to deliver something great to consumers and then the consumers are going to tell us just how great it is," he said.</p><p>GTA is one of the biggest, most commercially successful gaming franchises and the pent-up demand for GTA 6 is surely going to make it an enormous success when it releases. One firm is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">predicting 40 million sales and billions in revenue in the first year alone</a>. For its part, Take-Two has not shared any sales or revenue projections for GTA 6, but it's expected to be a juggernaut.</p><p>While Zelnick wouldn't give any specific sales projections, he did say, "I do think it's fair to say that this is perhaps the most highly anticipated property pre-release in the history of entertainment."</p><p>GTA 5 was released in 2013 and has sold more than 215 million copies across all platforms, making it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">one of the best-selling video games in history.</a> Given the game continues to sell, one analyst believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">one of the biggest "threats" to GTA 6 is actually GTA 5</a> and convincing people to leave that game for GTA 6.</p><p>There is also the question of what will happen with GTA Online when GTA 6 comes out. Rockstar has yet to share any information at all about GTA 6's expected online element, but these details should become clear in due time. GTA 6 launches May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, with a PC launch expected later. </p><p>Beyond GTA 6, it's rumored that Rockstar is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">bringing Red Dead Redemption II to Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">launching a GTA 4 remaster.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Former Activision Blizzard president Mike Ybarra <a href="https://x.com/Qwik">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter) that he thinks <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> will "boot stomp" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Call of Duty</a> this year, and that this will push the CoD series to stop being "lazy".</p>
<p>The full post reads: "Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year. But the real win here is CoD won't be lazy anymore, and we'll all get better FPS games for it." He elaborated on his thoughts in a response to another X user, writing:</p>
<p>"CoD has gone downhill for years since then. It's a mess. Cheating, heavy UI/install, rainbow colors. People are sick of it. Luckily BF will force them to change it."</p>

<p>Ybarra even touched on the recent spree of layoffs at Microsoft, the company that owns Activision Blizzard and as such the developers behind the Call of Duty series. Ybarra stated: "CoD will get better because BF will be great. You're blind if you don't see that. Bitter? No, glad I'm not part of the end of Xbox. Upset they can't lead teams to make good games? Yes. Because they layoff all those people for leaderships mishaps."</p>
<p>Since his departure from Activision Blizzard ahead of the Microsoft acquisition, Ybarra has since become CEO of Prizepicks. This sports betting company is notable through a gaming lens as an early adopter of esports betting, which it started embracing back in 2019.</p>
<p>It certainly seems like Ybarra's chips are on Battlefield this year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-top-selling-game-on-xbox-and-playstation-last-quarter">Call of Duty is still no slouch in terms of sales</a>, though positive sentiment has certainly taken a dip in recent years with complaints piling up (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">such as a distaste for certain cosmetics</a>).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/former-blizzard-president-predicts-battlefield-6-will-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-this-year]]></content:encoded>
