			<p><strong>Ubisoft </strong>chief executive officer <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong> has finally spoken outside of the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-third-quarter-growth-thanks-to-assassins-creed-overperformance/">financial earnings reports</a> after kicking off 2026 by confirming a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong>"<em>major reset</em></strong>"</a> that involved huge structural changes to Ubisoft and saw hundreds of developers get laid off, either <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">through cuts</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-ubisoft-toronto-layoffs/">different branches</a> or just <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">full studio shutdowns</a>. </p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">Variety</a>, Guillemot didn't offer any meaningful comments in response to questions about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/1200-ubisoft-employees-kick-off-three-day-international-strike/">strikes across different studios within the company</a> or provide any further comment as to why projects like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong> were cancelled that we hadn't heard before. But he did at least provide an update as to what's happening with a couple of the company's major franchises.</p>



<p>In terms of the <strong>Far Cry</strong> series, Guillemot confirmed that <strong>two new games</strong> are in development, one of which we can likely assume to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-far-cry/">Far Cry 7</a>,</strong> while the other is likely to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-7-far-cry-multiplayer-2025-alaska/">Project Maverick</a></strong>, the multiplayer Far Cry game we first heard about more than three years ago.</p>



<p>The other series Guillemot provided a bit of an update on is, unsurprisingly, <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong>. Guillemot confirmed there are "<em>several</em>" Assassin's Creed titles in the works, <a href="https://wccftech.com/9-assassins-creed-games-are-reportedly-in-development/">which isn't exactly news</a>, but he did add that the projects include both <strong>single-player</strong> and <strong>multiplayer</strong> games. </p>



<p>"<em>We have a solid pipeline underway across <strong>Vantage Studios</strong>. Under the 'Assassin's Creed' brand, several titles are in development, spanning both single-player and multiplayer experiences, with the ambition to further grow a community that exceeded 30 million players last year</em>," Guillemot said. "<em>On 'Far Cry,' anticipation is high, and we currently have <strong>two very promising projects in development</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, in relation to what both franchises are doing outside of video games, Guillemot gave a shout-out to the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/far-cry-tv-series-fx-now-official-produced-fargo-creator-noah-hawley/">Far Cry TV series coming from <strong>FX</strong></a> and confirmed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-dogs-film-is-in-development-and-already-has-its-protagonist/"><strong>Watch Dogs</strong> film has completed production.</a> He also shared his excitement about the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-netflix-adaptation-finds-director-johan-renck/">Assassin's Creed <strong>Netflix </strong>TV series</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-premiere-netflix-ubisoft/"><strong>Splinter Cell Deathwatch</strong> series getting renewed</a> for a second season.  </p>



<p>Overall, if you were hoping for a candid explanation as to what has happened with the company over the last few years, and what Guillemot and the rest of its top brass are doing to turn things around for the better, to say you'll be left wanting is an understatement.</p>



<p>Especially when it comes to Guillemot's response to questions about nepotism with regard to installing his son, <strong>Charlie Guillemot</strong>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/">one of the two co-leaders of Vantage Studios.</a></p>



<p>"<em>Ubisoft was created as a family company, and our strong heritage helps us take a long-term view, prioritizing sustainable growth, creative ambition, and continuity over short-term cycles. This perspective guides our decisions and helps us build franchises, teams, and strategies that endure for decades</em>," Guillemot said.</p>



<p>"<em>I <strong>strongly believe </strong>that Christophe Derennes and Charlie are the right leaders as co-CEOs of Vantage Studios. They bring complementary strengths and experience that make them well-suited for the role. Their appointment was based on their skills, track record, and fit for the role</em>."</p>



<p>As a reminder, Derennes steps into the role after previously leading Ubisoft's North American studios under the company's old structure. Charlie Guillemot's track record, however, includes being given a studio head position at Ubisoft right out of college, with the sole game that studio put out getting cancelled after one year and a major controversy. It also includes leaving Ubisoft to start an NFT-focused company, and one other role within Ubisoft before being given the keys to its biggest franchises.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/supreme-court-strikes-down-trump-tariffs-that-hiked-prices-on-switch-xbox-and-ps5-2000671987</link>
            <guid>1441822</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On Friday, the Supreme Court of the United States of America ruled against the majority of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, including those enacted using a decades-old law reserved for a national emergency. These 2025 tariffs led to a last-minute Switch 2 pre-order delay as well as increased video game console and accessory prices. It’s a major setback for the president, and it could help alleviate rising gaming costs, but it also might all be for nothing as Trump will likely move to reactivate the tariffs using different legal methods.</p> <p>In 2025, President Trump used the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/">1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA</a>) to enact tariffs against a large list of countries. No previous president had ever used the law to impose tariffs against other nations. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-strikes-trumps-tariffs-major-blow-president-rcna244827">The court was split 6-3 in its decision</a> to rule that Trump’s unprecedented use of the IEEPA was illegal, with Chief Justice John Roberts writing the majority opinion.</p>

 <p>“The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration and scope,” wrote Roberts. But the Chief wrote that Congress has never said the language in the IEEPA applied to tariffs, adding: “We hold that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.” Roberts was joined by the three liberal justices as well as two conservatives, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. It should be noted that not all of Trump’s tariffs are now gone, as not all of them were enacted using the IEEPA, but many of his so-called reciprocal taxes have now been ruled illegal.</p> <p>Last year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/president-trump-tariffs-switch-2-pre-orders-delay-us-1851774828">Trump’s reciprocal tariffs</a> and his <a href="https://kotaku.com/tariffs-trump-games-digital-consoles-price-increase-ps5-1851767919?">trade war against countries like China and Canada</a> directly led to <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-price-tariff-trump-nintendo-1851774764">Nintendo delaying pre-orders for the Switch 2 in April.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start on April 9, 2025, in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged,” said the company.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471">In August</a>, the company quietly raised the prices on many Switch accessories and on various models of the original console. Other companies like Sony and Microsoft followed suit with <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">similar price increases on hardware and accessories</a> as a result of tariffs against countries that produce many of the parts needed to manufacture gaming hardware.</p> <p>In a better, less horrible timeline, most of Trump’s trade war tariffs being deemed illegal would lead to video game hardware prices going down. But we don’t live in that timeline. President Trump has many different legal avenues for reinstating many of the now-illegal tariffs, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianplatt.bsky.social/post/3mfcfvbtvds2m">as helpfully pointed out by <em>Bloomberg</em> in this chart.</a></p>

 <p>Even if all of these legal backup plans fail and he’s unable to get all or most of his precious tariffs made legal again, console and gaming PC prices are likely to keep going up and up and up due to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/ram">ongoing memory shortage</a> caused by AI hyperscalers racing to build massive datacenters. But at least you can take comfort in knowing that Trump is having a bad day today. That’s something, right?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-remake-bluepoint-demons-souls-ps5-sony-playstation-2000671988</link>
            <guid>1441819</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday, the news broke that Bluepoint Games, the first-party PlayStation studio responsible for celebrated remakes of </span><i><span>Shadow of the Colossus</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Demon’s Souls</span></i><span>, has been shut down. According to a Sony spokesperson, the decision to shutter the developer was made “following a recent business review.” It’s terrible news however you look at it, but it’s perhaps especially painful for </span><i><span>Bloodborne </span></i><span>fans, as Bluepoint Games were the fan-favorite front-runners to helm a potential remake of FromSoftware’s 2015 PlayStation 4 game.</span></p> <p><span>The bad news doesn’t stop there, however, as Maxime Foulquier, a solo developer from France, followed up the announcement of Bluepoint Games’ closure with an unfortunately timed announcement of his own. As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Sony-shut-down-Bloodborne-remake-fan-project-before-scrutinized-Bluepoint-Games-closure.1230824.0.html"><i><span>Notebook Check</span></i></a><span>, Sony served Foulquier with a </span><a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/2024582839295950868"><span>cease and desist letter</span></a><span> in March 2025, due to his announcement on X some months prior that he was working on a game called </span><i><span>Bloodborne Top Down Arena.</span></i><span> Several clips of the game, which was actually Foulquier’s second </span><i><span>Bloodborne </span></i><span>remake project, can still be found in separate posts on his X profile, but the video featured in </span><a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1629098568928600066"><span>the original announcement post</span></a><span> has since been removed “in response to a report by the copyright owner.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Although the letter is almost a year old at this point, Foulquier noted that he’s only revealing this information now due to his “immense” disappointment with Sony following their decision to shut down Bluepoint Games. “I’d rather speak about it now, as my disappointment is immense. The disappearance of Bluepoint is a tremendous loss for the industry and for the dream of a </span><i><span>Bloodborne </span></i><span>remake. Why are you making such absurd decisions, Sony?”</span></p> <p><span>Not all is lost, thankfully, as Foulquier noted that he started to “repurpose all the assets” from </span><i><span>Bloodborne Top Down Arena</span></i><span> into a currently untitled, legally distinct project of his own. He also </span><a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/2024850777861136694?s=20"><span>shared a snippet</span></a><span> of the newly repurposed project in a follow-up post, referring to it as “a tribute to </span><i><span>Bloodborne</span></i><span>, set in a medical gothic world inspired by Paris.”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon fans have plenty to get excited about in 2026 as the franchise celebrates its 30th anniversary, and now is the time to pre-order Pokopia if you haven’t already.</p>



<p>Pokopia is a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/life-simulation/" id="2994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-simulation</a> game developed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/koei-tecmo/" id="1193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Koei Tecmo</a>, putting players in control of a Ditto in a mysterious world where humans have disappeared. </p>



<p>If you’re mulling over where to pre-order <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia</a> and want to know what bonuses are available, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-pokemon-pokopia">How Much is Pokémon Pokopia?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Bonuses. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia is priced at $69.99, with the price the same for both the digital and the physical version. </strong></p>



<p>However, the physical version of Pokopia does not include much physical content, and instead provides a virtual Game Card. Rather than a download code, which cannot be re-used, the Key Card can be resold or shared with friends or family.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>There are no special editions of Pokopia offering extra incentives or paid-for pre-order bonuses. However, it remains to be seen whether Pokopia will have paid-for DLC releasing in the future.</p>



<p>Both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a-2/" id="3627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> and Scarlet &amp; Violet had post-launch DLC, which is becoming more commonplace for the Pokémon franchise, so there is every chance Pokopia follows suit.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-pokopia-pre-order-bonuses">All Pokémon Pokopia Pre-Order Bonuses</h2>



<p><strong>There are several pre-order bonuses available for Pokopia, which vary based on where you purchase the game from.</strong></p>



<p>Bonuses range from physical rewards, like a Ditto Sitting Cuties plush or a wooden tray, to in-game rewards, including a Ditto rug and Flat Leaf Plant Decoration. In-game rewards are not exclusive and can be earned through gameplay progression.</p>

</ul>



<p>The table below shows all available pre-order bonuses for Pokopia, and where you need to purchase from to get them. Some rewards are only available in specific regions, including Japanese-exclusive rewards from Amazon Japan, and UK-only bonuses.</p>

            <p>We are just a matter of days away from the release of Resident Evil Requiem, but already leaks are running rampant, causing Capcom to ask its community to 'please, cut it out!'.</p>
<p>As our Connor reported yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-out-resident-evil-requiems-ending-is-being-spoiled-online-as-capcom-fights-to-clean-up-leaks">physical copies of Resident Evil Requiem were obtained ahead of schedule by some members of the public earlier this week</a>. And thanks to this, gameplay and story leaks started making the rounds on the likes of reddit. Sigh.</p>

<p>Capcom did its best to curtail the problem by removing unauthorised videos and whatnot, but it did feel a bit like that man sticking a bit of sellotape over a massive leaking vat of liquid. So, now, the studio is appealing to any potential leaker's better nature, with a firm but fair 'stop it'.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/2024835538251923590/photo/1">social media post</a> shared this afternoon, Capcom wrote: "Please don't post or share pre-release leaks and spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem. We really want everyone to enjoy the game's story and experience as much as possible."</p>
<p>It added its legal department "will continue to issue takedowns and deletion notices for leaks in order to preserve your day-one experience". It then said very reasonably that we don't exactly have much longer to wait until we can all experience what horrors are in store first hand.</p>
<p>"We look forward to seeing all your reactions after release!" Capcom closed.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to launch across PS5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in one week's time, on 27th February.</p>
<p>Our Alex is one of the many here at Eurogamer very keen to play the latest series entry, but unlike the rest of us, he has been able to go hands-on with it already  (what, no I am not jealous <em>at all</em>…). "I left it far more excited for RE9 than I went in," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-final-preview">Eurogamer's Resident Evil Requiem preview earlier this year</a>.</p><p>"I think that mad lot might just do it again. And certainly, with its varying modes of play and dizzying pendulum tempo, it feels like a fitting tribute to thirty years of Resident Evil's brand of survival horror. I am properly desperate to get my hands on the final thing."</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/20/arkheron-preview-the-glorious-battle-royale-lovechild-of-diablo-and-hades/</link>
            <guid>1441798</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Arkheron is doing something we all love in gaming, putting a fresh twist on something familiar. Coming from Bonfire Studios, a team founded by ex-Blizzard Creative Officer Rob Pardo, and whose influence runs through World of Warcraft, Diablo III and Overwatch, Arkheron is a PvP multiplayer dungeon crawler, with teams of three attempting to make it to the top of the tower, slicing their way through enemies and opposing teams, as the playable space shrinks. A team-based, dungeon-crawling battle royale? It’s a brilliant mix.</p>
<p><iframe title="Arkheron Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aouQE7ZzcDE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Arkheron centres around the relics. Each player has four empty slots: two weapons, a Crown and an Amulet, and you fill these by looting treasure chests as you climb the tower. Each relic has its own unique powers, or individual weapon types, and while there are common-level versions, what you’re really looking for are Relics that belong to an Eternal.</p>


<p>There are eight Eternals in the game right now, each with four unique Relics and corresponding abilities. If you collect all four from the same Eternal, you can transform into them, gaining a fifth, ultra-powerful special move as well, giving you a distinct advantage, and, as an added bonus, making you look incredibly cool too.</p>
<p>What it does mean, however, is that you’re stuck as that Eternal for the rest of the match, and that might not be the best choice. There are literally thousands of possible combinations for the gear here, and that includes further bonuses for carrying a split pair of same-type equipment. It’s a dizzying level of customisation, and I can see players really digging into the swirling range of possibilities when Arkheron launches.</p>


<p>You have to get to the top of the Tower first. Every team is dropped into the bottom floor with an expanding field of view letting you see other team drops and enemies, giving you a decent picture of where you want to join the battle. Our team – led by the exceptionally cool Bonfire Studios team member, Raph, – was consistently patient, waiting to see how the map was panning out before making the leap, and that seemed to work well in terms of giving us time to start building up an armoury.</p>
<p>Each floor of the tower is filled with CPU-controlled enemies for you to work your way through, clearing areas so that you’re free to ransack the heady assortment of treasure chests. There’s different levels of chest, so you’ll find plenty of mundane, run-of-the-mill weapons, amulets and crowns, in the lowest level, while the Eternal gear tends to be tucked away in the rare ones that you’ve really had to work for.</p>
<p>As you’re decimating the various enemies on each floor, you’re earning currency to use in the shop. These contain consumables and a selection of gear, too, but they’re also focal points for all of the other teams, and you can suddenly find yourself embroiled in a melee, just because you wanted to pick up some health. We found that a hasty retreat wasn’t so much cowardly as efficient, and we repeatedly lived to fight through another few floors after spying an enemy team and legging it in the other direction.</p>

<p>You can hear enemy footsteps ringing out through the gothic halls, so there’s a nice and clear audible indicator of which way you want to go, much like in other Battle Royales. Running and hiding remains my favourite tactic in PUBG, and I can do that here too, so I was well at home.</p>
<p>I loved the hack-and-slash combat here, though. A mix of Diablo and Hades-esque weaponry and movesets, makes this feel like a multiplayer version of those incredible games, and that is as enjoyable as it sounds. The weight and variety of different weapons and abilities has been tuned really well, and while things definitely become chaotic when you’re facing off against an enemy team, it never felt unwieldy. There’s a few quirks to playing with a controller – there’s not quite the expected level of control, with the controller replicating the way you move with a mouse and keyboard – but I still found myself having a whale of a time.</p>
<p>The battle royale element really comes into play when it starts funnelling the fifteen teams together. At points you have to retreat to the safety of a nearby Beacon, the only thing that will protect you from the Abyssal Storm. Lower floors have plenty of Beacons, but as you climb higher, there are fewer and fewer, leading to an inevitable brawl at the top with a final remaining team.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of customisation too, though thanks to the isometric view during each round, the best view you’ll have of your character, and your teammates, is on the prep screen before you head to the tower. Still, the art direction is really strong throughout, and the Eternals in particular are particularly characterful.</p>
<p>Our hands-on time gave a tantalising glimpse of Arkheron’s possibilities. If you’ve got a steady team of friends to party up with, enjoy the action of games like Hades and Diablo, and love the competition and gameplay loop of a battle royale, you should definitely keep an eye on Bonfire Studios’ first game.</p>

            <p>
Nightsoil is a sombre little top-down narrative adventure about a gong farmer – that is, a collector of human waste – in 1854 London, at the height of the cholera epidemic. Gong farmers were, I understand, required to work after sunset, to avoid causing revulsion among the decent folk. In this case, you’re a gong farmer at the end his tenure, working his final shift alongside his trusty carthorse Ol’ Boy, while reminiscing about his bygone youth and the happier days that might have been.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
This would seem to be an original and moving testament to a despised profession at a very grim time. Except that it’s from the developers of the self-explanatory Top Steed and the “cozy puzzler” Back to Stables, which features a horse called “mischievous George” who looks like he never took a shit in his life. Say what you like about Miniscule Mayhem, but they’re committed to <a href="https://minusculemayhem.com/">the full palette of equine emotions</a>. They’re also fond of turd emojis on social media. Remember when Ben Stiller decided he could do heavyweight drama? Similar emotions.
</p>
<p>
I like that Nightsoil exists, and genuinely admire Miniscule Mayhem for embracing subject matter that is probably as uncommercial as you can get without inflicting stigmata on the player, but after half an hour with it, this game does often feel like a parody of games that propose to undertake Serious Themes. It has hand-drawn flashback sequences featuring lines like “He knew, at that moment, that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.” It also has a Horse Comfort gauge, decreased by the sight of rat swarms. 
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to do gauges in games of this demeanour without looking silly, and while I’ve yet to complete Nightsoil (see below), I’m not convinced it sticks the landing. You’ll need to manage the Comfort gauge as you explore a small urban layout, shovelling shit into barrels by hitting E when you’re told to, unless you’re too nauseated or need to empty your can. You’ll also need to feed Ol’ Boy hay from a sack to keep him calm while you’re off gong farming, and periodically draw water from a well to quench his Thirst.
</p><p>
The horse-and-cart mechanics themselves are a bit simulation-y. To get Ol’ Boy trotting, you tap A and D rhythmically; to back up, you hold both keys at once. Ol’ Boy’s turning circle ain’t great, so it’s hard to gallop around corners without snagging a doorstep and wasting precious seconds putting Ol' Boy into reverse. This is unfortunate, because Ol’ Boy really loves dying of thirst. Ol’ Boy holds water like a sieve made of cobwebs on the surface of Mercury. At such times, one thinks wistfully of Mischievous George, who always appears fully hydrated and also gets to open treasure chests, and wear hats.
</p>
<p>
Serious Games definitely need to be wary of quick-time events, whatever David Cage might tell you. QTEs are innately daft. Nightsoil did not get this memo, though again, I wonder if they're being satirical here. If Ol’ Boy becomes too Discomforted, he’ll refuse to move, and you’ll need to hop off the cart and make soothing noises. If he’s super-stressed out, possibly because you keep galloping him into rat swarms, you must complete a potentially lethal waveform QTE in which you pat his nose or murmur reassurances on cue.
</p>
<p>
My playthrough ended with one of these QTEs. Alas, my fumbling ministrations only further rattled the noble creature (the controls are a bit janky, in my defence). After a few rounds of button-bashing, his poor heart gave out. “’Ol Boy, no!” wailed the gong farmer in despair, as the screen faded to black. I couldn’t stop laughing. Was this the aim, Miniscule Mayhem?
</p>
<p>
Had I managed to play more of Nightsoil before writing this up, I might have discovered one of the following: a) Nightsoil is, in hindsight, a heartbreaking interactive work of period scholarship, whose initial awkwardness soon fades from the mind, b) Nightsoil is secretly a Mischievous George spin-off, guest directed by David Cage c) some secret third thing. If you fancy a go, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4341390/Nightsoil/">it’s on Steam right now</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new Pokémon release is on the horizon with the launch of Pokopia on Nintendo Switch 2, though there are still some who are unsure about what the game entails.</p>



<p>Pokémon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> is set to release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-countdown-exact-release-date-start-times/" id="177262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 5</a>, and excitement levels for the game, developed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/koei-tecmo/" id="1193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Koei Tecmo</a>, are rising. In a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/" id="176556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview with Pokopia</a> at London EUIC, Insider Gaming was left impressed and desperate for more.</p>



<p>If you’re still not sure how Pokopia is different to other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> games and want to know more, this guide has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-genre-is-pokemon-pokopia">What Genre is Pokémon Pokopia?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New forms. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia falls into the life simulation genre and is similar in many ways to the Animal Crossing franchise, along with Xbox 360 classic Viva Piñata.</strong></p>



<p>In Pokopia, players take control of a Ditto with the ability to transform into a human. While Ditto can take the form of any Pokémon, the ability to transform into a human is not common, though it was seen in the Detective Pikachu movie.</p>

</ul>



<p>Players will need to attract new Pokémon to the island by building specific habitats, with some Pokémon being rarer than others, or having other requirements, like a specific time of day. By interacting with Pokémon, players learn new abilities to help shape the environment.</p>



<p>Like Animal Crossing, Pokopia features item collecting and crafting, and there are collectables to find in the world. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-features-does-pokemon-pokopia-have">What Features Does Pokémon Pokopia Have?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia offers full online functionality with up to four players at a time, allowing for local co-operative play and via Nintendo Switch Online.</strong></p>



<p>The Game Share feature allows you to play the game with someone who does not own Pokopia, including those on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2-exclusive-all-platforms/" id="177280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original Nintendo Switch</a>. Additionally, online cloud saves allow players to share an island, without story progression, that can be accessed at any time, without the need for the host to be online.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-is-releasing-the-closest-thing-you-can-get-to-a-real-pikachu/" id="176290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon is Releasing The Closest Thing to a Real Pikachu</a></li>
</ul>



<p>As mentioned, Pokopia sees players learn abilities from other Pokémon, including transformation into specific forms, like Dragonite for flying and Lapras for surfing.</p>



<p>While some buildings have a set format, there’s also the ability to freely create buildings of specific sizes, like Minecraft. You can also invite Pokémon to live in your house, and there are customizable interiors to decorate.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[What Is The Difference Between Pokémon Fire Red & Leaf Green? All Exclusive Differences, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-all-differences/</link>
            <guid>1441774</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Pokémon community has been begging to play Pokémon Fire Red or Pokémon Leaf Green again for years, with physical cartridges and Game Boy Advance hardware becoming harder to get. Nintendo has answered these prayers by announcing Pokémon Fire Red or Pokémon Leaf Green releases in 2026, and the differences are unknown to many.</p>



<p>If you played <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-release-for-switch-next-week/" id="178067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Fire Red or Pokémon Leaf Green</a> when they first came out, you know why they were so special. They were the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> remakes, bringing the classic gameplay of Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow, and updating it for a new generation. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/game-freak/" id="95185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Freak</a> has developed countless remakes since, but this was the first instance.</p>



<p>If you’re new to Pokémon Fire Red or Pokémon Leaf Green, let’s run through both games and what you should consider.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-differences-between-pokemon-fire-red-and-pokemon-leaf-green">All Differences Between Pokémon Fire Red and Pokémon Leaf Green</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The main differences between Pokémon Fire Red and Pokémon Leaf Green are that each game is a remake of a specific Pokemon game, which means there is a ton of game-specific Pokémon tied to both titles, and there are subtle cosmetic differences, too.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-exclusive-pokemon">Exclusive Pokémon</h3>



<p>Comfortably, the biggest factor differentiating the two games is exclusive Pokémon, with Fire Red having specific Pokémon you can only get in the game, and vice versa for Leaf Green.</p>

<p>This isn’t going to apply to the Nintendo Switch versions as much, but whichever original game cartridge you owned, you’d either get a green cartridge for Leaf Green or a blazing-hot Fire Red case.</p>



<p>One thing that will apply to both digital versions, though, is the specific Fire Red or Leaf Green menu screen and loading screens. Outside of this, there really isn’t much difference between the two games at all!</p>

<p><strong>If you have aspirations of collecting every Pokémon in whichever game you’re playing, it doesn’t really matter which version you buy. The only major difference is maybe if you prefer Venusaur over Charizard, or vice versa, and which color you prefer!</strong></p>



<p>Since day one, the aim of Pokémon games has been to collect what you can and trade with a friend, just like you would when collecting Pokémon cards to fill in the gaps.</p>

<p>So, if you buy Pokémon Leaf Green, make sure you have at least one friend in real-life or online who has Fire Red, and you can trade the exclusive Pokémon with each other to fill out your Pokédex.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Final Fantasy 7's multiplatform release had a pretty good month too.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">It was an understandably quiet January in the U.S. games market, with very few new releases and a bit of a comedown from a busy holiday season leaving Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 again the best-selling game of the month, and the PlayStation 5 on top for consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 led hardware in both unit and dollar sales, with the Nintendo Switch 2 taking second in both, according to analysis shared by Circana senior director and analyst Mat Piscatella. Overall hardware spending was up 16% year-over-year, with an increase in Switch 2 spending (admittedly an increase over nothing, as the Switch 2 wasn't out last year) offsetting declines in spending on PS5 (down 17%), Xbox Series (down 27%) and Switch 1 (down a whopping but understandable 79%). Accessories spending was down 5% to $185 million.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In content, spending up was up 3% year-over-year to $4.3 billion, largely driven by a 23% increase in subscription spending. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was once again the best-selling game of the month, followed by NBA 2K26 again in the No.2 spot, and Madden NFL 26 rising from No.4 last month to No.3 in January. Battlefield 6, last month's No.3, dropped to No. 5 in January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only new game entering the top 20 for January was Code Vein II, which came in at No. 11. We did see Final Fantasy 7: Remake leap from No.225 last month to No.9 for January, thanks to its Xbox Series and Nintendo Switch 2 releases. Fallout 4 also made a big jump from No.68 to No.20, possibly thanks both to Season 2 of the Fallout TV show coinciding with a major drop in price on Steam at the end of the month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Piscatella tells IGN that outside the top 20, both Fable Anniversary and Animal Crossing: New Horizons saw significant sales bumps. In the former's case, this was thanks to the new trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fable-the-first-preview">the upcoming Fable game</a>, and in the latter's, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/ACNH_3.0_Update_and_Switch_2_Edition:_All_Details_and_Everything_New">due to the DLC and Switch 2 release</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, total gaming spending reached $4.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Not exactly a thrilling start to 2026, but when has January ever been an explosive month for games?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">January 2026 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li><li>NBA 2K26</li><li>Madden NFL 26</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>EA Sports FC 26</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>Final Fantasy VII: Remake</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>Code Vein II (NEW)</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>EA Sports College Football 26</li><li>Helldivers II</li><li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A*</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>Elden Ring</li><li>Flight Simulator 2024</li><li>Fallout 4</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-has-a-whole-faq-on-why-its-selling-pokmon-firered-and-leafgreen-separately-for-20-each</link>
            <guid>1441768</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has released a lengthy Q&amp;A article discussing its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-get-nintendo-switch-launch-next-week-priced-at-20-each">upcoming Switch re-releases of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a>, and addressed its decision to launch them separately — rather than as part of the Nintendo Switch Online service, like numerous other Game Boy Advance titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response to the question "Why are you handling these classic games differently?" Nintendo <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71365/#s1q4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a>: "In celebration of 30 years of Pokémon, we thought it would be fun to return to the ultimate versions of the original Pokémon adventures in the Kanto region with these special releases."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in response to the question "Will these games also be coming to the Game Boy Advance – Nintendo Classics collection?" Nintendo replies: "These games are being offered as standalone software and are not planned for release as part of the Game Boy Advance – Nintendo Classics collection."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither of these answers seem to address the question of why the games could not <em>also </em>be part of the Switch Online's GBA collection (as a nice way for subscribers to access them at no extra cost) or why the games are priced at $20 each — a cost that has raised many fans' eyebrows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, the whole Q&amp;A reads as a rather defensive list of answers to questions Nintendo has anticipated fans will naturally raise in response to its decision-making here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If these titles are meant to celebrate 30 years of Pokémon, why aren't you releasing the original Pokémon Blue Version and Pokémon Red Version games that launched 30 years ago?" reads another pre-empted question. "We thought users will appreciate the ultimate versions of those original adventures, which add various features and upgrades to the contents of Pokémon Red Version and Pokémon Blue Version," comes the reply. That's fair enough, but then having opened the Red and Blue can of worms, Nintendo goes on to pre-empt another popular question.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Will you add the original Pokémon Red Version and Pokémon Blue Version or other Pokémon games to the Nintendo Classics collections available with Nintendo Switch Online?" It's a question Nintendo fans have asked ever since the first Game Boy titles were announced for Nintendo Switch Online, years ago. In response, Nintendo lists a selection of Pokémon spin-off games which are already available via the service, and then concludes with: "We have nothing to announce regarding any other potential titles."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokemon LEGO Sets</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One notable response suggests that Nintendo sees its launch strategy for FireRed and LeafGreen as likely a one-off: "What about other classic games beyond Pokémon titles? Is this the return of standalone Virtual Console types of offerings?" The response: "We remain focused on offering classic games through Nintendo Switch Online and Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But again, other than Nintendo thinking this solution would be "fun", there's little reasoning given here for why FireRed and LeafGreen will be a costly exception to its usual rule.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Nintendo is unlikely to turn around and say to fans that, really, money is the reason why it is doing this — whether that is the motivating factor here or not. And of course, despite any complaints online, these re-launches will undoubtedly sell very well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other fans have suggested that Nintendo is just technically unable to offer FireRed and LeafGreen via its usual Nintendo Switch Online GBA catalog, which typically allows players to load multiple save states and rewind gameplay. Such antics would likely create havoc for The Pokémon Company, by allowing for easier duplication of Pokémon. With just this list of Q&amp;A answers to go on, though, this remains speculation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon will celebrate its 30th anniversary next Friday, February 27, with its annual Pokémon Presents livestream. Tune in then for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <title><![CDATA[“We’ve Heard the Message Very Clear”: DICE is Focusing on Larger Battlefield 6 Maps, but Don’t Expect Them in Season 2]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-dice-heard-the-message-players-want-larger-maps-battlefield-6/</link>
            <guid>1441723</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Season 2</strong> for <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-now-live-drives-highest-steam-concurrent-count-this-month/">arrived earlier this week</a> after an unexpected <strong>one-month delay</strong>. While we can hopefully trust the <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> teams when they say the length between Season 1 and Season 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-delay-should-remain-isolated-case/">was an isolated case,</a> the new content in Season 2 hasn't exactly set the game's community on fire, and players still have several issues with the new content.</p>



<p>Outside of complaints about the new <strong>VL-7</strong> gas (which a scroll through the r/Battlefield page will show you players are either very positive on or very against), one thing that Battlefield 6 players agree on is that they want larger maps to run around. According to series producer <strong>Phillipp Girette</strong> at <strong>DICE</strong>, in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/dice-has-heard-the-message-very-clear-and-is-now-prioritizing-larger-maps-for-battlefield-6-but-it-takes-a-really-long-time/">PC Gamer</a>, the team is extremely aware of this. But don't hold your breath for a brand new large map coming anytime soon.</p>



<p>"<em>We don't want to spoil too much yet, but we've <strong>heard the message very clear</strong></em>," Girette said on the topic of players wanting larger maps. "<em>You've seen recently in Battlefield Labs that we started testing <strong>Golmud Railway,</strong> one of the older Battlefield maps. That is one of the responses [to that feedback] that we can give there, and the rest is for the future</em>."</p>



<p>So, in a similar vein to how <strong>EA</strong> and Battlefield Studios are pulling on fan-favourite elements of past Battlefields, like bringing back the <strong>Little Bird</strong> helicopter to kick off Season 2, and calling back to <strong>Battlefield 1</strong> by bringing back Operations with <strong>Operation Augur</strong>, an upcoming LTM set to arrive in the final phase of Season 2, we'll also likely see the return of old Battlefield maps, like Golmud Railway.</p>



<p>That's all fine and well, and it's a strategy that will likely add larger maps to Battlefield 6 faster than it would if the Battlefield Studios teams were making them from scratch. But it's not exactly the most exciting proposition to always be looking forward to the return of old maps. The problem, of course, with making brand-new, large scale maps, is how long it takes to make them.</p>



<p>"<em>For the maps, we try to make changes for the ones that are currently in development. And then we look further ahead, as you said. <strong>It takes a really long time to make these maps</strong>. We're somewhat, not limited, but we have to be very targeted in what we do…I think we will definitely take a look at the existing maps, but there's nothing we could announce that is going to happen within Season 2.</em>"</p>



<p>The idea that the team is making tweaks to new maps it already had in development is, again, a good sign and one that shows how the team is trying to respond to player feedback as quickly as it can. But that could also result in those maps just feeling stretched out. We've also seen how EA can overdo it in terms of the size of maps before, just ask anyone who was in <strong>Battlefield 2042</strong> when it launched.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the team is able to strike a good balance and get new, large-scale maps out to players sooner than later, at least for the start of Season 3, if it won't happen in Season 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Square Enix Teases What Fans Pray Is A New Nier Automata Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-3-sequel-square-enix-yoko-taro-2000671960</link>
            <guid>1441714</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been nine years since <a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839"><em>Nier: Automata</em></a> first graced the PlayStation 4 and broke through to players beyond director Yoko Taro’s usual esoteric action-RPG fandom. But there hasn’t been a new game since. Fans are desperate for that to chance. Square Enix just gave them fresh hope.</p> <p>“<em>Nier: Automata</em> to be continued.” That’s how a celebratory trailer during an anniversary livestream on Friday ended. It could mean a lot of things. Fans hope it means <em>Nier: Automata 2</em>, or a fresh RPG within the <em>Nier</em> lineage that goes wherever Taro wants to take it.</p>

 <p>The action-RPG stars an android named 2B in a post-apocalyptic world where human-made robots are at war with invading alien machines. Developed by PlatinumGames, the combat sings and thanks to Taro’s baroque storytelling process, the game must be played and <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-time-nier-automata-ends-it-gets-better-1793524744">finished multiple times</a> to reveal its true secrets.</p>  <p>Set in the same world as <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-nier-replicant-remaster-does-many-good-things-and-o-1846743596">2010’s <em>Nier</em></a>, it succeeded way beyond the cult-classic legacy of the original. A PS4 exclusive when it first launched, Nier: Automata was also a surprising bright spot in a mixed portfolio at Square Enix. The company announced the game surpassed 10 million sales in this week’s anniversary stream. The obvious questions is why <em>wouldn’t</em> the<em> Final Fantasy</em> maker greenlight a sequel?</p>

 <p>2B has been in plenty of other games as a guest character (or costume), and a mobile spin-off <a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958"><em>Nier Reincarnation</em></a> launched in 2021. But there’s never been a proper console sequel. If Square’s latest tease is actually for another mobile game, manga spin-off, or some other sort of transmedia adaptation, fans will riot.</p>

 <h2>What has Yoko Taro been up to?</h2> <p>For all of the love around his games, Taro hasn’t been shy about his struggles to get a new project off the ground. “I often get told stuff like ‘Why aren’t you making a new sequel to&nbsp;<em>NieR</em>?’ or ‘Yoko Taro isn’t doing anything,’ but that’s because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development,” he said <a href="https://kotaku.com/please-stop-cancelling-yoko-taros-games-2000644949">back in 2025</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">９周年記念放送おわりました！ご視聴ご来場頂いた皆様、アリガトウゴザイマシタ！！ <a href="https://t.co/BCNwYjqcIz">https://t.co/BCNwYjqcIz</a> <a href="https://t.co/rdG1KkYeYN">pic.twitter.com/rdG1KkYeYN</a></p> <p>— yokotaro (@yokotaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokotaro/status/2024842023375929506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I’ve actually been working on some stuff, it’s just that it never ended up seeing the light of day,” he continued. “I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven’t been doing anything just because none of the work I’ve done is being released.”</p>

 <p>It’s hard to believe that the guy who only ever appears in public wearing a mask of one of the characters from the first <em>Nier</em> wouldn’t want to keep working on the franchise. He appeared in the this week’s anniversary stream and tweeted about the new sales milestone but hasn’t let any cryptic hints slip about the franchise’s future. Yet.</p> <p>But if we somehow never got a new Nier: Automata game, well, that would be sort of fitting as well. “Life is unfair,” he told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-unfair-a-q-a-with-nier-automatas-director-1795653562">back in 2017</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/</link>
            <guid>1441711</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new interview, Ubisoft Co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed that two new Far Cry projects and multiple Assassin’s Creed games are in development.</p>



<p>Of course, for those in the loop with Insider Gaming, you’d know that we’ve been reporting on these games for the last two years, so Guillemot’s announcement shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p>







<p><span>The two Far Cry games are <span>codenamed ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-story-details/" target="_blank">Blackbird</a>‘ and ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" target="_blank">Maverick</a>‘, with Blackbird being the next mainline Far Cry game and Maverick a</span> kind of extraction shooter.</span> We say “a kind” here because Maverick has been rescoped and iterated multiple times during development, with the last major change coming late last year.</p>



<p>Blackbird has also had problems of its own and has seen the game internally delayed multiple times, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-has-delayed-its-significant-ips-to-improve-game-quality/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-has-delayed-its-significant-ips-to-improve-game-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest delay coming earlier this year</a> as a part of Ubisoft’s announced restructuring. </p>



<p>In the <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/" type="link" id="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, Yves also confirms that multiple Assassin’s Creed games are currently in development, with both single-player and multiplayer experiences.</p>



<p>Three games are understood to be fully “locked in” according to Insider Gaming sources, with Invictus, a multiplayer title, and Obsidian, the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake, scheduled to release later this year. The third game, codenamed Neo (publicly known as Hexe), is now scheduled to release in 2027.</p>



<p>As a part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft’s recent restructuring</a>, two Assassin’s Creed games were internally cancelled. One being the already released mobile game Assassin’s Creed Rebellion, and a second game called Assassin’s Creed Singularity.</p>







<p>Assassin’s Creed Singularity was in development for a couple of years, said sources, and was intended to be a virtual trading card game with Web3 and blockchain integration. The game was scheduled to release on both PC and mobile platforms.</p>

<p>New US video game sales data is live, revealing that PlayStation 5 was the leading console in January 2026 and more. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-was-uss-best-selling-hardware-in-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November</a> 2025, PlayStation 5 was the US’s best-selling hardware; in December 2025, the Nintendo Switch 2 took the lead; and now the PS5 is back in first place at the start of the new year. The US video game sales data also revealed more details, such as the best-selling game, a dip in accessories spending, and more. </p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-5-overtakes-nintendo-switch-2-in-hardware-sales-for-january-2026">PlayStation 5 Overtakes Nintendo Switch 2 in Hardware Sales for January 2026</h2>



<p>The latest US video game stats come from Mat Piscatella’s post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfcbfovqnc2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BlueSky</a>. The analyst first noted that hardware spending increased year-on-year by 16% to $248 million. Switch 2 offset declines, whereas PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and Switch saw declines of 17%, 27%, and 79%, respectively. Despite the decline, PlayStation 5 was the best-selling hardware in January 2026, in both unit and dollar sales. The Nintendo Switch 2 came second. </p>



<p>Accessories spending fell 5% year on year to $185 million, the lowest since January 2020 ($143 million). In January, projected spending on video game hardware, content, and accessories increased by 3% year over year to $4.7 billion. This growth was driven by a 23% rise in subscription spending and a 16% increase in hardware sales. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-january-2026-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game</a> of this month was Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </p>

            <p>The latest set photos from Amazon's upcoming Tomb Raider TV series give us our first look at Martin Bobb-Semple's Zip, as well as Sophie Turner as Lara Croft holding a rather mysterious looking piece of kit.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of potential spoilers for Amazon's Tomb Raider TV series below</strong> (to be clear, I have no idea what the plot is - for this show and just generally in life - but I don't want to accidentally show you too much too soon if you would rather keep an air of the unknown around the upcoming series).</p>

<p>The latest Tomb Raider set photos appear to take place in the same Surrey woods from earlier set photos, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-sophie-turners-lara-croft-and-her-dual-pistols-on-set-of-tomb-raider">saw Turner parachuting in during the day time</a>. These new images, however, appear to take place at night, with Lara now sporting that aforementioned new kit - a mysterious dagger.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15573351/amp/Sophie-Turner-knife-fight-scenes-motorbike-films-new-Tomb-Raider-series.html">Daily Mail</a>, Turner filmed "dramatic knife fight scenes" during the shoot, so I am now wondering if she went to the woods in search of this (potential) artifact. Though, Lara's gloves are <em>slightly </em>different, so maybe not… I guess we will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>In addition to the dagger, Lara also appears to have a retractable pickaxe with her. This tool made an appearance in the animated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> on Netflix if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>As for Zip, Lara's resident tech expert is no longer relegated to being behind an ear piece or computer. As you can see in the images below, Bobb-Semple's Zip is in on the action, and can be seen picking Lara up on a motorcycle.</p><p>I have to admit, I am not sure he is wearing <em>exactly </em>what I would choose to wear if I had to go and scoop my friend up from the dark, rain-soaked woods at night while on a motorbike, but he does look pretty sharp.</p>
<p>Also, I would have liked to see Lara on the front of the bike rather than at the back, but even so, I am very pleased to see motorbikes will be a part of Amazon's Tomb Raider show. Overall, I am really feeling rather optimistic about this adaptation.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we had a wave of cast announcements for Amazon's Tomb Raider series. As well as Turner and Bobb-Semple, the show will also feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Jason Isaacs as Lara's Uncle Atlas and Bill Paterson as Winston</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-lara-croft-actress-spotted-on-tomb-raider-set-with-fans-now-speculating-she-will-play-laras-mother-in-amazons-series">former Lara Croft actress Keeley Hawes was also spotted on set in London</a> earlier this year, with many suspecting she will play Lara's mother Amelia on the show's release.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fleabag and Killing Eve's Phoebe Waller-Bridge <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the show's creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. "It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Waller-Bridge has said of Tomb Raider</a>. "Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is.</p>
<p>"Get your artifacts out... Croft is coming..."</p>

<p>But then again, this is a platform that arguably deserves a second look, despite its well-documented shortcomings.</p>
<p>The brainchild of the late, great Gunpei Yokoi, the Virtual Boy was supposed to be another Game Boy-sized smash hit, but its undercooked tech (Yokoi reportedly wanted to work on it longer than Nintendo would allow), uncomfortable setup, and lack of convincing software support saw it dropped from stores less than a year after its release in 1995.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8yptmow&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Yet, there's nothing <em>quite</em> like the Virtual Boy – outside of those battery-powered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomytronic_3D">Tomytronic 3D handhelds</a> from the 1980s. perhaps. Even when compared to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/meta-quest-3-is-the-best-way-to-play-3ds-and-virtual-boy-in-2024">modern-day Virtual Reality headsets</a>, Nintendo's stab at the technology has a charm all its own – and it's now possible to experience it without having to shell out for an original unit (I'll get to why that's important shortly).</p>

<p>In case you weren't aware, there's no actual working tech inside the modern-day Virtual Boy – it's essentially a caddy into which you place your Switch 1 or 2 (I'd advise you do this gingerly, by the way, as it feels like there's potential for scratches and scrapes on your console's screen, despite the presence of some rubber pads – it's quite an awkward fit).</p>
<p>The image on the Switch's screen is displayed in the famous 'Virtual Boy red', an effect which is reinforced by a pair of red-coloured lenses (these are needed because the main Virtual Boy NSO menu, where box art is displayed, is in colour). The stereoscopic effect comes courtesy of the same lens section that originally shipped with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_04_vr_kit">Labo VR</a> headset – you can even remove the red lens section to reveal it.</p>
<p>While the old and new Virtual Boys look almost identical when placed side-by-side, there are several subtle differences.</p>
<p>The controller port, volume dial, and 3.5mm headphone socket aren't present on the new version, although Nintendo has been cute enough to mould them into the casing regardless. Likewise, the IPD / interpupillary distance and focus controls are purely for show – you can adjust the latter in-app, however.</p>

<p>The stand is also slightly higher on the new model, to allow the Switch console to poke out of the bottom of the main unit.</p>
<p>As for the stand itself, it's possible to use it with the original Virtual Boy, which is good news for those of you who have cracked stands – this is a very common problem on older units, with the failure point being where the two legs 'click' outwards.</p>
<p>Being able to replace the original stand with this new one is great, but it sadly doesn't work in the opposite direction; because it has two prongs that lock into the body of the original 1995 Virtual Boy, the old stand cannot be used with the resurrected model.</p>
<p>It also seems that replacing the 'eye shade' on the 2026 version isn't as straightforward as it was on the 1995 edition. Back in the day, you could easily pop off the existing eye shade and clean or replace it, but with the new variant, it doesn't appear to come away as easily – and I'm not brave enough to force it to find out. However, Nintendo does list it as a separate component on the box, so I'd assume it can be removed when the time comes. (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/gallery-weve-got-the-virtual-boy-accessory-for-nintendo-switch-online">Ollie has done it</a>, although it took "a little bit of force.")</p>
<p>The visual experience is recreated almost flawlessly; I constantly switched between an original Virtual Boy and the new offering to gauge the difference, and while the pixels on the Switch 2's screen are more noticeable than those on the legit VB, the effect is still pretty faithful.</p>
<p>The way audio is handled is similar, too, with the Switch speakers serving as a pretty competent replacement for the Virtual Boy's built-in offerings. The 'fake' 3.5mm headphone jack means you can't connect a pair of wired headphones like you could in 1995, however. You'll have to opt for wireless alternatives in 2026.</p>

<p>On the downside, the biggest drawback of using a Virtual Boy — the fact that you're hunched over, gazing into a table-mounted headset — is also present and correct in this version.</p>
<p>While many people complain about eye strain and headaches when using the machine, my biggest gripe was always the fact that my neck would hurt after even a short period of time. The same is absolutely true here, and, unless you get your seating position totally perfect, you can expect to feel some discomfort after just a few minutes of play.</p>
<p>It's little wonder, then, that Nintendo felt compelled to put an 'Automatic Pause' option into each Virtual Boy game back in the day; when enabled, this encouraged you to take a short break after around 20 minutes – essential not just to avoid eye strain, but also to allow you to stretch your back and move your neck around a bit. The feature is present in all of the games available for this new version.</p>
<p>Nintendo hasn't gone as far as to replicate the Virtual Boy's unique controller, which is a shame but not the end of the world. The dual-pad setup is reproduced well on the Switch Joy-Con's analogue sticks, with the 'A' and 'B' buttons taking the place of the (you've guessed it) 'A' and 'B' buttons of the original pad.</p>
<p>I'm actually of the opinion that the Virtual Boy controller isn't one of Nintendo's finest hours, so I prefer the setup Nintendo has offered here – plus, I dread to think of how much more expensive this thing would be had the company chosen to recreate the pad, as well.</p>
<figure data-uuid="cfaea520a0314"><a title="Review: Virtual Boy Switch 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cfaea520a0314/review-virtual-boy-switch-10.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>While you can adjust the angle of the headset, there's no escaping the fact that it's not a comfortable device to use for prolonged periods — <em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The price of this new Virtual Boy really does need mentioning, because, at almost £70 / $100, it's not what I would call an impulse purchase.</p>
<p>I've already seen people online lamenting how easily they were suckered by Nintendo-related FOMO when it was first announced, and I absolutely get it. The original Virtual Boy is a standard-issue piece of furniture in the gaming room of any self-respecting fan (if it's good enough for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/02/random_of_course_seinfelds_george_costanza_was_a_virtual_boy_fan">George Costanza</a>, it's good enough for me!), so this is a cheaper way of improving your decor, if nothing else.</p>
<p>As I hinted earlier, it's also a hassle-free way of experiencing the Virtual Boy's meagre library, as owning an original unit is fraught with challenges.</p>
<p>I've already mentioned the fragile stand (my first Virtual Boy suffered from this), <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/04/a-fix-for-the-virtual-boys-second-biggest-failing-is-available">but there's also the problem of the glue on the ribbon connectors inside the unit failing over time</a>; like the infamous horizontal lines on a monochrome Game Boy's LCD, the Virtual Boy's monochrome red screens are prone to developing a horizontal line fault similar to that seen on the Game Boy's LCD.</p>
<p>It's possible to repair this fault, but it's not a cheap exercise. During my review period, I was dismayed to notice that my own Virtual Boy had developed this very same issue, so in one way, this new accessory couldn't have come at a better time for me personally.</p>

<p>Ultimately, there's no escaping the fact that, as a concept, the Virtual Boy is utterly flawed.</p>
<p>It would work better as a headset you could attach to your face (something Nintendo actually promised at one point in the '90s, before it became clear the product was a dud), and, while titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/vertical_force">Vertical Force</a> are decent, the system suffers from a dire lack of must-have games, rendering it more of a curiosity than a must-have purchase.</p>
<p>Still, while the Virtual Boy certainly has its problems and isn't something I'd recommend unreservedly, if you're already a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber and have in any way felt curious about Nintendo's most infamous hardware flop, then it's certainly worth a look – even more so when you consider that the company is commited to opening up the system's library with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/two-cancelled-virtual-boy-games-coming-to-nso-in-2026-including-f-zero-spin-off">unreleased titles</a>.</p>
<p>Just expect it to achieve ornamental status in your gaming room sooner rather than later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Finji, the publisher behind indie hits like <em>Tunic </em>and <em>Night in the Woods</em>, has accused social media platform TikTok of creating "racist" and "sexist" generative AI ads for its games without its permission.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tunic-night-in-the-woods-publisher-says-tiktok-is-creating-and-running-racist-genai-ads-for-its-games-without-permission" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">IGN</a>, Finji first became aware of these ads through comments on its non-AI ads from concerned fans. One ad reportedly depicts the protagonist of Finji's game <em>Usual June</em>, a Black woman, in a way that, in IGN's words, seemingly "invokes a harmful stereotype".</p><p>Creatives and businesses on TikTok can choose to opt into a program called Smart Creative, which essentially grants TikTok permission to remix their content and ads with generative AI. You've probably already guessed this, but Finji's account had this option resolutely switched off.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Needless to say, Finji CEO Rebekah Saltsman raised this issue with TikTok's support center, and what follows can only be described as a descent into Kafkaesque absurdity.</p><p>At first, TikTok seems supportive, with a support agent pledging to "raise a ticket" to alert the relevant teams to what's going on. Following that, however, Finji and Saltsman received a response claiming that there was no "indication" of generative AI being used for the ads in question.</p><p>Naturally, a Finji rep then responds by providing evidence that this is not the case, upon which TikTok backtracks and promises to "initiate an internal escalation".</p><p>Finji still can't breathe easy at this point, though, because upon following up with TikTok, the studio was told that it was included in an automated ad initiative, again without its consent, and that said initiative "typically [brings] a 1.4x return on ad spend lift" for those enrolled.</p>
<p>Saltsman and Finji demand that the issue be re-escalated, and TikTok demurs, claiming that it's already passed the issue on to "the highest internal team" available, and that said team has "already provided [its] final findings and actions".</p><p>Finji replies yet again, upon which TikTok pledges to "re-escalate" the problem, but according to IGN and Saltsman, that's the last the studio heard from TikTok, and a followup message sent a few days ago yielded nothing.</p><p>Generative AI is already an intensely controversial topic in the gaming industry, with some studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/divinity-larian-gen-ai-concept-art" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="456b3d42-117f-4386-bca9-617e6237ee89" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">throwing their weight behind it</a> and others <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hooded-horse-no-gen-ai-contracts" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf049e2-a4f8-41a0-b834-8030bfbcc977" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">opposing it for all they're worth</a>.</p><p>To me, though, it seems like this usage of the technology - generating AI ads without the consent of the studio concerned, then seemingly deflecting and even essentially gaslighting the studio into believing that no, it's a good thing, actually - is beyond the pale.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see whether Finji and TikTok's issue gets resolved in future, but judging by the correspondence shared by the studio thus far, I don't think there's much cause for optimism. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
