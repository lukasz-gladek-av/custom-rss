		<p>There’s a new Horizon game coming and it is going multiplatform. LEGO Horizon Adventures is going to be released for PS5, Switch, and PC. All of the platforms will get the game at the same time, at some point Holiday 2024.</p>

<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures is set in the Horizon world and does feature Aloy, with the game having missions and stories inspired by the world. As like other LEGO games, expect to be building all sorts of contraptions, and leaning into the humour that LEGO games have become known for. In the description, Sony has said, <em>“In a distant future, the land is made of LEGO bricks and incredible dinosaur-like machines roam the Earth. Aloy, the game’s leading hero, is found in a cave as a baby and raised by a grizzled huntsman called Rost, who teaches her the way of the wilds. One day, Aloy embarks on a quest to discover her true destiny. Guided by a thousand-year-old hologram of a scientist called Elisabet, Aloy must confront Helis, the leader of a group of sun worshipers who bow to an Ancient Evil shrouded in mystery. There’s much more in store for Aloy and her friends, as their adventure sends them across the tallest mountains and deepest cauldrons — all beautifully recreated in LEGO elements.”</em></p>

            <p>
PowerWash Simulator - gaming's premiere squirt-'em-up - is poised to expand once more, this time venturing forth into Wonderland with a paid DLC inspired by Lewis Carroll's classic tales.
</p>
<p>
The Alice's Adventures Special Pack features five new stages to hose down with gleeful abandon - Wonderland Entrance Hall, White Rabbit's House, Caterpillar's Mushroom, Mad Tea Party, and Queen of Hearts' Court - and there's a new story, told through text messages as is PowerWash Simulator's way, to bind things together.
</p>
<p>
"The whimsical special pack captures the essence of Alice in Wonderland by showcasing iconic visuals and quirky designs," explains publisher Square Enix in its announcement. "Players will enjoy the beautiful environmental art, vivid colours, and unique looks depicted in each level."

<p>
And while the new levels are undoubtedly the focus, developer FuturLab notes the DLC will also introduce a new washer skin, gloves, and outfit, alongside ten new achievements. 
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator's Alice's Adventures Special Pack doesn't have a release date yet, but it'll cost £6.49/€7.99/$7.99 when it eventually shows up on PC (including <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736310/PowerWash_Simulator__Alices_Adventures_Special_Pack/">Steam</a>), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Switch, and Meta Quest.

			<p><em>Note: This is a developing story. More info about Lego Horizon Adventures will be added soon. </em></p>
<p>There have been a <em>lot</em> of Lego crossover games released over the years, but typically they focus on IP that originated outside of gaming (Star Wars, Batman, The Avengers, ect.) Well, over the past few weeks we’ve been hearing rumors that we’d be getting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-forbidden-west/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lego game based on a certain PlayStation IP</a>, and today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> kickoff show, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/lego-horizon-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> was officially announced.</p>
<p>As we see in the first the game’s first trailer, Lego Horizon Adventures looks a bit closer to some of the earlier Lego titles, featuring a somewhat zoomed-out isometric view. It also appears as if the game will feature co-op gameplay and the ability to customize your own hub area. Oh, and yes, as was previously rumored, despite not being primarily a live service game, Lego Horizon Adventures will be launching on both PS5 and PC… and even Switch! You can check out the first trailer for Lego Horizon Adventures for yourself, below.</p>

<p>Lego Horizon Adventures launches on PC and PS5 on this holiday season. What do you think? Willing to give this rather unexpected collaboration a try? Or are these two good flavors that just don’t go well together?</p>

Here’s the full trailer: </p><p><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> is, based on the game’s first trailer, a cartoony and family-friendly spin-off of the <em>Horizon </em>franchise. The main games feature Aloy and her struggle to help humanity after a tragic disaster doomed the planet, filling it with robot dinosaurs and giant electronic crabs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-the-kotaku-review-1792538336&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-the-kotaku-review-1792538336">The first game was a big hit on PS4 in 2017</a></span> and was followed up by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-forbidden-west-the-kotaku-review-1848524470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-forbidden-west-the-kotaku-review-1848524470"><em>Horizon: Forbidden West</em> in 2022</a></span> which arrived on both PS4 and PS5. </p><p>While the combo of Lego and <em>Horizon </em>might seem completely random, the two brands do have some history. In May 2022, Lego and PlayStation teamed up to release <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2022/02/horizon-forbidden-west-is-getting-its-very-own-lego-set/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2022/02/horizon-forbidden-west-is-getting-its-very-own-lego-set/">a very awesome Tallneck Lego set</a></span>. The $80 box included a smaller Watcher robot and a minifig version of the franchise’s main star, Aloy. So, perhaps that set sold incredibly well and led to Lego and PlayStation deciding to expand the crossover into a full game. </p><p>This is just anecdotal, but it took me a few weeks to track down the Tallneck set back when it first came out, as it sold out instantly at my local Lego Store and Target. So yeah, maybe the set proved a bigger hit than anyone expected. But hey, any game with “Lego robot dinosaurs” sounds pretty rad, so I’m excited to play <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> when it arrives on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch later this year.</p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>No More Room in Hell 2 was just revealed during the Summer Game Fest with a brand-new trailer showcasing an eerie, gory, and multiplayer-fuelled romp on an open map that offers unlimited levels of replayability. It’s a nail-biting, permadeath-based game that’s sure to turn heads – it has been more than a decade since the first game was released to an exceedingly positive reception.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-there-is-no-more-room-in-hell">When There Is No More Room in Hell</h2>



<p>No More Room in Hell was a Source mod, released way back in 2011 and presenting players with a low-effort (but highly entertaining) zombie shooter title. In the first-look trailer at No More Room in Hell 2, we see how the team at Lever Games has evolved, bringing about a game that looks equal parts terrifying and brutal.</p>



<p>Here’s the new trailer:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>It’s coming Halloween 2024 and supports up to eight players in a single session. Over the last couple of years, tidbits of information have been revealed by the team, but this is the first official trailer that showcases what’s coming. If you’re looking for something adventurous and meaty to enjoy this year, keep your eyes on this project. </p>

Not the cult classic John Carpenter horror movie from 1982, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-thing">the video game continuation from 2002</a>? Well, it’s coming back, courtesy of remaster specialist Nightdive Studios.</p><p>Announced today at IGN Live, Nightdive, whose revivals of Star Wars: Dark Forces and System Shock have won plaudits from retro video game fans, is now making The Thing: Remastered for PC and consoles in collaboration with Universal Products &amp; Experiences. It’s due out digitally on PC via Steam, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and Nintendo Switch later in 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Thing video game is a third-person survival horror shooter game that continues the story of the Kurt Russell film. Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>In the frozen arctic tundra, a mysterious shape-shifting alien has wiped out the crew of the U.S. Outpost #31 research facility. In The Thing: Remastered, players step into the boots of Captain J.F. Blake, the leader of a United States Army Special Forces rescue team sent to investigate the blood-curdling events that transpired in the original The Thing film. Trapped by the elements and at risk of infection by a horrific entity, Blake must keep his squad together to survive by gaining their trust and ensuring that their fear and paranoia don't get the best of them … or himself.</blockquote><p>The remaster is an upgraded version designed to run on current-generation gaming devices (PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S) up to a 4K resolution at 120FPS. Nightdive has made improvements to character models, textures, and animations, with the implementation of advanced 3D rendering for updated lighting and atmospheric effects.

                <p dir="ltr">The rumors were true--Sony and Lego are partnering to create a Lego game based on the post-apocalyptic Horizon video game series. Sony and Lego previously worked together on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-lego-set-is-on-sale-for-its-lowest-price-ever/1100-6519427/">Lego Horizon brick sets.</a> Lego Horizon Adventures is coming this holiday season to PS5, PC, and Nintendo Switch. Geoff Keighley noted that it will be day-one on all platforms, rather than PlayStation having an exclusivity period.</p><p dir="ltr">The new game was announced at Summer Game Fest, with a cute trailer hosted by a Hot Dog man minifig, for some reason. The trailer showed Aloy and other post-apocalyptic survivors roaming a brick-based wasteland, building a base, trying on various costumes, and taking down recreations of the series' iconic beasts--but as made out of Lego bricks.</p><p dir="ltr">A post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/07/lego-horizon-adventures-launches-holiday-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a> makes it sound as if this will be a retelling of the first game, Horizon Zero Dawn. It also emphasizes the co-op and split-screen aspect, though, which is common for Lego games but was not present in Zero Dawn.</p><p dir="ltr">Horizon is just the latest big-name franchise that got the Lego game treatment. Previous Lego games have taken place in the worlds of Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, DC, Marvel, and Indiana Jones, among others. For this games, Guerrilla is teaming up with Studio Gobo, which has previously contributed to games like Hogwarts Legacy and Redfall.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5449/" data-ref-id="2900-5449">all the biggest games and announcements from Summer Game Fest</a>.</p>

                <p>According to a recent tweet, PlayStation users in Brazil can now pay for digital purchases from the PlayStation Store via an installment plan.</p><p>The tweet features a series of screenshots that appear to show a user purchasing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor/">Jedi: Survivor</a> on the PlayStation Store's mobile app and being presented with the option to pay for the digital purchase all at once, or over the course of a up to four months.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/vitorpsarts/status/1799118957317677204" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🤔 DÚVIDAS: É possível parcelar jogos em promoção?

But assuming the option to pay via a two-, three-, or four-month installment plan is real, it certainly gives PlayStation users with tighter budgets something to look forward to, and could provide a wallet-friendly way for players to get their hands on long-awaited games as soon as they launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2024/2024/06/07/playstation-reveals-lego-horizon-adventures-coming-to-ps5-switch-and-pc-this<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>PlayStation has revealed Lego Horizon Adventures, a Lego brick version of Guerrilla Games' hit Horizon series. Like Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, Aloy returns in Lego Horizon Adventures as the protagonist of the exploration-based adventure game. It's releasing simultaneously on PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC this holiday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Revealed during today's Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, Lego Horizon Adventures seems to take the fun, action, and robot dinosaurs of the Horizon series and turn it all into bricks (literally). However, instead of world-ending threats, Lego Horizon Adventures has a much more comedic and tongue-in-cheek vibe to Aloy's journey, with an emphasis on two-player co-op action. It's being developed by Guerrilla and Studio Gobo.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Lego Horizon Adventures reveal trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cKv41GP4tw0" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>News of Lego Horizon Adventures launching simultaneously on PS5, Switch, and PC might come as a surprise given PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst, who coincidentally used to lead Horizon developer Guerrilla Games, recently said <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/30/playstation-says-live-service-games-will-launch-day-and-date-on-pc-but-single">live-service games will launch day and date on PC while its tentpole single-player releases won't</a>.</p>

<p>However, given Lego Horizon Adventures features co-op, it falls somewhere in between those categories. It's not a live-service game, and while it is spin-off in one of PlayStation's tentpole series, it isn't a tentpole single-player release. But, given the game's lean into co-op elements, it makes sense that PlayStation is giving it the simultaneous-platform release like it did with <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven">Helldivers 2</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/05/30/playstation-reveals-first-look-at-concords-5v5-fps-gameplay-out-this">Concord</a>. Games that fall outside of that category include Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/06/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-rides-to-pc-in-may#:~:text=The%20game's%20Director's%20Cut%20is,co%2Dop%20multiplayer%20Legends%20mode.">which recently launched on PC years after the PlayStation 5 release</a>, and God of War&nbsp;Ragnarök, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/05/30/god-of-war-ragnarok-hits-pc-this-september#:~:text=PlayStation%20has%20announced%20it%20is,a%20September%2019%20release%20date.">which PlayStation recently announced is launching on PC this September</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-salvations-edge-world-first-race-leaderboards-and-progress-so-far/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=destiny-2-the-final-shape-salvations-edge-world-first-race-leaderboards-and-progress-so-far<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="304" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s shaping up to be a very interesting World First Race with <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>‘s Salvation’s Edge raid. We’ve put together some leaderboards and progression stats updates for the World First Race in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>‘s first raid, Salvation’s Edge.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-the-destiny-2-the-final-shape-salvation-s-edge-world-first-race" data-injectable="false">What is the <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> Salvation’s Edge World First Race?</h2> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">Like most MMO’s, <em>Destiny 2</em> features pinnacle PvE content in the form of raids. Players are tasked with putting together their best 6-player fireteam and tackling the game’s hardest content inside of these raids which includes having to kill waves of enemies, solve challenging puzzles, superb coordination and communication, and fighting the most powerful bosses.</p> <p data-characters="571" data-current-count="946" data-injectable="true">Each time a new raid releases for <em>Destiny 2</em> there is a World First Race to see which team can be the first to solve the raid and complete it in its entirety. This is a uniquely challenging scenario because little to no information is known about these raids when they are released, meaning the players are exploring and discovering the raid’s content and puzzles in real time. While most players will have the advantage of being able to look up strategies when they jump into the raid, those competing in the World First Race have to figure things out on their own.</p>
 <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is the latest <em>Destiny 2</em> expansion that was released just a few days ago on June 4, 2024. However, the new raid for the expansion, Salvation’s Edge, was not released until today, three days after the expansion launched. This gave players enough time to finish the story campaign, increase their Light Level, and prepare for the Salvation’s Edge raid which officially opened at 1pm EST.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-is-the-race-going-so-far" data-injectable="false">How is the race going so far?</h2> <p data-characters="19" data-current-count="19" data-injectable="false"><strong>Updated at 5 pm EST</strong></p> <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false">Keep in mind most of the raid teams are being secretive and quiet about their strategies as they learn each encounter, so most of this information is based on what we could figure out just by watching their movements and actions.</p> <h3 id="h-encounter-1-hand-of-the-witness-puzzle" data-injectable="false">Encounter 1 – Hand of the Witness puzzle</h3> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true">We’re now 3 and a half hours into the World First Race and it has turned out to be quite a challenge. Teams scrambled around for over an hour trying to figure out how to even get past the first room. In the first room, Arcane Machines laid throughout the room, with all of them needing to be connected in order to Operate Inscrutable Machinery to proceed forward into the Salvation’s Edge raid.</p>
 <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">Compared to previous raids, this one seems to be a bit more overturned compared to previous raids, which was to be expected with all the hype surrounding <em>Destiny 2: The Finale Shape</em> and its Salvation’s Edge raid. Players seem to be taking a ton of damage, enemy numbers are high, and many enemies appear to be damage sponges as well.</p> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="762" data-injectable="true">For the first room players have to fight waves of enemies while activating plates on the floor in a specific sequence to get buffs that allow them to damage the Hand of the Witness that is slowly reaching down towards them in the room. It’s essentially a timed encounter, and if players don’t deal enough damage to the Hand of the Witness in the specified time, it will wipe the raid and restart the encounter.</p>
 <h3 id="h-encounter-2-herald-of-finality-boss" data-injectable="false">Encounter 2 – Herald of Finality Boss</h3> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">After completing the Hand of the Witness puzzle, teams are granted access to the first boss of Salvation’s Edge: Herald of Finality. Like the first encounter, there appears to be a hard timer to the fight. Once the timer hits zero, the raid is wiped and the encounter starts over.</p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true">It’s hard to tell the exact strategy required here, but the damage output of the Herald of Finality is absolutely insane. Players need to coordinate perfectly while also keeping up with healing to keep the raid alive and equally as much damage to keep up with the hard timer on the encounter.</p>
 <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false">At approximately 4:35, Elysium became the first team to defeat the Herald of Finality and move onto the third encounter.</p> <p data-characters="77" data-current-count="197" data-injectable="false">We will continue to update this section as we learn more about the encounter.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-spring-2024-new-releases<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Swords slice through frozen air as hot blood hisses red on fresh snow, so you know what that means! We're heading up to the frozen North as we take a close look at two brand new units for <em>A Song of Ice and Fire TMG</em>. With new releases for both the Free Folk army and the Winterfell army, we’re traveling up to the wall (and beyond)!</p>
<p>I’ve been consistently impressed with previous releases, which you can check out in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-bolton-starter-set-review">my review of the Bolton Starter Set</a>, and my review of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-late-2023-new-release-review">some late 2023 <em>Song of Ice and Fire TMG&nbsp;</em>releases</a>, but let's see how these two new units stack up!</p>
<h2><em>A Song of Ice and Fire TMG:&nbsp;</em>Harma's Vanguard</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/harmas-vanguard-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg.jpg?itok=Z_c0fgDS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/harmas-vanguard-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg.jpg?itok=hjPgYJAw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These miniatures are so dynamically sculpted, making a huge impression on the table!</figcaption></figure><p>First up, let's take a look at <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/products/sif-harmas-vanguard-ml" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Harma's Vanguard</a>, a new unit for the Free Folk army! The head of Mance Rayder's vanguard, Harma Dogshead led the approach South down the Milkwater - for non-<i>ASOIAF</i>&nbsp;readers all this is to say, she was a Freefolk raider who, notably, hated dogs!</p>
<p>And though she's not included in this set (she was already released as part of <a href="https://www.cmon.com/products/free-folk-heroes-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Free Folk Heroes I</a>&nbsp;years ago), her Vanguard represents a new, highly mobile bright spot in the army. With the only other Cavalry in the entire Free Folk range being the Frozen Shore Bear Riders (extremely cool, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-spring-2022-previews">check them out in our Spring 2022 roundup</a>), Harma's Vanguard can give some much needed ground cover to this army.</p>
<p>As with all Calvary, they get to make a free Maneuver action at the start of their turn. And while their weapons are a bit lacking (their "Crude Weapons" hit on a 4+, and they're rolling 6/4 based on damage), and they don't have great defense (6+), their ability to close the gap on the battlefield is crucial.</p>
<p>Add to that their special Order ability "Planned Approach," which at the Start of Any Turn reads: Target 1 friendly unit in Long Range. Until the end of the Turn, that unit may not be targeted by enemy effects or abilities. When selecting their Action for the Turn, that unit may only declare Charge Actions.</p>
<p>I really like this ability, as it feels very thematic to a Vanguard. Their job is to scope out the battlefield, discovering weaknesses and then alerting the army as to the when and where of the attack! That's just what they're doing with this ability. With a cost of 5 points (and no upgrades available), they open up new potentials for a... gasp! <i>faster</i>&nbsp;Free Folk army list!</p>
<h2><em>A Song of Ice and Fire TMG:&nbsp;</em>Winterfell Guards</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/winterfell-guards-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg.jpg?itok=YEWbyhLg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/winterfell-guards-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg.jpg?itok=lBAq17ts 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will you hold the line for Winterfell? These guys would!</figcaption></figure><p>Next, let's take a look at the <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/products/sif-winterfell-guards-ml?_pos=1&amp;_psq=Winterfell+Guard&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Winterfell Guards</a>. These Guards are described on their play card as "Veterans in their prime," who have staunchly defended the castle walls of Winterfell but now find themselves called to the battlefield in this time of war. One of the ways that I really like this flavor coming to life is in their "Adaptive" special ability, which just says to "Reduce the cost of 1 Attachment in this unit by 1."</p>
<p>What this means is that if I wanted to attach a neutral or Winterfell hero, a special captain, or some other cool "upgrade" to this unit I could do so for 1 less cost. That's a fun little ability, but from a storytelling perspective? Perfection. I think it makes&nbsp;<em>so much sense</em>&nbsp;that a unit comprised of veterans would be able to seamlessly welcome in a leader or specialist within their ranks.</p>
<p>With Longswords hitting on a 3+ (with 7/6/4 dice rolled as their ranks determine), and a decent 4+ defense, these are indeed sturdy warriors. Their two special abilities also seem fairly potent to me. For one, there's the Winterfell Supplies ability, which grants them Precision ("For each Attack Die roll of 6, the Defender does not roll a Defense Die, but instead suffers 1 Wound.") and says that while you control the Combat Zone, your melee attacks will always roll the highest value (7).</p>
<p>There's also the "Improved Defenses" Ability, which says that while you control the Maneuver zone, this unit gains a +1 to Defense Dice Rolls.</p>
<p>So here's the question, are these abilities -- which rely on you controlling specific zones -- actually all that helpful? In my opinion, you never want to be caught in a situation where you're controlling zones&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;for these benefits - they're not quite big enough I don't think - but if you have other ways to make use of these zones, then you've suddenly created a very threatening force here!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/winterfell-guards-closeup-detail-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-.jpg?itok=11L6cLjH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/winterfell-guards-closeup-detail-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-.jpg?itok=AJhnZUzf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Behold a mighty Champion!</figcaption></figure><p>Also included in this unit release is an Upgrade, the Winterfell Champion. He costs 1 (therefore is free for this unit, thanks to the above-mentioned Adaptive trait) and adds Critical Blow ("For each Attack Die roll of 6, the Defender suffers +1 Hit.") and "Enemies Successfully Charged become Weakened." I don't hate this Champ as a free upgrade to this unit, since you're already enjoying free damage from their Precision! So a roll of a 6 will deal 2 automatic damage that your opponent can't even roll to defend against - Nasty!</p>
<h2>How Do They Look?</h2>
<p>As you can see from the above photographs, these <em>A Song of Ice and Fire Tabletop Miniatures Game </em>miniatures - like just about everything else in this line - look absolutely stunning. And though there's no hobby element to&nbsp;<em>ASOIAF:TMG&nbsp;</em>(all models come pre-built and based, much to this busy reviewer's delight) the tradeoff in detail is really impressive. From tufted fur cloaks to a diversity of stances, these units both look incredible.</p>
<h2><em>A Song of Ice and Fire TMG Review: </em>Harma's Vanguard and&nbsp;Winterfell Guards - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Both of these units represent solid additions to their respective armies, but I think that Harma's Vanguard is much more transformative to the Free Folk than the Winterfell Guards are to Winterfell. Sure, it's great to see new Winterfell units, but there's nothing going on with that set that's really breaking the mold. But adding another Calvary unit to the Free Folk? Now that's interesting.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy Harma's Vanguard and/or Winterfell Guards?</h2>
<p>For Harma's Vanguard, if you're looking to add mobility to your Free Folk army, this is an absolute must-buy. For Winterfell Guards, if you like the thought of auto-dealing out multiple hits on good dice rolls, consider it! But know that these Veterans won't completely change your game.</p>

  <p id="avciNX">An important thing to know going into <em>The Watchers</em>, the feature directorial debut of Ishana Night Shyamalan, is that it isn’t a horror movie — it’s folkloric fantasy. That distinction will only matter to people who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYo91Fq9tKY">watched an initial trailer</a> and walk in expecting a focus on scares and violence, instead of on unpacking the mystery and history around the movie’s titular Watchers. Anyone who goes in with the wrong expectations will probably just find <em>The Watchers</em> baffling. It has its share of creepy moments, rising tension, and sudden-blast-of-music jump scares, but as a suspense story, it fizzles out surprisingly early.</p>
<p id="pqwSMf">That may be because the story beats are lined up in a bewildering order, guaranteed to drop the movie’s tension from one act to the next instead of escalating it. While it’d be difficult for any movie to live up to <em>The Watchers</em>’ opening premise, Shyamalan’s version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Watchers-gripping-debut-horror-novel-ebook/dp/B08TP9ZQY5?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Watchers-gripping-debut-horror-novel-ebook/dp/B08TP9ZQY5?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23937331__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23937331__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">A.M. Shine’s 2022 novel</a> does a particularly poor job of paying off the early promise of the story’s setup.</p>

<p id="E2X8Wk">The premise is unusual enough to be intriguing: Mina (Dakota Fanning), a Galwegian pet store worker still harboring deep emotions about her mother’s death 15 years earlier, gets lost in a forest, where she’s clearly being manipulated by beings with supernatural powers. She eventually reaches a glass-fronted shelter roughly the size of a shipping trailer, where three other people: Ciara (Georgina Campbell), Daniel (Oliver Finnegan), and Madeline (Olwen Fouéré) have been living. At night, they lock themselves into the shelter (which they call “the Coop”) and unseen creatures come to stare at them. During the day, the creatures hide in burrows, and the captives are free to roam the forest — but they believe that if they go too far and get caught outside at night, their captors will kill them.</p>
<p id="kd07i3">Most of <em>The Watchers</em>’ appeal comes from all the mysteries in this setup: wondering what the Watchers are and what they want, what secrets the other three captives are hiding, who will inevitably crack first under the pressure the eerie situation puts the group under, and how Mina’s arrival will upset the status quo. The sharp, high-contrast cinematography (from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22724430/lamb-movie-sheep-birth-scenes"><em>Lamb</em></a>’s Eli Arenson) gives these opening chapters a winningly oppressive look, with the golden glow of the Coop extending out into the deep blues and blacks of the nighttime woods. The constant effect of the Coop’s mirrored wall gives the characters an eerie set of duplicates hovering nearby at all times, which Shyamalan and Arenson use to create a hyper-real but still fable-like atmosphere that’s often haunting and unsettling. </p>

<p id="K7Up3A">One visual conceit in particular — foregrounding the mirror images, while diminishing the actual characters and turning them into afterthoughts — is a clever, eerie trick that hints at the film’s larger theme, around duplication. Mina’s parrot, a golden conure, periodically repeats things she says. Mina has a twin (also played by Fanning), who she’s pushed out of her life. Early on, Mina starts seeing an image of herself as a little girl off in the woods, an initial hint of the Watchers’ powers and intentions. But that theme never fully coheres in a satisfying or surprising element: It’s all scattered foreshadowing for a reveal that’s given away early, then repeated over and over in a way that keeps diminishing its impact.</p>
<p id="hYB4l4">Everything about <em>The Watchers</em>’ story and structure seems designed for exactly that sense of diminishing returns. The most compelling mysteries are quickly resolved, mostly through exposition. The tensest part of the movie is similarly resolved long before most cinephiles would expect it to, giving way to more exposition. The film’s third act largely consists of research, reading, and characters telling each other things the audience already knows, but in portentous tones, as if that might add significance. It’s honestly confusing, waiting for the other shoe to drop, then realizing there is no other shoe, just a protracted unraveling of the movie’s initial tension.</p>

<p id="xCkx2A">In theory, the structure could be viewed as a shift from general stakes to personal ones, and from a broad threat to a specific one. In practice, the movie lets its scariest elements go long before the finale, and replaces them with a tediously slow procedural building up to a poorly paced, badly mismanaged conversation. There’s real potential in the story elements here, but they all seem to come in the wrong order, and in some cases, in the wrong locale. It’s as if Shyamalan is trying to tell a story that’s distinctive, different, and unpredictable, but winds up with something mostly distinctive in how badly it misses the basic elements of a thriller. </p>
<p id="fhxD76">It’s easy to imagine a version of this film structured in the opposite order, where a character learns enough about the Watchers’ history and intent to make them more frightening when they appear, and the “trapped in the Coop” scenario lasts longer, feels more central, and is allowed to build the suspense up to the breaking point. It’s much harder to understand how anyone thought a movie could hold on to an audience once all the peril gives way to characters giving speeches and watching videos. </p>
<p id="JDk3Pj">Maybe going in with those expectations in mind will help: When a story is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22740450/horror-movie-tropes-real-fears">built entirely out of fear of the unknown</a>, it’s preposterously difficult to stick the landing without <a href="https://www.avclub.com/a-well-orchestrated-cabal-could-easily-manage-all-of-t-1798224683">eventually disappointing the audience</a>. But even forewarned and forearmed, <em>The Watchers</em> is a strange experience, like watching a fairly solid supernatural suspense movie, then spending half an hour reading the footnotes. </p>

<p>If you've <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/compression-attached-memory-modules-may-make-upgradable-laptops-a-thing-again/">read</a> our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/camm-standard-published-opening-door-for-thin-speedy-ram-to-overtake-so-dimm/">previous coverage</a> of the emerging CAMM standard, you know how excited we are about the ultra-thin modules that can simply be screwed into place on a laptop or portable motherboard. That offers a viable replacement for the now-standard soldered LPDDR RAM, which saves space but is incredibly difficult to repair or replace.</p>
<p>The CAMM standard brings the same easy-to-swap design as the older SO-DIMM RAM stick standard but with a smaller footprint, thermal design, and power usage specially made for portable devices. Reports suggest the XPG Nia will use the low-power LPCAMM2 version of these RAM modules, which will be easily accessible by lifting up the kickstand on the back of the XPG Nia. Alongside a standard M.2 2230 slot for adding more storage, that should make the new handheld much easier to upgrade than the likes of the Steam Deck, which <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/modder-boosts-steam-deck-to-a-bountiful-32gb-ram">requires some serious hacking</a> to push above the standard spec.</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/numberpad-1.jpeg" data-height="1886" data-width="3998" alt="A Dell rendering depicting the size differences between SODIMM and CAMM."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/numberpad-1.jpeg" data-height="1886" data-width="3998">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> A Dell rendering depicting the size differences between SODIMM and CAMM.</p><p>Dell</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only real downside to CAMM2 memory modules, at the moment, is the price; <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/lpcamm2-memory-module-debuts-with-shockingly-high-price-tag-but-fear-not-things-can-only-get-better-as-smaller-memory-players-jump-on-the-bandwagon">a recent CAMM2 offering from Crucial</a> runs $175 for 32GB or $330 for 64GB. That's significantly more than similar, bulkier SO-DIMM modules, but those prices should come down as more device makers and RAM manufacturers start supporting the standard.</p>
<h2>A “circular computing device”?</h2>
<p>Thus far, the XRG Nia's modular design doesn't seem to extend to the planned AMD Phoenix APU or Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor. That said, users will reportedly be able to remove the entire motherboard from the portable case, which can then be inserted into a smaller, screen-free enclosure for a potential second life as an Arudino/Raspberry Pi-like mini-PC.</p>
<p>Adata says it also plans to release the system's 3D design files and pinout details publicly, letting modders and third-party manufacturers design their own cases and accessories. It's all part of what Adata is calling a "circular computing design" that's part of its "sustainable future" initiative.</p>

<p>There are a few other features that set the XRG Nia apart from the waves of me-too Steam Deck clones. In addition to the rear kickstand, the entire screen enclosure slides up on a sort of pivot, providing a shallower viewing angle that requires less neck tilting when holding the device in front of your chest. Adata is also promising a front-facing camera that can be used for streaming as well as eye-tracking, which could theoretically power some fancy foveated rendering tricks for extra graphics horsepower.</p>
<p>It's way too early to know how all of these features will shake out in the move from prototype to final device; <a href="https://x.com/RetroHandhelds/status/1797885352994292036/video/4">reports suggest</a> the company is aiming for a release sometime in 2025. Still, it's nice to see a company trying some new things in the increasingly crowded space of handheld PC gaming devices that Valve has unleashed. If Adata can deliver the portable as an actual consumer product at its target of 1.5 pounds and $600, it could be one to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>I fully understand why people don't want multiple game launchers on their PC. Steam is the default and good enough for (seemingly) most people. It's not your job to compel competition in the market. You want to launch and play games you enjoy, as do most of us.</p>
<p>So when I tell you that <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/marvels-midnight-suns"><em>Marvel's Midnight Suns</em></a> is a game worth the hassle of registering, installing, and using the Epic Games Launcher, I am carefully picking my shot. For the price of giving Epic your email (or a proxy/relay version, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/email-protection/what-is-duckduckgo-email-protection/">like Duck</a>), or just logging in again, you can play a fun, novel, engaging turn-based strategy game, with deckbuilding and positioning tactics, for zero dollars. Even if you feel entirely sapped by Marvel at this point, like most of us, I assure you that this slice of Marvel feels more like the comic books and less like the overexposed current films. Just ask the guy who made it.</p>
<h2>Tactical deckbuilding is fun</h2>
<p>The game was <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/13373/marvels-midnight-suns">very well-regarded by most critics</a>&nbsp;but <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/firaxis-hit-by-layoffs-after-midnight-suns-disappointment-and-departure-of-iconic-creative-lead/">was not a financial success</a> upon release in December 2022, or was at least "underwhelming." Why any game hits or doesn't is a combination of many factors, but one of them was likely that the game was trying something new. It wasn't just <em>X-COM </em>with Doctor Strange. It had some <em>Fire Emblem</em> relationship-building and base exploration, but it also had cards. The cards blend into the turn-based, positional, chain-building strategy, but some people apparently saw cards and turned away.</p>
<p>"Before, I never had an experience where people had expressed disappointment before playing, you know," Jake Solomon, the now-departed director of <em>Midnight Suns</em> and <em>XCOM,</em> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jake-solomon-uncut-heres-our-post-firaxis-gdc-interview-in-full">told Rock Paper Shotgun in an interview.</a> "As we told people from the beginning, it's not an accident, we don't share a single mechanic with <em>XCOM</em>. … And so I think when people play it, they get it, it's really fun, and you can get as addicted to this as you can to <em>XCOM</em>. But I also totally get it when people look at images coming out and go 'What the f*** is that? Are those… are those cards? Cards!?' So yeah, I can sympathise with people for that reason, I guess."</p>

<p>Folks, the cards are fun. The resources you gather go into upgrading your cards, which are all your moves in combat. There are strategies inherent to each character, like chaining attacks, moving enemies through portals, area-of-effect attacks, and the like. But then you can min-max heroes' abilities, focus on your favorite heroes, and laugh when things go horribly awry or ridiculously in your favor.</p>
<p>You don't build one deck in <em>Midnight Suns</em>, you build a whole team of little decks. As a designer for deckbuilder <em>Cobalt Core</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-there-are-861-roguelike-deckbuilders-on-steam-all-of-a-sudden/">told Ars</a>, deckbuilding puts you "in this space where no two turns are ever exactly the same, so players get to keep figuring out new optimal solutions. But even though the options are always huge, they're made up of pretty simple building blocks, so it's not overwhelming."
</p><p>The other big change from <em>XCOM </em> and similar games is a rich use of both a destructible environment and rag-doll enemies. Having Magik set up a portal, then Iron Man blasts a goon through it, then seeing that enemy fly through the exit portal into an overloaded battery that explodes, knocking out two more baddies—it's a great feeling.</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>Even devout Marvel fans will find some characters they'd never delved into previously, like Nico Minoru of the Midnight Suns crew.</p><p>2K/Firaxis</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Comicbook Marvel, not movie-stars Marvel</h2>
<p>The thing that most often happens in between missions is talking. You seek out and talk to your teammates, respond to things they say, go on excursions with them. It gets to the point where you can join a book club with Captain America, Blade, Captain Marvel, and, reluctantly, Wolverine.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>It can be a bit much, but the dialogue and voice acting is well-done, in my estimation. In some comic-book-but-also-movie games, the lack of rights to an actor's face can be hard to get past, if you're used to seeing them in that superhero getup. <em>Midnight Suns</em> has both pretty close approximations of various heroes, or alternate faces that didn't bug me after the first few sightings. And if none of the world-building/friend-making stuff is for you, you can hold a button and skip through toward more goon-bashing.</p>
<p>Solomon noted in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jake-solomon-uncut-heres-our-post-firaxis-gdc-interview-in-full">that same RPS interview</a> that he is a "really, really, like, super Marvel Comics nerd." That comes through in how each character is framed, how they interact, and their motivations. There's still a good bit of the modern Marvel quip quotient, but it's palatable. Going on friend dates with the Scarlet Witch may not be something you seek out in your turn-based tactics, but give it a try. It gives you some motivation to see your heroes succeed and work together.</p>
<p>Epic has <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/marvels-midnight-suns">the base <em>Midnight Suns</em> game free</a> through June 13 at 11 am. You could add on some DLC if you like, with new characters like Storm, Venom, Morbius, and Deadpool (if you're _really_ okay with quipping). You'll see various costumes and in-game currencies available for sale, too, but none of them are at all necessary to play and succeed at the game. If you're enjoying the game, and wish it ran a bit faster, consider <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/midnightsuns/comments/zlm1ka/method_to_bypass_2k_launcher_for_epic_games/">disabling the 2K launcher in the Epic Games version</a>.
</p><p>A lot of games release every day, and some of them end up being games I wish I could have written about and recommended. <em>Midnight Suns</em> has long resided in that mental space for me. For the price of zero dollars, plus whatever level of commitment is required for an Epic Store download, it's an easy game to recommend.</p>

Even though the showcase is essentially a hype trailer for the video game industry, filling in the marketing hole <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23998271/e3-gaming-convention-canceled-death">E3 left behind</a>, Summer Game Fest got its own hype trailer reminding us of what games to expect.</p><p>But even though the SGF hype train has left the station, MC Geoff Keighley has <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-2024-geoff-keighley-sets-expectations-1851516386">cautioned viewers not to get too excited for surprise reveals</a>. During <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2162199165">a Q&amp;A livestream</a>, Keighley said that it’s a quieter year for big releases and announcements compared to last year. He also threw cold water on <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em> fans who are hoping that the game finally gets some kind of update after its initial announcement two years ago.</p><p>The Summer Game Fest keynote presentation begins on June 7th at 5PM ET and will stream on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fthegameawards">YouTube</a>.</p></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-f96d74ae-c501-40f7-9241-ae70dda04dbf"><div><p>Surely there’s a better way.</p><p>Chinese developers Game Science debuted a new trailer for its action RPG based on the classic novel <em>Journey to the Wes</em>t — <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. While light on actual gameplay, the trailer did show the Monkey King pulling his iconic staff weapon out of his ear. I’m pretty sure you’re not supposed to put those all the way in there. <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> launches August 20th on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.</p><br></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-8fa34f60-ba25-4f8b-b458-1440369d36c1"><div><p>Arkham Shadow emerges from the shadows.</p><p>A month ago, we got news that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24145849/batman-arkham-shadow-trailer-vr-meta-quest-3-exclusive">a new <em>Batman: Arkham</em> game was in the works</a>, this time exclusively for the Meta Quest 3.

Unfortunately, <em>Arkham Shadow</em> still doesn’t have a release date — only that it will arrive in fall 2024.</p><br></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-62d7c28b-f317-4567-8830-3439ec7fa5ee"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24173575/civilization-7-summer-game-fest-2k-firaxis-trailer">Civilization 7 is launching in 2025</a></h2><p>It’s been a long wait, but the next <em>Civilization</em> has finally been revealed. At the main Summer Game Fest keynote, publisher 2K officially announced <em>Civilization 7</em>, the first new entry in the strategy series since 2016. We didn’t get any real details or actual gameplay, but instead a very brief teaser trailer that looked a lot like, well, <em>Civilization</em>. But there’s one thing we do know: the game won’t be launching until 2025. More details will be coming in August, according to 2K.</p><div><p>There were some inklings this was coming.

Organized by accessibility consultant and critic Laura Kate Dale, it’s a reaction to events designed to build hype and how disabled gamers too often have to temper excitement with caution over whether revealed games will be accessible. A frustration, Dale told <em>The Verge</em>, driven by “the industry’s unwillingness to be open and transparent about gaming accessibility.”&nbsp;</p><p>Now in its second year, the showcase continues to push back against a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754562/summer-game-fest-women-diversity-geoff-keighley">lack of inclusive gaming events</a> as it grows — it includes <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcurator%2F45010171%2Fsale%2FAccess-AbilitySummerShowcase2024">a dedicated Steam page</a> this year. Already, developers are not only viewing it as an opportunity to show off their games, Dale said, but also as encouragement to implement accessibility earlier in development to be ready for the event. “The idea that a place to proudly promote their accessibility would help push developers to have more features ready at earlier milestones makes me feel like the show is having a tangible impact,” Dale added.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172897/access-ability-showcase-best-games-trailers-2024">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-b879fcce-21cc-4279-8e98-0e89c767d1a9"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24171636/summer-game-fest-2024-how-to-watch">How to watch the Summer Game Fest 2024</a></h2><p>It’s that time of year again.

In <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/">a blog post</a>, the studio explained that the change was made in order to “capture what this game is all about,” as the previous name “didn’t show just how strongly we feel about our new heroes, their stories and how you’ll need to bring them together to save all of Thedas.”</p><p>The studio didn’t reveal much else about the game but did have this to say:</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172872/dragon-age-the-veilguard-reveal">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-ccce7bb3-62b2-4615-ab0a-572614f559a3"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24159055/summer-gaming-events-xbox-showcase-nintendo-direct">Your guide to this year’s summer video game events</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Illustration: Cath Virginia / The Verge</cite></p></figure></div><p>As the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23998271/e3-gaming-convention-canceled-death">corpse of E3 lies a-mouldrin’ in its grave</a>, its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21243981/summer-game-fest-news-events-geoff-keighley-sony-microsoft">spirit marches on</a> in the form of a bevy of video game showcases and events.

The Access-Ability Showcase takes that one step further, curating an entire digital event around games with robust accessibility features. “Our aim is to make sure that if a game looks exciting, you don’t have to worry about getting hyped, only to learn later that a game doesn’t support your needs as a player,” wrote Laura Kate Dale, host of the Access-Ability showcase. The showcase starts on June 7th at 11AM ET on <a href="http://twitch.tv/LauraKBuzz">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FYoutube.com%2FLauraKBuzz">YouTube</a> and will feature viewing options for American and British sign language and audio descriptions.<br></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24159055/summer-gaming-events-xbox-showcase-nintendo-direct">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-9953da6b-c93f-4a3e-a169-8d007cc024e0"></li></ul></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="H5NYBs">Monday afternoon’s Ubisoft Forward 2024 is this year’s exclusive look at everything the major publisher-developer is working on — or, at least, everything it’s ready to share with players. </p>
<p id="vUpeqm">This year’s event likely <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24173629/12-new-indie-games-play-right-now">isn’t going to be an all-out barrage of release dates</a> and new game announcements (much like the previous <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24167070/summer-game-fest-2024-schedule-sgf-e3">Summer Game Fest events</a> from this weekend), but Ubisoft has promised plenty of updates and reveals — here’s how to tune in and what to expect.</p>
<h2 id="MjqkLT"><strong>What time is Ubisoft Forward?</strong></h2>
<p id="UwhFWB">Ubisoft Forward 2024 will stream live on Monday at 12:00 p.m. PT/3:00 p.m. EST/9:00 p.m. CEST with a 30-minute pre-show beginning at 11:2:30 a.m. PT/2:30 p.m. EST/8:30 p.m. CEST. You’ll be able to livestream it here:</p>

<h2 id="igijuN"><strong>What games to expect at the Ubisoft Forward</strong></h2>
<p id="EYV2Oc">and intel on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124341/star-wars-outlaws-story-trailer-release-date"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156633/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-release-date-codename-red"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161951/ubisoft-xdefiant-unable-to-find-match-launch-day-troubles"><em>XDefiant</em></a>. Based on the Ubisoft Forward trailer above, it seems likely that we’ll get gameplay trailers for all of these titles and more. </p>
<p id="aek2Gz"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> already has a release date of Aug. 30, 2024, and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> should be released on Nov. 12, 2024. <em>XDefiant</em> was released on May 21, so expect the showcase to include an overview of upcoming updates and patches.</p>
<p id="jSRRBM">Other than those three huge titles, we aren’t exactly sure what to expect from Ubisoft’s showcase. We’d love to see any update at all on <em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</em>, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171532/summer-game-fest-2024-e3-xbox-showcase-ubisoft-forward">we’re not holding our breath</a>. We’re also hoping to see new trailers for the <em>Splinter Cell</em> remake, but no promises.</p>
<p id="oxJ1hN">Players can also tune into the Ubisoft Forward to get <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/1wiMDtoAYWGz6xzD1Vvu5K/ubisoft-forward-2024-how-and-where-to-watch">Twitch drops and other rewards</a> — just make sure to link your Ubisoft account with your Twitch account if you care about scoring extra trinkets and skins in games, new and old.</p>
