                <p>There's a famous line in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings where Gandalf the Grey explains that a wizard is never late or early. Instead, "he arrives precisely when he means to." Video games, on the other hand, are another matter. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game/" data-ref-id="5000-604117">Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game</a> has been delayed again.</p><p>The game's developers, Private Division and Wētā Workshop, jointly announced that Tales of the Shire will now be released on July 29. Prior to that, Tales of the Shire was delayed from its 2024 release window and was scheduled to land on March 25. Now, fans will just have to wait until summer to move into the virtual Shire.</p><p>In the statement below, the given reason for the delay is that the devs want to ensure "the same cozy experience" is available on all platforms. The note also states that the developers want the game "to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4447318-talesoftheshirenote.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447318" data-ratio="1" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4447318-talesoftheshirenote.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447318"></a><figcaption>The complete message from Tales of the Shire developers Private Division and Wētā Workshop.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4447318-talesoftheshirenote.jpg"></figure><p>There will be no epic quests or ring-tossing into Mount Doom in this game. Tales of the Shire is all about the tranquil lives of Hobbits when they aren't out saving the world or having adventures. Truthfully, Bilbo and Frodo Baggins--as well Sam, Pippin, and Merry--were always outliers among their people. Most of the Hobbits prefer to stay at home in the Shire.</p><p>This game will allow players to create their own Hobbit character, and put together a beautiful home for them. Players can also enjoy simple Hobbit tasks like farming, gardening, decorating, and trading for rare items with fellow residents of the Shire.</p><p>Tales of the Shire will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Steam, and mobile devices via Netflix Games. GameSpot had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tales-of-the-shire-has-a-long-ways-to-go-if-it-wants-to-be-precious/1100-6526616/" data-ref-id="1100-6526616">a hands-on preview for Tales of the Shire</a> last year, which called it "charming" and praised its "good fundamentals," while also stressing the need for several quality-of-life improvements and more compelling gameplay. Hopefully the final version of the game will deliver those adjustments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-marine-2-devs-saber-and-hasbro-partner-for-a-%E2%80%9Ctentpole%E2%80%9D-aaa-game.1114860/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/space-marine-2-devs-saber-and-hasbro-partner-for-a-tentpole-aaa-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Hasbro and Saber Interactive have announced a new partnership to develop a new AAA game from one of the toy giant’s “tentpole IPs”.</p>
<p>Given how big Hasbro is and how many toy ranges and properties they produced, that could be pretty much anything. Hasbro owns Dungeon &amp; Dragons, Transformers, Magic: The Gathering, Monopoly, GI Joe, Battleship, Risk, Jenga, and so, so much more.</p>


<p>Of course, Saber is now best known for their excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, which launched to plenty critical and fan praise last year, and their surprising World War Z adaptation before then. We know their strengths as developers, and the technical prowess of their game engine to throw hundreds or thousands of individual enemies around on screen. It was great when used for a zombie shooter, and the perfect for depicting the Tyranids of 40K.</p>
<p>“We have many new digital collaborations in the works, but I’m especially excited to announce this one today, being a personal fan of many of this team’s games,” Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said in an earnings call. “Hasbro and Saber Interactive will be collaborating on an all-new video game partnership developed by the team behind 2024’s megahit, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Combining high-octane single-player action and amazing multiplayer with Saber’s Swarm tech, this new AAA title, based on one of our tentpole IPs, is sure to be a hit.”</p>
<p>Joining all of the dots, the answer’s pretty obvious.</p>

<p>Saber is clearly making <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/25/larian-boss-says-wizards-of-the-coast-not-to-blame-for-them-moving-on-from-baldurs-gate/">Baldur’s Gate 4</a>.</p>
<p>(Actually my money is on Transformers)</p>
<p>Answering questions, Cocks said that this would be a co-publishing deal, and that it’s specifically tapping the Space Marine 2 team to make the game – which was developed by the company’s main studio in Saint Petersburg, Russia. This sadly seems to reduce the odds of a Space Marine 3 happening, unless that project is already underway and the Hasbro collaboration scheduled to come after that.</p>

In response to the teaser, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tonyhawk/status/1892622967579832757&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tonyhawk/status/1892622967579832757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tony Hawk himself simply replied with eyeball emojis</a></span>, seemingly confirming that, yeah, this is for sure a teaser for a new game. (Xbox on Twitter also replied with the same emoji.) </p><p>Why did this appear in a <em>Call of Duty </em>game? Well, remember that before Activision was a <em>Call of Duty </em>machine, it published all the past <em>Tony Hawk</em> games. So this seems to be a bit of corporate synergy. How fun!</p><p>This is just the latest (and most concrete) evidence of a new <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-new-game-remaster-leak-confirmed-1851765242&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-new-game-remaster-leak-confirmed-1851765242">Earlier this week</a></span> a skateboarder who appeared in the last game, 2020's <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2,</em> claimed he’s appearing in a new <em>Tony Hawk</em> “remaster.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-activision-new-game-confirmed-thps-1851646946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-activision-new-game-confirmed-thps-1851646946">And in 2024</a></span>, Tony Hawk himself claimed the series had a future and that he was working with Activision again. </p><p>And on top of all that, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Wednesday, it was reported</a></span> that Microsoft (which owns Activision) was planning to announce and release a new <em>Tony Hawk </em>game in June as part of a yet-to-be-announced summer event.

Included with an ammo chest of new features, weapons, and more content was the return of the fan-favorite skate-themed map, Grind. The skatepark arena has been brought back mostly as fans remember it, with one exception being a giant, in-game TV screen featuring a very Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater-looking logo and a date of March 4, 2025.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Looks like a teaser for something related to Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater has been found in Black Ops 6’s Grind MP map!</p><p>Announcement on March 4. 👀 <a href="https://t.co/8efl6Qansl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8efl6Qansl</a></p></div>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It stops short of being in-your-face but is still undeniably an eyebrow-raising reference for fans who have been on the lookout for another entry in the Pro Skater series. Rumors that another installment could soon be announced began earlier this week when fellow skater Tyshawn Jones let it slip that he would soon be featured in an upcoming Tony Hawk video game (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-skater-claims-hes-in-a-new-tony-hawk-remaster-about-to-come-out/#google_vignette" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m in a Tony Hawk coming out, so that’s cool,” Jones said during a conversation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3umK3xG7Ly4&amp;t=1s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Breakfast Club podcast</u></a>. “They got a new one they remastering so that’s about to come out. I was in the last one.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a curious comment that had fans excited, with today’s newly revealed Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater Black Ops 6 Easter Egg letting them know when they can expect to learn more. Unfortunately, there’s no telling what exactly that March date has in store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision tried to breathe life into the franchise with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 5</a> back in 2015 but has yet to release another new numbered entry since.

When the king asks to switch from red wine to white, players failed the task when they couldn't fulfil that simple request.</p><p>Warhorse shared the Hotfix 1.1.2 breakdown on <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/hotfix-1-1-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. According to the developers, the primary adjustments include stability improvements and quest fixes. There's also a specific fix for the game on the Epic Games Store. Taken together, these changes may not seem very significant, but they're meant to help players have a more refined experience.</p><p>So far, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has been a massive hit for Warhorse Studios. It sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-tops-1-million-copies-sold-in-a-single-day/1100-6529264/" data-ref-id="1100-6529264">1 million copies in its first 24 hours</a>, and recently passed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-studio-reports-its-approaching-2-million-sales/1100-6529486/" data-ref-id="1100-6529486">the 2 million mark</a> as well. It also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-had-a-huge-weekend-on-steam-and-it-may-get-even-bigger/1100-6529355/" data-ref-id="1100-6529355">peaked at 250,000 concurrent users</a> on Steam. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-mods-are-coming-get-a-first-peek-with-henry-holding-a-fish/1100-6529434/" data-ref-id="1100-6529434">official mod support is coming</a> to the PC version of the game as well.</p><p>Players have also found entertaining details in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-a-secret-ending-you-only-see-if-youre-the-worst-person-ever/1100-6529439/" data-ref-id="1100-6529439">a hidden ending</a> that can only be achieved by letting the main character embrace all of his worst instincts.

                <p>EA and Hazelight Studios have <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/it-takes-two/about/friends-pass" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed information</a> about how Split Fiction's Friend's Pass and cross-play between different platforms work. There's even a free trial for players who don't own the game.</p><p>Similar to Hazelight's previous co-op games like It Takes Two and A Way Out, Split Fiction also offers a Friend's Pass. This allows players who bought the game to connect with someone who doesn't have a copy, and play through the game in its entirety. But this time, Split Fiction's version has some expanded features that weren't in those previous games, such as cross-platform play.</p><h2>How does Split Fiction's work?</h2><p>The first step is that one person has to own the game, whether it'd be a physical or digital copy. The next step is to have a buddy download Split Fiction's Friend's Pass on their chosen platform, whether it'd be PC, PlayStation, or Xbox through their respective digital storefronts. Just be aware that if you and your friend are playing on different platforms, for example PC and PlayStation, both of you need an EA account.</p><p>Next, the person who owns Split Fiction should send an in-game invite to their friend, whom then accepts the invite. Once that step is completed, both players can play through the entire game together.</p><p>What happens if neither of you own the game? No problem. The Friend's Pass offers a free trial for both players which includes the opening stages of Split Fiction. Both players will need to download the Friend's Pass version of the game, and once either of you purchase the full game, progresses can be continued.</p><p>Another aspect to note is that in It Takes Two and A Way Out, the player who was on the Friend's Pass version did not unlock trophies or achievements on their platform, while the one who owned the game did. At least in A Way Out, if the player on the Friend's Pass decides to purchase the full game later on, <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/a-way-out/a-way-out/play-a-way-out-with-the-friends-pass/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">they will retroactively earn the trophies and achievements</a> they would have unlocked while on the pass. It's unknown whether this is the same case for Split Fiction.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AAzbMPitPI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4AAzbMPitPI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>How does cross-play in Split Fiction work?</h2><p>It Takes Two and A Way Out didn't have cross-play, meaning that both players had to be on the same platform in order to play with each other. However, It Takes Two had cross-gen play, meaning that PS4 and PS5 players and Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S players could play with each other as long as they were on the same platform family.</p><p>Split Fiction is only on current-gen consoles, so cross-gen play doesn't exist. However, Split Fiction now offers cross-play, meaning that PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S players can all play together. Cross-play requires both players to sign up for separate EA accounts each, which you can <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help-home/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">make for free</a>.</p><p>Hazelight also has a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/hazelight" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord server</a> with a channel called "Looking for Player" for those who want to play Split Fiction with but don't have anyone available to arrange game sessions.</p><p>Split Fiction launches on March 6 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. In other related news, director Josef Fares recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-takes-two-and-split-fiction-director-shares-his-thoughts-on-ai/1100-6529493/" data-ref-id="1100-6529493">shared his thoughts on AI</a>, and also said that Hazelight Studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-takes-two-boss-says-studio-will-never-make-a-live-service-game/1100-6529501/" data-ref-id="1100-6529501">will never make a live-service game</a>.</p><p>For more Split Fiction coverage, be sure to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/split-fiction-is-shaping-up-to-be-another-great-co-op-adventure-hands-on-impressions/2300-6465704/" data-ref-id="2300-6465704">Split Fiction preview</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, Hazelight Studios announced that their highly anticipated new adventure game Split Fiction will be playable through crossplay across all platforms. This greatly enhances any player's ability to play with their friends since Split Fiction, like Hazelight's prior games, is co-op only.</p>
<p>But there's more. While the studio's previous games also implemented free passes for friends, enticing a casual gamer to play with a more hardcore gamer who bought the game, this time there's an evolution of that.</p>
<p>Through the Friend's Pass Trial, even if neither player owns a copy of Split Fiction, they can still experience a trial version using the Friend's Pass. Once they both download and launch the Friend's Pass version of the game, they will unlock the opportunity to invite each other to play the opening stages of the game together. If they like the game, they can progress if just one of them purchases a full copy of the game, which will be priced at $49.99 when it launches on March 6 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store and the EA app.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | How to Invite a Friend for Free with the Friend's Pass" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AAzbMPitPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Josef Fares and his team garnered widespread acclaim, especially with their latest title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Takes Two</a>, which won several Game of the Year awards. Split Fiction is also about a duo, although a very different one.</p>
<p>This time, players will step into the roles of Mio and Zoe. They're both writers, although one writes sci-fi, and the other fantasy, and they have wildly different personalities. They both find themselves trapped in their own stories after being hooked up to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas. Relying on each other to escape with their memories intact, they work together to master a variety of skills and overcome various challenges as they jump between sci-fi and fantasy worlds in what Hazelight promises will be an unexpected tale of friendship. The full PC system requirements for Split Fiction are available below.</p>

Oh, and PC players can now subscribe to <em>GTA+,</em> Rockstar’s subscription service that provides various bonuses and free games. </p><h2 id="h4928"><a id=""></a>There will now be two PC ports of <em>GTA V</em></h2><p>Rockstar confirmed that PC players who upgrade will get a free one time character transfer option. The company is promising to update and support both versions of<em> GTA V</em> on PC, so people who can’t run the new version or who have lots of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-5-gta-6-mod-ai-npc-legal-youtube-1850749678&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-5-gta-6-mod-ai-npc-legal-youtube-1850749678">mods</a></span> for don’t have to upgrade anytime soon. </p><p>Now, here’s the catch, because there is always a catch: if you upgrade the PC version of <em>GTA V </em>and transfer your<em> GTA Online </em>character, you won’t be able to play with people who haven’t upgraded yet.</p><p>“Please note that to maintain this support, the original version of <em>GTA Online</em> on PC will be a separate instance, and players who remain on that version will not be able to play in sessions together with those on the upgraded version,” explained Rockstar. “PC Players who want to play with each other will need to ensure they’re playing the same version of the game.” </p><p>Rockstar says both versions  will be available to everyone on PC, even first-time buyers, so you’ll always be able to play with your friends. It just might mean you need to have two versions of the game installed depending on who you are playing with, which sounds kind of silly even if I understand why.</p><p>Regardless of that hang-up, its nice to see Rockstar Games finally getting around to updating the PC port of<em> GTA V</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006">even if we are likely less than a year away from the release of <em>GTA 6</em></a></span>. That game won’t be out on PC at launch anyway, so I guess PC players can enjoy a better version of <em>GTA V</em> while they wait for the inevitable port. Let’s hope it doesn’t take three years. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With the launch of <em>Among Us 3D</em>, the VR version will be rebranded, and the new release will unite players across both PC and VR through cross-play.</p><p>The studio says that this “will allow Steam PC users to join cross-platform lobbies with VR players on Meta Quest, Steam VR, PlayStation VR 2, and PICO.”</p><p>It’s not clear yet when the 3D game will be launching, but the studio says that it’s coming soon on Steam. A demo will be available as part of Steam Next Fest on Monday. And while the original 2D version of <em>Among Us</em> will still exist, there will be no cross-play between it and the first-person edition.</p><p>As part of the announcement, Innersloth also revealed a new in-game currency called “stardust,” which will be used to buy cosmetics in <em>Among Us 3D</em>. The studio specified that the currency won’t be used for purchasing any actual game modes or features. Here’s the full roadmap for what has been announced so far:</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/chip-n-clawz-vs-the-brainioids-is-a-co-op-rts-with-chaotic-overcooked-energy-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Brain vs. Claw-n</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Before you even play it, you can intuit a whole lot about the upcoming action-strategy game Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids, just by its absolutely ridiculous name alone. Well, I’m pleased to report that after spending several hours with it, it’s exactly as goofy and over-the-top as the title suggests. This cartoonish co-op adventure gives off a distinct Saturday-morning cartoon vibe with its bright colors, absurd gags, and dorky aliens with wacky voices, and blends 3rd-person action with real-time strategy elements that have really piqued my interest. But don’t be fooled by its family friendly ornamentation! As one might expect from a strategy game with XCOM creator Julian Gollop at the helm, this thing already started to show just how deceptively challenging it can be during my short time with it, which has left me eager to see more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids threw me right into the middle of the action without much context behind its completely bonkers premise – and I was extremely okay with that. I mean, what’s not to get about a reckless human named Chip and a robot kitten named Clawz, fighting against an alien race of brains inside jars called the Brainioids? My co-op friend and I worked our way through increasingly tricky levels filled with relentless alien baddies sent to kill us by someone named General Blobbius (who is not a military general, but the general manager of the Brainioids corporation, because of course he is). If you couldn’t tell already, Chip ‘N Clawz doesn’t exactly take itself seriously, to its enormous benefit. From the brightly-colored levels, dopey looking enemies, and ongoing childish banter, it immediately oozes a kid-friendly charm that lured me into a false sense of security that maybe this would be a pretty easy ride, even though I’d selected hard mode.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Chip ‘N Clawz vs. The Brainioids - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Our objective was the same for most levels: battle our way through alien hordes and destroy the mothership at the far end of the map using a legion of robotic minions as our allies. To do so, we have to work together to collect Brainium (the resource used for building) and make decisions about what to spend it on, whether that be the construction of new factories or to power up individual units so they’re more effective in combat. But what started out as a fairly by-the-numbers action game with light RTS components became more complex with each level, until we found ourselves screaming at the screen and at each other in a panic, as we were overwhelmed by the enemy on multiple fronts. That’s because Chip ‘n Clawz definitely knows what it’s doing in the real-time strategy department, and in between the time I spent running around the map bonking aliens about with my melee weapon, I was toggling over to the build and command modes, which allowed me to construct new facilities or order my minions around, respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are loads of things to consider, as Chip ‘n Clawz slowly introduces new factories to build, units to control, and upgrades to apply to your character’s loadout that modify your abilities. You might, for example, want to take a perk that upgrades all your mining units that gather resources for building so that they’re faster and can withstand more damage from the enemy, or you might instead prefer to just deal more damage with your own melee weapons if you prefer to do more of your own dirty work. Then, during a certain level you might decide to spend your resources on a new artillery depot that supplies your character with a long-range gun, or alternatively you could use that Brainium to construct some stationary turrets to fend off enemies in the area automatically.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The jokey tone combined with frantic levels overflowing with ruthless alien goons reminded me a lot of the Overcooked series.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’re introduced to more and more things to consider, the enemy quickly levels up their tactics as well, which spirals into some surprisingly formidable encounters. One level had me defending our mobile base from enemy attack on three different fronts while controlling dozens of units, while another required me to construct vehicles and jetpacks to reach far away areas in search of resources I needed to win the day. The jokey tone combined with frantic levels overflowing with ruthless alien goons reminded me a lot of the Overcooked series, which uses its seemingly simple mechanics and cheery art to disguise the friendships it will surely ruin in the coming hours. Similarly, Chip ‘n Clawz cleverly disguises its difficulty by being one of the most immediately approachable RTS games I’ve played, luring you into a false sense of security with its third-person action mechanics, but then hilariously kicks you in the face with demanding levels that require you to lean more and more into its complicated RTS mechanics a short time later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I feel like I’ve only seen the tip of the iceberg from this surprisingly deep strategy game, and am looking forward to seeing how crazy things can get in later levels.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/history-evaporating-before-our-eyes-gamers-lament-twitchs-new-video-storage-limits/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          
<p>Popular <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/amazon-not-google-reportedly-buying-twitch-for-1-billion/">Amazon-owned</a> game streaming platform Twitch <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand">announced Wednesday</a> that it will be imposing a 100-hour limit on the archived video highlights users can preserve permanently on the site. And while Twitch says that only 0.5 percent of users will be affected by these new limits, gamers are warning that the move threatens to eradicate large swaths of recent gaming history from the Internet.</p>
<p>Highlights, in Twitch's own words, are a way for Twitch streamers to "show off your best moments to new viewers who land on your channel page." Unlike VOD recordings of full Twitch broadcasts—which are deleted automatically after seven days (or 60 days for Twitch partners)—these highlights provide a more permanent way to maintain an archive of important moments for many Twitch streamers.</p>
<p>That seeming permanence is set to end on April 29, though, when Twitch says it will start to delete content from channels with more than 100 hours of highlights, starting with the least-viewed highlights.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand">announcing the change</a>, Twitch cited the "costly" indefinite storage of these highlights, which it says are responsible for "less than 0.1% of hours watched" across the site. These highlights "haven't been very effective in driving discovery or engagement with viewers," Twitch wrote, and limiting them will "help us manage resources more efficiently... and continue to invest in new features and improvements to more effective viewer engagement tools like Clips and the mobile feed."</p>
<h2>An “incalculable” loss</h2>
<p>On social media, though, many Twitch users are expressing outrage over what the loss of these clips will do to the shared history of their gaming communities. "Who the hell cares about discovery or engagement?" one streamer <a href="https://x.com/MrJimmysteel25/status/1892421085418643523">wrote</a>. "People use highlights to archive, and you're destroying YEARS of speedrunning and other communities' history."</p>
<p>The speedrunning community seems particularly likely to be negatively affected by Twitch's move. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber">VTuber</a> VanityFox <a href="https://x.com/VanityyFox/status/1892588675306815995">points out</a>, "many speedrunners use highlights to document world records and important moments... the amount gaming history they are deleting to save money and shove short form content on your feed is incalculable."</p>
