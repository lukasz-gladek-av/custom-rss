            <p>My liege, I bring more tidings from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> and its Coronations DLC. After <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-apologise-for-crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-not-being-up-to-the-standard-you-deserve">apologising for the add-on "not being up to the standard you deserve"</a> last week, developers PDS Black have released a second patch aimed at smoothing out the edges of in-game oaths that've been causing issues.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-debuts-to-boos-and-jeers-from-the-steam-review-court-largely-thanks-to-broken-oath-breaking">we reported</a> not long after Coronations arrived, it quickly turned into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">another instance</a> of Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-take-first-step-in-response-to-bloodlines-2s-dlc-clan-backlash-with-playstation-refunds-promise-more-info-next-week">rather stepping in it</a> when it comes to DLC. Negative reception was fuelled both by technical issues with the new oaths rulers can take on ascending the throne, and the fact that the publishers were charging for features that are relatively compact, but also a pretty central aspect of any kingly lifespan.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To be fair to PDS Black, it's taken them less than a week to follow up on the promise of more Coronations fixes. Taking a look at the notes for the regal strategy game's freshly-released Update 1.17.1, there certainly isn't a shortage of tweaks, with a bit of balancing and a couple of new features to boot.</p>
<p>Those new additions are "a powerful new event for coronation hosts, allowing you to use your skilled chancellor to break up a neighboring confederation or earn a new vassal or tributary", plus some extra reasons for lovers to be in relationships. I assume the latter includes lines like 'his crown's got like seventy jewels, how sexy's that!' Meanwhile, balancing-wise, zealous characters are now easier to convert to witchcraft assuming their faith's OK with it. The Level six Millet Storage yurt also costs more to build, and "the ‘Divine Marriage’ tenet now has the incestuous trait as a virtue". Say what you want about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a>, its patch notes are rarely boring.</p>
<p>The rest of the bug fixes include, but aren't limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Consolidate the empire/kingdom’ oath: The requirement now fully checks for the title for which the coronation was held, not the current primary title.</li>
<li>‘Purge Pretenders’ oath: Fixed the requirement for the children having a claim on your primary title.</li>
<li>‘Purge Pretenders’ oath: Fixed decision display issues, fixed wrong law displayed in the selection tooltip.</li>
<li>‘Repent’ oath: One pilgrimage is no longer counted as multiple</li>
<li>Removed the requirements for the oath buildings and replaced them with piety/prestige costs</li>
<li>Character Memories about Coronations are now more reliable</li>
<li>The event ‘Fulfilled Oath’ will no longer display "Consolidate the None" upon completing the Reconquer Oath</li>
<li>Forbid Pope and other Heads of Faith from bringing any demands in the ‘Petitioners’ event chain</li>
<li>Upon losing the last Kingdom title, all active oaths are removed, thus preventing a lot of edge cases</li>
<li>‘Install Claimants’ Oath: The decision now properly requires 3+ claimants installed via wars.</li>
<li>Building Oaths now better display the requirements for buildings in held baronies</li>
<li>‘Shape the Realm’ Oath now has an updated building requirement in the decision window</li>
<li>‘Strengthen the House’ Oath now is fully mechanically resolved upon completion</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/573767838266819604?l=english">the full notes here</a>, sire. This patch should hopefully stop you from instantly forgetting they exist or being distracted by some Popely demand.</p>

"Without the modern day storyline and ancient aliens sci-fi stuff, modern AC games are just Witcher 3 clones with stealth mechanics."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They need to stop removing modern day content," added ZeroZelath. "It's honestly one of my favorite parts and that stems from the earlier games. I was actually looking forward to it in Shadows after how Valhalla ended but then... Shadows had literally nothing. It was such a big disappointment on that front. Like genuinely, the modern day stuff is part of how the franchise works so it should always be present in some form and be telling an overarching story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Omg, Ubisoft! STOP REMOVING THE MODERN DAY SEGMENTS!!!" added kamuigui.

"The ending of the game [in the modern day] is literally the bookend to the entire story..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, delving back into the series' previous modern day storyline featuring long-term antagonist Juno would require a bit of re-explaining at this point — but considering how that storyline ended up being dropped and concluded in a spin-off comic, this could have been a good opportunity to do more there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is yet to formally announce its highly-anticipated Black Flag remake, though its existence is an open secret after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-multiple-assassins-creed-remakes-are-on-the-way">years of leaks</a>  — including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-edward-kenway-actor-alleges-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-for-hinting-at-black-flag-remake">from the voice actor behind Edward Kenway himself</a>, as well as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-swirl-as-collectible-maker-admits-there-is-something-going-on">company making collectible figurines for the game</a>.

		<p>As the nights start to draw in, the wind picks up and the rain start to hammer down at this time of year, you might be looking for something to match the changing seasons to occupy your time. Something a bit cosy, but with some spooky vibes, perhaps? Following on from the success of Strange Horticulture, the focus of Bad Viking’s sequel is shifting from providing distinctive flora to your customers to now trying to provide them with amulets, artefacts and gemstones as Strange Antiquities launches today.</p>
<p><iframe title="Strange Antiquities - Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ylk4JVnt2HA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As John and Rob Doncan tell it –&nbsp;the two brothers that make up Bad Viking – there was a heavy degree of what might be described as kismet to creating Strange Horticulture. “We never set out to make a cosy game,” John said, “Rob came home from a dog walk and he’d seen an advert for a gardening company and the word ‘horticulture’ written on it or something. He came home and said, ‘I’ve got something to pitch to you: Strange Horticulture. It’s about running a sort of occult plant shop.’ I was like, ‘Yeah, let’s make that!’ And we dropped everything and was like, how do we make that? What do we do with our budget?”</p>


<p>Those other ideas they were working on, however, provided the basis for this new setting. John explained, “So we were working on a board game like concept and we were working on a point and click adventure game set in our world called Undermere. We were like, ‘Oh, let’s borrow the map idea that we had in our board game, let’s take the setting from the point &amp; click adventure,’ and it all kind of came together. We were just like, ‘Okay, we haven’t wasted the last six months of just kind of creative prototyping and ideas!'”</p>

<p>For many a gardener, a big part of the joy is seeing their garden in full bloom during the summer, of bursts of colour in thick borders, but Strange Horticulture got a little spooky with it. “I guess we liked the idea of your plants being quite sinister,” Rob said, “and they have, you know, unusual properties, but also quite dark properties.”</p>
<p>From there, Nicholas Culpeper’s Complete Herbal as a source inspiration, the 15th century botanist’s book already containing some mysticism and supernatural ideas, and the atmosphere of having the rain pattering on windows, and adding a cat to snooze on the counter –&nbsp;“Which seems like an obvious thing to put in with hindsight,” Rob said, “but it took us a long time to realise that this game needs a cat in it!”</p>
<p>Rob continued, “We knew we wanted to make a relaxed game because obviously it’s kind of like Papers, Please – that’s what we were heavily inspired by – but we find that game extremely stressful and like we were like, okay, let’s go the other way with it. […] Let’s make it relaxed; no timers ever, you go at your own pace.”</p>

<p>Shifting to Strange Antiquities, and there’s a shared tone, but the source material is shifting from to more overtly occult objects and mysticism. John revealed, “When we were researching the game [Antiquities], we went to the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, which is like this anthropological collection that’s, I’d say, loosely curated, because you go in there andthe glass glass cabinets are full of stuff and they’re all handwritten labels on them, and it’s it’s just really cool. And there’s a whole witchcraft section with drawers to pull out.”</p>
<p>Rob quipped, “It’s basically Strange Antiquities: The Museum, so it’s like the perfect place to go research!”</p>
<p>Strange Antiquities has also been a chance for John and Rob to learn how to present their game better. The customer is now front and centre, while you can browse the shelves that you stuff with artefacts, and the investigation desk now out of view when you’re not using it. Of the quality of life improvements, Rob said, “One of the main things about the game is that there’s quite a lot of text and some of it can be a little bit small. So you can zoom in on every item and then you’ve got this magnifying glass as well that can zoom in, so people shouldn’t struggle too much with that.”</p>

<p>John added, “It’s less cluttered, I think. We put the desk in a section at the bottom, it’s got its whole own screen, so everything’s just a bit bigger. But, I mean, for us, the quality of life improvements are in the gameplay.</p>
<p>“We’ve taken our formula from Strange Horticulture and just added more depth to it. So there’s more detective work, more reference materials, and things like adding an index to the book so you can cross search terms. So sometimes a customer will come in and ask for an item, but they don’t what it’s called or you’re not given what it’s called. Where Strange Horticulture would always give you the name and you would look it up in your book, here they’ll say, “I need it for this” and you can kind of go in your index, look up something and it’ll come back and sometimes you have to even cross reference a couple of times. It’s just like adding to like that detective [feel] where we’ve put breadcrumbs all over the place and you have to try and follow the clues to the right answer.</p>
<p>“The clues are scattered, so some sometimes the clue will be in the text of the book, sometimes it will be in the sketch, in the book, sometimes it will be in your gemstone book, sometimes it will be a symbol.”</p>
<p>Rob chipped in, “And there’s layers for the clues as well. Sometimes there’ll be four or five different things that could point you to an item and, you know, you might only notice two of them, but you’ll still get to the answer.”</p>

<p>Providing the background to these games, helping to lend it a relaxing tone is the soundtrack. For the first game, the brothers leant on buying royalty-free tracks to easily slot in, but that’s changed for the sequel.</p>
<p>Rob said, “We’ve got a composer this time around around. It’s a guy called Ben Young, and we’ve been super happy working with him. He’s great. I mean, he seems to love the creative process and he’s got kind of really into designing the sound and we think he’s done a great job.”</p>
<p>Digging into that process a little, John said, “He gave us like a bunch of existing material that he kind of thought would fit and we kind of found ones that we liked for sort of a sound guide, I guess, and then he went out and he put a few themes together and then we kind of had a collaborative discussion on what we liked, what we didn’t like, if we could go a bit more mysterious, this felt a bit like, I don’t know, too jolly or whatever. And he was super receptive to all our feedback and yeah, eventually we just it just sort of like came together and we were just super happy with it and we wouldn’t have too many notes for him.”</p>

<p>Oh, and of course there’s the all important cat. Jupiter, the moggy with the heterochromatic eyes, provides a suitably unusual fluffy companion to sit on your counter and receive regular petting as your mouse cursor passes them by. Once again, it was Rob’s</p>
<p>Rob told us, “His name, Jupiter, comes from Robin Jarvis’s The Deptford Mice, if you’re familiar with that. We read them as kids and they’re kind of, I mean, they’re really dark for kids books.” Jupiter was the alchemist’s cat in that tale, but John recalled that “Rob went into a shop in Italy and there was a cat on the counter. It was like a tabby cat.” But, as Rob noted, “We also gave him heterochromia –&nbsp;that’s the key feature.”</p>
<p><em>Strange Antiquities is out today for PC and Nintendo Switch, with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2885870/Strange_Antiquities">a demo available on Steam</a>, if that piques your interest.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We've known from the Steam concurrent player figures that Borderlands 4 <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has had a strong launch</a>, despite the performance issues that led Gearbox president and CEO Randy Pitchford to <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share some 'advice' with the community</a>.</p>



<p>2K and Gearbox have stayed silent so far, though. Thankfully, Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics has <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/borderlands-4-was-steams-best-selling?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23cbc54f-9348-46e1-a902-bc593d78c6d0_1920x1080.png&amp;open=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> the analyst firm's initial estimates, revealing that Borderlands 4 has already passed two million units sold across all platforms, and one million on Steam alone (750K in the first week), generating over $150 million in revenue. This also means it beat even Hollow Knight: Silksong, at least on Steam, as well as other hot indies like Peak. Despite the launch of a highly anticipated triple-A game like Borderlands 4, the indie games did very well for themselves, with Silksong and Peak at the head of the pack. Even the original Hollow Knight sold another 205K units last week. Lastly, the South Korean cooperative roguelite game Shape of Dreams also sold nearly 200K units, a big success for the two-man indie development team Lizard Smoothie.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Alinea Analytics report also discusses Dying Light: The Beast, which is out tomorrow after being bumped up by one day because <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moved-up-one-day-techland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Techland celebrated the game's one million pre-orders</a>. According to the analyst firm, however, things are a little more nuanced than that. As you might remember, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> started its life as the second Dying Light 2: Stay Human DLC before evolving into its own standalone game. Those who purchased Dying Light 2 Ultimate Edition were entitled to two DLCs, so Techland will provide them access to Dying Light: The Beast. Alinea Analytics infers there are about 700-800K of these users, given that the actual Steam pre-orders for the new game are around 100K, and the rest must be pre-orders from consoles.</p>

The game releases on October 10, but developer Supermassive Games has put a demo up on storefronts for free, and you can play it right now.</p><p>The demo will see you take control of Low and Alone in the game's first area, The Necropolis--an abandoned city in the middle of a desert. Watch out for Monster Baby as you step into Little Nightmares 3 for the first time. You can play the demo solo or with friends in online co-op, but you must be playing on the same platform as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-cross-play-and-cross-saves-explained/1100-6533507/" data-ref-id="1100-6533507">Little Nightmares 3 crossplay</a> is not available. However, it does support cross-generation play, so if you're on a PlayStation 5, you can play with PlayStation 4 users.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Co-Op In Little Nightmares 3 Actually Makes The Game Scarier | GameSpot Preview</p>
      </div>
<p>None of your progress will be transferred to the full release of the game, although there doesn't appear to be an end date for the demo, so you can replay the first area as many times as you'd like to tide you through to the launch date.</p><p>Little Nightmares 3 is the first multiplayer offering in the series, and follows the story of Low and Alone--two best friends looking to escape the haunting Nowhere. While it can be played co-op, you can still play solo with AI controlling the other character. The game releases October 10 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.</p><div title="6532712 - Little Nightmares 3 Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3749" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532712 - Little Nightmares 3 Preorders" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Little Nightmares 3 Mirror Edition | Amazon Exclusive</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$110 | Releases October 10</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDS8LWCH,B0FDS4GBN1,B0FDSJYFQ3&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon-exclusive Mirror Edition</a> costs $110 and includes all of the digital content found in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FDTN2KQS,B0FDR7G47V,B0FDR9641P,B0FDR8H4LN&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$60 Deluxe Edition</a> as well as a handful of collectibles.

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> mod lets folks load directly into any of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>'s boss fights from a dedicated menu, essentially turning the game into a choose your own bottom kicking adventure.</p>
<p>After all, who doesn't crave the ability to deliberately battle the one boss they're actually good at beating over and over again, ego juice coursing through their veins, a roar of sheer powerful ecstacy reverberating around their quarters? Or, you know, you might just fancy some practice ahead of your next full run through the game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Regardless, the mod is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/261?tab=description">Godhome</a> by Cuckson, whose name I'm going to try not to read anything into. They've developed a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> boss scene loader, which does what it says on the tin, letting you hop into any big baddie scrap the game has to offer at any time.</p>
<p>They claim that your progress shouldn't be affected, but also warned that the work-in-progress mod "could corrupt your save data" and recommend you use a 100%ed save they've included in the zip file. "While this mod is loaded, no data will be saved, to prevent corruption or loss of progress in case of using on a main save," Cuckson continued. "If you would like to enable saving, please first disable or remove this mod from your plugins folder."</p><p>Once the mod's loaded, the B key on your keyboard should open up a dedicated menu of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-bosses">different boss fights</a> you can load straight into, from the Savage Beastfly to Chef Lugoli. You'll be dropped at "the closest point to the boss that can be achieved purely through scene loading", which the modder says is often right next to them, and get straight on with the battle. There's also an option from the menu to load up a "safe zone", where you can do a bit of prep or recuperate in between battles.</p>

</figure>
<p>It looks like if you've already completed a run through Skong, you'll essentially be able to live in the boss loader menu, warping around to whichever battle you want to face, which in my book makes this a bit different to the existing teleportation mods for the game. The main ones are '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/156?tab=description">Bonfire Teleport</a>' and '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/46">Stakes of Marika - Rebirth Anywhere</a>' from modder Kassent, which are more focused around making getting around in a conventional Silksong run a lot more convenient in terms of respawns and fast travelling between the established benches. There's also '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/104">Boss retry menu</a>' from Pilout, which lets you retry a specific boss battle right away if you perish during it.</p>
<p>If you want to give Godhome a go, you'll need to grab the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/26">BepInEx 5 with configuration manager</a> framework or head to <a href="https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx">GitHub</a> if you're not using <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d">64-bit Windows</a>. In other recent Silksong news, Team Cherry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-second-patch-is-live-in-steam-beta-includes-fix-for-bug-caused-by-dying-to-bosses-while-killing-them">released its second patch into Steam beta yesterday</a>.</p>

            <p>
Many moons ago, I missed my chance to join a weekly Twilight Imperium play session. Missed my chance, or dodged a bullet? Twilight Imperium is an infamously complicated and backstabby boardgame, the kind of baroque <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> space opera that can swallow up entire days and expose any number of terrible character flaws along the way.</p>
<p>Thank goodness there's now a PC version in the works for Steam, which will at least remove the need to set up the pieces and remember what they do. Here's a trailer.

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5-TK-5JTm4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
It's being adapted by Red Square Games, the Kraków, Poland-based creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slavicpunk-oldtimer">SlavicPunk: Oldtimer</a>. If you've never come across Twilight Imperium before, the gist is that the galactic emperor has popped their clogs and 17 factions are vying to claim the throne.</p><p>"Will you dominate through raw military might, control the Galactic Council with persuasive politics, or outmaneuver rivals with secret objectives and clever deals?" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3669430/Twilight_Imperium_Digital/">asks the Steam page</a>. Me, I'll be pledging fealty immediately to whoever has possession of planet Crisp Bowl.
</p>
<p>
The Steam version is based on the boardgame's fourth edition, and will feature animated 3D tactical space battles. But the better news, I think, is that there will be interactive tutorials and tooltips. Even better, it also supports singleplayer. I don't envy anybody developing AI leaders for a game like this. The multiplayer features include online matchmaking, hotseat, and asynchronous play.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date yet. If you can't wait - and your index fingers and eyeballs are up to the strain - you can play Twilight Imperium in Tabletop Simulator. Back in 2015, Paul Dean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tabletop-simulator-mods-copyright">interviewed a bunch of tabletop game creators</a> about how they feel about TTS and its copyright-infringing mods.

So far, the game's reception on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180070/No_Im_not_a_Human/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> has been more muted, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3180070/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a current peak of 8,248 players</a>. But this is a single-player game rather than a multiplayer title, which may be why it hasn't done as well on Steam yet.</p><p>No, I'm Not a Human was developed by a Russian studio called Trioskaz, and it takes place in near-present apocalypse as humanity can no longer survive the intense sunlight during the day. At night, people can come out, but they aren't alone. Visitors--lethal creatures who largely appear to be human--are on the prowl and looking for their next victims.</p><p>The game takes place inside the house of the player's character, as they are approached by people who need help. Some of the people can even help the player survive. But there's always the tension about whether the guests are actually people or simply Visitors attempting to trick players before catching them off guard and murdering their human guests while they sleep. Detecting the subtle differences between humans and Visitors may mean the difference between life and death. Players learn more about distinctive Visitor traits each night through news broadcasts, but some traits are present in both humans and Visitors.</p><p>No, I'm Not a Human is currently only available on PC, however, Critical Reflex plans to port it to consoles at some point in the future.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> will include console-only crossplay, meaning Xbox and PlayStation players can avoid those pesky cheating PC players.</p>
<p>Senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson detailed to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042">IGN</a> the online shooter's crossplay options, activated with a simple on/off toggle. Turned on, console players will be prioritised before PC players fill a lobby. Turned off, and only console players will be included across both PlayStation and Xbox. The option is turned on by default.</p>
<p>"We're very confident but also very keen to what crossplay means for Battlefield 6," said Nickerson. "We've gone the extra mile and put in a lot of effort in terms of balancing the inputs, understanding where the inputs lie [not just] in terms of relationship to general play styles but general performance of what they're good at and maybe what they lack."</p>

<p>Cheating is a major issue across online shooters, with PC players being the most likely to cheat. That's why console players often prefer to exclude them, if possible.</p>
<p>Technical director Christian Buhl said Battlefield Studios is "taking cheating extremely seriously".</p>
<p>"Obviously, cheating is much more prevalent on PC than on console, but we are taking a lot of effort, putting a lot of work into prioritising fighting against cheaters," he said. "We've turned on secure boot. We've got Javelin, our new anti-cheat system, which is required in order to play.</p><p>"So, we're doing a lot on the PC side to clamp down on cheating as much as possible. We have a whole team within Battlefield dedicated to anti-cheat, which includes engineers, analysts who are reviewing things and banning players, and figuring out what the latest cheats are. We have another whole dedicated team at EA to anti-cheat that we work closely with. That's what I can say. Now, we can never win against cheaters, right? Cheaters will always be there. It's a never-ending cat-and-mouse game. I can't promise that there will be zero cheaters if you're playing against PC players. That's just simply not possible, but I can say that we are being extremely aggressive. We see this as critical to the success of - to the health of - the game."</p>
<p>Console players also use aim assist to balance play with PC players using mouse and keyboard for increased accuracy. But aim assist has been "completely redone" from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, said Nickerson.</p>
<p>"We've added aim assist for what we call our 'combat triangle' now - and that's infantry versus infantry, infantry versus vehicles, and vehicles versus vehicles - to give that cohesive experience if you are on controller, compared to, maybe, something that's a little bit easier on keyboard and mouse. So [we're] very dedicated to crossplay, and we're trying to nail it across multiple vectors when it comes to crossplay. It's just such an important aspect for us and for Battlefield 6."</p>
<p>It's all part of the studio's console-first approach. It's this that's led to strong optimisation across consoles.</p>
<p>Buhl explained to <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487">Kotaku</a> the team struggled to get the game running on Xbox Series S due to its lack of memory, with levels crashing. As a result, the team has optimised memory usage in the game which has in turn made the "whole game better and more stable".</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will release on 10th October across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-is-not-coming-to-the-switch-2-any-time-soon">don't expect a Switch 2 release any time soon</a>.</p>

            <p>It's been long enough since I last played an Ace Combat game that I can remember only two things about Ace Combat. 1) This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXB1W8va3eg">Ace Combat 7 cutscene</a> featuring what appears to be a wavy JPEG of a dog, which the Twitterati all thought was an exasperated animator's joke, but which I understand is <a href="https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/Cossette%27s_dog">actually a homage to a real staff member's dog</a> who died before the game's release. And 2) you can 'powerslide' by wilfully initiating a stall, which I think might actually be a move from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-haw-10">Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X</a>.</p>
<p>Delivery Must Complete sort of builds a whole subgenre around the thrill of powersliding planes. How does it do this? The clue is that "DMC" is also an abbreviation of "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>". Here's a trailer. I promise you there will be no further confusing/upsetting references to dogs.</p><!--more-->

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639060/DELIVERY_MUST_COMPLETE/">The Steam page</a> calls it "a high speed Acelike Roguelike with SSSTYLE", featuring cell-shaded, upgradeable jet fighters, four procedural locations, and an enemy roster that includes blimps, dragons and mechs. The story blurb suggests that your overall goal is to make a delivery. What's the return postage cost for an exploded Sidewinder these days?</p><p>In Delivery Must Complete, you will: parry missiles, fire bouncy projectiles out of railguns, deal with varying cloud cover, boggle at fantastical terrain flourishes such as floating islands, build a style meter, and call in orbital strikes. You will not: have limited ammo, though you do have to worry about overheating.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-telltale-devs-announce-release-date-and-episodic-format-for-their-new-%E2%80%98dispatch%E2%80%99-game.1300008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, AdHoc Studio announced the release date for their upcoming game, Dispatch. The 'superhero workplace comedy' will be released on October 22 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>) and PlayStation 5, and it will adopt a bi-weekly episodic format, hearkening back to the Telltale days, with two episodes each week (there will be four in total). The studio was founded by several former Telltale Studios developers (including writers of The Wolf Among Us and Tales from the Borderlands), so that makes a lot of sense.</p>



<p>In Dispatch, you play Robert Robertson, also known as Mecha Man. After his mech-suit is destroyed in a battle against his nemesis, he is forced to take a job at a superhero dispatch center as a dispatcher, not a hero. Robertson must rehabilitate a group of ex-supervillains, managing the roster, navigating office relationships, while also rebuilding his suit for a shot at revenge.</p>



<p>There is a strategic layer to the game. AdHoc promises that every decision made by the player influences the unfolding narrative, affecting Robertson's relationships with the heroes, their allegiances, and the path his story takes. The strategy map can be used to review ongoing emergencies and deploy the right (or wrong) heroes to deal with them. Players must balance the risks and rewards as they make tactical decisions, knowing that each choice can have lasting consequences for the team and the city.</p>



<p>Managing heroes sometimes goes beyond their powers. Each hero has quirks, flaws, and baggage players must navigate to keep the team together. Upgrade their skills and unlock abilities to boost their effectiveness in the field.</p>

Aaron Paul, Jeffrey Wright)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrWos4NShT8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Dispatch features a star-studded voice cast. The protagonist, Robert Roberson, is voiced by renowned actor Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad, Westworld), and players will also find the likes of Jeffrey Wright (The Batman, Westworld, American Fiction), Matthew Mercer (Critical Role, Resident Evil 6, Overwatch), and Laura Bailey (The Legend of Vox Machina, The Last of Us Part II, Marvel's Spider-Man), among others. The full season is priced at $30, and there's a Deluxe Edition priced $40 that includes a digital artbook and four digital comics. PC players can download a demo right now from Steam.</p>

Steam users can access it by switching to the beta branch in the game's library, though the developer warns that game compatibility with previous saves is not 100% guaranteed, and there may be some instability yet.</p>



<p>No doubt many will give it a try, though, as it's a sizable update that introduces many new features. For example, Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord now has a proper stealth system for breaking out of prison and taking on hideouts. NPCs can detect player characters through sight and sound and react to movement, noise, bodies, or alarmed allies. They see more clearly when looking down, but struggle a bit to spot movement above them. Light exposure also plays a role, according to TaleWorlds, with shadows and nighttime offering concealment, while areas lit by torches make you stand out. Natural hiding spots such as tall grass and dark corners also provide stealth, and crouching reduces visibility further.</p>



<p>The NPCs will cycle through four states of alertness: Neutral, Cautious, Searching, and Fully Alarmed. This Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord patch also introduces distraction mechanics with thrown objects and noise-making, but some enemies will resist being diverted. Stealth attacks deal bonus damage to unaware targets, and certain weapons allow for crouched melee and ranged strikes. Players can drag bodies to hide them and prevent alarms from being raised. The player character's roguery skill now also impacts the damage dealt by stealth attacks and your speed and noise level while crouched.</p>



<p>TaleWorlds also added a disguise system to complement stealth. Disguise relies specifically on inconspicuousness; suspicious actions, such as running, drawing weapons, or hiding, raise the guards' suspicion. High suspicion triggers a guard investigation. If you break line of sight, the guards will eventually return to their posts.</p>



<p>If you are identified, your cover is blown, and all guards are placed on full alert and initiate pursuit. Escape requires leaving the settlement, and capture results in imprisonment. If you successfully establish a contact, you can explore the town in disguise, including in any future entries.</p>



<p>But there's more, a lot more to this Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord update, including a significant overhaul for diplomacy. Players can now establish alliances between two kingdoms; each kingdom can have up to two alliances, and an alliance will last for one in-game year. Trade agreements can also be arranged and will feature the same format (up to two, lasting one in-game year). There's even a parley feature with enemy-held settlements containing nobles, where you can select who you wish to speak to from the present nobles.</p>



<p>A new ranged weapon, the Slings, has been introduced to the game. They are one-handed and can be used alongside a shield. Morale and retreat systems have been added to battles and simulations, introducing an extra strategic layer.</p>



<p>There are now up to a hundred random events that players can encounter while playing; these are resolved through pop-up menus, and the resulting choices will influence your character's traits, skills, party, items, or gold. Lastly, there's a new Deserter faction and a new Patrol party type.</p>



<p>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord is being prepared for its first expansion, War Sails, which will enrich the game with a full-fledged naval warfare system and a new race, the Nords. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-to-get-war-sails-nautical-expansion-this-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch in June</a>, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-and-blade-2-bannerlord-war-sails-dlc-gameplay-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed to Fall 2025</a>.</p>

And while the battle continues, so too does the struggle to address the bugs that have come up in the game. Arrowhead Game Studios has released a new patch for Helldivers 2, but there aren't many Super Earth-shattering issues this week.</p><p>The details for Helldivers 2 patch 01.400.002 have been shared on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/553850/announcements/detail/787688820859470906" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/553850/announcements/detail/787688820859470906" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and Discord, and most of the bugs are either crash or audio-related issues. Perhaps the most amusing bug placed Helldivers on top of cave structures while reinforcing. There are two Xbox-specific fixes, including the restoration of SDR colors to their proper brightness level and a bug that prevented players from accessing Helldivers user profiles.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> unleashed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/">Into the Unjust update</a>, which added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/" data-ref-id="2900-6952" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/">lot of new content</a>.

They're pretty hard to kill if you're coming at them with anything less powerful. Helldivers 2 has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stop-shtting-your-pants-helldivers-2-boss-jokes-as-game-passes-500000-concurrents/1100-6534312/" data-ref-id="1100-6534312" data-mce-href="/articles/stop-shtting-your-pants-helldivers-2-boss-jokes-as-game-passes-500000-concurrents/1100-6534312/">surged past 500,000 concurrent players</a>, which may mean that the influx of players from Xbox Series X|S is increasing engagement across the board.</p><p>Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani has said said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-players-lack-of-feedback-is-making-it-hard-for-devs-to-improve-the-game/1100-6534437/" data-ref-id="1100-6534437" data-mce-href="/articles/helldivers-2-players-lack-of-feedback-is-making-it-hard-for-devs-to-improve-the-game/1100-6534437/">the majority of Helldivers 2 players enjoy the game "silently"</a> and don't offer much feedback that the developers can use. However, the team has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/">releasing large patches</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-patch-notes-resolve-more-hard-crashes-buff-new-dust-devil-items/1100-6534486/" data-ref-id="1100-6534486" data-mce-href="/articles/helldivers-2-patch-notes-resolve-more-hard-crashes-buff-new-dust-devil-items/1100-6534486/">smaller updates</a> to keep the game running as smoothly as possible.</p><p>The complete notes for Helldivers 2 patch 01.400.002 are below.</p><h3>Fixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed a crash on cave maps, when host migrates under certain conditions</li><li>Fixed a crash to desktop which would occur if the oil rig was destroyed when the shuttle was on its way</li><li>Fixed a crash when joining someone who is using bombardment stratagems</li><li>Fixed a crash on game start-up</li><li>Fixed an issue where Helldivers were reinforcing on top of cave structures</li><li>The Dragonroach can now be damaged with fire and/or gas</li><li>Rupture Warriors now track moving clients accurately, leveling the difficulty level of attacks between client and host</li><li>Fixed an audio bug related to Devastator projectiles</li><li>Rebalanced caves audio levels</li><li>Fixed a rare instance where Primary Weapon audio would go missing</li><li>(Xbox specific) SDR colors no longer appear faded</li><li>(Xbox specific) Fixed a bug where users could not access a Helldivers User Profile in several screens</li></ul><h3>Known Issues</h3><h3>New</h3><ul><li>Extraction shuttle or beacon may clip into terrain, preventing extraction.</li><li>The Nuke Nursey Drill can be dropped on top of the cave by the ship becoming inaccessible</li></ul><h3>Technical</h3><ul><li>Keybinds do not save after restarting the game using the AZERTY and French keyboard settings</li><li>Players who are using the Microsoft IME languages are unable to type Korean, Japanese and Chinese symbols in chat.</li></ul><h3>Gameplay</h3><ul><li>Some weapons may be missing sound effects for some players.</li><li>Explosives can cause Helldivers hidden behind terrain to ragdoll</li><li>Weapon scopes may have an incorrect FOV that doesn't match the weapon</li><li>Interrupting the reload animation of the StA-11 SMG may result in the magazine being consumed without reloading it.</li><li>The right gauntlet of SR-64 Cinderblock armor is misaligned</li><li>Capes don't display in the Armory tab and instead show a blank grey cape</li><li>Weapon customization doesn't correctly display stats for sway and reload times</li><li>'Leviathan' and 'Warrior' change to 'Advocate' when used in Super Destroyer names</li><li>XP modifier is not applied accurately for high CR Eradicate and Blitz missions.</li><li>Extraction Shuttle can sometimes clip into the ground while landing</li></ul>

        </p>Game Creator<figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>Founder of “Shirosawa Games.” His debut title was a major hit, earning him the reputation of a “genius creator,” but his later works failed to replicate that success.</p><p>He has two younger sisters; the youngest, Ruri, was one of the six girls who vanished in Akihabara 13 years ago in an unsolved case known as the “Akiba Disappearance.”</p><p>Struggling with stagnation in his daily life, he declares that he will make a comeback by creating a game based on the very incident that took his sister away. Its title: <em>AKIBA LOST</em>.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“Not only am I becoming a character in a game this time, but working alongside IzanagiGames and professionals from the gaming industry itself has been a real challenge for me. I’m truly delighted that what we’ve created together as a team can cross borders and reach people all over the world.</p><p>“Also, by facing this project together with such talented cast members from various fields, I feel the game has gained depth and even sparked a kind of chemistry. It’s an unknown challenge, but as I imagine people around the world picking up and enjoying this game, I know I’ll want to grab a controller myself.”</p><p><strong>◆ Aoi Shinjo</strong> (portrayed by Sayuri Matsumura)<br>Maid</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>The younger sister of Shinjo, she works as the manager of a maid cafe in Akihabara.</p><p>Since the disappearance of the youngest sibling, Ruri, she has often clashed with her brother, who immersed himself in game development, and they have barely seen each other over the past 13 years. After graduating high school, she has continued to live in Akihabara, the site of the incident.</p><p>While usually somewhat aloof, she occasionally reveals a tsundere side that captivates many of her customers.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“I’m Sayuri Matsumura, and I play the maid in <em>AKIBA LOST</em>.</p><p>“I’m thrilled that my long-time dream of becoming a ‘resident of the 2D world’ in the anime and game universe I love has finally come true. From Akihabara, we’re bringing the culture that Japan is proud of to the world.</p><p>“We did a lot of shooting. A LOT.</p><p>“The unique filming method used for games was completely new to me, and it revealed connections and hidden hints in the story that you can’t fully grasp from the script alone. I’m looking forward to seeing everyone enjoy discovering them while playing.</p><p>“Each cast member has a carefully crafted story, which is truly impressive.</p><p>“I hope everyone dives deep into the world of <em>AKIBA LOST</em>!”</p><p><strong>◆ Yukimi Kurahashi</strong> (portrayed by Momoko Tanabe)<br>Game Streamer</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>Working as a designer at “Shirosawa Games,” she is also a popular game streamer, having gained a following through his streaming, which began out of his love for games.</p><p>A huge fan of Shinjo’s debut work, White Crash, he moved to Tokyo and boldly joined Shirosawa Games. He looks up to Shinjo and co-founder Takasawa like older brothers.</p><p>His occasional Tohoku accent that slips out during streams adds to his charm and draws in viewers.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“It was such an honor to play a character in a game for the first time! In dramas and films, audiences usually enjoy witnessing our characters’ lives, but in this game, becoming the protagonist and ‘choosing’ the story yourself is such a fresh experience.</p><p>“There are cinematic scenes, but many are depicted in still images, so for me—someone used to acting in full-motion video—the challenge was to convey a real, lifelike sense of presence so players can truly enjoy the game.</p><p>“In life, we make many ‘choices’—big decisions as well as small, everyday ones. I hope players enjoy the world they encounter when they experience these choices through the story.”</p><p><strong>◆ Moe Kurosu</strong> (portrayed by Misato Ugaki)<br>Gourmet Writer</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_014.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>A gourmet writer specializing in Akihabara, known for exploring the district through its food.</p><p>Originally a generalist writer, she became fascinated with Akihabara’s subculture about three years ago and now introduces everything from long-established restaurants to the latest trend cafes and unique eateries with her own unique perspective. While her casual outfits are accessorized to match her style, her tough, tomboyish personality is reflected in her rugged car.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“I grew up playing games like <em>Puyo Puyo</em>, <em><a title="Series > Pokemon [44 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/pokemon">Pokemon</a></em>, <em>Zelda</em>, and <em>Mario Kart</em> without even realizing it, and I take pride in everything I’ve learned from them. That’s why it’s such an honor to actually be part of a game myself.</p><p>“My character, Moe Kurosu, is outwardly a playful, big-eating older sister, but she is also a tough, strong-willed adult woman. Portraying this duality was a challenge on set.</p><p>“While I was initially unsure about the unique filming style used for games, I had so much fun collaborating with the staff to bring the world of <em>AKIBA LOST</em> to life. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as we enjoyed creating it!”</p><p><strong>◆ Kokone Nagato</strong> (portayed by Yui Oguri of AKB48)<br>Underground Idol</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_018.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>An underground idol active mainly in small live houses in Akihabara. She belongs to the group “Baby☆Macaron.” While exuding the full charm of a classic idol, her ambition to succeed is unmatched. She switches clearly between on- and off-stage life, often wearing high-end brand clothes and accessories outside of performances.</p><p><strong>Actor Comment</strong></p><p>“I’m truly honored to be part of this project, which crosses the boundaries of games and television!</p><p>“<a title="Series > Persona [91 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>lly, I’ve always felt the importance of embracing new challenges as the times change, so I’m excited and thrilled to be able to explore a new area of entertainment as a performer.</p><p>“With that in mind, the cast and staff worked together wholeheartedly during filming.</p><p>“I hope everyone can experience this fresh, unique form of entertainment through the game.”</p><p><strong>◆ Chihiro Jimbo</strong> (portrayed by Azusa Ohara)<br>Shrine Maiden</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AKIBA-LOST_2025_09-16-25_022.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Profile</strong></p><p>A shrine maiden working part-time at Kanda Myojin, the guardian deity of Akihabara.</p><p>After an event in her childhood, she came to believe in the existence of gods and developed a deep gratitude for the city of Akihabara. She is also an avid gamer and easily clears even difficult <a title="Genres > Action [3,043 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a>.

The DK Island + Emerald Rush DLC provides nostalgic fans with a small but charming new island to explore and a whole new mode to work through that changes up the gameplay loop from the base game.</p><p>If you're looking to dive into Donkey Kong Bananza's DK Island + Emerald Rush DLC, here's how to get started.</p><h2>How to start the DK Island + Emerald Rush DLC in Donkey Kong Bananza</h2><p>Before you can begin the DK Island + Emerald Rush DLC in Donkey Kong Bananza, you'll need to purchase it from the eShop for $20. Once you've made sure that it's installed, you can then open the game to get started. But be aware that how you access the DLC and how much of it is available to you is based on your game progress.</p><p><strong>If you've beaten the game and rolled credits</strong>, load back into your save and speak with one of the Elders (any of them will do) to learn about the rehearsals, Donkey Kong Bananza's primary endgame activity. At any point after this, you can visit any warp gong in the game to have the eel tell you about DK Island and open up fast travel there. This layer will now always be listed at the very top of the layer list.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4569231-20250916154807-01k5a13nay7assp3eh6e01ckf5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4569231" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4569231-20250916154807-01k5a13nay7assp3eh6e01ckf5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4569231"></a><figcaption>The DK Island layer is always listed at the top of the layer list once it's unlocked.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4569231-20250916154807-01k5a13nay7assp3eh6e01ckf5.jpg"></figure><p><strong>If you haven't beaten the game</strong>, you can speak to Squawks in the Racing Layer to open access to DK Island. However, you will only be able to explore the island at this point, as the Emerald Rush mode can only be unlocked after beating the game. </p><p>Once you arrive on DK Island, you'll find that there aren't any Banandium Gems to find. Instead, this island is designed to offer a dose of nostalgia for long-time fans and act as a hub of sorts. There are some secrets hidden around--and you can trade Banandium Chips with Squawks to earn some neat collectible statues based on various Donkey Kong characters and enemies--but the main thing to do here is speak with Void Kong and begin your journey through the Emerald Rush mode.</p><p>For more on Donkey Kong Bananza, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/donkey-kong-bananza-all-glamtone-fashion-test-solutions/2900-6782/" data-ref-id="2900-6782">All Glamstone Fashion Test Solutions</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-all-quiztone-quiz-answers/1100-6533307/" data-ref-id="1100-6533307">All Quiztone Quiz Answers</a>.</p>

                <p>After what felt like a couple of centuries in the making, EA has finally revived its classic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-2007/" data-ref-id="5000-28378">Skate</a> franchise with a new, free-to-play entry in the series. It's an early-access title right now, so it's fairly barebones in terms of its presentation, and the live-service aspect has sparked quite a bit of, ah, <em>discussion </em>among longtime fans of the series. But there is one thing that folks seem to be in agreement on with the new Skate: They nailed the feel of skating just like the original games did.</p><p>Out of the box, however, it may not feel exactly the way you remember. But there's a pretty easy solution to that problem in the game's settings, where certain "assists" are activated by default that make skating a much more forgiving experience. In addition to those must-tweak settings, we have some recommendations for other options related to custom ramps that most players will want to consider, and and audio option related to the game's narrator that could make your experience just a little less irritating in the long run. Let's take a look.</p><h2>Best settings to make new Skate make feel like the old Skate</h2><p>Navigate into the settings menu, then choose Gameplay, and then tab over to the Assists menu. For the true, old-school Skate experience, turn everything in the difficulty options section down. I did, however, allow myself to keep Allow Fall Height at 1, the middle option, for the sake of sick jumps.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569303-skatedifficultassists.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569303" data-ratio="0.56257242178447" data-width="1726" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569303-skatedifficultassists.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569303"></a><figcaption>For the truly unforgiving old Skate experience, turn all these options all the way to the left.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569303-skatedifficultassists.png"></figure><p>But wait, there's more! Below that you'll also find On-Board Helpers, and it's the same story here as it is above: turn them off. But if you'd like to ease yourself into it, you can leave on Prevent Low Air Spins, which makes it a little easier to maintain control at high speeds by preventing you from turning yourself when you're bouncing slightly. But eventually you'll want to turn that one off too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569305-onboardhelpers.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569305" data-ratio="0.56278366111952" data-width="1983" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569305-onboardhelpers.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569305"></a><figcaption>These On-Board Helpers can make your skating time easier if that's what you're into.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569305-onboardhelpers.png"></figure><p>There's also an Off-Board Helpers section at the bottom of this menu, but you can do whatever with those since those settings make it easier to get around on foot. You can do far more on foot in this game, like climbing up the sides of buildings, than you could in the old ones, so we endorse anything that makes that go faster so we can get back to skating.</p><p>Congrats, you've turned the new Skate into the same sort of painful and unforgiving experience that the old games were. But there are a couple other very important settings you'll also want to know about before too long.</p><h2>Turn off other people's quick-drop ramps</h2><p>The new Skate brings back and improves upon one of Skate 3's best features: the ability to place ramps and other objects anywhere you want in the world with a couple of button presses. The downside of this, however, is that this new Skate is an always-online game in which the world is constantly filled with other players, and they can also place ramps wherever they want, too. Knowing our fellow gamers the way we do, it's not hard to imagine a number of different scenarios in which folks might be really irritating with their ramp powers.</p><p>Fortunately, this problem can be wrangled quickly in a way that you probably didn't even know existed since you can't access it from the normal settings menu. To find it, you'll need to pull up the quick drop menu by pressing right on the d-pad, and then press the Options/Start button to open the quick drop settings menu. Scroll to the Multiplayer section at the bottom. Here you can govern whether you'll be subject to ramps placed by other players--and, crucially, you can make it so other players can't mess with the ramps that you place.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569306-quickdropedits.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569306" data-ratio="0.56281725888325" data-width="1576" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569306-quickdropedits.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569306"></a><figcaption>Free yourself from the tyranny of random people's ramps.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569306-quickdropedits.png"></figure><p>Once you're done with that, there's still one more setting you may want to keep in mind, particularly in the early goings.</p><h2>How to turn off the narrator</h2><p>Throughout your time in Skate, a nice digital lady called Vee runs you through the tutorials and missions as you learn the game and progress through, similar to the cameraman role that Giovanni Reda played in the original three games. Unfortunately, Vee is not as much fun to listen to as Reda was, and she really talks way, way more than she should, often repeating the same message over and over every time you return to your session marker, which is maddening. Fortunately, you can disable her idle chatter completely by turning off Gameplay Vee Comments in the <strong>Audio settings</strong> menu.</p>
