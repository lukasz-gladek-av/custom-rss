            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron insists we are "misunderstanding" his recent comments about video games.</p>
<p>Macron felt compelled to jump onto X/Twitter over the weekend after he "once again made gamers lose it" following an <a href="https://chb44.com/2026/02/france-ai-video-games-children-safety/">address to the nation earlier this month</a>, wherein he confirmed plans to study how children are affected by AI and gaming.</p>

<p>"I've seen a lot of misunderstandings. So let me be clear," he <a href="https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/2020059471209283956">wrote</a> (as translated by machine and what I remember from GCSE French). "The facts: I have always supported video games, pop culture – the industry, creation, culture, jobs. I have put French esports in the spotlight at the Élysée and made commitments to structure the sector and attract major events to France, which we have done.</p><p>"We have honoured the Sandfall teams and, even better, I support the participation of our teams (Karmine, Vitality, Gentle Mates, etc.) in the creation of a French national team around video games for a world competition. There are so many French gems that have global influence! We can be extremely proud of that."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="fr"><p>J’ai (encore) fait bondir les gamers…</p><p> J’ai vu beaucoup d’incompréhensions.<br>Alors je vais être clair.</p><p> Les faits : j’ai toujours soutenu le jeu vidéo, la popculture - industrie, création, culture, emplois.… <a href="https://t.co/Wl7P3REHxH">pic.twitter.com/Wl7P3REHxH</a></p></div>— Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/2020059471209283956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>However, Macron added that supporting the games industry and its culture does not mean he cannot "ask a simple question" about the impact of gaming on young people.</p>
<p>"Parents' observation is that some young people spend their days and sometimes their nights playing. It has also often been pointed out that games rated PEGI 18 are played by children," he added. "This is a major issue of public health, education, and responsibility. For physical health, especially the eyes, and mental health, when a young person no longer goes out at all because they play excessively, of course, it is worrying, and we must take it seriously.</p>
<p>"What I announced on Brut, in response to this teacher who was shouting her anger, is not a ban on video games: it is the launch of a scientific, collective work to look reality in the face. Calmly, lucidly, and with all stakeholders involved. It is our responsibility to ask researchers, scientists, and clinicians to assess the impacts, to untangle received ideas and to shed light on the public debate."</p><p>Macron added: "That is exactly what I am doing: I am opening a serious, informed and calm debate, which I want to keep far away from shortcuts. One can love video games, be proud of them, and at the same time look without taboo at certain practices and their effects."</p>
<p>If you're wondering what he means by honouring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, developer members of Sandfall Interactive were <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7425479716297539584/">knighted last week</a> in recognition of their significant contributions to the French arts. The Ordre des Arts et des Lettres – the Order of Arts and Letters – was given to Sandfall developers to mark a "major moment in the history of French video games".</p>
<p>Macron also congratulated Sandfall Interactive when Clair Obscur: Expediyion 33 released last year, calling its RPG a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-shining-example-of-french-audacity">"shining example of French audacity and creativity"</a>, and just last month, Macron once again publicly congratulated Sandfall Interactive for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, this time for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">securing a record-breaking nine wins at The Game Awards </a>in December.</p>

Welcome, one and all, to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Last time, we checked out Red Alarm for the Virtual Boy, which of course will be joining the launch lineup for Virtual Boy - Nintendo Classics on NSO later this month. It was a surprisingly close contest, with North America just about claiming victory with 54% of the vote.</p>
<p>So, we skip ahead to today, where we'll be looking at <strong>Super Bomberman 2</strong> for the SNES. This game is now, of course, fully playable on the Switch and Switch 2 as part of the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Super Bomberman Collection</a>, so we thought it wise to go back and see how the box art stacks up in each region.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pmqiyr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>US and EU designs are largely the same for this one (EU has a gold border, and that's about it), so we're going for a good ol' duel against Japan. Let battle commence!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/snes/related-articles:197105 @ 1770563860 -->
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="067cc41eca3f3"><a title="Super Bomberman 2 - NA / EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/067cc41eca3f3/super-bomberman-2-na-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2403-super-bomberman-2">Konami / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so the Western design seems pretty standard at first glance, but it's a lovely composition nevertheless. We've got Bomberman in the extreme foreground with a load of enemies filling up the remainder of the space. There's some lovely use of colour, and you certainly can't say it isn't eye-catching.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="d147762658b81"><a title="Super Bomberman 2 - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d147762658b81/super-bomberman-2-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2403-super-bomberman-2">Konami / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan's design is a bit more, shall we say, symmetrical. Which is good! It seems a bit busier in its composition, and again, the use of colour is simply superb.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kyedae-and-tenz-announce-split/</link>
            <guid>1429282</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kyedae and TenZ, the esports and content sweethearts who got engaged almost four years ago, have announced an amicable split on social media. The pair, who made their name competing in and streaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/valorant/" id="215">VALORANT</a>, became an iconic duo and one of the most recognisable romantic powerhouses in the modern gaming space.</p>



<p>In a lengthy post on social media, Kyedae revealed that they’ve been separated for ‘quite some time’ and that the break-up hasn’t come from a place of resentment or failure.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-did-kyedae-and-tenz-split-up">Why Did Kyedae and TenZ Split Up?</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/kyedae/status/2020324209852031174" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full post</a> from Kyedae on social media outlines the situation:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hey everybody,</p>



<p>Tyson (TenZ) and I feel ready to share some personal news.</p>



<p>We’ve actually been broken up for quite some time now. Toward the end of our relationship, we came to a realization that wasn’t easy to accept: we had stopped growing as individuals.</p>



<p>For most of our relationship, we did everything together.<br>Work — together.<br>Hobbies and interests — together.<br>Pretty much everything — together.</p>



<p>We’ve even joked in the past that although we were together for six years,&nbsp;<strong>it felt like at least thirty</strong>.</p>



<p>We moved in together just weeks after meeting, and from ages 17 to 24, that was all we knew. Over time, it became clear that we needed space to grow into our own people.</p>



<p>We know the internet often looks for “the tea” but the truth is sirnple —&nbsp;<strong>we grew apart</strong>.<br>There was no wrongdoing, no resentment, and no single event that caused this.</p>



<p>We still care deeply about each other and genuinely want the best for one another,<br>We’re also incredibly grateful for the time and life we shared together!</p>



<p>Thank you for respecting our privacy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rumors concerning the split had been circulating in streaming and social circles for some time, and this post effectively puts a nail in the coffin for them.</p>



<p>The pair were quick to get ahead of comments claiming that their engagement post from August 2022 ‘did not age well’, poking fun at themselves in a self-deprecating manner to beat the trolls.</p>



<p>It has admittedly been a rocky few years for the duo. TenZ announced his retirement from competing last year, and in 2023, Kyedae revealed <a href="https://x.com/kyedae/status/1631452687077363713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a cancer diagnosis</a> that eventually took her out of the streaming space indefinitely.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Steam’s Newest Feature is Huge for Early Access Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-new-early-access-feature-huge-for-games/</link>
            <guid>1429279</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Have you ever invested time, money, and effort into an early access game on Steam and wondered exactly when it’ll <span><strong>leave&nbsp;</strong>early access and graduate to</span> a full release? You’re not alone, and Valve has recognized that. In a recent update, the team behind Steam revealed that a new feature will give early access games greater transparency into their schedules.</p>



<p>When developers list early access products on Steam, they now have a visible field to indicate when the game will leave early access, whether that’s the <strong>year </strong>or the <strong>exact day</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-early-access-games-are-some-of-the-best">Early Access Games Are Some of the Best</h2>



<p>In the last few years, we’ve seen countless early access titles surface on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/steam/" id="173">Steam</a> and flourish, using the time granted by an earlier push to generate funds for the full development of a new title. In some cases, early access games flounder and fall, especially if they take a long time to <strong>leave </strong>that state.</p>



<p>But sometimes, an early access gem will appear, stick to a roadmap, and hit a full launch deadline without any issues.</p>



<p>The most recent example that rings true to that is Endnight’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/sons-of-the-forest/" id="320">Sons of the Forest</a>, which was released in early access and then launched as a full game exactly one year later, storming to success on Steam.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/500597484211404992?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new blog post</a>, Valve revealed that the early access date field is being added to promote better transparency for early adopters.</p>



<p>The team explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Occasionally, developers with a game in Early Access would ask us proactively if there was any official place to display a planned 1.0 date. They wanted existing and potential players to know about their plans. Many studios were already sharing their 1.0 dates in other places– within the text description on the store page, via Steam Event news posts, on social media, in their forums, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, they advised against using it <strong>just to use it</strong>, stressing that developers should only add a date if they’re relatively confident they’ll hit it. Otherwise, they risk running into trouble with their prospective fans.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout 76 Crossplay is Closer Than Ever and Fans Remain Hopeful]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-crossplay-closer-than-ever/</link>
            <guid>1429276</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Anyone who is anyone in the <em><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout-76/" id="438">Fallout 76</a></em> space knows about the game’s glaring lack of crossplay mechanics. It has been one of the biggest sticking points for players over the years, exacerbated by the fact that <strong>so many similar games </strong>have crossplay features.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios is well aware of the yearning players have to blow open the Fallout 76 ecosystem. Last year, we sat down with the team in Los Angeles and learned how difficult it would be to <strong>add </strong>crossplay to Fallout 76, and in a new interview, that was reiterated.</p>



<p>But the way it was framed suggests <strong>it’s now a plan</strong>… <strong>Almost</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-fallout-76-ever-get-crossplay">Will Fallout 76 Ever Get Crossplay?</h2>



<p>In June 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-still-thinking-about-fallout-76-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we sat down with Bethesda’s</a> Jon Rush and Bill LaCoste to talk about Gone Fission, the most recent Fallout 76 update at the time. One of the key questions we asked concerned crossplay and cross-progression mechanics, to which Bill said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>People ask us that all the time. And the thing for us, it has been more of a technical challenge for us to be able to do that. It’s not that we don’t think about it,&nbsp;<strong>we think about it often</strong>.</p>



<p>But, overall, <strong>no real plans</strong> right now to introduce crossplay, but certainly, we get asked to consider it very often, so we do.</p>



<p>Maybe in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In October, another interview surfaced between Bethesda Game Studios and the Iron Lords, and <strong>again</strong>, it was stressed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/its-never-a-no-fallout-76-crossplay-addressed-by-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they’re asked about Fallout 76 crossplay</a> all the time, but there were ‘no real plans’ to introduce the feature, much to the chagrin of players:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s never a no, right?</p>



<p>But what I will say, is that those are decisions usually made at the very beginning of development, and right now it’s a huge technical lift for us to have crossplay or cross-progression on it (Fallout 76).</p>



<p>It’s something we get asked about constantly from players. I understand why, I feel the same way. I’d love to go play on Steam and then go play on Xbox or PlayStation and just have my character, but right now, <strong>it’s a little bit too difficult for us to pull off</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>But then </strong>the pair appeared in yet another interview, this time with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fallout-76-crossplay-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, and it seems things have changed. Rush and LaCoste altered their direction on the Fallout 76 crossplay topic, going from ‘too difficult’ and ‘no real plans’ to something much more tangible.</p>



<p>Jon Rush said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are looking into it, and we have plans to try to scope out what that work is going to entail for us.</p>



<p>It’s just not in the immediate plans for us. We know players want it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And he was backed up by LaCoste:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What we can promise players is that we will continue to investigate, we will continue to try to establish plans to make that a thing in the future, just not in the short term.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a little weak, but Jon’s comment about ‘we have plans’ and ‘we are looking into it’ is perhaps the closest we’ve ever gotten to the Fallout 76 crossplay debate being resolved. If they’re sizing up the technical delivery of crossplay mechanics, we’re one step nearer to playing with our friends across those gaming borders.</p>

<p>Expect the following adjustments</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="87015558535f3"><a title="Adventures of Elliot" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/87015558535f3/adventures-of-elliot.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>During Nintendo's Partner Showcase this week, Square Enix announced its new HD-2D RPG title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a> would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/square-enixs-gorgeous-hd-2d-zelda-like-the-adventures-of-elliot-launches-this-june">coming to Switch 2 this June</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of this, it has announced it will be making some changes to the game based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/square-enix-wants-feedback-about-its-new-hd-2d-game-coming-to-switch-2">previous demo feedback</a> from players. Here are the adjustments on the way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Based on the feedback from the post-play survey of the debut demo released on Nintendo Switch 2, we will be making the following adjustments."</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Increase in Elliot's Movement Speed</em></li>
<li><em>New Difficulty Levels</em></li>
<li><em>Expanded Convenience Features for Magicite</em></li>
<li><em>Adjustment to Weapon Shortcut Menu Behaviour</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't already played the 'Debut Demo', you can access it from the Switch 2 eShop. Here's some additional information about what it offers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This ‘Debut Demo’ is designed to give you a sense of the exploration and action you’ll experience in the game, so expect plenty of crunchy combat, spooky caves and all kinds of secrets hidden around.</p>
<p>See a crackable wall? Blow it to smithereens with a bomb and you might discover a Secret Treasure Route- a small dungeon you can explore for valuable rewards.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ll find a Shrine of Life - these optional challenges put your combat and traversal skills to the test. Perhaps you’ll find valuable loot like magicite or money. Always remember - this is a game that rewards the curious.</p>
<p>Or, you could follow the quest markers and delve into a deadly swamp, and the Unexplored Ruins beneath. This multi-level dungeon is full of dangers - so be sure to use everything you’ve learned to find your way through.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We went hands on with The Adventures of Elliot last August. You can can read and see what we had to say about it in our previous coverage:</p>

<p>Here's what the critics think</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo is launching its Virtual Boy- Nintendo Classics digital library for the Switch Online + Expansion Pack service later this month, and the previews are now in.</p>
<p>First up are our own impressions from Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s no secret that the Virtual Boy failed spectacularly when it originally launched back in 1995. As such, you might be under the impression that its games just aren’t very good. Well, not so! Virtual Boy Wario Land is an incredible 2D platformer that makes spectacular use of perspective, while Red Alarm is a solid wireframe shoot-em-up with clear Star Fox inspirations.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"I wasn’t able to try Zero Racers or D-Hopper, since neither of them will be available at launch. But the sheer fact that both will be fully playable for the first time <em>ever</em> is reason enough to celebrate. What a time to be alive."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196665 @ 1770566583 -->
<p>So, what did other critics have to say about it? Here's the rundown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vooks.net/preview-virtual-boy-nintendo-classics-a-strange-reality/">Vooks</a>: "The Cardboard VB requires you to hold the unit to your face, offering the more comfortable option of playing the games... The plastic VB recreation is more impressive. It’s as close as you’re going to get to play a VB unit without forking out the even bigger bucks for a real VB. Playing this way means you can have a more comfortable control set up. This is the only comfortable part of the VB though. It was difficult to get to a good or realistic height on the unit where I wasn’t hunched over and having to push my face against the VB. It will be good to get some longer time with the VB once it is released, even just to have a quick dip into some Nintendo history."</p>
<p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/nintendo-switch-virtual-boy-hands-on-preview">Mashable</a>: "The most vital aspect of all of this: after just a few minutes, my eyes and neck began to hurt and I had to back away. I got the same feeling of being disconnected from the physical world around me and needing to re-integrate with it as soon as I was done that I normally get from using modern VR headsets. We've come so far in terms of VR tech, but for me that sense of dislocation hasn't changed at all."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/preview-new-nintendo-virtual-boy/">DualShockers</a>: "I... walked away a believer in these games, even with the understanding that 30 years ago, they didn't move the needle enough for mass adoption. Maybe I'm just a sucker for retro, arcade-y titles as I continue to age into my thirties, but I also know I won't at all be alone in this sentiment. If retro titles are your jam, there's a lot to have a good time with here."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/articles/previews/virtual-boy-switch-online/">CGMagazine</a>: "<em>Wario Land...</em> showed the most promise of the launch titles—just as it was arguably the most in-depth game on the Virtual Boy in its own time. Hopping between the 3D planes became more than a gimmick, as swinging hazards immediately illustrate; this is a legitimate platformer and a decent successor to the Game Boy games, and you’ll need to learn to pay attention to multiple planes to survive and thrive."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtual-boy-on-switch-2-discovering-nintendos-greatest-failure">IGN</a>: "I only played for about 20 minutes, but I thankfully didn’t get a headache like the original hardware’s reputation would suggest. I’m honestly not sure how long I’ll play in one sitting when my own Virtual Boy preorder shows up in a couple weeks, because even though Wario Land was fun, it’s still kind of a pain to play. The edges of the screen were tough to see when looking in the unit, and it’s not the most comfortable feeling to crane your neck to look inside. At least it’s that authentic neck pain I’ve always wanted, though."</p>
<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/03/i-played-the-virtual-boy-games-on-switch-2-and-it-was-actually-kind-of-cool">Game Informer</a>: "People speak so poorly of the 1995 model that I fully expected to immediately reject the Switch 2 version, but I came away mildly impressed. When the baseline expectation is "headache, neck pain, and nausea" but the actual experience is "huh, pretty neat," I think it's fair to say this exceeded my expectations. It's far from a perfect device, but it very well may be the best way to revisit Nintendo's worst console."</p>

            <p>
For all of their faults (the list may be endless), the interesting thing about live service games, when done well anyway, is the way they can change from day to day. There's an actual living quality to them that, even if I'll always prefer them, a singleplayer game can't capture as well. One such game that can change quite drastically is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, with its varying map conditions and events, swapping in and out at the whims of its developers. This rotation isn't something universally loved, but CEO Patrick Söderlund has said that they're here to stay.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve">IGN</a> in a broader interview about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, when asked about Embark's response to those that don't love the rotating schedule of conditions and events, Söderlund explained that they are "on a rotating schedule for multiple reasons. Obviously, we believe that it's a part of how the game should be played, that not everything is available at all times. We believe that creates tension. It's an element of fun. It's a way for us to move people from map to map, which we believe to be important."
</p>
<p>
Söderlund continued to explain how the studio doesn't want all map events to be constantly available, and "that most likely won't change. Sometimes we'll let them stay for longer. Sometimes we run two or three in parallel, but they may be different, but we believe that to be a part of how the game should be experienced." The CEO did also share that while they plan to continue adding more map conditions, some may end up being removed temporarily, with the potential for them to return "with a different edge."
</p>
<p>
This obviously won't be accommodating to everyone, as obviously some will have schedules that constrict the time of day they can play. And there lies the double edged sword of these ever evolving live service games. Mayhaps this reality where FOMO-driven gameplay does not make for entirely great experiences.

            <p>
Last month, Ubisoft pretty unceremoniously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">cancelled a bunch of games</a>, the most notable of the bunch being that long gestating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake. This came as part of a major restructuring at the company, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">putting up to 200 jobs at their Paris HQ at risk</a>, ultimately leading to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-french-ubisoft-workers-put-out-call-for-an-international-strike-held-by-all-current-employees">call for an international strike</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-reportedly-fire-assassins-creed-designer-who-spoke-out-publicly-against-return-to-office-as-union-reps-call-for-ceo-to-resign">firing of one Assassin's Creed designer</a>. It's all a concerning mess, and now the creator of Prince of Persia and lead designer on the original Sands of Time Jordan Mechner has shared his sympathy to devs affected by the remake's cancellation.
</p>
<p>
"The remake's cancellation as part of Ubisoft's restructuring was disappointing news to all fans who'd been eagerly awaiting it, myself included," Mechner wrote in a <a href="https://www.jordanmechner.com/en/latest-news/#winter-days">blog post</a> on his personal website (ta, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/prince-of-persias-creator-reacts-to-ubisofts-cancellation-of-the-sands-of-time-remake-having-a-project-killed-is-a-brutal-experience/">PC Gamer</a>). "My sympathy goes to the development team in Montreal; I can only imagine how they must feel. Having a project killed is a brutal experience. It's an aspect of the game industry that the public doesn't often see, but developers are all too familiar with."
</p>
<p>
Mechner also highlighted how damaging this can be for the spirit of younger developers who don't have many shipped games on their CV yet. "It's tough to suddenly absorb that the past four years of hard work you were proud of, and looking forward to seeing out in the world as your new calling card, will now never see daylight. Words like loss and grieving might seem exaggerated, but artists put their hearts into their work."
</p>
<p>
I found this line from Mechner to be highly pertinent: "Memories of nights and weekends spent in studio crunch instead of at home with loved ones, sacrifices that felt worth it at the time, only add to the pain retrospectively once their object ceases to exist." Sure would be nice if this whole system of taking nigh on half a decade plus to make a game just kind of ended at some point!
</p><p>
The Sands of Time remake seemingly wasn't the only notable game to get the axe, as it was also recently reported that an online Assassin's Creed game was in the works, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-online-cooperative-game-originally-spun-off-from-assassins-creed-shadows-has-reportedly-been-cancelled">but that's supposedly been canned now too</a>. Anyone else feeling tired? Yeesh.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26’s gameplay designer, Cornell Gunter, is very excited about the ragdoll physics in the upcoming video game. He says the new gameplay tweaks will allow wrestling moves to connect properly with weapons instead of being hampered by invisible barriers.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> is set to release worldwide on March 13. This year’s game features the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273">several match types</a> to WWE video games, including Inferno Matches and 3 Stages of Hell, and several new gameplay improvements. </p>







<h2 id="h-no-more-invisible-walls-when-slamming-wrestlers-onto-weapons-in-wwe-2k26">No More Invisible Walls When Slamming Wrestlers Onto Weapons in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/m935QSZHAfI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JustBryan,</a> WWE 2K26 gameplay designer Cornell Gunter said his favorite improved gameplay mechanic is the addition of ragdoll physics to the game.</p>



<p>Gunter praised the removal of “invisible walls” and how it allows players to use weapons in more creative ways, enhancing the realism that sometimes occurs in wild, anything-goes matches on WWE television.</p>



<p>“Being able to remove that invisible wall when you’re performing moves and performing certain things like that, which is very important to us,” he said. “Being able to watch the collision and the figures of how the superstars react when they’re hitting weapons and all those kinds of things… Those are the things I’m really excited about for gameplay.”</p>

<h2 id="h-more-features-in-wwe-2k26">More Features in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>WWE 2K26 also features several improvements that give players more control over the realism in matches, starting well before the bell rings. Players can customize how much pyro goes off, which camera angles are used, and more during wrestler entrances this year.</p>



<p>Also, there’s a new AI customization that lets players create sequences of moves the AI will always try to hit in succession, adding realism to every match.

			<p>On December 2, 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/santa-ragione-horses-banned-from-epic-games-store-at-last-minute-steam-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that <strong>Epic Games</strong> had decided to ban the controversial game <strong>HORSES</strong> at the last minute before its planned launch. They had previously approved a pre-release build, whereas <a href="https://wccftech.com/santa-ragione-new-horror-game-horses-might-be-its-last-steam-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Valve</strong> had banned it from <strong>Steam</strong> the previous week</a>. Needless to say, this was a huge blow for HORSES developer <strong>Santa Ragione</strong>, a small Italian development studio that suddenly found itself cut off from the two biggest PC game stores. </p>



<p>Now, the controversy has reignited. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/i/186925441/a-note-about-horses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a recent interview with Game File</a> that was mainly about <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-saw-record-setting-third-party-sales-growth-in-2025-reaches-317m-pc-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <strong>Epic Games Store's 2025 growth figures</strong></a>, Epic Games Store General Manager <strong>Steve Allison</strong> said that the company loves Santa Ragione, but added that the<strong> 'Adult Only' rating</strong> <strong>was a dealbreaker</strong> when it came to publishing HORSES on the store.</p>



<p>Well, Santa Ragione did not take kindly to the comment. Today, they responded with a strong, firm rebuttal <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3mebdvzgim22k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the social network BlueSky</a>:</p>



<p><em>Epic Games made provably incorrect statements about the game’s content, refused to provide details supporting their claims, and has not shared their claimed AO IARC certificate, which normally includes a link for the developer to appeal. They do not ‘love that studio’, they have effectively ghosted us.</em></p>



<p><em>The fact that the game does not deserve an AO rating is apparent from the widely available full walkthroughs on YouTube and Twitch, as well as from its distribution on the Humble Store.</em></p>



<p>According to Santa Ragione, Horses obtained a PEGI 18 and ESRB M rating through the IARC system, not an Adult Only classification.</p>



<p>The game itself is intentionally quite the gut punch. It's set on a farm <strong>where the titular “horses” are actually naked humans wearing permanent horse masks, treated entirely as livestock</strong>: fed like animals, stabled, made to pull ploughs, raced, and ridden on their shoulders. Horses is presented in a bleak, black‑and‑white psychological horror style, and <strong>the player is forced to participate in daily routines and increasingly disturbing tasks</strong> that normalize this ongoing dehumanization. The game also includes sexual assault, mutilation, and torture (the "horses" are punished with beatings and castration if they have sex with each other). </p>



<p>That said, the game's supporters (and the developers themselves) believe that it does not warrant an Adult Only classification, and its content, while disturbing, is not as explicit as, for example, sex animations in more popular games that are normally distributed.</p>



<p>Horses is currently available for purchase on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses?utm_campaign=adtraction&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=adtraction&amp;r=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GOG</a>, <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">itch.io</a>, and <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Humble Store</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" id="96820">Embark Studios</a> CEO Patrick Söderlund responds to players who aren’t fully satisfied with the current ARC Raiders roadmap.</p>



<p>In a sea of live service games that can turn into a watery grave far too soon, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a> has managed to catch on and become a hit with players worldwide. It even won Best Multiplayer Game at the Game Awards in 2025.</p>



<p>Embark recently released a roadmap for the game detailing upcoming additions, including new maps and more. However, not all players are fully satisfied with the game’s current direction, as they feel the roadmap doesn’t provide enough incentive to keep playing.</p>







<h2 id="h-embark-ceo-acknowledges-player-frustration-with-arc-raiders-roadmap">Embark CEO Acknowledges Player Frustration With ARC Raiders Roadmap</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with IGN,</a> Patrick Söderlund was asked what he would say to players who weren’t satisfied with the recent plan. Notably, he wants dissatisfied players to understand that they are heard, and he even claims he would feel the same if he were in their shoes, but only because they do not yet have full details.</p>



<p>“If we get into the studio development schedule and make that public, we’re probably going to be in a world of hurt,” he said.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Söderlund stated that they are developing things as they go. However, he says players will see that the patch notes are very detailed and that the organization wants to be seen as transparent. He knows that some won’t forgive if they cannot deliver on certain wants, but his main goal is to provide continuous updates to the game, saying he feels it’s worth its $40 price tag.</p>



<p>“From the beginning of January, whenever everyone was back, we’re working around the clock to deliver as much content as we can to players,” he said.</p>







<p>Players can check out the full roadmap <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-roadmap/" id="153016">here</a>. Insider Gaming will continue to provide future updates on when new content will come to ARC Raiders.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cold Snap is Coming Back to ARC Raiders as a Regular Map Condition]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cold-snap-coming-back-arc-raiders/</link>
            <guid>1429084</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Cold Snap, the festive-themed update that introduced Candleberries, a new event, and some harsh, inclement weather, is <strong>coming back to ARC Raiders </strong>as a map condition in the regular rotation. This will join the pool made up of the likes of Harvester, Hidden Bunker, and Electromagnetic Storm, even if it <strong>doesn’t make much sense</strong>.</p>



<p>In December, Cold Snap came around because it was a winter-themed event bursting with festive potential. It existing beyond that feels a little strange, and it’s being passed off by Embark Studios as ‘sporadic snowfall’.</p>







<h2 id="h-doesn-t-make-sense-but-okay">Doesn’t Make Sense, But Okay</h2>



<p>Cold Snap was a limited-time map condition that existed to serve a purpose, and that was the facilitation of the new festive LTM and new player project. Now that the festive window is over, the condition has understandably moved on, arguably to make way <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-arc-raiders-map-condition-named-toxic-swamp/"><strong>for more </strong>map conditions</a>, coming as soon as later this month.</p>



<p>But <strong>wait!</strong></p>



<p>Embark Studios has taken Cold Snap and injected it back into the map rotation for ‘the foreseeable future’. From February 10, Cold Snap will be a playable condition once again, with blizzards freezing maps, blanketing them in thick snow, and making it a hazardous concept to even creep outside.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Clear skies and sunny temperatures are predicted for Topside this weekend, but don't pack your winter gear away yet folks; the weather towers are predicting sporadic snowfall in the foreseeable future!<br>The Cold Snap returns to our regular rotation of conditions from February 10… <a href="https://t.co/J4OACyBc9y">pic.twitter.com/J4OACyBc9y</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2020180761849331776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Fans were quick to point out that this is the epitome of reusing and recycling content, and it comes mere weeks after the map condition was <strong>removed </strong>from the pool, which was always going to be the plan.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-four-months-content/">ARC Raiders roadmap</a> suggests we’re getting a new map condition soon, and based on earlier scouting, it should be <strong>Toxic Swamp</strong>, but it could still be up to three weeks away.</p>

            <p>
In a few months time we'll be approaching the anniversary of Square Enix realising that actually, their commitment to releasing certain games only on particular platforms <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-might-not-wait-so-long-for-the-next-ff7-remake-as-square-enix-plan-to-win-over-pc-users-with-aggressive-shift-away-from-console-exclusives">isn't that good for them after all</a>. These following two years will supposedly have been a time of internal change for the studio, with that translated externally via the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> Remake games releasing on more than just PlayStation. Perhaps they're finally making smart choices! And then last year, instead of finally showing off something like, I don't know, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, which was first revealed four years ago now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-follows-up-foamstars-flop-with-traitors-esque-killer-inn">they announced Killer Inn</a>. Okay! And now, you can try it out for yourself.
</p>
<p>
Heading over to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1598230/KILLER_INN/">Steam page</a> allows you to join a playtest taking part this weekend ahead of its early access release next week. No pre-requirements, just click a button, and you're in. But perhaps some context for the uninitiated. You and 23 others find themselves in the titular Killer Inn, where 16 of you are designated as lambs, the rest as wolves. It really is quite like Werewolf, with wolves attempting to sneakily kill the lambs, while the lambs try to figure out who the wolves are.
</p>

<p>
Clues can be left behind at the scene of a crime to be discovered, traps can be set up to trick lambs, and also it looks like just about everyone can have guns to just fully blast each other with. There is a strong Unreal Engine premade vibe to the whole thing, quite honestly, but the overall concept isn't awful, it's just an incredibly strange game for Square Enix to not only publish, but partially make (alongside Tactic Studios). Who knows! This is a streamer bait game if there ever was one, and social games like these are having a big moment right now, so perhaps there's an audience for it somewhere.
</p>
<p>
If you don't manage to try out the beta test, you'll be able to pick it up when Killer Inn releases February 12th, next week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another week draws to a close, and hopefully, your NYT Connections streak <strong>persists</strong>. We’re cutting fast through February and will be bidding farewell to the winter months soon enough, but you know what we’re <strong>not </strong>bidding farewell to today? That’s right – today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions.</p>



<p>Read on to get the full scope of today’s NYT Connections answers, to get this puzzle done as quickly as possible.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-8">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 8)</h2>



<p>Here are the words from today’s NYT Connections puzzle:</p>



<ul>
<li>TIMER</li>



<li>INHIBIT</li>



<li>SYMBOL</li>



<li>ROUTINE</li>



<li>GAG</li>



<li>LENGTH</li>



<li>CENTS</li>



<li>MUZZLE</li>



<li>FACED</li>



<li>NUMBER</li>



<li>UPPERCASE</li>



<li>DRILL</li>



<li>BIT</li>



<li>SILENCE</li>



<li>HABIT</li>



<li>GRIND</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– To keep things quiet</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – This might describe a regular side gig</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Designing a password</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – These follow two</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 8:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-8-973">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 8 (#973)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– GAG, INHIBIT, MUZZLE, SILENCE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DRILL, GRIND, HABIT, ROUTINE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – LENGTH, NUMBER, SYMBOL, UPPERCASE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BITS, CENTS, FACED, TIMER</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Eric Barone discusses the possibility of a Stardew Valley 2</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/stardew-valley/" id="1072">Stardew Valley</a> was released a decade ago and became a massive hit. The game has inspired many farming sims and cozy games since its release. However, 10 years later, the game’s creator is discussing the possibility of a sequel, including when plans to make one were underway and more.</p>







<h2>Stardew Valley 2 Was in the Works Before Eric Barone Pivoted to An Upcoming Release</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with IGN,</a> Eric Barone, aka <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/concernedape/" id="95209">ConcernedApe</a>, noted that he would be interested in the idea of working on a sequel to Stardew. Personally, he would be more interested in creating a new world with new characters. However, he’s worried that players are too attached to Pelican town and the villagers who call it home.</p>



<p>Furthermore, he revealed that he had begun working on a Stardew Valley 2 but ultimately chose to pivot to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/haunted-chocolatier/" id="3546">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, an upcoming release he says could be seen as a follow-up to the popular 2016 farming sim.</p>



<p>“There was a time where I was starting to work on a Stardew Valley 2, but, I don’t know. For various reasons, I moved over to Haunted Chocolatier instead. Haunted Chocolatier, you could say, is like Stardew Valley 2, but it’s a bit different of a game,” he said.</p>







<h2 id="h-still-fans-shouldn-t-expect-stardew-valley-2-from-his-next-game">Still, Fans Shouldn’t Expect Stardew Valley 2 from His Next Game</h2>



<p>Despite saying players can view the upcoming game as “Stardew Valley 2,” it is clearly meant as a spiritual successor. In fact, Barone is concerned that expectations for the upcoming game may be too high. He admits it’s a challenge to decide when the next game will be ready for release because there’s so much to live up to, given the legacy of his previous game.</p>



<p>“I want to just make the game I want to make, but I also don’t want a bunch of people to not like the game because they were expecting a certain thing,” he said.</p>



<p>As of now, there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/haunted-chocolatier-long-time-to-finish/">no release date planned for Choclatier</a>. Barone acknowledged that any Stardew Valley-related matter would require his full attention. However, he hopes that, at least over the next decade, Haunted Choclatier will be released. He even mentioned that there could be another Stardew Valley project by then.</p>

The rest, as they say, is history: Spider-Man was inarguably Magic’s most disappointing set of at least the last year (maybe longer), and Edge of Eternities was much more well-received but invariably didn’t get its chance in the limelight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I was hoping that Wizards would take some lessons from it, we’re now entering a 2026 roadmap with seven full sets planned. Lorwyn Eclipsed is great, and only just launched, but that’s January’s set. Preorders are now live for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGrVNq?object_uuid=fcf04366-9d70-4822-9c66-d2bf97a545a8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Rnk8?object_uuid=fcf04366-9d70-4822-9c66-d2bf97a545a8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Secrets of Strixhaven</u></a>, and even <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56LlN?object_uuid=fcf04366-9d70-4822-9c66-d2bf97a545a8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Marvel Super Heroes</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last set, by the way, is around five months from launch. While I appreciate that a company needs a line on a graph to go up to show success by bringing in new players, it’s starting to feel like Wizards of the Coast is trampling on Magic’s own legacy in its desperation to talk about crossover sets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lorwyn Eclipsed should be a celebration, a chance to return to a beloved Plane full of classic creature types, and instead, we’re getting close to the Turtles landing on store shelves. Looking past Strixhaven to a Marvel crossover, this early (and with the taste of the Spider-Man set still lingering), is just a bad look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Please, Wizards - don’t let Secrets of Strixhaven suffer the same way Edge of Eternities is. It’s almost unavoidable with such a packed release calendar, but if you can’t pay enough time to your own universes, the ones that have captivated players for over three decades, does that not tell you a change is required?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Honestly, all of this is moot anyway - I’m part of the problem. I’ve pre-ordered some Marvel Superheroes products, and you can bet your Bilbo Baggins that I’ll be first in line for The Hobbit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Magic’s current set, Lorwyn Eclipsed, be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-most-expensive-cards"><u>our list of the best chase cards</u></a> in the set right now, as well as a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-weird-wonderful-creatures-of-magic-the-gatherings-new-lorwyn-eclipsed-set"><u>all eight creature types</u></a> in the new set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

            <p>
I'll be truthful with you for a moment: I do, from time to time, enjoy a game where I do not have to be supremely strategic, and get to watch different lights and colours light up on my screen. Something that's got the juice, but doesn't ask too much of me. Everyone needs to turn their brain half off once in a while! And I believe I could quite easily find myself switching off that half to STICKER/BALL once in a while, a "pool game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> from the future."
</p>
<p>
Ok, so, I do have to admit that for the first couple minutes of STICKER/BALL's demo, I had to turn my brain on ever so slightly to figure out what was going on, so let me explain it for you here. You have six balls. When a run starts, there is a single die on the screen, so you shoot the die, and get points, of which there's a minimum you have to make each round, increasing upon a successful one. Once the ball comes back to you, you are granted a choice of one singular sticker amongst three, all of which have different effects to get you even more points.

For example, a house sticker spawns a human when you hit it, and said human gives you three points upon spawning, or six if they survive, and eight if they die from getting shot by a bullet. So, you might then want to place a gun sticker on the dice field, of which there are 216 slots, each line unlocking the more stickers you get. You can also choose which stickers go on which numbered die, and they'll randomly appear on the main field, prompting you to determine just where you want to point your ball towards.
</p><p>
The more dice you get, the more opportunities for the ball to bounce around and cause the different stickers to interact with one another. A game of true, honest cause and effect. And as mentioned, one that requires just a smidge of thought, as when there's enough stickers on the field, you can kind of just feel out where it's best to shoot your shot on instinct, resulting in those treasured flashing colours.
</p>
<p>
I think ultimately the game is summarized quite well by the last line of its Steam description: "Enjoy the chaos, it’s on purpose." I will, STICKER/BALL! No exact release date attached to this one, but it's currently slated for release in 2026, and you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3537690/_STICKERBALL/">here</a>.
