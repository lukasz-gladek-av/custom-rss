            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atomfall-review-british-invasion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If <em>Atomfall</em> is anything, it’s a good case study on why the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fallout-4-review-catch-that-uranium-fever" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout</em></a>-style of game design should be used more often outside of its typical American formula. Rebellion has done just that by putting together an all-new survival game with plenty of British flair and hard-earned difficulty that feels both familiar and has been allowed to stand on its own.</p>

<p>There’s quite a lot in <em>Atomfall</em> that leads me to that conclusion, so let’s get to the meat of what we’re working with.</p>

<p><em>Atomfall</em> begins with a dramatic, potentially world-ending event, which is to say that a nuclear disaster in a place called Windscale in Northern England happened, and there’s a time skip with all the consequences. Fast-forward five years, and the area’s been walled off into a quarantine zone with those within left to their fate.</p>

<p>The protagonist in <em>Atomfall</em> is out of sorts and suffering from amnesia. The whole story will hinge on finding out how they got there and what’s really going on in this now isolated world.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-05.jpg?itok=Sub-ujVQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-05.jpg?itok=XPp_f6ej 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Most of the story takes place in this quarantine zone, and it’s here that many perils and unsavory locals and factions who don’t take kindly to strangers are found. <em>Atomfall</em> leans a lot on the mystery created from these foundations, and a lot of that progression relies on discovering the unknown.</p>

<p>It’s not cinematic, but it gets the job done, and I did enjoy being able to pick at the investigation into what was going on a highlight of the nearly 30-hour experience. A lot of <em>Atomfall</em>’s narrative value is in the bits and pieces you find along the way such as notes and the like, along with a colorful cast of characters who aren’t always as trustworthy as they may seem and have plenty to say.</p>

<p>The British flavor helps a lot too, I felt. There’s something cheeky about sneaking up to a bright red phone booth in the woods as it rings especially for you.</p>

<p>Outside of its story, <em>Atomfall</em> pushes its mystery through gameplay in a lot of ways. You’ve got the standard melee and ranged attacks, and the protagonist can make use of a lot of weapons. Like any survival game, you’ll have to find whatever you want to use. There’s no handholding here, which is something I feel can be frustrating or a benefit, it all depends on your perspective.</p>

<p>With limited inventory space, I found it better to go with an even spread because there’s a good chance that the protagonist can die at any moment. Guns are around, but finding ammo isn’t always a safe bet. There are bows and arrows, too, which I found more useful since there’s at least a chance of recovery once you fire one.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-06.jpg?itok=_gc82vwD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-06.jpg?itok=hw3kuBBP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Other useful ranged weapons include throwables like the Molotov cocktail. Melee weapons are useful too to deal heavier damage, although I found the wind-up time on some of them, like the cricket bat, to be a bit too long for my liking. If the protagonist is in a pinch, they can kick out at enemies to stagger them a bit and it does go a long way to get into the habit of using all the abilities at your disposal.</p>

<p>Having to keep an eye on the protagonist’s heart rate during such fights is a bit of a challenge, too, and it’s easy to slip too far and slow down as a consequence, especially when encountering some of the tougher enemies like the infected Ferals.</p>

<p>And again, <em>Atomfall</em> isn’t out here holding your hand. I died, a lot, and much of it ended up being a learning experience on how I could approach enemies, some of which won’t even bother you if they don’t perceive you as a threat. Sometimes the best strategy is to just sneak around and get away, especially because combat can sometimes be unwieldy and difficulty can spike up for no real reason.</p>

<p><em>Atomfall</em> isn’t always on a knife's edge like that, however. The other core part of gameplay lies in its quests, picking up leads and tracking them, and building up conversations with NPCs through dialogue options. Leads net things like hints on where to go, but it’s important to be mindful because again, it’s hard to trust anyone.</p>

<p>This opens up a lot of <em>Atomfall</em>’s sandbox nature as well. I was really floored just how much freedom you have to explore at your own pace, there’s nothing pressing, and you’re not moving between pre-determined quests.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-07.jpg?itok=FB_Y6iiH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-07.jpg?itok=_IoU4V8m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While <em>Atomfall</em> is the most technically impressive game out there, it does well with the sheer number of assets on display. There’s a lot of greenery and the different locations from the village to the forest, and even a detention center is filled with plenty of interesting things to look at.</p>

<p><em>Atomfall</em> runs smoothly on PC for the most part, though I did encounter some issues with janky animation and an NPC that got killed by accident and couldn’t respawn without restarting a save.</p>

<p>Overall, though, <em>Atomfall</em> has plenty to keep you busy. If you’re keen on survival games with a bit of mystery, and maybe if you liked the sort of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>-flavor of gameplay difficulty wrapped up in it, this one’s for you.</p>

<p>While some of the gameplay can be unwieldy, and difficulty can ramp up without reason, <em>Atomfall</em> has enough to keep you going, especially for those who like to seek out multiple endings. It’s clear Rebellion put a lot of love into this game, and the mystery that binds it altogether into a compelling experience worth trying out.</p>

<hr><p><em>Atomfall </em>was reviewed on PC with a code provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the course of review over 30 hours of gameplay.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty's popular Nuketown map has been reimagined over and over again throughout the series, and the latest evolution of the map--focused on the stoner holiday of 4/20--has now been revealed.

This includes five core mode variants, all with excellent names: Head Stash (TDM), Inhalation (Domination), Hotbox (Hardpoint), Very High Target (HVT), and Munchies (Kill Confirmed).</p><p>The mode will make you trip out, eliciting "visual hallucinations" and sometimes shifting to a third-person POV to give you an out-of-body experience. The mode also includes double health and low gravity.</p><p>Finally, Activision announced that the popular stoners Jay and Silent Bob are coming to Black Ops 6 as playable characters.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has suddenly become unplayable for some PC players on older systems due to a new hard requirement not supported by aging CPUs.</p>
<p>While the minimum PC specs on the Steam page have not changed, the game now requires AVX2 support to run thanks to recent optimisations.</p>
<p>However, many players have been running the game on systems without AVX2 support and, as a result, are now locked out of the game.</p>

<p>AVX2 (or Advanced Vector Extensions) essentially allows for fast and efficient CPU usage and was first supported by Intel in 2013. It means CPUs released prior to this won't have AVX2 and therefore will no longer be able to run Helldivers 2.</p>
<p>The Helldivers 2 Discord server has been awash with players suddenly unable to play the game on PC - a game that's not free-to-play but was previously paid for and playable for the past year.</p>
<p>"Can't believe I can't play a game I've fully paid for and have the required minimum specs for," wrote one player in Discord.</p>
<p>"600+ hours in a game I love just to be locked out is making me so frustrated to the point I just want to ask for a refund instead of fixing their mistakes," wrote another.</p>
<p>"The AVX2 check in the script is experimental, and can throw false positives, which is why it's wise to manually check your processor model for the AVX2 support from the manufacturer's documentation," explained Discord moderator Birby.</p>
<p>Another reply from the moderator reads: "That processor does not support AVX2, which is now a hard minimum requirement for processors. Unfortunately you will require a system upgrade."</p>
<p>Yet despite moderators attempting to reply to all players, the conversation has become decidedly heated from both sides.</p>
<p>"I don't like to have to tell people their 13 year old processor is out of date," wrote Birby. "I have fielded this question hundreds of times in the past week. I sit here and help people in 48hr stints before going to bed. People will piss and moan and argue, not to mention insult and attack us for being the bearers of bad news. I get you're venting, but as I keep saying - it is up to you as the consumer to confirm your system meets spec before purchase, and you should never be surprised if your out of spec machine can't run the game."</p>
<p>On top of sharing a <a href="https://arrowhead.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15916898652700--HELLDIVERS-2-Known-Issues">current known list of issues</a>, moderators have shared multiple fixes for a string of current issues, from checking minimum spec requirements, to rolling back AMD and NVIDIA GPU drivers, to purging downloaded mods from the system.</p>
<p>Developer Arrowhead itself is yet to publicly respond to players. Eurogamer has contacted the studio and publisher Sony for comment.</p>
<p>Over on console, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-helldivers-2-has-received-a-stealth-ps5-pro-upgrade-and-heres-what-it-does">Helldivers 2 recently received a PS5 Pro patch</a> to boost performance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, creative director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-boss-says-industry-doomed-to-unnecessarily-brutal-layoffs-while-chasing-after-the-battle-royales">Johan Pilestedt discussed "ridiculous" layoffs across the industry</a> at this year's GDC, due to studios' dogged reliance on battle royales.</p>
<p>"We will always go through the cycles of death and rebirth, but now that cycle is unnecessarily brutal because we don't diversify enough," he said. "We need to make more types of games because people are playing more than ever and still we are unable to stay in business. It's ridiculous."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In one of this year’s most dark discoveries, brand-new hit life simulator Inzoi lets you run over children. While the game is designed to mimic most aspects of day-to-day life, players are understandably baffled by the inclusion.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-inzoi-come-out-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a> has steadily gained momentum and hype throughout 2025. Eventually, it superseded Hollow Knight Silksong to become the most-<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wishlisted title on Steam</a>. Despite a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-inzoi-have-denuvo-denuvo-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Denuvo</a> roadblock on the way, the new rival to The Sims has gotten off to a hot start. It allows you to escape your real life to live a more perfect existence through Inzoi.</p>



<p>However, Inzoi possibly offers a bit too much freedom as you can quite literally control a car and careen into children.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-run-over-children-in-inzoi-s-life-simulator">You Can Run Over Children in Inzoi’s Life Simulator</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s stick to the road, yeah? Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>An NSFW post appeared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inZOI/comments/1jldd0w/i_dont_think_that_krafton_realizes_that_you_can/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-players-surprised-to-discover-you-can-run-over-children-despite-teen-rating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inzoi subreddit</a> on March 27. It initially contained a description saying: “You can drive into the elementary school and run over…unalive the children.”</p>



<p>Underneath the message is a video of the action itself. Amazingly, it’s exactly as the user describes: It’s a car driving into a small group of kids, and the force sends one of the children flying and ragdolling uncontrollably.</p>



<p>The action reportedly kills the child, and this discovery has understandably shocked everyone. Many comments suggest the developer (or the assistance of publisher Krafton) will cause this type of action to be removed.</p>



<p>“They stated they wouldn’t be fond of violent mods in the game and then accidentally added one themselves,” said one user, whereas someone else commented: “They’ll probably fix it soon. Steam doesn’t allow you to depict children being harmed in such graphic ways, according to their content rules, so they’ll patch it out fast enough.”</p>



<p><strong>Warning: You can check the video for yourself below, but it might be uncomfortable for some.</strong></p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rapidsave.com_-9xsxumx7pare1.mp4" playsinline=""></video></figure>



<p>We’re yet to hear an official response from Krafton on the video. Do you think this type of content should be allowed in Inzoi? Or is it a life-simulator living up to its intention? We’re interested to hear your thoughts on this down below and in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1777/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/wanderstop-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Alta is a fighter. She’s trained her whole life to be the very best, forging a bloody path through a sea of enemies. As soon as she becomes the best… well, someone else soon comes along, and it turns out that now they’re the best. Video games don’t tend to spend much time on the psychological state of a warrior who’s lost everything, but Wanderstop deals in the spiral of self-loathing and failure that Alta suffers, showcasing her battle with the mental and physical pain she’s put herself through, and continues to do so.</p>
<p>I’m not a doctor, but I know Alta is suffering from burnout. Her continual struggle and failures have left her exhausted, and she’s fundamentally breaking down. At the opening of Wanderstop, she’s racing through the forest, searching for Master Winters, a legendary warrior turned trainer who Alta believes can make her the greatest warrior. But first, she needs to rest. She can’t keep running at this pace, leaving her sword behind in an effort to keep going, and eventually collapsing.</p>
<p><iframe title="WANDERSTOP | PC, PS5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hsyvk0ArBb4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You wake on a bench, sat next to the cheerfully huge figure of Boro. Boro owns the Wanderstop, a café in the middle of the forest, and while he’s concerned for Alta’s wellbeing, he also seems to want a spot of free labour, asking her if she’ll help out around the place while she recovers. There’s little else to do – it would be an incredibly short game otherwise – so Alta sets about brewing tea, growing exotic plantlife, and rebuilding her self-esteem by focusing on her well-being. For anyone caught up in the daily grind, Wanderstop delivers a message that you’d do well to listen to.</p>
<p>The world of Wanderstop is very beautiful. Painted in gorgeous pink, purple and blue hues, it’s clearly been designed to produce calming and stress-free sensations from players, and It works. Accompanied by the beautiful piano-led soundtrack, which moves between plaintive and playful, Wanderstop is a gorgeous journey for the senses.</p>


<p>Alta has, like most of us, got herself into a series of unhealthy thought processes, not least that pain, brutality and an unceasing desire to be the best, will result in you becoming the best. Wanderstop deals with exhaustion, with alternatives, and ultimately, with being kinder to yourself. Boro is the voice of your friends, your family, and possibly your therapist, telling you to slow down, and it’s a message we all need to hear. Of course, Alta doesn’t want to hear it at first, so instead, you make tea.</p>
<p>The Wanderstop’s tea-making machine, is an immense contraption of cunning and complicated design. There’s no PG Tips or Yorkshire Tea-style tea bags, nor an electric heating element, so instead you have to do everything by hand. This means clambering up ladders, bashing levers, pumping bellows, and adding the right ingredients to create the perfect cup of tea.</p>

<p>Tea is an event, and so is the rest and relaxation that it can bring, so the unnecessarily complicated method of brewing up, plays into the idea that you should enjoy the little things, and that you can make a ritual out of anything. Your customers are an interesting bunch, and their specific needs will dictate what tea you make them, diving into your field guide for ingredients and their helpful qualities.</p>
<p>Wanderstop tells you that there are no specific rules to the way that you play the game. Other than serving tea to customers, which forms the central gameplay mechanic, you can potter about as much as you like, sweeping up leaves, growing magical plants or just drinking tea. Everyone loves drinking tea.</p>
<p>If you’re not brewing tea, Wanderstop goes all Animal Crossing, having you titivate the small area that surrounds the café. You sweep up fallen leaves, snip away brambles and weeds, and water your plants, before having a brew, and then putting a cup in the best dishwasher ever created. Seriously, it’s the <em>best</em>.</p>

<p>Wanderstop continues to plow its games-as-therapy through its 10-hour runtime, and I think its impact will depend on your own experiences with mental health, exhaustion and burnout. If you’ve been through these things, you’ll recognise yourself in Alta’s behaviour, and the tea-making and restful moments here feel like therapy.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it’s a gentle and easy-going form of therapy, but it’s therapy nonetheless. It can be difficult to see yourself in her actions and reactions, and I occasionally longed for Wanderstop just be a game about tea and beautiful foliage, rather than pain. There’s catharsis to those emotions though, and as she works through it, you learn or are reminded to be kinder to yourself. It’s proof once more that games are capable of being so much more than purely entertainment.</p>

			<p>Half-Life 2 RTX can be easily fixed to look much closer to the original game in terms of ambiance and atmosphere with some choice tweaks showcased in a recent video.</p>
<p>The video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2kliksphilip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2kliksphilip</a> highlights how volumetrics and light bounce impact the ambiance in the currently available demo of the RTX Remix project the most. The first is easily fixed by reducing the Max Accumulation Distance, which makes volumetrics update much faster once a light source has been covered, and the Froxel Max Distance settings, which, reduced to 0, completely eliminates fog and similar effects.</p>
<p>The other setting that was changed to make Half-Life 2 RTX look much closer to the original is the Max Expected Average Radiance, which was set to 0 to limit how much lighting bounces around. This creates a much darker atmosphere that's more in line with the limited light bounce the Source 1 engine was capable of.&nbsp; The amazing adjustability of RTX Remix has also allowed the modder to show how Ravenholm would look during the early morning by setting a negative value to fog distance.</p>

<p>Besides being an excellent showcase of how RTX Remix can significantly upgrade older games' visuals, the Half-Life 2 RTX demo is also an excellent showcase of <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-showcase-sampler-feedback-vram/">Sampler Feedback technology</a>, which can be used to significantly lower VRAM usage, which can be a game-changer in the future for those playing games on GPUs with low VRAM.

Players pursue various goals/objectives as they observe and interact with other Zois around town. Some actions can result in Zois fighting with each other, if players choose specific prompts (e.g., “Pick a fight”; “Throw a punch”). Zoi can die from natural or accidental causes (e.g., starvation, electrocution, fire, traffic accidents); among these deaths, death by fire depicts flames visibly engulfing a Zoi's body in dramatic fashion. Players can build relationships and pursue intimate encounters with other Zois, with the ability to romance them via certain prompts (e.g., “Tell a dirty joke”; “Make bedroom eyes”; “Try out a pickup line”). One of these actions (e.g., “Suggest having a baby”) leads to a scene in which Zois appear in bed, with a large heart icon covering them, as confetti bursts on the screen. During the course of the game, Zois can be seen using toilets, accompanied by mosaic/blurred pixelation effects; players can also command Zois to pass gas (e.g., “Fart secretly”).</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s enough to get the T for Teen rating you’d expect for a sandbox life sim like this, and indeed is the same rating The Sims 4 has.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, inZOI players have discovered that they can — accidentally or otherwise — kill NPCs including children by driving into them, at which point the ragdoll physics kick in. Characters run over in this way die immediately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sort of gameplay typically warrants an M for Mature rating in the United States and a PEGI 18 rating across Europe. The Grand Theft Auto games, which carry an M for Mature rating, do let you run over pedestrians but do not feature children outside of cutscenes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While inZOI looks like an early Steam hit, reaching number one on the global Steam top sellers chart just 40 minutes after release and, at the time of this article’s publication, over 56,000 concurrent players, it seems this aspect of the game may have slipped through the net at publisher Krafton.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Krafton for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don't think that Krafton realizes that you can run over children in inZOI,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inZOI/comments/1jldd0w/i_dont_think_that_krafton_realizes_that_you_can/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reads one thread on the inZOI subreddit</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I have early access to inZOI and part of early access is trying to break the game,” redditor HeeeydevonGaming said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is how you report bugs, issues, etc. One of the issues I found is that you can drive into the elementary school and run over.. Unalive the children.. They might want to change this as the game is launching with a T rating.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans believe Krafton will likely patch this out of the game, or risk inZOI having to be resubmitted for a stricter age rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Celebrating the launch today, inZOI Studio CEO and inZOI producer and director Hyungjun ‘Kjun’ Kim said:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I created and nurtured inZOI with great care as if it were my child, though it still has a lot of room for improvement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As inZOI takes its first steps into the world, I feel both proud and somewhat anxious — hoping it won’t stumble or get hurt. It would be deeply appreciated if you could watch over the game with warmth and support.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">inZOI’s Steam page also includes the now essential generative AI disclaimer, which Valve imposes on developers and publishers who use the tech in the creation of their games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Players can generate unique textures for character outfits and various items based on text input. They can also create 3D objects from image input, which can be used as interior decorations or accessories, and add distinctive motions to their Zoi using video input. Additionally, the actions and thoughts of Zois are controlled through sLM technology, enabling more engaging and intuitive interactions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/april-2025s-ps-plus-monthly-games-robocop-texas-chainsaw-digimon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for April 2025 have been announced and fans of 80s action films will be delighted to see the inclusion of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/31/robocop-rogue-city-review/">RoboCop: Rogue City.</a> The future of law enforcement might have a bit of a time going up against the 70s horror icon that is Leatherface, though.</p>

<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be April 1st – no kidding – and they will be available until May 5th.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>RoboCop: Rogue City | PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre | PS5, PS4</strong></li>
<li><strong>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker’s Memory</strong><strong> | PS4&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>RoboCop is the headline act here, with the recent announcement of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/06/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-channels-the-raid-in-this-standalone-expansion/">the standalone expansion RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business</a>. Set between the second and third films, RoboCop methodically stomps around town on the trail of a new drug gang and peel back a new mystery while blasting everything in sight into smithereens. The game has passed a significant milestone with Nacon proudly touting over 1 million players since launch.</p>
<div>
<p>It’s a game that’s divided opinion a little amongst our writers. A few of us have had a great time with it, getting exactly what they want out of a RoboCop game – one-note bipedal cop-bot action – while others were a little less enraptured by this.</p>


</div>
<p>Then there’s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, one of the multitude of asymmetrical multiplayer horror games out there, based on the iconic 1974 film. A group of survivors has to complete tasks and avoid being caught, while one member of the Slaughter Family stalks through the maps and tries to capture all of their ‘guests’. Launching back in 2023, PS Plus will provide a fresh batch of players, and in our review Steve said, “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a fantastic homage to the original film and really shines in its general presentation, but the gaming experience itself proves to be a frustrating one.”</p>

<p>Lastly there’s 2017’s Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker’s Memory. Accused of a crime he didn’t commit,&nbsp;Keisuke Amazawa has to head into the Digital World to prove his innocence, joining a group of hackers &nbsp;while finding, raising and battling with over 320 Digimon.</p>
<h2>Can you still get the March 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 31st March to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/UP0006-PPSA01390_00-DRAGON4STANDBUND">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> | PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0177-CUSA19351_00-SONICCOLORSULTIM">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a> | PS4</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0101-PPSA04490_00-TMNTCOWABUNGAXXX">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</a> | PS4, PS5</strong></li>

			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 design registration went live this week, complete with some illustrations that provide another look at the system launching later this year worldwide.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.tmdn.org/tmdsview-web/#/dsview/detail/GB702025006431128-0001">design registration</a>, which was spotted by Famiiboards forums member <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1691253">fwd-bwd</a>, features different illustrations showcasing the system from different angles, allowing users to get a good look at how the ports are placed on the top and the bottom of the console, where the microSD card slot is located, how the system looks with the kickstand opened up and more. According to user <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1691278" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiC</a>, based on the screen size of 7.9", the console dimensions should be around 201 x 115 x 14 mm.</p>

<p>While yesterday's Nintendo Direct wasn't supposed to reveal anything regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, we still learned that the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-cards-system-overhauls-digital-game-system-introducing-lending-of-digital-games-and-more/">Virtual Game Card system</a>, which will overhaul the original console's digital games system, will also be compatible with the upcoming system. The launch of the Nintendo Today app also brought the confirmation that the new button found on the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-patent-mouse/">Joy-Con controller</a>&nbsp;is indeed called the C button, although its function still remains a mystery. Thankfully, it won't take long to finally know what this button will do, what the Nintendo Switch 2 is capable of, and which games will be available <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/">at launch</a>, as the Nintendo Direct presentation focused on the system will air in five days, on April 2nd.</p>

            <p>Is there a Marvel supervillain themed around PC game memory requirements? Let's assume that there is, and that her name is Dr RAMsbottom. For too long has Dr RAMsbottom - aka the Bottlenecking Belle, aka Zero Sub Sixty - plagued the lives of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> players. For too long has she reduced our superheroic exploits to an unsightly stop-motion parade.</p>
<p>Be of good heart, ye Rivals, for the boffins at NetEase (the ones that weren't <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">suddenly laid off</a> in February) are devising some countermeasures. Specifically, they're thinking about adding a box you can tick to somehow cut back the game's memory usage "significantly" and improve your frame rate.</p><!--more-->
<p>"On PC, we realize that [optimization] is a big problem, especially for the memory consumption," Marvel Rivals director Guangyun Chen told cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-director-says-a-future-patch-will-reduce-the-shooters-insatiable-hunger-for-ram-its-a-very-big-problem/">PCGamer</a> during an interview at GDC 2025. "So it may be that in Season 2, we will have an experimental check box in our launcher players can use to reduce memory [consumption] significantly." </p>
<p>How this will work is unclear. Given that perceptions of lacklustre PC game performance vary wildly between users, I wouldn't put it past NetEase to invoke the old placebo effect and literally just add a box to the title screen with "tick to realise your PC's latent superpowers" written next to it in Arial Bold. Perhaps lying video game menus are Dr RAMsbottom's Kryptonite? They should add a large arrow pointing to the box, just to be safe. </p>
<p>Chen wouldn't be drawn on specifics by PCGamer. "It's a very big problem, but it's a lot of work to organize [a fix]," he acknowledged. "We cannot just release it in a small patch, we have to fully test it. But we realize the problem and we're going to keep optimizing."</p>
<p>I haven't been excessively bothered myself by performance issues running Rivals on my 16GB PC, but then again, I am the kind of sicko who enjoys making pretty games run on low-spec machines. My verdicts are unsound. How have you been getting on with it?</p>
<p>Rivals Season 2 begins on 11th April, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-season-2-will-add-more-team-up-skills-plus-the-usual-new-heroes">there's the promise of new Team-Ups</a>, among other things.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s been a long time since many fan-favorite PlayStation franchises have been seen. This has a lot to do with Japan Studio’s closure in 2021 and Shuhei Yoshida’s departure as president of SIE Worldwide Studios.</p>



<p>Sony is fixated on delivering high-energy, big-time blockbuster games for PlayStation owners. Examples of this strategy include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/guerrilla-games-1-million-players-horizon-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-ghost-of-tsushima-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Tsushima (and Ghost of Yotei)</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-showrunners-address-spores-returning-for-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yuri-lowenthal-spider-man-3-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/returnal-developer-housemarque-teases-mystery-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Returnal</a>. However, it means a less-driven approach toward AA game development.</p>



<p>The gap between indie titles and AAA giants is larger than ever, and part of this is due to Shuhei Yoshida stepping down as SIE Worldwide Studios’ president, which in turn caused Japan Studio to close.</p>



<h2 id="h-sony-playstation-no-longer-wanted-aa-games-on-ps4-or-ps5">Sony PlayStation No Longer Wanted AA Games on PS4 or PS5</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The studio had a Knack for games. Credit to Japan Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a translated interview with <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001799.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AV Watch</a>, Yoshida explained: “I was in charge of the first party, so I was asked to make a game that was powerful enough to sell hardware. When you make something like that, the company pushes you a lot. The company wanted such things, and while we had to make them, the scale of development and the sales required were getting bigger and bigger.”</p>



<p>He added that company creators were coming up with great ideas, and while they were “very creative and interesting,” they were ultimately deemed AA. He said that “Japan Studio ceased to exist” soon after he stepped down as president—an event brought on by PlayStation’s corporate restructuring.</p>



<p>“At that time, the JAPAN studio was a team that was good at making AA, and it was a studio. In that case, it probably doesn’t match what the company and first party are looking for,” explained Yoshida.</p>



<p>Japan Studio was part of the most lauded titles in PlayStation’s catalog: Everybody’s Golf, Ape Escape, LocoRoco, Knack, Patapon, Gravity Rush, and many more. While other studios might pick up these franchises—like Bandai Namco has done with the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-everybodys-golf-hot-shots-announced-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots</a> title—some of these games are now consigned to history.</p>

            <p>Thanks to a little bit of small print, many out there now have hopes that Nintendo may be upgrading some of its OG Switch games for the more powerful <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> console.</p>
<p>During yesterday's Nintendo Direct, the company announced a new feature for Switch and Switch 2 that'll let players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-cards-thatll-let-you-share-you-digital-switch-and-switch-2-games">share their digital games with another console or Family Group members in the same way they might swap a physical cartridge</a> known as Virtual Game Cards.</p>
<p>This little announcement was very welcome in itself, but a particular bit in the small print has since caught the attention of many, with the mention of "Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games".</p>

<p>The small print on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/">Virtual Game Cards information page reads</a>:</p>
<p>"Compatible systems must be linked to a Nintendo Account to use virtual game cards. Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system.</p>
<p>"To move virtual game cards between two systems, you must pair the systems via local wireless and an internet connection, but only when pairing the systems for the first time. Up to two systems total can be linked per Nintendo Account."</p>
<p>The fact Nintendo has made a clear distinction between Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games has led many to speculate that a select number of original Switch games will be getting a bit of an upgrade for the upcoming console, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">which we already know will be backwards compatible</a>. </p>
<p>There have been a number of rather enthusiastic reactions online, with one post reading "WE FUCKING WONNNN OMG".</p>
<p>Others, meanwhile, are remaining cautious about the wording, suggesting that Nintendo is merely suggesting that some games will be released across both Switch and Switch 2 (much like we still see plenty of games debuting on PS4 and Xbox One), while some will be Switch 2 exclusives.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Nintendo for further clarification on its wording.</p>

            <p>Cult horror game The Exit 8 is being adapted into a film and has just received its first trailer.</p>
<p>The film was first announced at the end of last year, and will be released on 29th August this year (in Japan at least), distributed by Toho.</p>
<p>It's directly based on the game from Japanese studio Kotake Create, which sees players stuck in an infinitely-looping Japanese subway.</p>

<p>In the game, players must carefully observe anomalies in the environment in order to advance their escape by turning back. Miss a change and the loop begins anew.</p>
<p>With its minimalist aesthetic and creepy atmosphere, The Exit 8 has become a cult hit since its release on Steam in November 2023. It was later released on Switch in April 2024, PlayStation consoles in August 2024, and Xbox Series X/S earlier this year.</p>
<p>A VR version is also available for Meta Quest headsets and has just been released on mobile devices (iOS and Android).</p>
<p>Genki Kawamura will write, produce, and direct the film, following his work as producer on anime film Suzume, directing and writing the 2022 film Hyakka, and even producing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-pokemon-and-ed-sheeran-collaboration-is-coming-out-next-week">Ed Sheeran's Pokémon music video for Celestial</a>.</p>
<p>The film will star Japanese singer and actor Kazunari Ninomiya as the lost man.</p>

		<p>Amazon’s Luna game streaming service is expanding to Sweden, Portugal, Belgium, and Luxembourg today, the service will now be available in fourteen countries.&nbsp; Those who have Amazon Prime get a free taster selection of games with Fortnite,&nbsp;LEGO Fortnite,&nbsp;Rocket Racing, and Trackmania available all year, and a rotating selection of games per month. March 2025 includes WRC Generations,&nbsp;Overcooked! 2,&nbsp;Spitlings,&nbsp;The Jackbox Party Pack 3, and&nbsp;Strange Horticulture,.</p>
<p>Luna also announced a partnership with EA which will see some of the publisher’s games join Luna. &nbsp;Starting today,&nbsp;Star Wars Jedi: Survivor,&nbsp;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and&nbsp;Dead Space are available to Luna+ subscribers, “with more games coming soon.” This will include “More of EA’s popular franchises, including select games from the EA SPORTS portfolio.”</p>


<p>“Our teams are focused on building experiences that entertain and engage EA’s massive online communities, and we’re excited to partner with Amazon to make those games available to even more people,” said David Tinson, EVP and Chief Experiences Officer, Electronic Arts. “We look forward to a selection of EA games joining Amazon Luna, offering new ways for players and fans to come together across a variety of devices they already own, wherever they are.”</p>
<p>This does mean EA games are available on both EA Play and Amazon Luna but as Luna only has a few older games it’s probably not going to significantly impact subscription to the EA service.</p>

<p>We took a look at Amazon Luna back in 2023 when it launched, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/14/amazon-luna-review-can-you-buy-streaming-success/">you can read our thoughts here.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/pillars-of-eternity-is-getting-a-turn-based-combat-mode-later-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Obsidian has announced, for the tenth anniversary of its release, that their decade-old CRPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> is getting a new turn-based combat mode later this year.</p>
<p>The announcement came alongside an update to the game to coincide with its anniversary, fixing a smattering of issues, such as GOG Achievements not working, improving 4K resolution support and more. That’s a nice update, but the big change is with the upcoming turn-based combat mode.</p>


<p>“We’ve been hard at work delving deep into the code grimoire and tuning the balance of blade and spell—and today, we’re excited to share the results of that effort with a brand new patch,” <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134573-patch-138087535-is-live/">the team writes in their forums</a>. This update addresses a wide range of fixes and improvements across visuals, combat, quests, and more. Whether you’re journeying through the Eastern Reach for the first time or returning to tie up loose threads, your path should now be a little smoother.</p>
<p>“But that’s not all—we have something special on the horizon.</p>
<p>“Coming later this year, Watchers will be able to help us test a brand-new feature: Turn-Based Combat. We’re excited to explore this new way to experience encounters in Pillars of Eternity, and your feedback will help shape its future. More details on how to participate will be shared in the near future, so keep an eye on our socials and in our Discord.”</p>

<p>Before there was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/">Avowed</a>, Obsidian founded their original fantasy universe with the Kickstarter-backed Pillars of Eternity. This was a smaller budget throwback to classic CRPGs, in tone and general style.</p>
<p>Pillars of Eternity was a game with real-time combat and pause at launch, meaning that you could still have plenty of time to make your decisions and enact them, but with a fundamentally real-time underpinning. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/08/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire-review/">Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire</a>, meanwhile, introduced an optional turn-based combat mode, which is now being rolled back to the original game. It’s sure to be a popular option, giving players that more traditional D&amp;D-style experience and more deterministic decision-making – you’ll no longer have to factor in time for movement and tick down second on ability cooldowns.</p>
<p>Digging back into our own archives to find our review of Pillars of Eternity, Gareth said of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/29/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review/">the 2017 Complete Edition console port</a>, “Pillars of Eternity is a stellar entry into its genre, but one that won’t win over people who are not already fans. It is huge and richly detailed, with more history than some actual periods of real life, and a rare amount of care and attention. It’s probably a better experience on a PC, but it’s still definitely worth playing on console if it’s your only option.”</p>

		<p>I’m on my travels to play a game today, which I can actually tell you about next week. So with plenty of time while waiting for and while on various modes of transportation, I’ve been playing a bunch of retro stuff on a bunch of retro handhelds, including the Retroid Pocket 5. It’s mostly been Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy 9, both of which I haven’t played for a long time, and I’m enjoying rediscovering the stories of each. Besides that, it’s been more Yakuza: Like a Dragon, some Wanderstop, and I checked out the extremely promising <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/clair-obscur-expedition-33-final-preview-a-journey-through-the-devastation-of-loss/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> has played Assassin’s Creed Shadows this week, which he says, “Definitely adds some cool refined mechanics to the series, but has way too much filler for my liking. It would be easier to overlook if the main story and characters were a lot more interesting – hopefully it’s just a case of Shadows getting off to a slow start. Either way, Ubisoft’s depiction of feudal Japan is stunning in its historical authenticity and natural beauty, supercharged by immersive weather and lighting effects. I also appreciate the various game settings on hand, allowing insta-kills with the hidden blade and switching off the guided exploration.”</p>
<p>Next up, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2. Because, of course he has, but <strong>Gamoc</strong> played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall</a> for our review and enjoyed wrapping up its British flavoured sci-fi mystery. Otherwise, he’s also been playing more AC Shadows, which he says is great! He told us, “I might need to turn the difficulty up though as stealth and combat are a bit too easy. Also played Phasmophobia, where I’m level 100 and about to prestige, it is still perhaps the single biggest surprise I’ve had in games – I didn’t think I’d like it so much at all.”</p>


<p><strong>Aran</strong> has had a quieter week, just diving into his favourites in the shape of Witcher 3 and Football Manager. <strong>Tef</strong> has had more time, greatly enjoying <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/33-immortals-early-access-preview/">33 Immortals</a>. He says, “It’s become my mindless chillout game. The playerbase feels like it’s at the stage where it can pretty easily smash through the first level and boss with ease, and I’m making my way through levelling up all the weapons and things. It really is like a bitesized version of farming an MMO raid.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round this week out with <strong>Steve</strong> who finished Avowed. He says it was, “Decent but felt like it dragged a little by the end. I perhaps made the combat too simple by focusing too much on two handed sword and rifle which made most fights a walkover. Sounds like pistol and grimoire is the most fun way to play.” That wasn’t all he had time for though, continuing, “I also rattled through the very silly old school shooter Slayers X and followed that up with some Mullet Madjack which is a great adrenaline-filled Crank shooter. I have carried on trying to plough through Lego Star Wars Skywalker but there is just so much to do that I’m not sure I can be bothered to 100% it – something I’ve done with every other Lego game (apart from the terrible Lego Movie 2 one). I also finished Dancing Panda and Your House for reviews which should be up next week. I’m installing Atomfall for my next big game.”</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

Horizon: Zero Dawn composer Joris de Man has expressed a tentative interest in the return of Guerrilla's Killzone shooter series, which was once touted as PlayStation's answer to Halo, Call Of Duty, and Gears Of War.</p>
<p>If you've never played a Killzone game - not surprising, given that they only ever officially made it to PC via Sony's now-retired PlayStation Now subscription service, and don't run on the current generation of PlayStation consoles - they're essentially World War 2 meets Aliens with a thin dusting of satirical intent. They involve a lot of manly shrieking about incoming shells, many legally distinct, lightbulb-eyed stormtroopers, and some sadistically unsafe dropships with rooftop guardrails that wouldn't stop a toddler falling off a chair. Also, Brian Cox has a lot of fun playing Space Hitler. Look at him go.</p>

<p>De Man reckons there's appetite for a Killzone remaster series, but is also of the opinion that people don't want to play a shooter as "bleak" as Killzone today.</p>
<p>"I know that there have been petitions for it," he told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/killzone-composer-would-love-a-remaster-trilogy-dont-know-new-game/">Videogamer</a> in an interview for the PlayStation: The Concert Tour, which showcases music from first-party games like The Last Of Us. "I think it's tricky because, I can't speak for Guerrilla or anything... I don't know if it will ever happen. I hope it will because I think it is quite an iconic franchise, but also I think it kind of has to take into account kind of the sensitivities and the shift in, I guess, what people want because it is quite bleak in some ways. 
</p>
<p>
"I think a remastered one would be successful," de Man added. "I don't know if a new game would be as much. I don't know if people have moved on from it and want something.... I don't know, sometimes I get the sense that people want something a bit more casual, a bit more quick." (I've edited Videogamer's transcript lightly for legibility.) 
</p>
<p>
Quite a lot to unpack, there. Working backwards, I don't remotely think that the old Killzone FPS house style is too demanding for today's crowd. I remember Killzone 2 as Call Of Duty with a wonky but serviceable lock-to-cover system, and some enjoyably crapulent architecture. I'd say the problem is more that linear campaign shooters like the classic Killzones don't get nearly enough traction for the suits at present. You're either Call Of Duty with a raucous entrenched audience who demand a new single player offering every year, or you're a live service battle royale and/or hero shooter, like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.
</p>
<p>
And then there's this point about Killzone fiction being too "bleak". If de Man genuinely thinks that tastes are trending away from dystopian war fables ridden with fascist iconography, I would gently invite him to 1) read a newspaper or go into a pub or just stick his head through the window of the nearest house, and 2) play some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> and especially, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, which is arguably a Killzone spiritual successor - hence <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-first-licensed-crossover-is-also-killzones-official-debut-on-pc-sort-of">its very first crossover collaboration</a>.</p>
<p>I suspect that, in practice, a new Killzone game that plays up the old Axis aesthetics would find an unironically eager following among players who think that Homelander's a nice guy once you get to know him. You can imagine the based blowhards of ShiXter dog-piling Guerrilla for portraying the Helghast as the baddies.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's what de Man is getting at, I don't know. I'm obviously putting a lot of words in his mouth. Do you have any to add? Or any thoughts on the individual Killzone games? I enjoyed the top-down PSP spin-offs but never played Shadowfall, the most recent incarnation on PS4.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-canceled-by-wb/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warner Bros. Games have canceled Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition even before its official announcement. The news <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzEwMzc5MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzNzA4NTkyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFNSRDZUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.dGBdhB7lWw3cxZNYXHsmp5Xz3rOJ-TM3ph6fDrDzGpg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, who was also the first to report on its existence <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in June 2024</a>. Avalanche Software was developing this version of the best-selling game of 2023 with the help of Rocksteady. A few months ago, insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition was scheduled to launch in 2025 with 10–15 hours of new content and a price of $20–30 for owners of the base game.</p>
<p>This more or less lines up with Schreier's new report, which says that it would have restored a cut storyline tied to one of the game's companions. However, Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition was canceled partly because Warner Bros. Games was concerned that the amount of new content would not be enough to justify the price. Ultimately, they must have thought it was simply not worth the effort instead of going for a lower price.</p>
<p>It's a shame, especially since I was really hoping that Avalanche Software and Rocksteady would take the opportunity to fix or at least greatly reduce the awful stuttering that still plagues the game on PC, even with DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation enabled <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a GeForce RTX 5090</a>. At least the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-pc-gets-modding-tool-and-built-in-support-on-january-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently updated</a> with official modding support on PC, although I doubt that it will take off in as big a way as it does for Bethesda's games and a few others.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Bloomberg report also clarifies that the Hogwarts Legacy sequel is still in development at Avalanche Software, though there were few doubts about that, given that the original has sold over 34 million units to date. Schreier recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-reportedly-wont-be-live-service-hogwarts-definitive-edition-will-include-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the sequel won't be a live service game, despite prior comments from Warner Bros. Games about wanting to expand the franchise into that area.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> has cancelled a major expansion to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> as part of ongoing restructuring, as the company faces financial woes.</p>
<p>The planned expansion to the company's biggest success in recent years would have added new storylines on its release later this year, alongside a "Definitive Edition" including all content.</p>
<p>However, according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzEwMzc5MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzNzA4NTkyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFNSRDZUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.dGBdhB7lWw3cxZNYXHsmp5Xz3rOJ-TM3ph6fDrDzGpg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, the expansion has been scrapped - the expansion itself was never publicly announced, but was reported by the outlet last year.</p>

<p>In part, the expansion was cancelled due to the content not being substantial enough to justify its price, anonymous sources told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Developer Avalanche was reportedly working with Rocksteady Studios on the expansion, which would restore a storyline based on a companion cut during development of the original game.</p>
<p>Last year, Rocksteady released its Suicide Squad live-service game, which was deemed a financial failure. Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">studio suffered a round of layoffs</a>, but is now reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">working on a new single-player Batman game</a> as it returns to its biggest success.</p>
<p>The news follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancellation by Warner Bros. of its Wonder Woman game</a>, as well as the closure of its Monolith Productions studio, in addition to Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This was described as a "strategic change in direction", the publisher said.</p>
<p>It's now doubling down on its biggest franchises: Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC, and Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy has sold over 34m copies to become one of the best-selling games ever, but Warner Bros. has been unable to replicate its success elsewhere. A sequel is in development by Avalanche.</p>
<p>"We can rage about the system, the stock market, and the bad luck all we like, and we'd have a good point - it is our purpose, as journalists, punters and just humans, to seek out systemic explanations, to flush out the patterns, when the same things keep going wrong," wrote Eurogamer deputy editor Chris Tapsell about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-hellish-decade-offers-a-valuable-lesson-to-gamings-power-brokers-sometimes-youve-nobody-to-blame-but-yourselves">Warner Bros. Games' decade of mismanagement</a>.</p>
<p>"And systemic issues are real. So are individuals. And this industry will get nowhere without those individuals who make the big calls first taking a long, hard look in the mirror."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It looks like we will be able to pre-order a Nintendo Switch 2 as of next week.</p>
<p>According to a now-deleted post on Best Buy Canada, pre-orders for the Switch successor will go live on 2nd April. That is the same day as Nintendo's dedicated Switch 2 Direct.</p>

<p>The post was removed from the website after publication, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-start-april-2">IGN </a>caught a glimpse before it was deleted. "Pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 will open on April 2nd at Best Buy Canada," the blog post read.</p>
<p>As IGN noted, it is unclear if it's just Best Buy Canada which has plans to kick off Switch 2 pre-orders next Wednesday, or whether other major retailers will follow suit. It is fair to assume, though, Nintendo will reveal a console release date during its Direct next week, and announce pre-orders at the same time.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2 was officially announced in January</a>, with a brief little teaser giving us a glimpse of the console. Here, we got a peek at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">Switch 2's rumoured mouse functionality</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">a new Mario Kart game</a>. More will be shared next week, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">the upcoming showcase promising "a closer look at Nintendo Switch 2"</a>.</p>
<p>And, that pre-order release date isn't the only little Switch 2 nugget that has slipped free ahead of the Direct. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-finally-confirmed">console's rumoured 'C' button has been confirmed ahead of schedule</a>, thanks to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">promotional image shared on Google Play and the App Store for Nintendo's new Today app</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
