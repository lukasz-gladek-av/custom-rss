              <p>Good music can make even the most boring tasks somewhat bearable. Listening to some Bruno Mars or Taylor Swift during long commutes or while doing the dishes is a good way to push through them with ease. The market is filled with headphones, and picking the right one can be overwhelming. If you’re after a pair that’s comfortable to wear for long hours, offers multiple listening modes, and doesn’t blow your budget, we have good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6274/">The highly rated Bose QuietComfort wireless headphones are going for just $179 at Amazon, after the retailer slashed a whopping 49% off their retail price.</a> You’re saving a massive $170 on a premium pair, and this deal applies to the stunning Standstone color option. Not your vibe? Several other options are discounted, too, including black, gray, lilac, and pink. Those who prefer their audio gear to be on the minimal side should grab the black version. If a pop of color is what you like, consider going for the blue pair. Both of these are sitting at $199, after dropping from $349. The discount is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, and there are no delivery charges to worry about. You also don’t need to add any long coupon codes or follow complicated processes to score the drop. Just click Add to cart, and proceed with checkout at the discounted rate.</p>

<h2>Superior Sound</h2>
<p>These are made for extended use. That’s thanks to a comfortable padded band paired with plush over-ear cushions that hug your ears softly for a secure, snuggly fit. The band keeps them in place, even when you’re taking a walk, jogging around, or trying to get a workout in with some energetic music to keep you going.</p>
<p>There are two listening modes to choose from; Quiet and Aware. The quiet mode blocks all the external noise, offering an immersive listening experience with no distractions. It’s great for when you want to focus on a task and don’t want background chatter and noise impacting your flow (or chain of thoughts) negatively. Aware mode, on the other hand, keeps you..well, aware of your surroundings. It lets some sounds in, making it easy to stay in the loop on what’s happening around you. You’ll be able to have conversations with this on, hear when the barista calls your name, etc. This mode is great for when you’re in a public area and can’t afford zoning out completely. Adjustable EQ makes it easy to tweak audio settings based on what you like, so you’ll always enjoy a custom listening experience.</p>



<p>The headphones offer up to 24 hours of battery on a single charge, which is more than enough to go at least a couple of days without worrying about plugging them in. Plus, when running low, a quick 15-minute charge via USB-C gives you an additional 2.5 hours of jamming; perfect for when you’re on the go and don’t have the time to power them up completely. Even better, these support wired connectivity just as well, so you also have the option to use them with the included audio cable, too, which works even when you’re out of battery. It’s best to use the pair with the dedicated Bose app to enjoy the latest features and adjust settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6274/">Amazon is letting you grab these for just $179 now, making the upgrade quite affordable.</a> You’re saving 49% on a top-rated option, plus there are several color options to choose from, which makes it easy to choose the one that fits your aesthetics the best. But again, grab it quickly, as once the deal is gone, it likely won’t come back anytime soon.</p>

<p>It’s time to admit, before God and the good readers of Ars Technica, that I have a problem. I love roguelikes. Reader, I can’t get enough of them. If there’s even a whisper of a hot new roguelike on Steam, I’m <em>there</em>. You may call them arcane, repetitive, or maddeningly difficult; I call them heaven.</p>
<p>The second best part of video games is taking a puny little character and, over 100 hours, transforming that adventurer into a god of destruction. The best thing about video games is doing the same thing in under an hour. Beat a combat encounter, get an upgrade. Enter a new area, choose a new item. Put together a build and watch it sing.</p>
<p>If you die—immediately ending your ascent and returning you to the beginning of the game—you’ll often make a pit stop at a home base to unlock new goodies to help you on your next run. (Some people distiguish between roguelikes and “roguelites,” with the latter including permanent, between-run upgrades. For simplicity’s sake, I’ll use “roguelike” as an umbrella term).</p>
<p>2025 has been a truly horrific year for most things. But for roguelikes? It’s been an embarrassment of riches. Because I’m an editor and there’s no one here to stop me, I’d like to tell you about them. To keep things manageable, I’ll stick to games that hit 1.0 in 2025.</p>
<h2><em>Hades II</em></h2>

<p>Where else could we start? In a year of wall-to-wall video game showstoppers, <em>Hades II</em> sticks out. The first <em>Hades</em> got our nod for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/ars-technicas-best-games-of-2020/">best game of 2020</a>, and <em>Hades 2</em> certainly has my vote for 2025.</p>
<p>This time, you play as Melinoë, sister to <em>Hades</em> protagonist Zagreus and daughter of Hades himself, as she attempts to take back the house of Hades from Chronos, the titan of time. The cast of Olympian gods returns to bestow blessings (upgrades to your various attacks and defensive maneuvers) to help you on your way. If you played the first game, you’ll know what you’re getting into here; the sequel just vastly expands the content and mechanics.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>As you fight through the game’s two different paths, you’ll slowly uncover the game’s story via little snippets of dialogue (there’s a truly mind-boggling amount of dialogue in this game), and oodles of unlockables and endgame challenge runs ensure you’ll be playing for a long time.</p>
<p>You won’t find many roguelikes with higher production values. The game is $30. Madness! If you like roguelikes, you’ve probably already picked this up. I’ll go further, though. If you enjoy video games at all, you should buy <em>Hades II</em>. It’s that good.</p>

<h2><em>Ball x Pit</em></h2>



<p>You ever boot up a new game and immediately think, “Well, this thing is going to be a problem for me”? Yeah.</p>
<p>We’ve been blessed with several pachinko-style roguelites over the past couple of years (<em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/peglin-is-the-roguelike-peggle-rpg-we-didnt-know-we-needed/">Peglin</a></em>, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2667120/Ballionaire/">Ballionaire</a></em>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3191030/Nubbys_Number_Factory/"><em>Nubby’s Number Factory</em></a> are all worth your time); now comes a take on another ball-centric classic. I’m talking about last month’s <em>Ball x Pit</em>, a roguelite version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)"><em>Breakout</em></a>. Or at least that’s the simple way to describe it. In actuality, the game is that rarest of finds: something that feels unique.</p>
<p>Take one of your many and varied characters onto the battlefield, and you’ll lob a stream of balls toward the top of the screen, where slowly descending enemies periodically fire attacks back at you. When you level up, you’ll choose “special balls,” which have all manner of effects, like inflicting fire or poison on enemies or balls that explode into other balls. As the game progresses, you can “fuse” these balls together, combining the effects. Sometimes, you’ll be able to “evolve” two balls into an entirely new type of ball. Not enough for you? Slam two evolved balls together for even more wackiness.</p>
<p>The moment-to-moment gameplay is fantastic, with different characters and upgrades forcing you to play differently to succeed. The game doles out new mechanics and surprises along the way to keep things fresh, though this is a game you can “complete”; the between-run metaprogression eventually lets you become a bit of a god.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>A base-building system—and a minigame in which you bounce your characters around the map to activate buildings—is a nice, thematic diversion between runs, but it’s mostly just a flashy upgrade screen. I usually just wanted to get back into the game as soon as possible.</p>

<p><em>Absolum</em>’s well-regarded <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3713610/Absolum_Demo/">demo</a> was released in June, but this thing came out of nowhere for me. The elevator pitch: a beat ‘em up, but make it roguelite.</p>
<p>Not really a beat ‘em up fan? Me neither. Doesn’t matter. The last side-scrolling brawler I played for more than an hour was probably 1991’s <em>The Simpsons</em> arcade game or that same year’s <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time</em> (though the original TMNT arcade game from 1989 was my first quarter-munching arcade love).</p>

<p>The game features gorgeous hand-drawn visuals and the year’s best soundtrack, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yShiPI-gPeA&amp;list=RDyShiPI-gPeA&amp;start_radio=1">this absolute banger</a> from <em>Doom</em>’s Mick Gordon (that’s from a particularly metal boss fight; most of the songs are more fantasy-forward).</p>
<p>Over your runs, you’ll traverse multiple paths, finding secrets and unlocking new features. The roguelike elements are a bit thin at first, but piecing together powerful builds becomes simple as you fill out your options. The combat is sublime—you can get away with button-mashing for a while, but you’ll want to learn at least some of its intricacies to make it to the end.</p>
<p>This thing’s the complete package, and it’s easily one of the best games of the year. Bring along a friend if you’re into co-op. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3713610/Absolum_Demo/">surprisingly beefy demo</a> is still available—there’s really no excuse not to check it out.</p>
<h2><em>Clover Pit</em></h2>



<p>I’ve never actually been to a casino, but judging by the electric dopamine surge I get when hitting a jackpot in the slot machine roguelike <em>Clover Pit</em>, I know I should maintain my chastity.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><em>Clover Pit</em> locks you in a disgusting, blood-soaked closet of a room, and the only way to earn your freedom is to deposit money into an ATM over a series of ever-increasing payments. In other words, it’s what’s come to be known in some circles as a <em>Balatro</em>-like, aka a numbers-go-up game (of course, <em>Balatro</em> was just the first such game to hit it big; the genre’s true progenitor came a year or so earlier in the form of another excellent slot machine roguelike, <em>Luck be a Landlord</em>).</p>
<p>Standing on a trap door that will drop you to your death if you fail to hit your deadlines, you’ll pull a lever on a slot machine over and over, hoping to hit it big. It’s not totally random, though, of course. Purchaseable trinkets allow you to manipulate your odds, trigger beneficial effects, and multiply your score. Getting a jackpot of all 7’s? It’s easier than you may think.</p>
<p>Don’t expect <em>Balatro</em>-like depth—most strategies here involve simply picking one symbol and buffing it to high heaven—but fun, game-breaking builds are easy to put together to make you feel like a winner. There’s something disconcertingly hypnotic and soothing about repeatedly pulling a slot machine lever—it’s best to do it here, where you won’t end up losing your home.</p>
<h2><em>Shape of Dreams</em></h2>



<p>I’ve been playing the hell out of this game, but if you stopped me on the street, I could not tell you what it’s called. Forgettable name aside, I love it.</p>
<p>I’ve heard the game’s combat and controls described as MOBA-like. That seems reasonable, at least from what I remember from my ill-advised and short-lived attempt to get into <em>Dota 2</em> a decade ago. Don’t let that scare you off, though; this is basically a top-down action RPG where you’ll be fighting through small rooms of enemies, <em>Hades</em>-style.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<p>What makes it special is its skill system. You start each run with a couple of attacks and a passive ability, and you’ll pick up (and replace) skills as you go. Each skill—here called “memories” (don’t ask me; I skipped the lore)—can fit up to three “essences,” modifications that affect how the skill functions. You can rearrange these modifications at any time, enabling a “make your own skill” system that’s endlessly fascinating.</p>
<p>Unique unlockable characters and robust metaprogression skill trees will keep you busy for embarrassing amounts of time. You can even play with friends. Before long, you’ll be creating game-breaking, room-nuking builds, the hallmark of my favorite games of the genre.</p>
<h2><em>Megabonk</em></h2>



<p>As its name might suggest, <em>Megabonk</em> is not a serious game. Unlike some other games on this list, there’s no chance of this one becoming an all-time great. But there’s a reason this buzzy little title has been on many gamers’ lips since its release in September. The concept is simple: it’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> meets <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>.</p>
<p>If you’ve played both games, mash them up in your mind and you’ll know exactly how this thing plays. And not just in the way that most “<em>Survivor</em>-likes” tread extremely similar ground to the original. <em>Megabonk</em>‘s treasure-chest-opening animation is ripped straight from <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and the game’s structure and items (down to the artwork style) are basically just <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>.</p>
<p>So no, it’s in no way original. And I was disappointed to learn that there are only two real “stages” to play; a <em>Risk of Rain-</em>style teleporter just takes you to a harder version of the stage you’ve picked. There are also balance issues; the damage scaling on anything but the first 10-minute stage is absurd. But there is some ridiculous fun to be had with it.</p>
<p>If you’re not into the whole auto-shooter/bullet heaven thing, there’s nothing here for you. But if you’re interested in seeing how chaotic a third-person <em>Vampire Survivors</em> can get, step right up.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>It’s also the one 2025 game where you can play as a sunglasses-wearing, skateboarding skeleton who throws bouncing bones at enemies. In these tough times, that’s not nothing.</p>
<h2><em>Deep Rock Galactic Survivor</em></h2>



<p>We’ve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-is-a-fine-entry-point-into-the-auto-shooting-depths/">talked about</a> this <em>Survivors</em>-like take on the beloved co-op shooter <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em> a couple of times over its Early Access period, but we were remiss in discussing it upon its 1.0 release last month. The game was already an Ars favorite, but its progression systems still needed a bit of work. It’s now ready for public consumption, and it’s one of the best auto-shooters on the market. It’s so good that you might want to take a look at it even if you want nothing to do with the oversaturated subgenre.</p>
<p>Its <em>Vampire Survivor</em>-like bones are obvious—you walk around a map while your weapons fire automatically at hordes of enemies closing in on you. Collect the XP gems defeated enemies drop to level up and choose an upgrade. The difference here is that you’re also able to mine through walls of rocks, letting you escape tricky situations and funnel bad guys to traps you’ve laid.</p>
<p>The progression system is heavy on the grind, but there’s plenty of fun to be had no matter how hardcore you want to be about it.</p>
<p>Rock and stone!</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em></h2>



<p>Five years after the original, it’s time for the sequel to the second-best roguelike deckbuilder of all time (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2868840/Slay_the_Spire_2/">the sequel to the first-best roguelike deckbuilder</a> has—thankfully, if I’m being honest—been delayed until the beginning of next year). As in the first game, and as the game’s title might suggest, you’ll be fighting monsters on a train, trying to stop them before they ascend three floors to reach your “pyre”—your health pool for the run.</p>
<p>In <em>Monster Train 2</em>, as in any deckbuilder, you start with a fairly crappy deck of cards and upgrade and expand it throughout your run to try to make it to the end. But in addition to the usual spells and attacks, <em>Monster Train 2</em> gives you units to assign to the different levels of your battlefield, infusing an interesting spatial element to the cartoonishly violent proceedings.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>The sequel is more of the first game, but with smart updates that make everything flow smoother. It’s one of my favorite games of the year, and I highly recommend it to any fan of tactical card games.</p>
<h2><em>Deadzone Rogue</em></h2>



<p><em>Deadzone Rogue</em> instantly joins the pantheon of roguelite first-person looter shooters, which includes perennial favorites <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1217060/Gunfire_Reborn/"><em>Gunfire Reborn</em></a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/692890/Roboquest/"><em>Roboquest</em></a> (I haven’t played them yet, but the brand-new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721110/Abyssus/"><em>Abyssus</em></a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2615540/VOIDBREAKER/"><em>Void/Breaker</em></a> are also generating a bunch of buzz).</p>
<p>Where <em>Roboquest</em> excels at fun, <em>Doom</em>-like movement and colorful environments, <em>Deadzone Rogue</em> is all about the shooting. The game has the best gunplay of any FPS roguelike I’ve played, and the random weapons, armor, and upgrades you get give each run a sense of personality.</p>
<p>The game’s music, voice acting, and lore are best ignored, but the sound design is nice and punchy. This won’t be a game you’ll play for 100 hours, but sometimes it’s just fun to shoot a gun in a video game, and <em>Deadzone Rogue</em> gets that simple formula right.</p>
<h2><em>9 Kings</em></h2>



<p>Look, I’m going to cheat here, and I’m not ashamed of it. It’s true—<em>9 Kings</em> is not fully released. But I can’t not talk about. I initially wrote the game off when it was released into Early Access in July, thinking it looked too simple. It <em>is</em> simple, but that’s to its credit.</p>
<p>The premise is easy to explain: Build a little kingdom on a 3-by-3 grid of squares. Play a card to construct or upgrade a building or unit in your kingdom. Afterward, a neighboring kingdom will attack, and your units will automatically fight to defend your home. After the battle, you draft a card from the defeated kingdom to add to your hand.</p>
<p>As you can see from the above screenshot, you can expand your kingdom beyond the initial nine squares, and unlockable perks change up the way you play each king. A handful of enemies are randomly chosen from the pool of nine, meaning that the cards you can draft each run will be different.</p>
<p>Making busted builds and fighting your way up the difficulty levels is extremely compelling; there was a week where the “one more run” curse descended on me, and I did little else than play this game.</p>

                <p>The popular AI VTuber Neuro-Sama is attempting to complete<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990"> Minecraft</a> Hardcore, and her human supervisors appear to be losing all hope following a series of comedic but disappointing failures on her part.</p><p>Neuro is an AI-powered VTuber created by streamer <a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987</a>, and she utilizes a large language model with rapid response times, and the ability to "see" screens, read her own Twitch chat, respond to speech in almost real time, and even play games. Now, she's attempting Minecraft's Hardcore mode--the permadeath version of Minecraft that wipes the game world as soon as one player dies. Vedal, along with fellow VTubers<a href="https://twitch.tv/crelly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Crelly </a>and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/filian" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filian</a>, has claimed that the Twitch stream will not end until the quartet complete the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcE_dHvaN2Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZcE_dHvaN2Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To complete Minecraft, the four need to get to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-to-the-end-in-minecraft/1100-6531635/" data-ref-id="1100-6531635">The End</a> to face off against the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-ender-dragon-boss-guide-where-to-find-and-how-to-beat/1100-6531625/" data-ref-id="1100-6531625"> Ender Dragon</a>--not an easy feat at the best of times, and certainly not when you're relying on a childlike AI to make the right decisions, follow instructions, and cheat death.</p><p>As if that didn't sound complex enough, Neuro has been making some interesting choices that have resulted in yet another world reset. Neuro often gets overwhelmed with bloodlust, seeking out mobs during the night and facing off against them with less than ideal strategies. She's not yet mastered the "hit and shield" approach of attacking mobs, so she'll repeatedly land weak attacks on them until they inevitably overcome her.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcQNHxSGrVo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UcQNHxSGrVo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Alongside the usual Minecraft deaths--such as being blown up by Creepers, attacked by an Enderman, or falling into a lava pit--Neuro has seemingly decided to troll her creator and his friends. Clad entirely in enchanted diamond armor, the four set off for the Nether to find Blaze Rods--an ingredient essential for finding the portal to The End--where Neuro immediately began to build a bridge over a large lava lake. After taking an extended look back at the portal to the overworld, she spammed crouch and then walked off the end of the bridge and burned to death.</p><p>On another attempt, after becoming overwhelmed by that aforementioned bloodlust, Neuro slayed an innocent Villager. In Minecraft, if you damage a Villager in a village protected by an Iron Golem, that Golem will not take kindly to your actions. Neuro found this out the hard way, and in just two hits she was dead, and the run was over.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xPyoaBEc5k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xPyoaBEc5k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As the attempts progress, Crelly--who has become Neuro's "stepmother" and often entrusted with babysitting the AI--is becoming increasingly frustrated with Neuro's frequent mistakes. "She wants to die!" yelled the cow YouTuber after attempt number 74. "Neuro, Neuro, Neuro!" she shouts during attempt 80, when Neuro-Sama insisted upon digging upwards out of a safe area Crelly had created for her. "Neuro, that's an Enderman; let's not look at him. Follow me!" she adds. It's safe to say the trust in Neuro's Minecraft capabilities is rapidly depleting.</p><p>At the time of writing, the streamers are taking a sleep break after attempt number 83, and the stream has been live since Friday, December 5, at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET / 7 PM GMT. According to YouTube editor <a href="https://youtu.be/4xPyoaBEc5k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">KeidenEdits</a>, Neuro has been responsible for 47 deaths, Filian for 14 deaths, Vedal for 13 deaths, and Crelly for 10 deaths. Of those statistics, 17 have been Zombies, 11 have been Creepers, and 11 have been Skeletons. Nine deaths have resulted from fall damage, eight from drowning, four from the Iron Golem, four from lava, Neuro has turned homicidal four times, the Drowned mob has committed two murders, two from Zombified Piglins, two from an Enderman, and one a piece for the Witch, Spider, Husk, and Guardian mobs. Neuro has starved to death once, Vedal has accidentally killed once, and Neuro has suffocated in sand once.</p><p>The four plan to resume their attempts today, December 8, at 8:30 AM PT / 11:30 AM ET / 4:30 PM GMT.</p>

<figure data-uuid="13c74898f9e33"><a title="System Shock 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/13c74898f9e33/system-shock-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nightdive Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nightdive Studios is bringing its awesome <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake to the Switch and Switch 2, and we can now exclusively reveal that it'll be available to play from <strong>18th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Originally released in 2023, System Shock is a comprehensive yet faithful remake of the 1994 FPS from Looking Light Studios. Development was lengthy and somewhat troubled, with Nightdive striving to reboot the original with more modern design principles.</p>
<p>In the end, however, to deliver on the promises of its initial Kickstarter campaign, the team chose to lean more towards a remake, keeping the core elements of the original intact while introducing a plethora of quality-of-life updates.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pmgzwx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Ultimately, Nightdive succeeded in its goal, and System Shock received mostly positive critical acclaim upon release. Taking place in the year 2072, you play as an unnamed hacker who awakens in a station under total control of SHODAN, an AI completely removed from its moral and ethical restraints. Grotesque mutations and cyborgs roam the station, and it's up to you to defeat SHODAN.</p>
<p>With visuals blending pixel art textures and modern lighting technology, the System Shock remake is, to put it lightly, a <em>vibe</em>. It's a significantly different experience compared to System Shock 2, which Nightdive also released on the Switch earlier this year. If you're curious, we definitely recommend giving it a shot. For those on Switch 2, the game will offer up both gyro aiming and optional mouse controls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Unravel the chilling story of SHODAN's rise and explore the mysteries of Citadel Station, piecing together the truth in this atmospheric sci-fi world</p>
<p>- Face perilous traps, puzzles, and a legion of hostile and mutated creatures — created and controlled by the villainous SHODAN herself</p>
<p>- Choose between a male or female-presenting Hacker protagonist</p>
<p>- Improved gyro aiming and Joy-Con 2 mouse support adds gameplay versatility for both controller and mouse and keyboard players</p>
</blockquote>

              <p>Laptop upgrades don’t always have to break the bank. Even though Black Friday and Cyber Monday are long gone, there are ways to bag some massive discounts on items across a range of categories, including laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6273/">Gamers and creatives looking to upgrade their everyday machine should consider grabbing the 15-inch Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3, which is currently available at a whopping 65% discount at Amazon.</a> It would run you around $2,000 on a regular day, but you can grab it today for just $700. That’s similar to what most entry-level options cost these days. This is also the lowest we have seen the laptop drop to in a while, and the deal is available to all shoppers, whether you’re a Prime member or not. Note that the retailer has listed the discount as a limited-time one, so it’s best to grab it fast. Deals such as this one tend to wrap up quickly, and we’re expecting Amazon to push the price back up any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6273/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ideal for Gamers and Creatives</h2>
<p>IdeaPads are sleek powerhouses. This one, in particular, comes with a full-sized keyboard with a dedicated numeric keypad; comfortable to type longer documents with ease. It’s not backlit, but the keyboard is paired with a bright display that lets you work in any lighting. The 15.3-inch WUXGA IPS screen delivers a brilliant 1920×1200 resolution to bring all your favorite content to life in vibrant detail. The 300 nits of brightness take care of the visibility, while the anti-glare coating makes sure the display is easy on the eyes, whether you’re using it in a dimly lit room or out there in the sun.</p>
<p>There’s also a 720p HD camera with a privacy shutter included, plus digital microphones for better video calls. Audio is taken care of by the built-in dual 2W speakers, meaning you won’t just enjoy stunning visuals, but enjoy better sound for whatever’s playing on the screen, too. Additionally, the battery life is impressive. You can expect it to last a full day for lighter tasks (browsing, streaming), while around 2-4 hours for heavier tasks. When running low, the Rapid Charge Boost gets the machine back up and running in no time. You’ll get an extra 2 hours of usage with just a quick 15-minute top-up.</p>



<p>As for the power, Slim 3 runs on the 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor, which smartly combines portability and durability, letting you be productive (plus game) on the go. The 24GB DDR5 SDRAM memory keeps things running smoothly, even during demanding days, which is especially great for multitaskers. You’ll be able to perform a bunch of tasks at the same time without slowing down, whether it’s using different apps simultaneously, gaming with friends, trying to hit deadlines in a short period of time, getting feedback on your creative tasks, using multiple windows side-by-side, and more.</p>
<p>The built-in 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD makes it just as easy to store all your important stuff in a single place. The laptop can house most of your important media files, work documents, creative projects, and programs without a problem. Of course, it’s not massive enough to store entire game libraries, but should be sufficient for casual use. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, plus a wide range of ports to connect peripherals.</p>
<p>All things considered, we recommend the laptop for casual gamers, creatives, work professionals, and even students. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6273/">It’s now down to just $700, which is quite affordable considering all the features you’re getting with this one.</a></p>

As for his future plans, Harada will share more at a later date.</p><p>Here is the full message from Harada on his departure:</p><blockquote><p>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.</p><p>With the <em>Tekken</em> series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese <a title="Platforms > Arcade [379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/arcade">arcades</a> and in small halls and community centers overseas.<br>I still remember carrying <a title="Genres > Arcade [99 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade</a> cabinets by myself, encouraging people to a “Please try <em>Tekken</em>,” and directly facing the players right in front of me.</p><p>The conversations and atmosphere we shared in those places became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator.</p><p>Even as the times changed, those experiences have remained at the center of my identity.</p><p>And even after the tournament scene grew much larger, many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for drinks at bars.</p><p>Those memories are also deeply precious to me.</p><p>In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect.</p><p>Those accumulated events made me reflect on the “time I have left as a creator.”</p><p>During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi—whom I respect as though he were another father—and received invaluable encouragement and guidance.</p><p>His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</p><p>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day.</p><p>Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects—VR titles (such as <em>Summer Lesson</em>), <em>Pokken Tournament</em>, the <em>Soulcalibur</em> series, and many others, both inside and outside the company.</p><p>Each project was full of new discoveries and learning, and every one of them became an irreplaceable experience for me.</p><p>To everyone who has supported me, to communities around the world, and to all the colleagues who have walked alongside me for so many years, I offer my deepest gratitude.</p><p>I’ll share more about my next steps at a later date.</p><p>Thank you very much for everything.</p><p><strong>Postscript</strong></p><p>Although I will be leaving the company at the end of 2025, Bandai Namco has asked me to appear at the [<em>Tekken</em>] World Tournament Finals at the end of January 2026, so I expect to attend as a guest.</p><p>For 30 years I kept saying, “I’ll do it someday,” and never once performed as a DJ at a tournament event.</p><p>So instead, I will be releasing—for the first and last time—a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60-minute <em>Tekken</em> DJ-style nonstop mix</a> (DJ mix), personally edited by myself, together with this announcement.</p><p>Listening to it brings back many memories.</p><p>Thank you again, sincerely, for all these years.</p></blockquote><p>Bandai Namco also <a href="https://twitter.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178" target="_blank">shared</a> the following message regarding Harada’s departure and the future of the&nbsp;<em>Tekken</em> series:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Regarding the Departure of Katsuhiro Harada</strong></p><p>Katsuhiro Harada, who has long led numerous projects including the <em>Tekken</em> series, will be leaving Bandai Namco. This comes as the <em>Tekken</em> series finishes celebrating its 30th anniversary, a milestone he deeply contributed to as executive director and executive producer on the franchise. Harada-san is making an appearance and meeting with the <em>Tekken</em> community at the “<em>Tekken</em> World Tour 2025 Global Finals” Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ) and Top 20 Finals, held in Malmo, Sweden, on January 31 and February 1, 2026.</p><p><strong>Regarding the Future of the <em>Tekken</em> Series</strong></p><p>To our fans, rest assured that we are fully committed to future development and content plans for <em><a title="Games > Tekken 8 [59 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a></em>. We will continue to take community feedback on the game and its content to heart to ensure that we uphold the vision and spirit built by Harada-san, dedicating our utmost efforts to ensure the legacy of the <em>Tekken</em> series continues as a fighting game franchise beloved worldwide.</p><p>We express our deepest gratitude to Harada-san for providing us with vision and continued success over the years.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/katsuhiro-harada-to-leave-bandai-namco-after-more-than-31-years]]></content:encoded>

                <p>There are well over 200 individual <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grow-a-garden/">Grow A Garden</a> seeds you can plant in your plot of land in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">Roblox game</a>. Each one has a different rarity and value, and depending on the type of plant, they can either be harvested once or will keep growing new fruits indefinitely after you sell the ones you pick. However, with such a high turnaround for events and their exclusive seeds, you may wonder if there is another way to get them.</p><p dir="ltr">Luckily, with recent changes to the game’s structure, there is now a way to get some older plants that were available during the Spring and Summer. Of course, once you get the high-value plants, you’ll want to have them grow, then expose them to as many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-weather-events/2900-7058/">Grow A Garden weather events</a> as possible to increase their value with multipliers added to them via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-grow-a-garden-mutations/1100-6534388/">Grow A Garden mutations</a>.

The catch is that there are varying odds on which plants will be available whenever the shop restocks, with the more common seeds restocking more often than those of higher rarity. As such, Transcendent rarity plants, such as Crimson Thorns, will seldom ever see a natural restock.</p><p dir="ltr">If you are following the directions in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-and-tips/1100-6535055/">Grow A Garden beginner’s guide</a>, you should try to get Mythical or higher rarity plants to start with, as they’ll give you a good return for your investment. Then it’s a case of getting as many multipliers as possible on them, which many of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-pets-tier-list/2900-7008/">best Grow A Garden pets</a> can help you with.</p><p dir="ltr">While the shop used to have tiered stocks dependent on the friendship level with the store owner, Sam, there is now a new Daily Deals tab in its place. This now stocks previously available plants from older updates, which you can buy for a limited time. While they don’t restock on their own, you can spend some Robux to automatically refresh these Daily Deals if you find a plant you want more of. The varieties will change constantly, but have so far included Cauliflower, Brussels Sprout, Green Apple, Avocado, Rafflesia, Banana, and Pineapple, among many others.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_Grow_A_Garden_seed_packs">How to get Grow A Garden seed packs</h3><p dir="ltr">Seed packs are another way to get rarer seeds, though which one is up to chance. When you open it, you’ll see a roulette wheel that eventually lands on the seed you’ll get from the pack. Rarer seeds tend to have lower odds.</p><p dir="ltr">You can reliably get some seed packs via the in-game achievements section. Head into the Guide and select the Achievements tab to look at the first segment and find out what you need to do to obtain these packs.</p><p dir="ltr">Another way you can obtain seed packs is to complete the Daily Quests found in the Season Pass tab, which will earn you XP towards progressing to the next level. Rewards include the Prime Seed pack, which you can also buy from the Pass Store tab for 100 Pass Coins whenever they’re in stock.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, there are exclusive seeds and seed packs tied to the current event. You can find out all about how each event works in the central hub area by speaking to the NPCs, and we also have all the info about both the current and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-grow-a-garden-update-and-events/1100-6534922/">next Grow A Garden event</a>. Sometimes they’re available in shops for Sheckles or in-theme currency (such as Candy Corn for the Halloween Market), while other times they’re drops in Chests. These work just like seed packs in almost every way, but can also include rare pets.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4600997-grow-a-garden-seeds-shop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600997" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4600997-grow-a-garden-seeds-shop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600997"></a><figcaption>The one place that will always have seeds is the Seed Shop, but it only replenishes some of its stock at any given time.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4600997-grow-a-garden-seeds-shop.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="All_Grow_A_Garden_seeds_you_can_buy">All Grow A Garden seeds you can buy</h2><p dir="ltr">To keep things simple, we will only update this list with the currently available Seeds in the shop at all times. Plenty more have been previously available as part of event shops, including one or two limited-time seeds, but these are tied to their subsequent events. We’ll also omit any Daily Deals seeds as the range changes constantly. It’s better to look for yourself which ones are on offer. Season Pass plants and craftables will be documented here as they’re available for a lot longer.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Seed Name</th><th scope="col">Seed

                <p>Which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grow-a-garden/">Grow A Garden</a> fruits are of the prickly type? Each one of the hundreds of available plants has a type associated with it. Blueberries are, well, berries, while the invaluable early-to–mid game Bamboo plants are classified as woody. One of the more uncommon types is the prickly plants, and that’s an issue if you’re trying to turn in plants for a limited-time reward.</p><p>Another thing you should be aware of is that fruits can have multiple types at once. For example, though the Rose is classified as a prickly fruit in this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">Roblox game</a>, it’s also both a flower and a leafy-type plant. Cultivating crops with multiple types can be beneficial in the long run when handling requests during upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-grow-a-garden-update-and-events/1100-6534922/" data-ref-id="1100-6534922">Grow A Garden updates</a>.

However, only a handful of them are obtainable right now. This is because many of these were available in exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grow-a-garden-seeds-packs/1100-6536143/" data-ref-id="1100-6536143">Grow a Garden seed packs</a> during events earlier in the game’s lifespan. Some have made comebacks via the Daily Deals shop, but many others have not at the time of writing.</p><p>That said, as mentioned in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-and-tips/1100-6535055/" data-ref-id="1100-6535055">Grow A Garden Beginner’s Guide</a>, there are valuable plants you can easily get from the regular seed shop, including two prickly plants that can be worth a lot during the early game. We recommend you try growing the crops with the highest Price-Floor Value so you can expose them to as many of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-weather-events/2900-7058/" data-ref-id="2900-7058">Grow A Garden weather</a> conditions as possible.

            <p>The Maw has once again eaten Edwin. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-next-fest-demo-excess-and-double-fines-sentient-lighthouse">After spending a few days in the news beast's digestive tract back in October</a>, Edwin did implement fresh safety protocols. No petting The Maw. Only feed The Maw using a standard issue six foot news pole. All teeth cleaning must be performed by a qualified animal dentist with a certificate in eldritch care. Sadly, the CCTV camera shows Edwin was fooled by The Maw's gurgles, which sounded suspiciously like 'Can I tell you a secret?'. Edwin proffered his ear, and the cost of his curiosity was to be swallowed whole. We believe he will climb out of the creature's gullet in time to cover The Game Awards on Thursday.</p>
<p>Don't worry, the proper traditions were observed. Mark played The Last Post on his kazoo, James wiped out the '56' on the 'Days since last accident' whiteboard in the coffee room, and wrote in a '0'. There was a respectful silence, only interrupted by the microwave ping when my porridge was done.</p>
<p>Things should be quietening down as we approach Christmas. That said, there are still some great games on the docket this week.</p>
<h2>Monday</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a> sees you trying to earn your freedom from the Underworld by skating all the way to the moon. The main issue is you're made of glass, any slips on the way are mighty deadly.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2988580/Yakuza_0_Directors_Cut/">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut</a> is the fleshed out and expanded version of the prequel to Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios infamous Yakuza series. First released on PC in 2018, this embiggened version includes a Red Light Raid multiplayer mode.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3597880/Cat_Named_Mojave/">Cat Named Mojave</a> is ideal for anyone who spent last week playing Horses and decided they need a touch more animal-headed, human-bodied horror in their lives.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3604260/Liminal_City/">Liminal City</a> is for people who played Horses and thought, I would like a nice horror game with no people in at all, please-and-thank-you. (Spider-like creatures that chase you through car parks are, however, in attendance.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/">Death Howl</a> is leaning hard into its deck-building, soulslike genre blending, even putting <a href="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2825880/extras/3133a8ee09c772e865609fe30bbd0a99.avif?t=1765188528">a chart on its Steam Page</a> detailing how it satisfies the criteria of both. Buzz words aside, it looks to be a stylish descent into a wasteland filled with eldritch horrors.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3582980/Milanos_Odd_Job_Collection/">Milano's Odd Job Collection</a> is the localised release of Milano no Arubaito, first released in Japan in 1999. If you ever wanted to recreate the experience of childhood labour exploitation, you can earn summer money as a 11-year-old Milano as she steps into the shoes of a fruit picker, nurse, and delivery driver.</li>
<li>Set in a world where music is outlawed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unbeatable">Unbeatable</a> is a rhythm action game where you put on illegal gigs and smash the state. We'll have a review later this week.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday</h2>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3350190/Anxiety_Puppy/">Anxiety Puppy</a> is a visual novel about dealing with the mounting daily anxieties of living in a city. I'm not sure about the developers' claim that this is a unique theme in gaming, but I'm all for people looking for ways to represent mental health.</p>
<h2>Thursday</h2>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/">Ashes of Creation</a> will be opening its MMO world up to early access players this week. The developers are stressing that it will be an alpha world and expect frequent, significant changes to its world. Still, with the ambition to create a world where you can trade, capture, or defend player-developed settlements, it could be a good game to explore in its early days.</p>
<h2>Friday</h2>
<p>In an appropriate disregard for canonical history, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1718460/Terminator_2D_NO_FATE/">Terminator 2D: No Fate</a> is a pixel-art game set in and around the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day which ignores the 8-bit movie tie-in game released on the NES and Master System in 1992. Still, 90s game never came to PC, so it may as well not exist – as much fun as riding a motorbike through the LA canals and shooting locks off chainlink gates may have been. The new game recreates scenes from the film and invents new events that took place in the margins of the action. It's basically the Terminator equivalent of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.</p>
<p>While this is a comparatively quiet week for releases. If you're a news glutton similar to our fine Maw, look forward to a veritable feast of stories from tomorrow's Wholesome Snack and Thursday night's Game Awards.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-4-are-now-cheaper-than-renewed-models-at-45-off-as-apple-continues-its-clearance-push-2000651052</link>
            <guid>1375948</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="157" data-end="888">Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but that doesn’t mean all the best discounts have disappeared with them. In fact, one of the strongest lingering deals right now is on the Apple AirPods 4. Even though these earbuds are just over a year old, they’re getting a surprisingly steep price cut—making this an ideal moment to grab a pair if you’ve been waiting for a sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">The ANC-enabled AirPods 4 launched at $179, but Amazon currently has them marked down 45%, bringing the price to just $99</a>. That’s a staggering $80 off the original cost. If you prefer add on AppleCare+, the version packed with Apple’s coverage is also discounted down to just $118 (down from $208).</p>
<p data-start="890" data-end="1292">AirPods have been a staple in Apple’s lineup for years, and each generation sees subtle but meaningful refinements. The newest AirPods 4 introduce a sleeker shape with a shorter stem and intuitive quick-press controls for managing your audio. Apple has put an emphasis on all-day comfort in this redesign, aiming to make them easier to wear for longer stretches—whether you’re commuting, working, or relaxing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1294" data-end="1311">Isolate Sound</h2>
<p data-start="1313" data-end="1686">One of the biggest upgrades comes from Apple’s H2 chip, which significantly improves call quality. The chip enables advanced voice isolation that filters out background noise, ensuring the person on the other end hears you clearly, even in loud or crowded environments. Instead of competing with chatter, engine noise, or street sounds, your voice remains front and center.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="1970">That same H2 chip enhances your listening experience as well. Apple’s updated acoustic architecture is designed to deliver richer audio, offering detailed highs and deeper bass for music, podcasts, and videos. The improvements make everyday listening feel more dynamic and polished.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="1970">With active noise cancellation, you can reduce unwanted background noise so you can focus solely on your entertainment or phone call. The H2 chip allows the AirPods 4 to blend together ANC and Transparency Mode. If you start speaking with someone nearby, the AirPods 4 can automatically adjust the volume of what’s playing so you can hold a conversation.</p>


<p data-start="1972" data-end="2365">Another enhancement is the new interaction capabilities with Siri—Apple’s voice assistant. The AirPods 4 can interpret simple head gestures like nodding yes or shaking your head noas responses to Siri’s questions. It’s a futuristic touch, though I’m not sure which is weirder. Someone sitting across from you seeing you blankly nodding and shaking your head, or deadpan whispering “yes” or “no” to seemingly nobody.</p>
<p data-start="2367" data-end="2703">One immediately noticeable change from the previous generation is the charging port. Apple has finally moved away from the proprietary Lightning connector. The AirPods 4 charging case now uses USB-C, aligning with the broader industry standard and making charging more convenient if you already have USB-C cables for your other devices.</p>
<p data-start="2705" data-end="2995" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">With Black Friday and Cyber Monday now behind us, it is a pleasant surprise to see a deal this strong still available—especially on a newer Apple product.</a> If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your earbuds, the ongoing discount on the AirPods 4 is worth taking advantage of while it lasts.</p>

<p>It's no secret that some of the greatest minds in Japanese game development like to get together to break bread (or knock back a beer or two), but this particular meeting is especially impressive.

<p>Just imagine the kinds of conversations these guys have while sipping back a few beverages! It's enough to make us extremely jealous. How we'd love to be a fly on the wall at these get togethers...</p>
<p>For Sakurai in particular, this will no doubt be one of few instances in which the creator has actually taken some time away from his busy schedule. In addition to creating Kirby Air Riders for the Switch 2, Sakurai also produced dozens of YouTube videos focused on the art of creating games.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mikami is hard at work at his new development studio Kamuy Inc., Ueda is working on the untitled 'Project Robot' game, and Suda51 is putting the finishing touches on the upcoming <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/romeo_is_a_dead_man">Romeo is a Dead Man</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fallout-creator-returns-work-full-time-at-obsidian-entertainment/</link>
            <guid>1375936</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Tim Cain, the veteran game designer known primarily as the original creator of Fallout, has returned to work at Obsidian Entertainment in a full-time capacity.</p>



<p>The announcement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCVWRZqyroA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came from his personal YouTube channel</a>, where Cain regularly posts videos about the games industry as a whole. The Fallout creator had gone into 'semi-retirement' in June 2020, after nine years as a full-time employee of Obsidian, during which he worked on South Park: The Stick of Truth, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pillars of Eternity</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tyranny-review-glory-overlord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyranny</a> as a programmer, and on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds</a> as its co-director alongside Leonard Boyarsky (whom he previously worked with on Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines). Cain also contributed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, which launched just two months ago, but only as a creative consultant.</p>



<p>Now, however, it seems like his early retirement is over, and he's also moved back to Southern California to work in-person at the studio:</p>



<p><em>I should point out that I'm back at Obsidian. I'm their full-time employee and in person, so not remote. I'm not a contractor anymore. This means that I'm not working in other places, although there's at least one game that I worked on that I know is going to ship. I don't know if it'll be next year or the year after, but a game's going to come out that's not an Obsidian game. They'll have my name in the credits because I did work for it for it. There are other games I worked on. I'm not sure they're going to ship. The 2020 to 2025 was a weird time in the industry and a lot of games got started and a lot of games got cancelled. So, I really don't know the status of all the games that I contracted on.</em></p>



<p><em>I also can't talk about the project I'm working on at Obsidian just because, you know, that's covered under NDA. Don't bother guessing. You're not going to guess right.</em></p>



<p>A recent rumor shared by former Obsidian founder Chris Avellone <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-2-but-not-the-outer-worlds-3-reportedly-in-the-making-at-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that the studio may not be planning to make a new The Outer Worlds entry, at least for now. That, coupled with the return of Cain, is more than enough to get Fallout: New Vegas fans hyped about the possibility of seeing him team up once more with Leonard Boyarsky (who also worked on the first two Fallout titles) on New Vegas 2 or another Fallout spin-off. However, Cain's tease that fans won't guess right appears to be a nudge that the project is actually a new IP.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, it's certainly great news that such an esteemed RPG designer, whose credits also include cult classics like Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura and The Temple of Elemental Evil (which is about to be re-released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3843520/The_Temple_of_Elemental_Evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, by the way), is back at work on new projects. Obsidian has the ambitious goal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-entertainment-wont-chase-huge-profits-or-grow-aggressively-plans-to-last-100-years-in-the-rpg-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continuing to make great RPGs for the next 100 years</a> without chasing big profits or turning into a massive studio, and Cain's presence will help keep them on the right course.</p>



<p>The team is also looking to satisfy people's hunger for deeper RPGs, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/players-want-deeper-rpgs-says-the-outer-worlds-2-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned a while ago by the director of The Outer Worlds 2</a>, and the return of the original Fallout creator will undoubtedly be a boon to that end.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Veteran game developer Katsuhiro Harada has announced his departure from Bandai Namco after working on the Tekken franchise for 30 years. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tekken-8-producer-provides-a-character-breakdown-for-fahkumram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tekken franchise</a> has long been one of the pillars of the fighting game genre, and Katsuhiro Harada has been at the heart of it. His goodbye marks the end of an era for the Tekken, but the Tekken 8 team has been quick to shut down any fan concerns regarding the departure of their studio director.</p>







<h2 id="h-katsuhiro-harada-leaves-bandai-namco-after-30-years">Katsuhiro Harada Leaves Bandai Namco After 30 Years</h2>



<p>Harada confirmed his departure in a statement shared online, explaining that the decision came after a period of personal and professional loss. He revealed that the “loss of several close friends” and watching senior colleagues retire or pass away pushed him to reflect deeply on “the time [he] has left as a creator.” After decades spent shaping the world, characters, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anna-williams-tekken-3-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legacy of Tekken</a>, he felt the moment was right to close this chapter.</p>



<p>His message also looked back on his early days at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-bandai-namco-partnership-billion-yen-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bandai Namco</a>, recalling humble beginnings at local Japanese arcade tournaments and tracing his journey through the studio’s growth and Tekken’s global rise. He thanked fans for their unwavering support and noted that he will share details about his future plans in due course.</p>







<p>You can read his full statement below.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.<br>With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.</p><p>My roots lie…</p></div>— Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In response to his announcement, the <a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tekken development team</a> issued their own statement, assuring players that Harada’s departure will not impact Tekken 8’s ongoing development or post-launch roadmap. They emphasised their commitment to continuing the series “with the vision and spirit built by Harada-san,” promising to keep community feedback at the core of their approach as Tekken moves into its next era.</p>

            <p>Remember that trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a> 4, which made the rounds last week? Well, I am sorry to say it was indeed unofficial after all, and Ys Net is now considering legal action against the uploader.</p>
<p>In a post on social media, Ys Net said last week's trailer - which clocked in at over four minutes - has "absolutely no connection" to the studio. Its logo was used "without permission", Ys Net said, "falsely giving the impression that it is an official Shenmue 4 related video produced by us".</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"We recognise that the unauthorised use of our logo, and any act that misleads viewers into believing such content is official, constitutes a serious issue that may amount to trademark infringement and unfair competition," Ys Net continued.</p>
<p>"We are currently working with relevant parties and preparing appropriate measures, including potential legal action".</p>
<p>While Ys Net does not actually own the Shenmue IP, with that honour belonging to Sega, the studio apologised to its community for the confusion last week's trailer may have caused. Let's be honest, it surely raised more than just a few hopes (I mean, last year fans of the series went so far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-fans-rent-times-square-billboard-campaigning-for-fourth-game">rent out a billboard in New York's Time Square to campaign for a fourth game</a>).</p>
<p>"We will continue to ensure the proper and accurate dissemination of information, and we ask for your understanding and cooperation," Ys Net's statement on the fake trailer closed.</p>
<p>As for the offending trailer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/real-or-ai-fake-suspicious-off-screen-shenmue-4-trailer-sparks-excited-debate">it followed Shenmue protagonist Ryo as he went about various around-the-town jobs</a>, such as washing dishes and arm wrestling. Many were sceptical about its legitimacy from the off, though, with the video coming from an unknown and unvalidated YouTube source with very few followers.</p><div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue-3">Shenmue 3</a> resurrected the RPG series in 2019, and our former editor Martin Robison was rather taken with it all. "A bewitching time capsule that transports us to late 80s China, and to turn-of-the-century video games," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-review-a-faithful-follow-up-to-an-all-time-classic">Eurogamer's Shenmue 3 review</a>.</p>

            <p>Long-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken</a> director, producer, and general advocate for the virtual graps Katsuhiro Harada has announced he's leaving Bandai Nanco at the close of 2025. Harada's opted to step away as the fighting series turns 30, though he does have one more guest appearance at the Tekken World Tour finals lined up early next year. He's also released an hour-long DJ mix on Soundcloud to commemorate the occasion, making up for the fact he never got around to DJing live at a Tekken tournament.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary - an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to - I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close," the developer announced on Twitter.</p>
<p>"In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect," he added "Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator'. During that period, I sought advice from [former Sony Computer Entertainment CEO] Ken Kutaragi — whom I respect as though he were another father — and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Harada added that he's spent the past five years or so gradually handing over all of his responsibilities, as well as custodianship of Tekken's stories and world, to the rest of Bandai's Tekken team.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco have <a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178">put out a statement</a> on behalf of Tekken 8's developers, thanking Harada and assuring players "that we are fully committed to future development and content plans for Tekken 8." "We will continue to take community feedback on the game and its content to heart to ensure that we uphold the vision and spirit built by Harada-san, dedicating our utmost efforts to ensure the legacy of the Tekken series continues as a fighting game franchise beloved worldwide," that statement continues.</p><p>Heading back to Harada's goodbye post, the veteran developer wrote that he'll share more info about his next steps "at a later date". For now, he left things off by sharing an hour-long DJ mix he's created and popped on Soundcloud. "For 30 years I kept saying, 'I’ll do it someday,' and never once performed as a DJ at a tournament event," the dev explained. "So instead, I will be releasing — for the first and last time — a 60-minute TEKKEN DJ-style nonstop mix (DJ mix), personally edited by myself, together with this announcement. Listening to it brings back many memories."</p>
<p>You can give the DJ mix, dubbed 'TEKKEN: A 30-Year Journey – Harada’s Final Mix' <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix">here</a>. I can confirm the first five minutes are very funky.</p>

<figure data-uuid="c8fd6d87e84de"><a title="Harada leaves Bandai Namco" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8fd6d87e84de/harada-leaves-bandai-namco.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN">Katsuhiro Harada</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Katsuhiro Harada, the executive producer and director of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/tekken_tag_tournament_2">Tekken</a> franchise — a man often referred to as a father of sorts to all things Tekken — has announced via social media that he'll be stepping down from his role at Bandai Namco, and therefore from involvement in the series, at the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The legendary director (and voice of Law and Yoshimitsu, not to mention a few others, on some of the earlier <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tekken_3d_prime_edition">Tekken</a> entries) says he's timing his departure to fit in with the 30th anniversary of this most beloved of fighting franchises.</p>

<p>Harada's post was also shared by <a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178">the official Tekken X account</a>, which added a few pertinent details, lest fans get a little concerned. The post states that the departure won't affect DLC plans or future updates/plans for Tekken 8 (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/tekken-8-on-switch-2-would-be-a-lot-of-work-but-director-isnt-ruling-it-out">when are we getting that on Switch 2, eh?</a>) and the franchise at large, whilst also wishing Harada well, and pointing out that he'll make an appearance at the Tekken World Tour 2025 finals in Sweden at the end of January.</p>
<p>In a lengthy and very personal message, Harada also described his roots and reasons for moving on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.</p>
With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.
<p>My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and in small halls and community centers overseas.<br>
I still remember carrying arcade cabinets by myself, encouraging people to “Please try TEKKEN,” and directly facing the players right in front of me.<br>
The conversations and atmosphere we shared in those places became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Even as the times changed, those experiences have remained at the center of my identity.<br>
And even after the tournament scene grew much larger, many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for drinks at bars.<br>
Those memories are also deeply precious to me.<br>
In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect.<br>
Those accumulated events made me reflect on the “time I have left as a creator.”<br>
During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi—whom I respect as though he were another father—and received invaluable encouragement and guidance.<br>
His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</p>
<p>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day.<br>
Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects—VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company.<br>
Each project was full of new discoveries and learning, and every one of them became an irreplaceable experience for me.<br>
To everyone who has supported me, to communities around the world, and to all the colleagues who have walked alongside me for so many years, I offer my deepest gratitude.<br>
I’ll share more about my next steps at a later date.<br>
Thank you very much for everything.</p></blockquote><blockquote>

Although I will be leaving the company at the end of 2025, Bandai Namco has asked me to appear at the TWT Finals at the end of January 2026, so I expect to attend as a guest.</p>
<p>For 30 years I kept saying, “I’ll do it someday,” and never once performed as a DJ at a tournament event.<br>
So instead, I will be releasing—for the first and last time—a 60-minute TEKKEN DJ-style nonstop mix (DJ mix), personally edited by myself, together with this announcement.<br>
Listening to it brings back many memories.<br>
Thank you again, sincerely, for all these years.</p>

<p>December 8, 2025 - The Final Day of TEKKEN’s 30th Anniversary -<br>
Katsuhiro Harada</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, Tekken. For gamers of a certain vintage, it kinda still feels like one of the new challengers on the fighting block - as do most things that came after the cultural shock and awe of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/super_street_fighter_2_turbo">Street Fighter 2</a>. Harada's series brought us some of the most memorable characters outside of Capcom's huge stable of fighters, too, and the likes of Law, King and Yoshimitsu brought with them a 3D, limbs-based pugilism that feels as dazzlingly deep today as it did down the arcades in 1994.</p>
<p>Of course, and as everyone worth their salt knows, the best Tekken game on Nintendo consoles is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/tekken_tag_tournament_2">Tekken Tag Tournament 2</a>, because...well, just look at it.</p>

<p>So long, Mr. Harada, all the best for the future and thanks for all the kickings!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I’m too old to have experienced SpongeBob SquarePants in its original cartoon form, but it’s impossible to be a denizen of the internet without being exposed to the endless memes and references to the iconic series. Even without that, there have been a whole host of games starring the lovable sponge over a multitude of different consoles. The best of these by far have been the 3D platformers following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/05/thq-nordic-annouce-spongebob-squarepants-battle-for-bikini-bottom-rehydrated/">Battle for Bikini Bottom</a>, with developers Purple Lamp continuing to produce high quality games that capture the madcap nature of the cartoon whilst also providing genuinely entertaining gameplay. SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of Tide&nbsp;sees an interesting new batch of mechanics and some real standout moments, but how does it match up to its predecessors?</p>
<p><iframe title="SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide | Titans of the Tide Karaoke" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/znxlF8Fjams?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The karaoke trailer for Titans of Tide needs to be watched to be believed, containing as it does the dream beach team of SpongeBob and the Mighty Hoff. Hasselhoff sings an adapted version of the earworm shanty, Wellerman, and even has a recurring cameo in the game as the voice of wisdom whose advice is unlocked by finding well hidden golden TVs. Such gods of the bay set the scene for the epic conflict that underpins the game, a conflict which sees King Neptune and The Flying Dutchman duking it out over an argument about who gets to cut the line at the Krusty Krab.</p>


<p>Aesthetically, Titans of Tide is very familiar, with the artstyle and many of the assets being brought forward from Purple Lamp’s previous games. This isn’t necessarily a negative, though, as they nailed the look of 3D Bikini Bottom in those earlier titles – you think they redraw everything from scratch for each episode of the cartoon? The soundtrack, similarly, is reminiscent of earlier games, but suits the action perfectly, and while the voice acting is authentic, it still suffers from the repetition of throwaway lines and can become annoying.</p>


<p>So, in many ways, Titans of Tide is more of the same in this series, following the mantra of ‘it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’. Where changes are made, however, is the main gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>During the initial scuffle that gives the game its name, Spongebob is hit by a bolt from The Flying Dutchman which kills him outright. Game over, man, right? Well, fortunately for the story, he continues as a green ghost flying around the scenery. We swiftly switch perspectives to play as Patrick who rushes to the Krab to see what has happened. Upon finding his ghostly pal, the two best friends discover that the power of their ring of friendship allows them to switch forms, with one being corporeal and one a ghost.</p>

<p>This swapping mechanic becomes the key gameplay tool as you work through the five sizeable worlds in your quest to set things right. Spongebob can karate kick obstacles and red balloons to reach new areas, whilst Patrick can dig under the surface and pick things up. Later in the game, Spongebob also receives a bubble wand that can activate switches and distant items. This relatively limited moveset is stretched out to create puzzles that force you to use each skill and often switch between each character in rapid succession. At its best, these navigation areas can make you feel like spongey ninja, but often they are very simple. This is a kid’s game after all.</p>
<p>Spread across the worlds of Bikini Bottom you’ll come across tiki statues containing coins, life restoring underpants, switches and targets that require specific skills to activate, and reality shifting jars that alternate between green and blue – with parts of the level appearing and disappearing to match. Small environmental puzzles or platforming challenges are rewarded with chests containing either parts of HP increases, filters for the ingame camera mode or costumes for the dynamic duo. While most of these are quite easy to spot there are plenty of deviously hidden ones for completionists to find.</p>

<p>In truth, getting your money’s worth out of the game will require you to take a completionist approach as there is only 6 or 7 hours worth of content here outside of replaying levels to find everything. The game might not be a £70 retail game, but the inevitable launch day DLC and Season Pass still feel pretty stingy. Finding the collectables unlocks Plankton challenges that offer standalone levels that feel heavily influenced by Mario Galaxy’s void levels. These are the most enjoyable parts of the whole game, so it’s a shame that they are hidden behind the repetition of seeking out every chest.</p>
<p>While the 3D platforming is solid throughout, I could have done without the frequent sliding sections that return from earlier games. These are harmless enough in themselves but the races attached to each were quite buggy pre-release. Some races involve a spectral surfboard but restarting often resulted in no board spawning at all. Other sliding sections see both characters using their tongues as sleds which is just horrific. Combine this with the paid DLC that makes the two leads naked and you have genuine nightmare fuel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Katsuhiro Harada has announced his departure from Bandai Namco having worked on the Tekken series for 30 years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 55-year-old Japanese video game developer legend, who worked on all the Tekken games right up until last year’s Tekken 8, said in <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement posted to social media</a> that the loss of close friends in his personal life and the retirement or death of senior colleagues had caused him to reflect on the time he has left as a creator. Advice from Ken Kutaragi — the "father of PlayStation" — supported Harada in making the decision, he said. Harada failed to reveal what he plans to do next, but he did not say he was retiring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Harada has had a somewhat frought relationship with the Tekken series and indeed Bandai Namco in recent years, and has spoken openly about the development difficulties he's endured while at the company. Most recently, Tekken 8 has caused a great deal of friction between players and the development team, and Harada has stepped in multiple times on social media to address fan concern.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/harada-1765184996704.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Tekken chief Katsuhiro Harada will leave Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Photo by SIA KAMBOU/AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most high-profile example of this came in October last year, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-chief-katsuhiro-harada-says-hes-going-to-rethink-his-role-following-dlc-stage-backlash">Harada addressed a row over the sale of a premium DLC stage for Tekken 8</a> after fans accused Bandai Namco of “corporate greed.” His explanation for the DLC stage basically came down to his role on Tekken within Bandai Namco, and his separation from the business side of the operation to focus on development. This structural set-up was a mistake, Harada admitted in a tweet he eventually deleted, and he confirmed plans to reorganize not only the Tekken business but his role within it to ensure community expectations were met in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's what Harada said, at the time:</p><blockquote>The Tekken project is divided into two companies: a game development studio and a publisher that is responsible for game sales (at the time of the development and release of Tekken 7, the development and publishing companies were not separate).</blockquote><blockquote>As some of you may know, I moved to the Development Studio side a few years ago, and have been focusing on maximizing the quality of the content/tech/graphics etc...</blockquote><blockquote>The development side and publishing side each have their own roles, and there are differences in the way they think and the responsibilities, I who should be the one to act as a bridge between the two, have not been able to properly participate in the publishing (sales) decision-making process for Tekken. As a result, I think that there were parts of the process that did not take the Tekken community's opinion into account.</blockquote><blockquote>I think I failed to create an organizational structure that would allow me to oversee things beyond my own position.</blockquote><blockquote>One of my roles was to listen to the opinions of the community and reflect them not only in the content but also in the out-game, but I was clearly becoming passive, worrying about the relationships between companies and not exercising my role.</blockquote><blockquote>From now on, I will review this structure and change it to one that values the community as it did in the past.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a typically frank statement from Harada, who was never shy to criticize his paymasters at Bandai Namco over their management of Tekken and the company’s various fighting game franchises. In June last year, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-chief-katsuhiro-harada-gets-remarkably-candid-discussing-why-soul-calibur-disappeared">Harada was remarkably candid in discussing why Soul Calibur disappeared</a>, and has spoken about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-boss-katsuhiro-harada-actually-tried-to-get-colonel-sanders-as-a-guest-character-but-kfc-turned-him-down">trying and failing to get KFC mascot Colonel Sanders in Tekken</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Harada's exit statement in full:</p><blockquote>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.</blockquote><blockquote>With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.</blockquote><blockquote>My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and in small halls and community centers overseas.</blockquote><blockquote>I still remember carrying arcade cabinets by myself, encouraging people to “Please try TEKKEN,” and directly facing the players right in front of me.</blockquote><blockquote>The conversations and atmosphere we shared in those places became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator.</blockquote><blockquote>Even as the times changed, those experiences have remained at the center of my identity.</blockquote><blockquote>And even after the tournament scene grew much larger, many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for drinks at bars.</blockquote><blockquote>Those memories are also deeply precious to me.</blockquote><blockquote>In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect.</blockquote><blockquote>Those accumulated events made me reflect on the “time I have left as a creator.”</blockquote><blockquote>During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi—whom I respect as though he were another father—and received invaluable encouragement and guidance.</blockquote><blockquote>His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</blockquote><blockquote>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day.</blockquote><blockquote>Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects—VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company.</blockquote><blockquote>Each project was full of new discoveries and learning, and every one of them became an irreplaceable experience for me.</blockquote><blockquote>To everyone who has supported me, to communities around the world, and to all the colleagues who have walked alongside me for so many years, I offer my deepest gratitude.</blockquote><blockquote>I’ll share more about my next steps at a later date.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you very much for everything.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Harada joined Namco (long before the acquisition that created the Bandai Namco we know today) in the early '90s to work on Tekken's arcade versions, which always launched first before console ports were released. He spent much of his time visiting Japanese arcades to check how Tekken was being played out in the wild, essentially living at the office.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Harada was a junior member of staff, but over the course of several years he worked his way up the chain to become the director of Tekken and the face of the franchise, attending community events while wearing his trademark sunglasses and making a fist — a reference to Tekken's tagline, 'The King of Iron Fist,' — for photo opps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">1998's Tekken 3, which is considered by many to be one of the greatest fighting games of all time, was the first Harada worked on as director and a smash hit, selling at least 8.36 million PlayStation copies worldwide. It became the PS1's fifth best-selling game ever ahead of the likes of Tomb Raider, Metal Gear Solid, and Resident Evil 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Harada's exit comes at a crossroads for Tekken. Tekken 8 sold 3 million copies a year from release, according to Bandai Namco, which said the game was selling at a faster pace than Tekken 7. But we haven't had a sales update since January, and Bandai Namco has yet to announce new DLC characters for a potential Season 3. Will Bandai Namco release a Tekken 9 any time soon?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by SIA KAMBOU/AFP via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s Xbox published horror game OD sure does sound odd.</p>
<p>As part of a new interview, the Death Stranding creator not only said he can't tell us "exactly" what OD actually is yet, he also doesn't even know "if it will work out" in the end.</p>

<p>"We've created stealth games and delivery games which were unlike anything before, but system-wise, they were similar to other games," the Kojima Productions head told <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/74735">ananweb</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideo-kojima-says-od-is-something-completely-different-from-a-standard-horror-game-we-still-dont-know-if-it-will-work-out/">Automaton</a>). As well as Death Stranding 1 and 2, the developer is also best known for the Metal Gear series.</p>
<p>But for the horror-flavoured OD, he continued, the studio is "trying to change the service model from the ground up", with Kojima adding "it should be quite challenging".</p>
<p>That all being said, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-and-xbox-team-up-to-show-off-more-od-knock">OD developer did say the recent trailer was "packed" full of hints</a>. "So if you keep thinking about it, you might figure it out", he closed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">OD was first announced back in 2023</a>, though Kojima stopped short of actually telling us all that much more about it at the time. Sophia Lillis and Hunter Schafer are both tied to the project, and there is also some involvement from director Jordan Peele, who is known for his films Get Out and Nope.</p><p>Otherwise, Kojima said it's "a game and at the same time a movie and at the same time a new form of media", so make of that what you will. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-marmite-hideo-kojima-says-you-will-either-love-or-hate-od">Kojima recently admitted he was sure plenty of people will hate OD</a>, but he is ok with that in the short term.</p>

<p>A Switch Lite, but comfy!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>What do you do when you're surfing the old interwebs and happen upon a bunch of lovely gaming folk wondering if anyone has ever stuffed a Switch — in fully working order — into a Wii U GamePad (also still in complete working order)?</p>
<p>Well, if it were us, we'd shut off our internet and go for a nice, long walk outside. Maybe we'd never come back. However, (and as reported by <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/55674-modder-crams-a-switch-into-a-wii-u-gamepad">GoNintendo</a>) retro gaming YouTuber and modder extraordinaire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KouzexMods">@KouzexMods</a> accepted it as a challenge and decided it was time to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>As you can see in the impressively detailed video up top, this was no half-hearted job either. Nope, this expert retro modder has gone all in, drawing up a list of rules to stick by and everything, and it's fascinating to watch along as a Switch Lite console is stripped right down, very carefully, whilst designs are drawn up for how to have every part of the Wii U GamePad still fully functional whilst making it useable and comfortable.</p>


<p>There are even some improvements made to the base Switch console's performance during the process here, with upgrades to its battery, screen and a few other things that you can check out in the vid. Honestly, it's worth watching the full thing to see just how much effort and ingenuity went in here, and how problems met along the way were circumvented.</p>
<p>The vid wraps up with what we have to say looks like a very polished hybrid console, and muscle memory tells us that — let's face it — it's probably way more comfortable to hold than a vanilla Switch Lite. Man, that GamePad was comfortable.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Like the modding job that's been done here? Fancy turning your GamePad (if you're one of the seventy or so people who owned one) into a Switch? Let us know! (But also, don't blame us when you break it)</em></p>

			<p>Eidos Montréal <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-might-have-canceled-legacy-of-kain-game-new-layoffs-reported/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently made headlines after suffering new layoffs</a>, and information from those who left the game developer revealed that the team had been working on a canceled game set in the Legacy of Kain franchise, among others. </p>



<p>However, renowned leaker Tom Henderson stated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM8RcRXnHX8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the latest episode of the Insider Gaming podcast</a> that these layoffs are not directly related to the cancellation of the Legacy of Kain game, which occurred around the same time <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the new Deus Ex project was canceled</a>.</p>



<p>The latest round of cuts, according to Henderson, is instead linked to other reasons. Chiefly, despite the many cancellations, Eidos Montréal still has a big game in development that's scheduled to launch next year, which is starting to ramp down as it heads toward the end of production, leading to layoffs.</p>



<p><em>They are working internally on quite a big project. I'm not going to mention the name of it, but basically, this big project is an open world action adventure third-person game which is being created by the same team that did <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-laras-coming-of-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, and it's been in development since 2019. It's gone through quite a lot of changes. That game has been in development for six years, and internally it's called P11. [...]</em></p>



<p><em>The layoffs are related to that project in particular because they are starting to ramp down the headcount now. Conceptualization and all of the systems and all that kind of stuff has been complete and they're gearing up for beta and that game is scheduled to release next year. So that's whittling down the headcount of that particular project.</em></p>



<p>If that's the case, we might be getting an announcement at The Game Awards in just a few days. That's just speculation on our part, though.</p>



<p>Other recent cuts at Eidos Montréal were seemingly related to another canceled project, a card game 'with a story spin' based on The Lord of the Rings. To give fans an idea of the number of projects that were discarded internally, according to Henderson, the developer has reached Project 22 while they still have to finish Project 11.</p>



<p>Their last project to launch was Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy in October 2021. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-what-kind-of-name-is-avengers-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a great game in its own right</a>, it did not sell particularly well. Hopefully, they can secure a win with this P11 title; it would be a shame if another game ended up like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monolith Productions</a>.</p>

            <p>Open your mouth, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>. Ah, it's as I suspected, you've eaten the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a>! Don't worry, I don't blame you. You were only hungry, and the modders controlling your great maw were keen to see how Melinoë would cope with taking on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> run through the underworld which Zagreus blazes through in the first game.</p>

<p>Fittingly, then, the mod (spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/theres-a-mod-that-lets-you-play-hades-1-in-hades-2/">Poseidon Chronos Gamer</a>) which adds that underworld run path to Hades 2 is called Zagreus Journey. With it installed, Melinoë'll be able to head through a chaos manhole out of the crossroads located between the two doors leading to her usual paths. Jumping into this new exit sees the princess of the underworld emerge in Tartarus, then fight through Asphodel, Elysium and the Temple of Styx, battling all the same enemies Zag once did. Naturally, though, this time you'll be slapping them up with Mel's abilities and Hades 2's selection of boons.</p>
<p>Zagreus doesn't feature in combat, but he does pop in to handle all of the dialogue, delivering lines from the first game while Melinoë stands silently by his side. Get all the way to the end, and you'll get to see how the talents Mel's honed battling the time bloke and those besieging Olympus stack up against her dear old dad, Hades.</p><p>The modder behind this splicing of two mythical smitings, Nikkel Mollenhauer, writes in its description that they do have plans to add in some new story beats and dialogue between Melinoë and other Hades 2 characters about the new route at some point down the line. That'll serve as a fresh epilogue of sorts, since the modder reccomends you wait until you've seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-post-launch-patch-1-revamps-melinoes-true-ending-and-is-out-now-in-steam-preview-form">the game's true ending</a> before taking the underworld plunge. Fresh incantations that'll enable meta-progression on the new route, erebus gates, and extra boons are also on their future to-do list, as well as getting the original Hades' secret boss fight up and running.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving their work a go, you can grab it from <a href="https://github.com/NikkelM/Hades-II-HadesBiomes?tab=readme-ov-file">Github</a> or <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/NikkelM/Zagreus_Journey/">Thunderstore</a>. You'll need to zap all of your other current Hades 2 mods to get it working, as well as make sure you've got both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-10-review">Hades 2</a> and the original Hades installed in a place the mod can find them.</p>
