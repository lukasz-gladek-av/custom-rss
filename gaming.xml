It’s a remake done right, and its new features and mechanics only serve to enhance the fundamental experience. One of these very welcomed additions is the Monster Wrangler, an extremely strong vocation that wasn’t available in the original game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,195719,196572" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-remake-review-hd-2d-changes-quality-of-l-1851700918&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-remake-review-hd-2d-changes-quality-of-l-1851700918"><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> Is A Gorgeous Remake That Stays Stubbornly Faithful To An RPG Classic</a></span><br><strong>Order Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fdragon-quest-iii-hd2d-remake%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fdragon-quest-iii-hd2d-remake%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/b5tna58zaaqyu&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/b5tna58zaaqyu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Buy</a></span></p><p>But what exactly is the Monster Wrangler, and is it worth adding one to your lineup?</p><h2 id="h96113"><a id=""></a>How Does The Monster Wrangler Work?</h2><p>The Monster Wrangler is a vocation that allows you to tame monsters and use their abilities in battle. Unlike most vocations, this one requires you to invest time outside of battle to find monsters and earn their abilities for yourself, so it’s not recommended for anyone seeking a straightforward, no-frills party setup.</p><p>As you continue to level up, you’ll eventually earn an ability known as “Animal Instinct”, which lets you know when there are monsters nearby that you can tame. However, recruiting them won’t always be easy, as you’ll sometimes need to meet certain requirements or use special items to ease them into befriending you. It’s worth the effort, though, as filling out your abilities list is the only meaningful way to advance this class.</p><h2 id="h96114"><a id=""></a>Is The Monster Wrangler Any good?</h2><figure id="" data-id="936be02ad1311881791d4335acb16fa2" data-recommend-id="image://936be02ad1311881791d4335acb16fa2" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters choose vocations in a fantasy inn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters choose vocations in a fantasy inn." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="936be02ad1311881791d4335acb16fa2" data-recommend-id="image://936be02ad1311881791d4335acb16fa2" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters choose vocations in a fantasy inn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Monster Wrangler is certainly one of <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>’s most unique vocations, but is it actually worth using over other options? </p><p>The short answer is, well, <strong>yes</strong>!</p><p>The Monster Wrangler begins the game feeling slightly underpowered compared to more traditional vocations because it doesn’t have many offensive options at its disposal at first. But it eventually becomes a powerhouse as players advance through the campaign adding more and more monster abilities to their arsenal. </p><p>This vocation is especially useful for late-game grinding, such as facing off against Metal Slimes, as you can use its Call of the Wild/Monster Pile-On ability to call in your animal companions for multi-hit damage against random enemies (or just an onslaught of attacks against a single foe). Additionally, it can use whips and boomerangs, which are both excellent weapons for hitting multiple enemies at one time.</p><p>Ultimately, whether the Monster Wrangler is right for you will depend entirely on what type of party you’re trying to build. But most groups are likely to benefit from this vocation’s various high-damage abilities and support potential, so don’t shy away from it just because it’s a bit slow to get going!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Blizzard is holding another PTR (Public Test Realm) for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>, testing some of the new features and content that will be arriving in Season 7 next year. Here's everything Diablo 4 players on PC will be able to preview during the 2.1 update test period, which will run December 3-10.</p><p>One of the major new features previewed in the 2.1 PTR is the Armory, a new feature that will allow players to swap between different builds easily. The Armory lets you save, load, and name your favorite character builds, with five different built slots allotted per character. Loadouts will save a character's equipped items, Paragon Board and Glyphs, skill selections, and class mechanic. Switching between them will display the relevant details at a glance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4403903-gm3881bh7qmz1732059279370.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403903" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4403903-gm3881bh7qmz1732059279370.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403903"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4403903-gm3881bh7qmz1732059279370.jpg"></figure><p>2.1 will also let players master Witchcraft, with three new schools of Hawezar sorcery to learn. These include Eldritch, which focuses on destructive energies and polymorphy; Psyche, a defensive magic based on mind and spirit; and Growth &amp; Decay, a type of magic based on the dichotomy of healing and harming.</p><p>Players will have to complete seasonal tasks to learn Witchcraft, completing new Whisper bounties and defeating the new Headrotten enemies to earn Restless Rot. This new seasonal currency can be exchanged at a Coven's Altar at the Tree of Whispers to unlock and upgrade new Witchcraft powers. The full list of available powers, at least for the PTR version of Witchcraft, can be found below.</p><p>As part of the seasonal content, players will be tasked with hunting the new Headrotten enemy, which can be found in Headhunt subzones and Roothold micro-dungeons. Headrotten also have a few unique boss variants, including the Headless Husk and Fugitive Head. The latter harbors a parasitic Stolen Head, which can be collected upon its defeat and returned to Gelena in exchange for Occult Gems.</p><p>Another new feature, Occult Gems can be placed into items with available sockets to add unique effects and upgrades that complement the new Witchcraft powers. Gelena will also craft Occult Gems in exchange for Restless Rot, Gem Fragments, and Fugitive Heads. The full list of Occult Gems and their effects can be found below.</p><p>The PTR test will also include a number of new Runes, Legendary Aspects, and Unique Items, all of which are detailed below.</p><p>In order to test out the update between December 3-10, players can download the PTR through the Battle.net app, by selecting the Public Test Realm option from the selector above the Play button. Players can copy in a character from their main account from the PTR's character select screen, and can use the PTR boost NPC in Kyovashad to make sure they're properly specced for the new content.</p><p>Check out all the new powers, upgrades, and items coming to the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24162193/the-2-1-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2.1 PTR test</a>:</p><h2>Witchcraft Powers</h2><h3>Eldritch Powers</h3><p>Firebat Servants</p><ul><li>A deadly swarm of Firebats swarm enemies every 2 seconds, inflicting X total Fire damage over 1 total attack.</li><li>At Higher Ranks: Enemies are Stunned for 3 seconds after being hit 5 times by your Firebat Servants.</li></ul><p>Abyssal Resonance</p><ul><li>Every 250 Resource spent, release an explosion dealing X Shadow damage.

To mark the occasion, Ubisoft has dropped a launch trailer that explains how Kay Vess and her friends get drawn into an adventure alongside the legendary Lando Calrissian. But it looks like they'll be on opposite sides at the start.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc7FhNxCk8c" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oc7FhNxCk8c" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>An outlaw's reputation means everything in the underworld, which is how the Empire is able to successfully blackmail Kay into working for them on this mission. If she refuses, the Empire will simply let it be known that Kay is one of their operatives and the various syndicates will mark her for death. To keep the Empire off of her back, Kay also has to win a high-stakes Sabacc tournament against some of the game's best players--who may also be flagrant cheaters like Lando.</p><p>Naturally, this arrangement is destined to go sideways as Lando and Kay escape on her ship. From there, we're not sure where the story is going, but it's an encouraging way to tease the DLC. Ubisoft has also dropped a massive update for the game that--among other things--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-is-dropping-forced-stealth-so-you-can-start-blasting-your-way-out-of-trouble/1100-6527925/" data-ref-id="1100-6527925">does away with forced stealth missions</a>. From now on, Kay can shoot her way out of some tight spots without failing her mission. Most of the major gameplay changes are laid out in the new video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-X1YI7WIxM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2-X1YI7WIxM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ubisoft has put a lot of post-launch work into Outlaws because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">its initial sales were very disappointing</a> and players had a lot of complaints about certain aspects of the game.

Its legions of beloved fans stick around even though its core gameplay hasn't changed much since 2004 (though it has been repeatedly overhauled and improved). Players pick a race, class, and gender, then set out into the world to complete quests, raid dungeons, and fight other players using unique spells and abilities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What once pressed against the technical limits of online play is now quaint in an age of battle royales and co-op basebuilding games. And yet, it persists. And not merely persists—millions of players still log in regularly to raid dungeons, bringing in extraordinary cash for the studio and its new parent company Microsoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This Saturday, the venerated MMORPG officially turns 20. At Gamescom 2024, we asked production director Michael Bybee and game producer George Velev about the game's long-lasting appeal—and what its current stewards are doing to make sure it never goes away.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="World of Warcraft "><span>World of Warcraft </span>players want a reason to log in every day</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team at Blizzard is fully aware it doesn't take much to drag someone away from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "We're ultimately competing for everyone's attention and we compete with everything, including things like Netflix," Bybee said. "If we're not giving you something interesting or engaging to do, [players] are gonna go somewhere else."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/avowed-director-carrie-patel-explains-how-obsidian-pushes-boundaries-in-the-fantasy-genre" target="_self">Avowed director Carrie Patel explains how Obsidian pushes boundaries in the fantasy genre</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That was a problem Blizzard ran into with the expansion </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadowlands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which released to positive reviews but soon saw a drop-off in players. (It didn't help that the critically acclaimed MMORPG </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy XIV</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a dark horse competitor to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was enjoying great word-of-mouth marketing).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beginning with the next expansion </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragonflight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Blizzard began releasing content at what Bybee referred to as a "faster pace." Around this time, the company began </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/blizzard-may-be-ready-to-annualize-i-world-of-warcraft-s-i-expansions">shifting its production structure</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to support two expansion teams and one "live service" team. The company had always worked several expansions ahead, but the hope now was that Blizzard could plan expansions in a way that let them tease players about future content sooner and adjust that content based on player reception.</span></p><p>Image via Blizzard Entertainment/Microsoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Enter this year's expansion, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The War Within</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In it, Blizzard introduced a new idea for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which is the idea of a story arc that will play out over multiple annual releases. The first one is called "The Worldsoul Saga," and its announcement came with the names of the next two expansions: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Midnight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last Titan</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "Our goal was to make sure that players always felt like there was something right around the corner," said Bybee. Creating expansions that end with a metaphorical "next time on World of Warcraft..." definitely tees up the game's future direction more than the climactic finales of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadowlands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Legion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/with-disney-tron-catalyst-bithell-games-gets-to-make-a-game-about-games" target="_self">With Disney TRON: Catalyst, Bithell Games gets to make a game about games</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But altering the structure of expansions wasn't Blizzard's only pivot point.

These expansions catered to players who wanted to run said encounters again and again—but Blizzard started getting the message this wasn't appealing to all of its subscribers. Raids are still a high priority for Blizzard, but players will now have endgame options that don't demand they and their friends all be available at the exact same time.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/cairn-s-manual-climbing-system-is-like-a-vertical-death-stranding-" target="_self">Cairn's manual climbing system is like a 'vertical Death Stranding'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Delves also allow casual players to see story narrative cinematics that used only appear after completing high-difficulty dungeons—a boon for the broader </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> playerbase.

But Bybee said it's the game's status as a social hub that's made these encounters stand the test of time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Velev pointed out that there are player-led challenges like the "world first" competition, where groups assemble to be the first (or second, or third) to defeat a new dungeon on their server.

            <p>Snufkin: Melody of the Moominvalley is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows and to celebrate, Raw Fury has revealed DLC is on the way.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley">Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley</a>'s Fuddler’s Courtship DLC sees players embark on a "brand-new pocket-sized adventure filled with wonderful encounters set amongst the striking watercolour visuals of autumn".</p>

<p>"In this heartfelt novella-like story of romance, newfound friend Fuddler needs a helping hand to express his feelings, and players join Snufkin and his best friend, Moomintroll, on a camping trip deep into the wilds before winter sets in," Raw Fury explains. "What should have been a relaxing excursion for two, turns into a chaotic and romantic journey, with many new and old friends."</p><p>As yet, there's no firm date on when we can expect Snufkin: Melody of the Moominvalley to hit these consoles (it's already out on Switch and Steam), but Raw Fury said it'll let people know "soon". Don't forget that standard physical editions are also now available, with a deluxe edition launching on 20th December.</p>
<p>"You can't throw a rock in Brighton without hitting a moomin. There are boutiques and galleries devoted to them," Chris Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley-review">Eurogamer's Snufkin: Melody of the Moominvalley review</a>, in which he awarded the "lovely" game four stars out of five.</p>
<p>"They're on our teacups and our beach towels. They're on plant pots by our windows and on the rough-papered covers of fancy Tove Jansson reprints stocking our libraries. It's not surprising that they've made it to video games, but it is surprising - to a moomin outsider, at least - to discover that the sort of thing that middle-class Southern idiots like me lap up so readily has a little bite to it. Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley, a musical stealthy exploration game, is the best kind of surprise."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"With an unreliable narrator at the helm of the story, not all is what it seems," the team teases. "Players will experience gameplay effects enabled to this over-the-top framing, such as receiving extraordinary abilities (i.e. superhumanly punching someone’s head off) and undergoing extreme situations not seen in the base game."</p>
<p>Support Group is out today, 22nd November. The game is currently available on PC via Steam, GOG, and itch.io, and will be available on iOS in January 2025.</p>
<p>"Despite a schlocky – and shocking – presentation, this action-shooter is exactly what I needed it to be, which is a delightfully bombastic experience that neither outstays its welcome nor feels unjustly punishing," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-am-your-beast-review">Eurogamer's I Am Your Beast review</a> earlier this year, slapping it with a healthy four out of five stars.</p>
<p>"Stapled to a blisteringly powerful soundtrack, this is a trim, frenetic, thoughtful shooter that stayed with me far longer than its truncated playtime."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-sales-one-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher GSC Game World has announced that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>sales have already crossed a big milestone, and the game has only been on release for two days.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455843903878201787" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam announcement</a>, a million copies of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>have been sold since the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-delayed-once-again-november" rel="nofollow">launched on Wednesday</a>, a feat for which GSC Game World thanks the players who've already bought&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>.</p>

<p>The game's sales achievement is even more impressive when considering that it was a day-one Xbox Game Pass release as well, which means that a million players have bought&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>in addition to those who've checked it out as part of Microsoft's subscription service.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-sales-radar.jpg?itok=sMtIWCLl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-sales-radar.jpg?itok=Q1J2zd4F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is off to a very strong start sales-wise.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s sales performance has been strong, the game hasn't been without its issues. Its Steam reviews are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">broadly positive at time of writing</a>, but even many of those who recommend the game acknowledge that it's got more than its fair share of bugs (or "anomalies", if you will).</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1859265478276894856" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday</a>, GSC Game World acknowledged that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has some "rough edges", but that hotfixes to correct some of the game's most egregious bugs are on the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following those fixes, the development team has pledged to release larger updates that will include extra content for&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, with a roadmap for the game on its way in December.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the second mainline entry in GSC Game World's&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>series, which combines open-world RPG-inflected gameplay with a non-linear, hands-off approach to exploration and combat.</p>

<p>The game has had a long and troubled development history; it was first revealed in 2010 before numerous delays and studio troubles saw the game shelved for a number of years.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>was then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-release-date-announced" rel="nofollow">reintroduced at E3 2021</a>&nbsp;with an intended April 2022 release date, although that was naturally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/post-apocalyptic-shooter-stalker-2-delayed-until-december" rel="nofollow">pushed back</a> several times. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in early 2022 also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-developer-reportedly-leaving-ukraine" rel="nofollow">significantly impacted development</a> for GSC Game World, which is based in the besieged country.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also available as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/all-confirmed-xbox-game-pass-november-2024-games" rel="nofollow">November's Xbox Game Pass lineup</a>.

            <p>The mutant enemies in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> are very hungry. Hungry not only for your flesh, but also all the bullets in your AK-47. It can take entire clips of ammo to take down some of these tough beasts, and you get nothing back for killing this wildlife except the hollow satisfaction of pest control. Alongside the bugs and performance issues, it's a common enough complaint to players of the first-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> shooter that it's already been addressed by a modder, who has created a tweak to lower the health of various dogs, boars, and bloodsuckers. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The simply named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/41">Lower Mutant Health</a> mod by NexusMods user "Fredrik" will cut each enemies health by either 25% or 50%, depending on your preference. "I found that the mutants and creatures of the zone were borderline annoying," said the modder, who felt strongly enough about it that they reduced the health, even though there are some creatures they haven't encountered yet. "I haven't seen them yet and can as such not judge whether or not their health is unreasonable."</p>
<p>It's not the only mod that has cropped up. It's only been a few days since the game's release but already we have a mod that will <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/77">reduce the painfully high repair costs</a> of your guns and armour, another that lets you <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/48">sprint for longer</a> without getting tired, and even one that introduces <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/10">slow motion "bullet time"</a> to the game. </p>

<p>It's worth noting that the radioactive sequel, for all its foibles, is meant to be a harsh and tough misadventure that forces you to make firm decisions. It's one of the many things James liked about it in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">his review</a>. For example, you need to decide what items you can afford to carry and what you must leave by the roadside to avoid becoming encumbered. But if you're happy to ignore the design intentions of the game, you can always install this mod that allows for <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/78">infinite carrying capacity and non-decaying weapons</a>. Fair warning, this will pretty much nullify a core pleasure of the game. Here's how James described the game's approach to difficulty:</p>
<blockquote>I’ve been battered and sometimes frustrated by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, but ultimately there is something admirable about its commitment to challenging you – especially when it simultaneously provides just enough tools to avoid becoming unfair. Between that, its punchy shooting, and some properly superb atmosphere-building, it’s done enough to earn the mantle of Good Game.</blockquote>
<p>One thing I do like, though, is this mod that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/52">reduces the stamina cost of jumping and knife attacks</a>. Because, god, the platforming puzzles are already shonky enough without having to take a breath between every leap. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Farewell to Penacony with Sunday and Fugue.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.7 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “A New Venture on the Eighth Dawn,” will launch on December 4, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [178 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-929490"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update brings the final chapter before the Express sets its course for the mysterious realm of Amphoreus, the Eternal Land. With the journey in Penacony coming to a close, a new story is set to unfold, featuring the debut of two new playable characters, Sunday and Fugue. In addition to these characters and storylines, Version 2.7 also offers Trailblazers a range of immersive experiences to enjoy.</p><p>In the previous story arc, Black Swan suggested that the Crew venture to Amphoreus, a realm so enigmatic that even the Aeon of Trailblaze, Akivili, could not reach. Curious yet cautious, Navigator Miss Himeko decides to gather intel on this destination. Meanwhile, the Crew makes a final stop in Penacony, reuniting with old friends and creating lasting memories before embarking on their next journey.</p><p>The memories of that ‘performance’ at the Penacony Grand Theater are as vivid as if they happened yesterday. It’s not just the Astral Express or Penacony that’s awakened from its dream—Sunday has, too. Having stepped down as head of the Oak Family, he has chosen to “descend to the mortal realm and see what this world is truly like.” Casting aside blessings from both Harmony and Order, Sunday sets out to pursue his vision of a utopia as a mere mortal. With the help of a secret Pepeshi named Wonweek, he returns to Penacony with one wish—to give a final, unforgettable performance before beginning his new journey. His robe and hood provide a fresh appearance and conceal his identity for his last dance in the “Planet of Festivities.”</p><p>While in combat, as a 5-star Imaginary character, Sunday has unique support skills. His Skill allows teammates to immediately take action while increasing their DMG dealt. If the teammate has a summon, both can immediately take action, and the DMG Boost effect is even more evident. Using Sunday’s Ultimate can regenerate Energy for one teammate, as well as causing the character and their summon to be blessed with “The Beatified.” A halo will appear on “The Beatified” teammate, boosting their CRIT DMG.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Another character soon to arrive is Fugue, who Trailblazers know as their old friend—Tingyun. Once a tactful foxian girl, she now finds her name, appearance, and even identity stolen. Fate, however, has left her a slender thread of hope, though the mark of Destruction still stirs restlessly within her. Tingyun barely escaped death after her clash with Phantylia during version 1.2’s main storyline and was saved only by the intervention of Madam Ruan Mei from the Genius Society, who granted her a second chance at life. Recently, Himeko and Welt visited Madam Ruan Mei and took it upon themselves to bring Miss Tingyun home, renewing her journey back to the familiar.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_929491"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Fugue is a 5-star Fire character with an affinity with support one teammate in reducing enemies’ Toughness regardless of Weakness Type. When Fugue is in combat, enemy targets will be inflicted with the “Cloudflame Luster” effect. When “Cloudflame Luster” is reduced to 0, the target will take Weakness Break DMG again. Furthermore, when teammates attack Weakness Broken enemy targets, they will also deal Super Break DMG. Not only that, through her Skill, Fugue can increase ally characters’ Break Effects. When she uses her Ultimate, she deals Fire DMG to all enemies regardless of Weakness Type and directly reduces all enemies’ Toughness.</p><p>Additionally, the limited 5-star characters, General Jing Yuan and Firefly will have their return in the first and second halves of the Version 2.7 warp event, respectively. Their formidable assistance make them invaluable allies for your future journeys.</p><p>Beyond new characters and storylines, Version 2.7 introduces an immersive experience aboard the Astral Express’s new Party Car, blending elegance with a sense of nostalgia. Here, a spacious reception area with a sleek marble bar and a classic bartending robot awaits. With the Cosmos as their backdrop, players can enjoy a drink with the Express Crew or quietly reflect by the window, letting the view inspire their thoughts.</p><p>Ascending the stairs, players will find the Trailblazer’s personal quarters. In the “Cosmic Home Décor Guide” event, they’ll transform an empty storage room into a cozy haven, adding areas like a bedroom and bathroom. Using Express Funds earned from tasks, Trailblazers gather furniture piece by piece, crafting a space that reflects their journey through the stars.</p><p>Looking ahead, as the game prepares for Version 3.0, it will introduce the Path of Remembrance, featuring characters with unique summons known as memosprites. Each memosprite will offer distinct abilities in battle, joining allies on this Path and enhancing strategic depth in every encounter.</p><p>The Relic system will be updated in Version 3.0, allowing players to select both a Relic’s Main Stat and Subsidiary Stats during synthesis with specialized tools. By using a certain amount of the new item, Wishful Resin, along with Self-Modeling Resin, players can set both the Main and Sub Stats of a Relic simultaneously.</p><p>Lastly, while sorting through the Trailblazer’s storage boxes, Pom-Pom discovered something special. From the Version 2.7 update through to the end of Version 3.2, Trailblazers will be able to claim the “Gift of the Express,” which grants the opportunity to select one regular 5-star character of their choice.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,414 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [21,770 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

			<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director recently apologized for the difficult Platinum Trophy of the game, vowing to never make another so difficult in the future.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-34152657">Daily Star</a>, director Naoki Hamaguchi discussed the difficult Platinum Trophy, which requires multiple playthroughs of the game and completing mini-games at hard difficulty. He apologized for how difficult it is to unlock and assured that he would never make one so difficult to obtain again, so trophy hunters should have far fewer problems mastering the third and final part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake project.</p>
<p>To Daily Star, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi also <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-wont-34152228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> how the game won't be getting any DLC to have the sequel out as soon as possible and how the third entry in the series is likely to shake up the formula of the second game in the Remake trilogy, as he wants to add a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-director-wants-to-add-a-different-twist-for-a-new-and-exciting-experience/">different twist for a new and exciting experience</a>. This new experience will likely involve the Highwind airship, as the team is fully committed to delivering a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">freely explorable map using the airship.</a></p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PlayStation 5, and it is played best on <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> until the game finally hits PC on a yet-to-be-confirmed date. You can learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <p>BioWare has released a rather hefty patch for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which among a myriad of bug fixes, also adds some quality of life changes. </p>
<p>This includes more filters to its photo mode and new weapon icons. Players will now also be able to bind arrow keys to input mappings, thanks to this recent patch, while screenshot file names from photo mode are now "simplified".</p>
<p>As for those rings, new ones can now be compared against both equipped ring slots. Previously when you picked up a new ring to put on your finger, it would only compare the stats against one of the rings you had equipped. </p>

<p>On the bug side of this Dragon Age: The Veilguard patch, BioWare has implemented over 40 fixes. These cover crashes (BioWare has "eliminated" the causes for some of them - hurrah!), and some odd facial expressions from Rook's first meeting with Emmrich.</p>
<p>Also, companions should no longer get stuck on balance beams now, which I am sure they will be pleased about.</p>

<p>On its release, we awarded Dragon Age: The Veilguard a shiny five out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it. The answer is yes, emphatically. The Veilguard is spectacular.

<p>The game launched to "solid" sales here in the UK, though has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-sales-solid-in-uk-softer-across-rest-of-europe-report">numbers "nearly 21 percent lower" than Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth across Europe</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, GSC Game World <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1859930792564285907" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>via social media that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has already sold one million copies, and 'many more' have joined the Zone via Game Pass. It's not entirely unsurprising given the massive amount of hype (and Steam wishlists) the game had garnered over the years.</p>
<p>It's probably not nearly enough to recoup the development costs, though. GSC Game World told me during <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gamescom-qa-gsc-game-world-talks-about-the-final-rush-to-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Gamescom 2024 chat</a> that the studio was massive, with over 430 employees working on STALKER 2. The social media blast also claimed this was only the beginning, and indeed, on launch day, GSC Game World wrote an open letter to fans acknowledging the game's rough edges outlined in reviews.</p>
<p><em>There are so many things in the game that we are incredibly proud of. Nevertheless, STALKER 2 is a massive game. We understand that in such a game, there may still be rough edges: we literally haven't released anything of this scale before. We're absolutely committed to being here, monitoring your feedback, and quickly fixing any issues that need our attention. In the first days after release, we'll be working with hotfixes, rolling them out as precisely as possible, but as frequently as we can. Then, we'll switch to larger updates that include constant improvements. There will also be free in-game content — we'll share its roadmap later in December. We have big plans for the STALKER universe. In a way, today is both a return and the beginning of a grand new journey.</em></p>
<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> that features like hardware ray tracing, mod tools to make cross-platform mods and even multiplayer modes will be released after launch. The Ultimate Edition of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl also includes access to the Season Pass, which is already guaranteed to add at least two expansions to the game at some point in the future.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[STALKER 2 Has Sold 1 Million Copies, With ‘Much More’ Players on Game Pass]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-1-million-copies/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-has-sold-1-million-copies-with-%E2%80%98much-more%E2%80%99-players-on-game-pass.1042743/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-1-million-copies/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>GSC Game World has just revealed that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has sold one million copies since being released on November 20. In a post on social media, the team also revealed that ‘much more Stalkers’ played the game through the Game Pass subscription service.</p>



<p>STALKER 2 is a relatively divisive game that’s proving to be either a hit or miss for players worldwide. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my recent review for STALKER 2</a> branded it a major success that’s well worth your time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-success-in-the-zone">Success in The Zone</h2>



<p>In the post on social media, GSC Game World wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>No wonder it feels a bit crowdy in the Zone. </p>



<p>A million copies were sold, and much more Stalkers joined the artifact hunt with Game Pass. </p>



<p>This is just the start of our unforgettable adventure. The Heart of Chornobyl emanates stronger with each of us. </p>



<p>Thank you, Stalkers!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>STALKER 2 was a long time coming. On and off, the team was working on Heart of Chornobyl for more than a decade, undergoing many struggles and tribulations, least of all being the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which uprooted the studio and led to the tragic passing of some GSC developers.</p>



<p>It’s a big win for Game Pass, it seems. GSC hasn’t been forthcoming with the numbers, but stressing that ‘much more Stalkers’ are enjoying the game through the Game Pass service is an indication that it’s popular enough on the platform. Despite it being ‘free’ on Game Pass, the game sold like wildfire on some platforms – on Steam, it peaked at over 100,000 players on launch day.</p>



<p>Have you given STALKER 2 a try yet? If not, let us know why on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Virtua Fighter 5 was first released in 2006 in the arcades and was followed by PS3 and Xbox 360 ports in 2007. A number of revisions were made over the years since, culminating in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a> on PS4 in 2021. It's this version that is being ported to PC, with the new moniker R.E.V.O.</p><p>Technically it's not the first time it's been playable on PC, though, as Virtua Fighter 5 features as a minigame in Yakuza 6, which is available on PC. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-2">Virtua Fighter 2</a>, the 2D Mega Drive fighter, is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/71115/Virtua_Fighter_2/">already on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Still, this is excellent news for fans of Sega's somewhat dormant series. In an interview earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-developing-another-virtua-fighter-game">Sega confirmed a new Virtua Fighter game was in development</a>. It's unclear, though, if this was referencing this PC port or a new game entirely - presumably <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a> 6.</p>
<p>Both Capcom and Bandai Namco have seen great success with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> and Tekken 8 respectively, so perhaps Sega is hoping its own Virtua Fighter can make a triumphant return.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">Sega is also looking to revive classic series</a> like Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, and Jet Set Radio.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Silent Hill 2 patch is now live on PC and PlayStation 5, addressing some PS5 Pro-specific issues and much more.</p>
<p>The 1.06 patch focuses on fixing various issues on both platforms, including the widely reported visual glitches on PlayStation 5 Pro. Other PlayStation 5-specific fixes include audio, map and blocker fixes, boss animations, and more.</p>
<p>The new patch also addresses many issues on PC, including the interference between saving a game and properly performing vibrations on the controllers, improved mouse sensibility and mouse input, and more. The full patch notes are available on Konami's <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/news/eu/en/update_106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>
<p>Despite some issues here and there, developer Bloober Team did an excellent job remaking Silent Hill 2, developing their best game to date. You can learn more about it by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <p>Long before Hideo Kojima made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">the first triple-A walking simulator</a>, he was trying to spin sunlight into bullets. The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a "solar-powered" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.</p>
<p>Three sequels followed, and then Daddy Konami called time on the series. But Boktai lives on in the shape of <a href="https://chickenhat.itch.io/kura5-bonds-of-the-undying">Kura5: Bonds Of The Undying</a>, a non-canonical fangame which remixes the first game with one of its successors, Lunar Knights. It's a free downloadable experience, and as such, the old baked-in photometric functionality is gone, but the solar charging mechanic has been overhauled to work with an online real-world weather-tracking system. The 1.0 version launched this month - here's a trailer.</p>

<p>And here's some blurb from developer ChickenHat.</p>
<blockquote><p>It's neither a full remake nor a sequel, but a remix of both familiar Boktai staples and new elements that seek to recreate the magic that we all loved from the series. Kura5's weather system knows where you are in the real world, so there's no need for a solar sensor. In-game events may even play out differently depending on if you play in darkness or in light... And that's just the start!</p> </blockquote>
<p>The game gives you two characters, sun-gunning cowgirl Annie and vampire swordsman Emil. You can switch between them by playing in the day or after dark. That's right, Kura5 is designed to be played round the clock, but you can switch off the weather/day-tracking functionality and play offline if you prefer.</p>

        <p>A short, colourful FPS experiment with a free demo</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kill-the-man-in-the-house">Kill The Man In The House</a> is a video game title I can get behind. It tells me exactly what I need to do before I even boot up the game, which is otherwise powerfully weird-looking. The cover art is reminiscent of a children's book, if it were for adults. Or a lost episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BPLXepRC8E">Ed Edd and Eddy</a>, where a fourth older sibling (Eddie) acts on his murderous intent and engages in some slick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPSing</a>. Either way, there's a demo out on Steam and despite being very short and limited, I am excited for its future.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In Kill The Man In The House - Kill House, I'm going to call it - you have a revolver, an uzi, and a shotgun. Press F for a satisfying kick. Press Space to double or even triple jump. Land a headshot and there's a chance you'll enter slow-mo for a brief period. Oh and red barrels explode. Follow the compass at the top of your screen to lead you to the aforementioned Man, and once he's been killed, you need to get back to your car. Fin.</p>
<p>While the assassination process is similar to lots of other minimalist FPS games, I do think Kill House' foundation is strong. The controls are responsive, the guns have character, and the gore is gratifying. Also, the layout of the demo's level is well thought out, with buildings and barrels positioned in ways to promote stylish violence.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/kill-the-man-in-the-house-2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>cannibal</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Really, I think it's the game's surreal, polygonal art style and how that intertwines with the violence that elevates it beyond a normal FPS to a fun, experimental one. I love the feel of being a cold-blooded assassin seeking awful bastards who have taken up residence in kaleidoscopic reflections.</p><p>It's all about the little things, like how you start off next to your car, a bodyguard with his back turned to you -  a cue to punt him into the stratosphere. And how the demo opens up as you round a corner and the sharp corners unveil a jagged valley of reds and greens and yellows, the man's house nestled in this surreal condo. Not to mention that some enemies will slide and ragdoll upon death, leaving bloody trails that act like you've constructed your very own cobbled path to the next victim.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that there's no official release date just yet and that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2467950/Kill_the_Man_in_the_House/">Steam demo</a> is very short and composed of a single mission. But more updates are planned, with "many features and refinements to come". These include NPCs, pickupable, stackable and destructible objects, fire propagation, driveable cars, customisable loadouts, and large open-ended levels. Goodness me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The game won the fan-voted Game of the Year award at last night's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTDmABPisP8&amp;t=10102s">Golden Joysticks</a>, with Ji making the comment during his acceptance speech.</p>

<p>So what could those surprises be?</p>
<p>At the very least, Xbox players are still waiting to get their hands on the game. Its release on Microsoft's platform was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delayed as it needed more time for optimisation</a>, though rumours swirled around a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">PlayStation exclusivity deal</a>.</p>
<p>At the least, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">Microsoft reiterated the delay was not due to "platform limitations"</a>. A release date still has not been given, three months after its launch, but could still arrive before the end of the year.</p>
<p>More interestingly, Ji's comment further suggests DLC is on the way. Back at launch, an FAQ on the game's website noted DLC and "non-pay-to-win in-game purchases" may be released in future.</p>
<p>After release, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/investor-who-risked-it-all-on-wukong-scores-another-sales-win">Bloomberg</a> reported Game Science was working on an expansion for the game, following in the footsteps of FromSoftware with its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Multiple rumours have also circulated the DLC will release in early 2025 to coincide with Chinese New Year. So perhaps Ji's surprise is merely a release date announcement this side of Christmas. Looking at you The Game Awards!</p>
<p>"Its dramatic and spectacular boss fights just about keep Black Myth: Wukong afloat, but behind all its glitz and glamour is a frustratingly hollow and rudderless action game," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Eurogamer Black Myth: Wukong review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>We have been here before. Dynasty Warriors Origins is the tenth mainline entry in a franchise that has spun out into samurai, giant robots, JRPG heroes, and even the odd Hyrulean legend along the way. But Dynasty Warriors is where it all started, where the Musou hack and slash genre began, and with Dynasty Warriors Origins the team at Omega Force are starting once more, reimagining their headline series for the modern day. Our hands on was a commanding four hours long, and crucially, when time was called, we didn’t want to stop!</p>
<p><iframe title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - Gameplay Features" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C25kV-6Qrs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the moment-to-moment gameplay, this is classic Dynasty Warriors. While it might be a reset for the series, your approach to battle is the same here as it has been across all of the Musou games. Red indicators on the map show you where enemy strongholds and officers are, and you make your way to them to support the allied forces, and to progress the battle further, gaining ground as you go. As any fan of the series knows, it starts out easily enough, but soon you’re trying to fight on multiple fronts and juggling thousands of enemies. It’s a simple gameplay loop, but one which continues to engage and enthral, even after all this time.</p>


<p>Omega Force has given you plenty of tools to despatch those thousands of enemy troops, and combo after combo, swinging blade after swinging blade, you’ll chop those numbers back down to zero. It’s fair to say that Dynasty Warriors will immediately test the quality of your Square button, but the further you progress, the more variety you can find in this lethal game of last one standing.</p>


<p>Parrying and evading play a substantially bigger role than they have done previously, though it’s not suddenly turned Dynasty Warriors into a Soulslike. You’ll need to utilise them both to defeat the stronger enemies you come across though, and getting it right rewards you with some very cool animations, and a hefty chunk off the enemy’s guard gauge.</p>
<p>At its best, Dynasty Warriors Origins makes you feel like a super-powered warrior, capable of dispatching entire battalions of enemy soldiers by stringing together dynamic and visually rewarding combos. Even hours into our hands on, I was having a hell of a lot of fun, helped along by your steadily increasing skills, improved weaponry and new tactics.</p>
<p>One of the key differences is the addition of more meaningful RPG elements. As you progress you gain experience, and in turn rank up the main protagonist, with the skill tree broken into different military ranks. Each rank has its own skill panel, and a selection of stat boosts and new moves to unlock using your accumulated experience, though it’s entirely up to you how you choose to spec your character, and what you unlock, though in some cases you have to have unlocked a previous skill to access the next.</p>

<p>There’s nine weapon types, and your proficiency with each of these can also be levelled up, boosting damage and unlocking new combos as you do. While there’s the standard blades and lances, there’s the more unique weapons like the Rings which add in some ranged abilities alongside the melee ones. You can buy new weapons from merchants across the map, or they’ll sometimes be dropped by enemy commanders, potentially giving you an immediate boost on the battlefield</p>
<p>It doesn’t end there either, and once you’ve found the element known as Pyroxene on the world map, you can exchange each one for a random gem that you then equip for different boons and bonuses. I primarily focused on the Wellspring gem, which rewards you by recharging your health for every 100 enemies you’ve slain, and as you find more Pyroxene and level up each gem, the boosts become more favourable. I found messing with all of the different systems and swapping out weaponry for ones with special characteristics really rewarding, and made for a good balance between combat and downtime.</p>
<p>You can also build bonds with other officers. Talking and training with these characters and making the right choices will strengthen the bond, and later on in the game you’ll be able to focus on their relationships via the Shui Jing Retreat. It’s a nice addition, and though it’s one that we’ve seen before in other RPG franchises like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/17/fire-emblem-engage-review/">Fire Emblem</a> and the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, it makes sense here as you forge bonds on and off the battlefield.</p>

<p>The new world map represents the Three Kingdoms period in China. You can explore this on foot, discovering secrets and side missions, but it’s not an open world, having more in common with an RPG map than something from Ubisoft. As you quell the trouble in each region you raise the level of Peace there, which in turn will give you some undisclosed advantages.</p>
<p>When in town, you’ll stay at the inn, and from here you can read your letters – some of which will advance the story – change your equipment, or plan your battle tactics. Alongside that, other utilities will be available, including weaponry shops to expand your arsenal.</p>
<p>The map only really serves as an interactive menu, but it helps to make your skirmishes and battles feel like part of a greater war, and that you are liberating areas from oppression. It’s a shame that there isn’t more of a visual reward for doing so, as you’re bringing life and prosperity back to a region, but it’s a minor thing.</p>
<p>It’s Year 6 of the Guanghe era. Drought and famine have pushed the people to the limit, but the government have done nothing to ease their suffering. You step in as an unknown warrior, joining series stalwart Guan Yu in protecting the villagers. You’re told of Zhang Ziao and his steadily growing cult of worshippers The Way of the Great Peace, and this is the beginning of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, which, for anyone that’s played a Dynasty Warriors game before, is where the journey always begins.</p>
<p>You join up with Liu Bei’s army, alongside Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, and the first order of business is to tackle Zhang Ziao’s horde. However, there’s more here than we’ve seen in the past, with your amnesiac protagonist wrapped up in a further mystical storyline. You encounter Zhuhe, a warrior committed to eliminating those who would sow chaos. It seems as though you might have previously been a Guardian as well, and while you might have played all of the previous games, this is a welcome new narrative thread to pull on. That’s not to say that it doesn’t still feel like a Dynasty Warriors game, as during our hands on we encountered more and more of the central cast, with favourites like Cao Cao and Xiahou Yuan all present and correct.</p>

<p>It’s been almost a whole console generation since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">Dynasty Warriors 9</a>, and with the jump to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> as the baseline, the visuals have taken a clear step forward, managing to be crisp, clear, and expansive while there isn’t a hint of slowdown even when there’s a huge number of enemies on the screen. The cutscenes are also of a much higher quality than we’ve seen before, and though I’m not normally a fan of the English localisation, it’s perfectly effective here. You’ll still want to play it in Mandarin to get the full effect.</p>
<p>While I mean no disrespect, I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed Dynasty Warriors Origins. We’ve come to know what to expect from this series and its spin-offs, and while Origins doesn’t throw away the Musou rulebook, it makes smart changes to the formula that just make it more compelling. I can see myself pouring hours into this, and so might you.</p>
<p>And the best thing is that you can start right now, with a demo now available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Blizzard Entertainment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRgtN1sMf6M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosted</a> a Campfire Chat with Diablo IV developers to discuss the upcoming 2.1 patch that will go live on the Public Test Realm between December 3 and 10, exclusively on PC's Battle.net.</p>
<p>The team talked about the main features and new content that will be in the new update, starting with the long-awaited Armory feature, which allows players to save and switch between different builds easily without any respeccing costs. With the Armory, Blizzard seeks to improve player flexibility in the endgame content. They noted that controller support for the feature would not be available right away, though. Worries about accidentally selling items saved in the Armory were put to rest, too, with the developers assuring players that saved items will be favorited automatically to prevent any accidental sales. They will also have an icon indicating they are part of a saved build.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The other highlight of Diablo IV Patch 2.1 is the new system based on Witchcraft powers. Players will engage with witches around the Tree of Whispers, offering a new currency called Restless Rot (earned after defeating the new Headrotten enemies) at altars to learn new witchcraft abilities through a streamlined menu system. The season also introduces a reputation system called Covens Favor for unlocking rewards, including new witchcraft powers. Additionally, players can discover lost powers by finding Forgotten Altars in the world. Over 20 powers will be available, with popular options like the poison frog summon, Doom orb, and vengeful servant. Another Witchcraft Power called Pano sucks enemies into a swirling vortex of destruction.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Players will find Headrotten enemies through the new seasonal activity called Headhunts, earning the new Occult Gems as rewards. These gems are special socketables that boost defense and provide unique effects to fine-tune player builds. The developers showcased examples of occult gems like Elder Sigil, Killing Wind, and Dust Stone, each offering different bonuses based on player preferences and playstyle. Additionally, quality-of-life improvements have been made to the town around the Tree of Whispers, adding more services and streamlining navigation to enhance the player experience during Headhunts. Of course, Diablo IV Patch 2.1 will also come with a plethora of class changes and overhauls. The full patch notes will be released on Wednesday, November 27.</p>
<p>By the way, did you know Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-was-at-some-point-a-roguelike-game-with-arkham-like-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimented </a>with making this game a roguelike with Arkham-like combat early in development?</p>

<p>As you explore The Zone in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>, you’ll come across an abundance of items to pick up, from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-to-do-with-pdas-in-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PDAs</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-use-artifacts-in-stalker-2-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Artifacts</a> to guns like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-find-lullaby-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lullaby</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/find-riemann-solve-safe-code-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riemann</a>. Speaking of guns, some that you find while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-fast-travel-in-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roaming the open world</a> may have a red shield icon indicating their broken status. </p>



<p>If you’ve come across these diminished weapons and are wondering what your options are, we have you covered. Here’s what to do with broken weapons in Stalker 2, as well as what we recommend depending on your desired outcome.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-do-with-broken-guns-in-stalker-2">What to do with Broken guns in Stalker 2</h2>



<ul>
<li>Repair it at a Technician</li>



<li>Take the ammo and leave it</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want to keep and use the weapon, we recommend having it<strong> repaired by a Technician</strong> like Lens in Zalissya. This should only be done if you really like and want to use the weapon, as it can be an expensive process. You can check out our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-repair-weapons-in-stalker-2-easy-best-method/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide on how to repair weapons</a> for a full breakdown.</p>



<p>You <strong>can’t sell broken weapons</strong>, and repairing them to sell is inefficient since you won’t make any profit. So, if you don’t want to use it, it’s best to <strong>take the ammo out of the weapon and leave it behind</strong>.</p>



<p>This all goes for broken weapons with the red shield icon, but you’ll also find weapons with a yellow shield icon.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-to-do-with-damaged-weapons-in-stalker-2">What to do with damaged weapons in Stalker 2</h2>



<p>A yellow shield icon in <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stalker 2</a> means the weapon is <strong>damaged but not broken</strong>. It can still be used, but it can also be sold for some quick cash. As expected, damaged weapons will sell for less, but it’s still not worth repairing them before selling, as it’ll only cut into your profits.</p>



<p>You can track a weapon’s health with the Durability stat, which is found at the bottom of the weapon tab when hovering over it in the inventory. </p>



<p>The best option here is to sell it if you’re not too fussed with the gun, but if you like the weapon and want to continue using it, get it repaired for safekeeping.</p>
