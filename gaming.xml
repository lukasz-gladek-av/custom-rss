<p>One of the most electrifying fixtures at IEM Cologne has just wrapped up, with FaZe Clan pulling out one of the most dizzying reverse sweeps against Team Liquid that we’ve seen in years. It looked awry for FaZe Clan on Mirage, with Team Liquid securing a massive 11 – 1 lead, but as the match pushed on, FaZe Clan exploded.</p>



<p>Just like that, the team was able to pull off a full reverse sweep, with Team Liquid managing to secure just one more round before the game entered Overtime at 12 – 12. FaZe Clan refused to relent, netting a further four rounds to win the map and push Team Liquid out of IEM Cologne.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stunning-performance">Stunning Performance</h2>



<p>FaZe Clan went on one hell of a run to secure qualification into the playoffs. From the upper bracket, FaZe Clan beat Team Liquid once but was sent packing into the lower run by Vitality, who would later qualify for the playoffs. </p>



<p>In the lower bracket, FaZe Clan forcefully ejected Team Falcons – currently the number-one organisation at the Esports World Cup – before dispatching Team Liquid once again.</p>



<p>The numbers ended up <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/matches/mapstatsid/181396/liquid-vs-faze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">looking sharp for FaZe Clan</a>, but most particularly for ropz, who picked up the accolades for the best overall rating, the most kills, and the most damage. </p>



<p>It was tough watching FaZe Clan get rinsed so many times in quick succession, but the team remained resilient and pulled off a beautiful reverse sweep worthy of a tournament champion.</p>



<p>Now, FaZe Clan enters the playoffs along with MOUZ, G2, NAVI, Vitality, and SAW. There’s still the matter of the $1 million prize pool on the line, and the winner of this event will net $400,000 of that <strong>plus </strong>qualification to IEM Katowice 2025 <strong>and </strong>the BLAST Premier World Final.</p>



<p>FaZe has been running a little cold lately, having secured IEM Chengdu in April but nothing else going back to November 2023. Could this be another IEM win for the squad?</p>

It’s a message that sees Arrowhead acknowledging player frustrations, as it promises to focus on “action. Not talk,” when it comes to Helldivers 2’s future.</p><p>“We’ve spent the last week listening to feedback, reflecting about the path ahead for Helldivers 2 and how we want to continue developing the game,” game director Mikael Eriksson said. “In short, we didn’t hit our target with the latest update. Some things we just didn’t get right - and other more fundamental inconsistencies in our approach to game balance and game direction. All of that is on us and we are going to own that.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2-escalation-of-freedom-1721742365253.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Arrowhead publishes 60-day plan to get Helldivers 2 back in shape.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Anger from Helldivers 2 fans stems from a number of gameplay tweaks and additions that have arrived since launch in February. Namely, many are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fire-damage-nerfs-push-helldivers-2-community-to-open-rebellion-again"><u>upset with recent weapon nerfs</u></a>, arguing that Arrowhead’s balance tweaks hamper fun in favor of a more even experience overall. It’s a conversation that has seen the community divided, as there is a fair share of others who prefer the feeling of barely extracting from a mission alive.</p><p>Regardless, Arrowhead feels the need to step in. Within the next 60 days, Eriksson promises to re-examine how the team approaches balance in Helldivers 2. That means alterations to how fire damage works and rag-dolling that isn’t as intrusive to the experience. Arrowhead also wants to prioritize bugs that directly impact gameplay while improving frame rate across Helldivers 2. Another change promised in the first 60 days will see those relentless Chargers reworked, though no details on how they will be changed were revealed.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Our intention is that balance should be fun, not ‘balanced’ for the sake of balance.</p></div><p>“Our intention is that balance should be fun, not ‘balanced’ for the sake of balance,” the outline says.</p><p>Arrowhead’s grand outline comes with a few long-term bullet points aimed to ensure Helldivers 2 sticks around for a long time to come. This includes the high-priority goal of erecting an opt-in beta test environment as well as regularly posting player surveys in order to streamline communication from fans to the developers. With this will come even more blog posts and more detailed patch notes.</p><p>“We also want to thank you for your patience," Eriksson continued. "We're grateful that so many of you provided constructive feedback and suggestions on the latest update.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Helldivers 2 launched to unforeseen success earlier this year and even managed to become <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks"><u>PlayStation’s fastest-selling game ever</u></a> with 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks on PC and PlayStation 5. With its victories have come a laundry list of changes, with one major shift seeing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs"><u>John Pilestedt switch from CEO to CCO</u></a> in order to focus more on the studio’s games and community. Its new CEO, Shams Jorjani, would later <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-setting-studio-up-to-make-more-and-better-stuff-in-sustainable-way-new-ceo-says">comment on the success of Helldivers 2</a>, acknowledging that the team “knew it would be impossible to keep up with demand and the insatiable hunger for more fun shit to do in/with HD2.”</p><p>Helldivers 2 is working through a low period after a strong first few months. We called it “amazing” in our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review"><u>9/10 review</u></a>, saying, “Helldivers 2's combat feels fantastic, its missions stay fresh and interesting, and its smart progression system doesn’t nickel and dime you.”</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/borderlands-movie-eli-roth-randy-pitchford-gearbox</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-am-in-awe-of-the-borderlands-movie%E2%80%99s-origin-story-a-burden-you-must-now-also-bear.952386/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/borderlands-movie-eli-roth-randy-pitchford-gearbox<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After many years in various circles of development hell, the <em>Borderlands </em>movie is finally out. It’s not doing well. On <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borderlands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, it’s currently tangled in the tendrils of a nine-percent score, and its global box office take over the weekend was <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/borderlands-grosses-16-million-globally-leaving-it-roughly-60-million-shy-of-breaking-even-and-that-s-before-the-theatres-take-their-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a mere $16 million</a> – tens of millions less than its budget. I have no desire to see this apparent whimper of a thing in theaters, nor should you. However, I will absolutely <em>devour </em>details about how it got made.</p><p>Nothing about the movie makes sense, after all. How did it attract such a star-studded cast? Why are all the main characters played by actors substantially older than they’re supposed to be? Why <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-r-rated-pg-13-eli-roth-interview-1851618411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut the cartoony gore</a> the <em>Borderlands </em>series is known for, especially with the R-rated <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> running circles around the rest of this year’s summer movie slate? <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/cate-blanchett-borderlands-covid-madness.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Cate Blanchett OK</a>?&nbsp;</p><p>Answering precisely none of those questions – though definitely providing an illuminating point A to explain how we reached the movie’s point Z – is director Eli Roth’s explanation of how he pitched <em>Borderlands </em>to studio execs, which I discovered while going down a rabbit hole last night and which I am now obligated to share with you, to ease the weight of my own burden. It involves literal dogshit. From <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/borderlands-director-reveals-the-first-question-he-asked-the-games-studio-and-how-his-dog-got-him-the-job/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview</a> Roth did with SFX Magazine:</p><blockquote><p>Whenever I take [my dog] for a walk and she has to go to the bathroom, she won’t let me look at her. I have to look away because she gets really shy. But one day I filmed her. She had that shy look on her face and I was like, 'That’s Claptrap.'</p><p>My first question [to Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford] was, 'You can’t kill Claptrap, but you can shoot him hundreds of times?' He goes, 'Correct. Because there’s a scene where Claptrap gets shot up after being a decoy.' I said, ‘So, what happens to the bullets?’ Randy goes, 'I don’t know.’ I go, ‘Could he shit out the bullets, like we’re in a Mel Brooks movie?’ He goes, ‘Yes, he could.’ And I felt we needed to see that.</p><p>… And that was my pitch to Lionsgate. They were laughing so hard.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This tale fits a little too well with <em>Borderlands</em>’ sometimes-puerile sense of humor, so perhaps it’s just marketing spin. But given where things ended up, I’m choosing to believe it.</p><p>Speaking of where things ended up, Pitchford is – as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/randy-pitchford-tweets-maximum-copium-after-borderlands-bombs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer recently put it</a> – posting through it. Among other things, he recently compared the plainly-bad video game movie <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1822369245822374131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to The Beatles</a>, which is certainly a choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/owlcat-games-enters-publishing-space-with-two-rpgs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Owlcat Games, known for making games like Pathfinder: Kingmaker and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-crpg-pathfinder-owlcat-games/">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a>, has entered the publishing space with two new RPGs. This company will now help independent developers across the globe create their own RPG projects. By helping these independent developers out, they will give them access to funding, expert advice, and any other services they may need in the game creation department.</p>
<p>Owlcat Games reviewed 50 different games and picked two to start with. The two development teams they'll be working with are Emotion Spark Studio, based in Serbia, and Another Angle Games, based in Poland.</p>
<p>Emotion Spark Studio is currently working on an RPG titled <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126190/Rue_Valley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rue Valley</a>. The story revolves around a man who is trapped in a time loop during a psychotherapy session. By uncovering more of his story, he has to delve into his mental challenges and figure out how he got into this situation.</p>
<p>Another Angle Games is working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1173980/Shadow_of_the_Road/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Road</a>, an isometric RPG set in an alternate history timeline of Feudal Japan. This game combines history, samurai, allegiance, and honor with tactical turn-based combat systems. In addition, it takes place in a world filled with magical Yokai and Steampunk technology.</p>
<p>While both games are still in early development, attendees of Gamescom will get more information on these two RPGs.</p>
<p>With Owlcat Games joining the publishing industry, they gained full control of the publishing label META Games, which assisted in publishing Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous and helped bring the game to PC and consoles in 2021. META Games is a very different publisher style from the one that Owlcat Games aims to be, as they focus primarily on gameplay-first titles with co-op multiplayer features.</p>
<p>META Games has published some games, including Biped, Spirit of the Island, Train Valley 1, and Train Valley 2. Its upcoming games include Biped 2 and Nested Lands. Similar to the above RPGs, META Games will be at Gamescom, where it will showcase some of its upcoming titles, including Biped 2 and Nested Lands.</p>
<p>Owlcat Games started as a very small company and has since grown exponentially, with over 450 employees worldwide. Their head office is in Cyprus, but that doesn't stop them from having employees from many different countries. With the news of Owlcat Games stepping into publishing, they are continuing to expand and hire for new roles, something that is seemingly uncommon in today's climate in the gaming industry.</p>

About 30 minutes into playing in the tournament, Osmanova alerted officials that she was feeling sick, complaining of nausea and dizziness. Doctors were called and they deduced that she had likely been poisoned. Officials checked security footage and discovered Abakarova allegedly poisoning Osmanova’s chess board. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://t.me/bazabazon/30070&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://t.me/bazabazon/30070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In footage released online</a></span>, you can see Abakarova enter an area filled with chess boards and empty chairs. Before the tournament had started, the chess pro walked over to where Osmanova was scheduled to play and then smeared liquid mercury—allegedly from a broken thermometer—onto the table and board.

<p>There are several fantastic gaming events throughout the year designed to build hype around upcoming titles, like the ever-popular Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 or Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. This year, at Gamescom, we’re set to see a huge selection of popular games, with a few of them already confirmed for the show floor. Here are 10 games we’ll see at Gamescom!</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>This year’s entry in the long-running first-person shooter franchise promises to be one of the most exciting and welcoming to everyone, as it’s one of the first major launches in the series on Xbox Game Pass. <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </strong>returns with improved movement, a cinematic single-player campaign, round-based Zombies, prestige levels, weapon customization, and so much more!</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The upcoming installment in the grind-heavy Monster Hunt series, <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong>, takes players to an all-new location with unique monsters, weapons, and abilities to help breathe fresh life into the franchise. We’ve previously glimpsed an overhauled weather system and boss encounters, but Gamescom should give us a taste of more gameplay!</p>



<h2 id="h-star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In what may be the biggest blockbuster game of the summer, Star Wars Outlaws is Ubisoft’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-star-wars-outlaws-multiplayer-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first open-world, single-player</a> Star Wars title to date. It boasts multiple planets to explore, space flight, cover-based combat mechanics, stealth, and choice-based story progression. We’ve already explored quite a bit of the game, but Gamescom is the last real shot the team has at winning over fans before its launch at the end of August!</p>



<h2 id="h-warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>The upcoming third-person horde shooter, <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</strong>, from developer Saber Interactive is shaping up to be one of the most exciting titles of the year. Stepping into the ultra-armored boots of an Ultramarine, players once more take on the role of Captain Titus, but this time around, it’s not Orks but Tyranids invading. Using a variety of weapons, up to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-multiplayer-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three players in co-op</a> can push back the unsightly enemy en masse.</p>



<h2 id="h-little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following the immense success of Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares 2, Supermassive Games is back once more with <strong>Little Nightmares 3</strong>. In this entry, players follow Low &amp; Alone, two companions in search of a way out of Nowhere. With two protagonists, players will embark on this unique and frightful adventure in full co-op or with an AI companion. We’ll see more of Little Nightmares 3 at Gamescom this month!</p>



<h2 id="h-s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-heart-of-chornobyl">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-stalker-2-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent delay and 35-minute Deep Dive</a>, in which we enjoyed significantly more gameplay and game design elements than ever before, we’re all eagerly awaiting the launch of <strong>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</strong>. Thankfully, it’s only a few months away, but we’re still hopeful for more. With Gamescom around the corner, developer GSC Game World intends to give us what we want!</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Once more, following in the footsteps of young Henry, <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</strong> drops us into 15th-century Medieval Europe in an epic adventure full of sword fights, horseback chases, and an impressive five hours worth of cinematics to help the story along. At Gamescom, we hope to see additional gameplay from Henry’s perspective as he explores Medieval Europe, along with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a release date</a>!</p>



<h2 id="h-dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</h2>

<p>From developer Funcom, known for Conan Exiles, <strong>Dune Awakening</strong> follows a similar gameplay style but set in the iconic universe of Frank Hebert’s Dune. It’s touted as an open-world survival MMO with a massive, persistent sandbox world to explore, fight across, and build within. We’re hoping to see gameplay from the project at Gamescom!</p>



<h2 id="h-civilization-vii">Civilization VII</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The long-running turn-based strategy franchise returns with immense excitement on all fronts. <strong>Civilization VII</strong> is coming to Gamescom, and we’re hoping for gameplay, first and foremost, but also more on the title’s mechanics, countries, and multiplayer components. It’ll be there for all to see, so <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-civilization-7-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we just have to wait patiently</a>!</p>

It’s a story-driven single-player adventure spanning multiple continents as Indy and companions fight against sinister forces. At Gamescom, we’re hoping for gameplay, but a cinematic is certainly welcome, too!</p>

            <p>
Cast your mind back to the murky distant past of 24 hours ago and you might remember publisher Boss Team Games teasing two projects based on John Carpenter's Halloween. Well, it turns out one of those is a 16-bit-style platformer from Shantae developer WayForward, and the studio's creating an Ash vs Evil Dead platformer too.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/retro-realms-halloween-ash-vs-evil-dead-games-announced-release-date-price">IGN</a>, Boss Team (which previously published Saber Interactive's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/last-years-multiplayer-evil-dead-game-wont-get-new-content-switch-version-canned">now-defunct</a> Evil Dead: The Game) is releasing both titles as part of its new RetroRealms series. The publisher describes its first two instalments as "gore-filled" and "fast-paced 90's arcade style" platfomers, and you can get a taste of their retro-inspired action in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S-Dt-0_lbY">trailer</a> below.
</p>
<p>
RetroRealms: Halloween and RetroRealms: Ash vs Evil Dead are both set to launch for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch on 18th November, and they'll cost $24.99 USD (around £20) each. A $49.99 physical Double Feature bundle is also on the way, with Boss Team noting players owning both games will unlock new features, including the ability for protagonists Michael Myers and Ash Williams to cross over to each others' worlds.

<p>
Today's news (which, if nothing else, has reminded me I still haven't watched all of Ash vs Evil Dead) follows Boss Team Games' recent announcement it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-carpenters-halloween-is-getting-two-game-adaptations-from-evil-dead-publisher">two Halloween projects in the works</a>, both enabling players to "relive moments from the film and play as classic characters". One of these is evidentally WayForward's platformer, but the other remains mysterious. It does, however, seem likely this second project will be the one John Carpenter is said to be "intimately involved" with, unless Carpenter had some particularly revolutionary ideas about running left and right and occassionally hitting a jump button.
</p>
<p>
There's no word of a release date for Halloween game number two, but hopefully the oft-reliable WayForward will deliver the goods when RetroRealms: Halloween and RetroRealms: Ash vs Evil Dead show up on 18th October.

This update is special since it marks the sci-fi social deduction game crossing over with the beloved <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>D&amp;D</em></a> actual play series <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Critical Role</a>. The aptly named Among Us x Critical Role crossover introduces new cosmetic items and new imposter kill animation.</p>
<h2>The Among Us x Critical Role Crossover Announcement</h2>
<p>The Among Us x Critical Role crossover was announced through a <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/announcing-among-us-x-critical-role/">dev log post</a> on Innersloth's website. As the name implies, the update introduces brand-new cosmetic items based on the adventuring parties of Vox Machina, Mighty Nein, and Bells Hells.</p>

Log into the game and pick up Gilmore's Curious Cosmicube for 110 Stars (MSRP $9.99). From there, you slowly unlock those cosmetics as you play.</p>
<p>The cosmetics found within that Cosmicube are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Artagan's Cloak Skin</li>
<li>Artagan's Hair Hat</li>
<li>Artagan's Incredible Brows Visor</li>
<li>Chetney's Eyebrows Visor</li>

<li>Teatime with Caduceus Nameplate</li>
<li>The Nine Eyes of Lucien Nameplate</li>
<li>Vax's Armor Skin</li>
<li>Vax's Hair Hat</li>
</ul><p>If your character has all three of Chetney's cosmetics equipped, and you are playing as the Impostor, you will unlock a brand new kill animation.</p>
<p>Like all purchased Cosmicubes, you can unlock the <em>Among Us x Critical Role</em> cosmetics at your leisure after you buy them. However, this Cosmicube will only be available for a limited time. You have until November 12 at 2 AM ET to pick it up if interested.</p>

You doing okay, buddy? I know it's been a few years since you launched a game, but did you remember...how? to announce? a game?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In case you haven't heard, Steam platform owner Valve, the developer of the Half Life, Team Fortress, and Portal series, as well as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>DOTA 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Artifact</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, is finally releasing a new game: a hero shooter called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Or...is it? The game was first dug up through Steam datamining and not officially announced. Though it looked near completion, there was every chance Valve could pull the plug and not launch it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, at some point, Valve invited players to a closed beta for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, using a key system that allowed players to invite their friends. The invites proliferated so far that according to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/">SteamDB</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the game's hit a peak of 18,000 concurrent players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Such invites for unreleased games normally come with varying NDAs, but as The Verge's Sean Hollister </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game">discovered</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Valve's only attempt to discourage sharing anything about the game was a menu screen saying "don't share info" when you opened the client, with a prompt for the user to say "ok."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hollister navigated around this screen by pressing the "escape" key. After he wrote about this experience, Valve banned his account from matchmaking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hollister's banning tripped a red flag for me. Not just because retaliating against journalists pushes against a free press (I don't want to make too big a deal of this, it's just getting banned from a game's matchmaking), but because this series of events indicates Valve's market power might be getting out of hand.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is it a monopoly? I don't know, but because Valve owns and operates Steam, the platform it distributes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on, it's been able to market its game in a way no another developer or publisher can.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's dig into why.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What other publisher can roll out a game in this manner?">What other publisher can roll out a game in this manner?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's step through the stages of Valve's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> rollout.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve owns Steam, the platform it distributes its own games on. It funds the development of new games with revenue from Steam and its existing titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When Valve releases any game, it competes against other games on the Steam marketplace. Valve's market power is checked by how many games it can deliver, the quality of them, and its competitors' ability/decision to launch on other platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve, like other developers, decided to do a closed beta for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Unlike most other developers, it has not announced the game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>yet</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This closed beta is run with an invite-based system that is very open, where players can invite others. Valve has deliberately given up control over precisely who joins the playtest because for whatever reason, this fit into its strategy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve could also have legally controlled who is allowed to discuss </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and under what conditions by requiring the signing of an NDA or some equivalent triggered in-game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It did not, because for reasons I do not know, this fit into its strategy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Already we are in a position most (if not all?) developers and publishers cannot afford to operate in: tightly controlling information about a game (purportedly) key to its financial success. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valve has an outsized amount of financial stability to endure any loss of revenue that could come from an early leak of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The closest example of another publisher trying this strategy I can think of this is when Respawn Entertainment and Electronic Arts revved up the launch for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and invited a bunch of press and influencers to LA to play the game before it launched. During this test, they still required press to sign NDAs (or at least agree to embargoes, I never learned the specific terms).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now we enter even more uncharted territory. Valve has placed a game on Steam that it has not announced, and invited people to play it. Not only to invite them to play it, but to invite their friends to play it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is where Valve doesn't just have market capacity that other companies don't have, but it explicitly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>benefits</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from its position. The company is not making money off of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but a beta like this could entice people to one day spend money on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Valve is benefitting from this strategy, as many other companies do, so I'm only noting it here as the beginning of its unusual position.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here is the nail in the coffin for me on why Valve's moves flex its market power: when Valve gets people to share invites for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it has the potential to effectively create new users for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>all of Steam</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some people playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> may invite their friends who have not played on Steam before. That's not a farfetched concept. If people have only played </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or have mostly been on console, or have pirated software and not used Steam, whatever, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valve's efforts here have the potential to create new Steam accounts.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Every new Steam account benefits Valve in some way financially. If a player accepts an invite to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, makes an account, then buys a game from its competitor on Steam, Valve gets a cut. If that player never spends a penny, but hops into other free-to-play games on Steam, they enter an ecosystem that leads to other players spending money in the game, which Valve gets a cut from. In the big picture, Valve relies on other companies to market Steam for it, because they're the ones who say "hey, if you want to buy our game, join Steam." Here, they get to use their own product to do that marketing at a discount compared to their competitors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And now we hit the "NDAs," a point where I think Valve has badly abused its position. Valve did not require anyone invited to play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to sign a legally actionable NDA or have them agree to an EULA. It posted a sign that did not even explicitly require the user to click "I agree," something EULAs go to great lengths to spell out to ensure their legality (and even then, some judges and regulators are scrutinizing that).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine this warning, or any document, is a guard at the door. If the guard is named "NDA," or "EULA," when a person asks to pass the threshold, the guard says "you may pass the threshold if you agree to X, and Y, and if you violate that agreement, Z will happen."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The person who wants to cross the door agrees or disagrees, and the guard lets them in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here, Valve has dropped a guard at the door who when players ask to cross, it says "don't tell anyone you crossed this door." If players ask "or what?" it does not answer. What will the guard do? Will it bar you from entry? Will it punch you into next Tuesday? Will it open a trap door and you fall in and there's crocodiles but the crocodiles are friendly and you have a nice time with the crocodiles—okay this is getting out of hand, I think you get the point.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then a person can walk past without saying "ok" to the guard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That is the purpose of those documents: to create conditions so both parties understand the outcomes and can agree on somewhat equal footing to enter a contract together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve's menu is not an NDA, and it is not an EULA. When Hollister wrote about the game, he did so with no explicit knowledge of what Valve's response would be. When journalists agree to embargoes or sign NDAs, we do so with the knowledge of what will happen when we violate that agreement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve took action and banned him from matchmaking. That is a slap on the wrist—but Hollister had no way of knowing if that would be the only consequence.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve could have banned him from all online play on Steam. Valve could have turned off his access to various elements of Steam. Valve could have gone so far as to disable or suspend his entire account. It has the power to flip that switch, and it chose here to take what it felt like was an appropriate response.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But unlike </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>every other game company in the marketplace</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it did so </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>without entering an agreement in the first place</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Actions like this invite scrutiny of Valve's marketplace power">Actions like this invite scrutiny of Valve's marketplace power</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To date, I have not been personally convinced by the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wolfire-games-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-has-been-dismissed">lawsuits</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> accusing Valve of operating a monopoly through Steam. That's not to say I think they're 100 percent wrong, I just think as long as I can go buy a game on Xbox or PlayStation, I have a marketplace of choices. That I can play other games on PC without ever opening Steam is another factor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, I want to leave it to the courts and the regulators to figure out. I'm just a writer, not a legal expert.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Valve's behavior with the rollout of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has shifted my thinking. Some of the lawsuits against Valve has revealed details about how it "encourages" developers to maintain </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/valve-sued-for-allegedly-overcharging-14-million-uk-steam-players">price parity</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> across platforms, but again I'm not an expert on whether that is considered price fixing. But as someone professionally obligated to follow the game industry, I know when I've seen something I've never seen before, and I have never seen a company enforce an order to not share information without some form of binding agreement in place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a first. And it is a first because Valve has the market power to do this. That power manifests in its control over accounts on Steam, its ability to resist harm from the leak of information, and its ability to benefit its entire ecosystem by letting players invite other players into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I still don't know if Steam is a monopoly! Again, I am a writer and not an expert, and would prefer the courts and FTC step in before putting such an argument to print.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've been thinking a lot about market power and monopolies in the wake of the recent court decision about</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/google-antitrust-ruling.html"> Google's search engine dominance</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ftc-says-microsoft-has-turned-xbox-game-pass-into-a-degraded-product-">FTC's objection</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to Game Pass price changes following Microsoft's purchase of Activision Blizzard, especially with regards to the concept of a "degraded product." Valve hasn't done anything to make Steam worse (in fact, it regularly makes it better for developers and players), but the rollout of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deadlock</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> suggests the existence of some supreme form of Steam that other developers don't have access to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is that fair? Is it legal? I don't know.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within - Official Shadows Beneath Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Dracthyr shown in the WoWCast image, however, is definitely not an Evoker. Rather than using the caster weapons Evokers typically wield, this Dracthyr is wielding two giant axes. That has led players to believe the image actually shows a Dracthyr Warrior, seemingly confirming that the race will have its Evoker-only class restrictions lifted for The War Within's launch or sometime shortly after. Blizzard had previously hinted the Dracthyr would eventually be able to play as different classes, but that the feature would not be included for The War Within's release.</p><p dir="ltr">Funnily enough, this isn't the first Warband image Blizzard has shown depicting a non-Evoker Dracthyr. During BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard shared a Warbands interface mockup that featured a Dracthyr wearing leather armor instead of the mail armor worn by Evokers. Blizzard at the time called the inclusion of the leather-wearing Dracthyr an oversight.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4349699-dracthyrwarrior.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349699" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1456" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4349699-dracthyrwarrior.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349699"></a><figcaption>Yep, that's definitely a Dracthyr Warrior.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4349699-dracthyrwarrior.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As the feature hasn't been officially announced, it's unknown what classes will be available to Dracthyr.

            <p>
Developer Creative Assembly's Alien: Isolation is, of course, a stone-cold horror classic, so it only seems right the movie series it's based on would finally get around to paying it some dues. Which is exactly what Fede Álvarez, the director of new movie Alien: Romulus, has done by sneaking in a whole bunch of Isolation-inspired phones.
</p>
<p>
As fans of the sci-fi horror masterpiece will already know, telephones play a prominent role in Alien: Isolation, serving as save points scattered intermittently throughout the nail-biting, Xenomorph-dodging adventure. "In the game," Álvarez told Total Film (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alien-romulus-pays-tribute-to-alien-isolation-with-a-telephone-easter-egg-director-says/">VGC</a>), "every time you knew there's a phone you'd go, 'Fuck, I'm about to go into some bad set-piece.'"
</p>
<p>
And it's in that spirit Álvarez, tipping his hat to Alien: Isolation, elected to plaster emergency telephones all over his new movie, sneaking them into frame like an omen of imminent horrors to come. "It's the same thing here," he continued. "You'll see they're planted strategically throughout the film. When you see the phone, it's like: brace for impact... The movie is set up in a way [that] every time something bad is about to happen, you will see a phone."
</p>
<p>
So yes, steel yourself: spot a phone in the background and Randy Pitchford might be about to jump out and announce an Aliens: Colonial Marines 2.

<p>
And it seems Álvarez - who also directed 2013's Evil Dead reboot and 2016's Don't Breathe - isn't just a man of exceptional taste when it comes to games; early word suggests he's also crafted a fine slice of horror himself with Alien: Romulus. We'll know if it genuinely does halt the movie series' decades-long downward spiral when it arrives in cinemas this Friday, 16th August.

And if for some inexplicable - and by this point, almost unforgiveable - reason you've yet experience Alien: Isolation's masterful slice of sci-fi horror, now is as good a time as any: it's currently discounted by 80 percent on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/alien_isolation_collection">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/214490/Alien_Isolation/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/alien-isolation">Epic</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0177-CUSA00362_00-AITCOLLECTIONPS4">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/alien-isolation/C1H9V6SLK2K5">Xbox</a>.

Whether it was the questionable crossovers that were the <em>Alien Vs. Predator</em> flicks, or the bizarre way in which <em>Alien: Covenant</em> tried to be both an <em>Alien</em> movie and a <em>Prometheus</em> sequel, there are some misses in the iconic franchise.<br></p><p>So, ahead of the theatrical release of <em>Alien: Romulus</em>, we’ve ranked the <em>Alien </em>films from worst to best.

At the end of that movie, we were given a tease for a possible sequel featuring a Predator/Alien hybrid. Sadly, that neat stinger is better than all of <em>Requiem</em>.<br></p><p><em>Requiem </em>is a poorly lit disaster of a movie that is a slog to watch, assuming you can even see what’s happening. The movie is too dark, which is a problem when the aliens in the film are dark in color and vanish into the background during many scenes. And <em>AvP: Requiem</em> features some human characters who are about as memorable as gray paint. </p><p>I’ll admit that <em>AvP: Requiem </em>does include <em>some </em>decent action scenes featuring the new “Predalien” hybrid, but don’t watch this movie. Instead, save yourself the trouble and just look up the six or so cool moments on YouTube and forget this trainwreck of a film ever happened. I mean, the creative team behind the ongoing <em>Alien </em>and <em>Predator </em>film franchises have done that. So you should too! — <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong><br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="12e5f091f728b6bfed31a84d4b5449f4" data-recommend-id="image://12e5f091f728b6bfed31a84d4b5449f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Alien and Predator face off.

It’s fan service pretending to be a movie and designed solely to give fans what they had wanted for years: A live-action fight between Xenos and Yautja, something we had only previously seen in comic books and video games. And the movie does that. The fights between the Aliens and Predators are great and feel ripped out of some silly comic book from the ‘90s. </p><p>However, <em>AvP </em>is quietly a really solid, well-paced, and fun sci-fi action film, too. That’s the secret to why so many people give this film a pass. Though its sequel, as mentioned, was a hard-to-watch, overly gory, and canon-destroying mess of a movie that nobody should suffer through.<br></p><p>But <em>AvP </em>is a mostly self-contained adventure that ends up doing something impressive, considering this is more fan service than a movie. By the end of <em>AvP</em>, I was actually invested in a friendship between a large lizard alien with dreads who doesn’t talk and a human woman using parts of a Xenomorph as weapons. Huh? Weird! Yeah, it’s not nearly as good as even the “bad” <em>Alien </em>sequels, but it’s a tad bit better than you might expect. Which is a big improvement over <em>Requiem</em>. — <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong><br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca2415bf78f8f5aebdb3ceb875b4d647" data-recommend-id="image://ca2415bf78f8f5aebdb3ceb875b4d647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ripley carries a body." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ripley carries a body." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Studios / AVP Galaxy</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca2415bf78f8f5aebdb3ceb875b4d647" data-recommend-id="image://ca2415bf78f8f5aebdb3ceb875b4d647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ripley carries a body." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Hoo boy, this is a pretty bad movie, though it is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE3YTkyM2ItY2UzOC00Mzg4LWEzNjItNWEwM2VjY2RmNDlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_QL75_UX500_CR0,47,500,281_.jpg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE3YTkyM2ItY2UzOC00Mzg4LWEzNjItNWEwM2VjY2RmNDlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_QL75_UX500_CR0,47,500,281_.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source of the iconic <em>Alien</em> meme.</a></span> <em>Alien 3</em> was directed by David Fincher, which is such a bummer since he makes some great movies (<em>Se7en, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Zodiac, Gone Girl</em>—it’s an impressive filmography), but even he can’t save it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/03/david-fincher-interview-transcript&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/03/david-fincher-interview-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And even he hates it.</a></span> The threequel already had the cards stacked against it, having to come after the fantastic <em>Aliens</em>, which offered a completely unexpected sequel to the original film—and then it was bad to boot.<br></p><p><em>Alien 3</em> starts off in an absolutely baffling manner, with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crash-landing on a prison planet and both her lover (Hicks) and her sort-of adopted daughter (Newt) dying off-camera.

Ridley Scott even directed it (he’s only otherwise done the original <em>Alien</em> and <em>Prometheus</em>), so people were hopeful the 2017 film would be rock solid. And there are some shining moments in this film, particularly in Scott’s clear determination to ask and examine existential questions that the original movie only briefly touched on.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, <em>Alien: Covenant</em> tries too hard to be both an <em>Alien</em> movie and a <em>Prometheus</em> sequel, which results in it kind of feeling like neither. Though many people can (and do) argue that <em>Prometheus</em> sticks out like a sore thumb in the <em>Alien </em>pantheon, I think it’s more egregious to try and make a film that fits in both buckets. <em>Covenant </em>is by no means a bad movie, but it just falls a little flat, especially if you watch it back-to-back with <em>Prometheus</em>. — <strong>Alyssa Mercante</strong><br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e06ef43a156e98940a0cb55055e35213" data-recommend-id="image://e06ef43a156e98940a0cb55055e35213" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ripley and the squad stand in waist-high water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ripley and the squad stand in waist-high water." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e06ef43a156e98940a0cb55055e35213" data-recommend-id="image://e06ef43a156e98940a0cb55055e35213" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ripley and the squad stand in waist-high water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The fourth main entry in the series, <em>Alien: Resurrection</em> could have played it safe and hoped that it could bring in the money and fans via the iconic name, some xenomorphs, and Sigourney Weaver as Ripley.

But <em>Alien: Resurrection,</em> on the other hand, is a movie that burned many scenes and images into my head. Stand-out moments include the bit where the Xenos attack one of their own to use its acid blood to escape containment, the creepy and sad moment when Ripley (a clone in this movie) has to kill a barely living and different Ripley clone, and when someone kills another person using the chest-burster exploding from their own body like an organic alien spear. Good stuff! And let’s also not forget one of the coolest moments ever captured on film: That time Weaver nailed a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/FF44YvDVP8Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/FF44YvDVP8Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">behind-the-back basketball shot</a></span> and made Ron Perlman break character.<br></p><p>Sure, yeah, the ending is wild and depressing. And yeah, at this point the film is arguably not a part of the current <em>Alien </em>canon—though what is and isn’t canon in this franchise is a wild mess that’s not worth thinking about. But whatever, I really dig <em>Resurrection </em>for taking some risks, doing some weird shit, and trying to create something new and not just rehashing the past few films but with some new actors. And while I’m excited to see <em>Romulus</em>, the latest film in the series, I’ll admit that I’m a bit sad to see that the film is so dedicated to perfectly recapturing the look of the old movies while treating the franchise like it’s a precious artifact that can never be broken.<br></p><p><em>Resurrection </em>shows that it’s often more memorable and interesting to do something weird and take a big swing than just do <em>Alien </em>again and again until the heat death of the universe. — <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e6022e428535016833f27a6327cb1807" data-recommend-id="image://e6022e428535016833f27a6327cb1807" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charlie, Elizabeth, and David stand in front of a massive statue of a face, flashlights in hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charlie, Elizabeth, and David stand in front of a massive statue of a face, flashlights in hand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e6022e428535016833f27a6327cb1807" data-recommend-id="image://e6022e428535016833f27a6327cb1807" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charlie, Elizabeth, and David stand in front of a massive statue of a face, flashlights in hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Though its detractors will point to how <em>Prometheus</em> deviates from the tried-and-true <em>Alien</em> formula, I’d argue that’s what makes the 2012 film so special. Directed by Scott (the first <em>Alien</em> film he helmed since the original), <em>Prometheus</em> seeks to explore the origins of the xenomorphs and humanity—it is more epic tale than horror film, more fable than action movie. It’s an inspired deviation from expectations, and one that I think pays off in spades.<br></p><p>Understandably, this can feel a bit strange in the context of the other <em>Alien</em> movies, but <em>Prometheus</em> is so beautifully shot, so well-written, and so expertly acted that it doesn’t matter. I remember leaving the theater after and furiously scribbling theories on a notepad—and only a good movie can move you to do something like that. Plus, any movie that gets Noomi Rapace on the big screen is a banger in my book. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1ad95410d8501297dc656716b803098f" data-recommend-id="image://1ad95410d8501297dc656716b803098f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ripley comforts Newt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ripley comforts Newt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ad95410d8501297dc656716b803098f" data-recommend-id="image://1ad95410d8501297dc656716b803098f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ripley comforts Newt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I nearly put <em>Aliens</em> at the top of this list, which would have sparked some serious conversation. It nearly took the number one spot because, while <em>Alien</em> is a horror masterpiece and perhaps one of the most important movies of all time (its invaluable impact argued expertly by <em>Kotaku</em> managing editor Carolyn Petit on the next page), there’s something incredibly special about a sequel that follows that up by completely flipping the script. <em>Aliens</em> could have been another slow-burn sci-fi horror flick, but instead it offers us a shot of adrenaline straight to the chest.<br></p><p>The 1986 film, directed by James Cameron and starring Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, and Bill Paxton, is high-octane action from the jump, as a group of highly trained soldiers take on the terrifying xenomorphs with Ripley in tow. Brilliant performances from Biehn and Paxton help justify such a large ensemble cast, and the super-powered action propels you through a runtime that is slightly longer than the original with such force you almost feel like you’re out of breath by the end of it.<br></p><p>It is <em>the</em> quintessential ‘80s action movie, but it is so much more than that—some think of it as a stereotypical shooty film, but if you go back and rewatch it today, you’ll be reminded that no one actually fires a weapon until almost an hour in, and the first chunk of the film focuses on Ripley’s attempts to reckon with the fact that she is the sole survivor of the Nostromo, and over 50 years have passed since the traumatizing event. It also calls into question the morality of the military industrial complex and war in general—think about how quickly the hoo-rah soldiers go from confident to terrified. It’s brilliant, and <em>Aliens</em> holds up incredibly well during a modern re-watch. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong><br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5f324f77a666f51b792de4fa9df35b91" data-recommend-id="image://5f324f77a666f51b792de4fa9df35b91" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ripley sits in the cockpit of a spaceship.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The first film in the increasingly expansive <em>Alien </em>saga remains, in my view at least, the very best. Though Ridley Scott’s more recent entries continue to expand the lore of the franchise with varying degrees of success, what remains most compelling to me is what he did so well right at the very beginning. As we meet Ripley, Dallas, Brett, Parker and the rest of the Nostromo crew, what’s immediately foregrounded is the mundane reality of their lives as workers in service of a company that’s already exploiting them for little pay and will gladly screw them over in a heartbeat if it sees profit in it. The alien that stalks the crew and picks them off one by one is chilling, but what really makes it resonate is that larger theme of capitalist fuckery, so economically and efficiently communicated by the wonderful line, “Priority one — Ensure return of organism for analysis. All other considerations secondary. Crew expendable.”<br></p><p>But themes, no matter how well executed, aren’t enough to give a film soul. No, what makes <em>Alien </em>so exceptional is the way its characters are embodied so naturally by its outstanding cast—Sigourney Weaver of course, in a star-making performance, but also folks like Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, and the wonderful Yaphet Kotto—who, as we get to know them in the film’s opening scenes, so well-directed by Scott, interrupt and talk over each other in such a natural, believable way, the sort of thing you rarely see in American cinema after the 1970s. Also, like Spielberg’s <em>Jaws </em>four years before, <em>Alien</em>’s strength so often lies in what remains unseen, left to our imaginations. The Nostromo, more than many movie settings, feels believably lived and worked in, and naturally conducive to giving the xenomorph stalking the hapless crew plenty of places to hide. Later films in the franchise have been more intense, more elaborate, and more expensive, but the tightly focused humanity and horror of the series’ progenitor remains, arguably, the best the series has ever been.<br><strong>— Carolyn Petit</strong></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Developer Creative Assembly's Alien: Isolation is, of course, a stone-cold horror classic, so it only seems right the movie series it's based on would finally get around to paying it some dues. Which is exactly what Fede Álvarez, the director of new movie Alien: Romulus, has done by sneaking in a whole bunch of Isolation-inspired phones.
</p>
<p>
As fans of the sci-fi horror masterpiece will already know, telephones play a prominent role in Alien: Isolation, serving as save points scattered intermittently throughout the nail-biting, Xenomorph-dodging adventure. "In the game," Álvarez told Total Film (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alien-romulus-pays-tribute-to-alien-isolation-with-a-telephone-easter-egg-director-says/">VGC</a>), "every time you knew there's a phone you'd go, 'Fuck, I'm about to go into some bad set-piece.'"
</p>
<p>
And it's in that spirit Álvarez, tipping his hat to Alien: Isolation, elected to plaster emergency telephones all over his new movie, sneaking them into frame like an omen of imminent horrors to come. "It's the same thing here," he continued. "You'll see they're planted strategically throughout the film. When you see the phone, it's like: brace for impact... The movie is set up in a way [that] every time something bad is about to happen, you will see a phone."
</p>
<p>
So yes, steel yourself: spot a phone in the background and Randy Pitchford might be about to jump out and announce an Aliens: Colonial Marines 2.

<p>
And it seems Álvarez - who also directed 2013's Evil Dead reboot and 2016's Don't Breathe - isn't just a man of exceptional taste when it comes to games; early word suggests he's also crafted a fine slice of horror himself with Alien: Romulus. We'll know if it genuinely does halt the movie series' decades-long downward spiral when it arrives in cinemas this Friday, 16th August.

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 may not be released before March 2025, as developers have apparently been told not to expect a launch during the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>GamesIndustry's Chris Ding shared a new update on the console's release today.&nbsp;<span>At around the 1:00 mark of this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-saves-tango-gameworks-and-numbers-all-of-the-numbers-gi-microcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast, he said</a></span>&nbsp;that no developer he has talked to expects the Nintendo Switch 2 to be released this fiscal year because they have been told not to expect it. Some people hope to see an April/May release, but as of now, the system's release window remains unknown.</p>
<p>Such a late release for the Nintendo Switch 2 is definitely worrying, considering the system's silicon has been ready for a long time, and even people at NVIDIA are wondering why <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/">it is taking so long for the console to release</a>. The system was already going to be a little dated with a 2024 release, and things would only be worse with a 2025 release.</p>
<p>If anything, the console launching in the next fiscal year could give the Japanese company more time to produce more units and make it readily available in stores in its launch windows, which is one of its main focuses, as revealed<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-enough-units/"> a while back.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will let you know more about the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

Making games is hard and audiences have never been busier and more fickle. Still, it’s disappointing when you find out that sci-fi shooter or fantasy adventure you’ve been waiting for won’t be out any time soon, and a lot of that disappointment is going around right now, as a bunch of this year’s notable releases have recently slipped to 2025.<br></p><p>The recent retreat into 2025 began with <em>Avowed</em>.

The often-delayed 2.5D retro-futuristic platformer was pushed to next year to “ensure we meet the high standards we’ve set for ourselves,” the development team <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/REPLACEDGame/status/1823374289384489103/photo/1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/REPLACEDGame/status/1823374289384489103/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on Twitter</a></span>. The game will still be playable at Gamescom later this month, but a new release window hasn’t been set yet.</p><p>Not to be left out, <em>Terminator: Survivors</em> snuck in its own delay in August as well. “Over the past few months, we’ve been really impressed by your enthusiasm and amazed by the response to our announcements, and we know how eagerly fans are awaiting<em> Terminator: Survivors</em>,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SurviveTheT800/status/1823011706836029701&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SurviveTheT800/status/1823011706836029701" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read a post</a></span> on Twitter. “To realize our vision, and to make sure to deliver the game that fits your expectations, we need some additional time.” The open-world survival game was supposed to come out in Early Access in October.
