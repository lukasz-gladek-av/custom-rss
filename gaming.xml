            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/card-en-ciel-release-date-gameplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Inti Creates has revealed the release date for upcoming card battler&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel</em>, which essentially looks like a less RPG-ified version of&nbsp;<em>Mega Man Battle Network</em>.</p>

<p>The game is launching in October, and in a new trailer, Inti Creates shows off some&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>gameplay, and it looks...well, a whole lot like&nbsp;<em>Mega Man Battle Network</em>, actually, right down to the grid style and isometric viewpoint.</p>

<p>However, where&nbsp;<em>Battle Network&nbsp;</em>also featured JRPG-style trappings, including an overworld in which you could talk to NPCs and watch the story unfold,&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>looks to be stripping things back for a more roguelite-inspired take on the genre.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/card-en-ciel-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=2sirlSf7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/card-en-ciel-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=mkRs-1Ax 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>is, ahem, "inspired" by&nbsp;<em>Mega Man Battle Network</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>revolves around Neon, a "gaming detective" (yes, that's Inti Creates' actual wording) who must collect and utilize cards to do battle with a range of enemies.</p>

<p>The game will offer more than 10 different dungeons, each of which is full of monsters to fight, cards to collect, and new synergies to find. You can also look forward to special "Muse Cards", which activate special abilities soundtracked by 50 vocal tracks present in the game.</p>

<p>Along the way, you'll also discover the story of Neon and his friends, although it'll be told largely through visual novel-style static scenes rather than overworld exploration, it seems.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>right here if you want to get a sense for what the gameplay is like.</p>




<p><em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>comes to us from Inti Creates, the studio responsible for franchises like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/azure-striker-gunvolt-2-review-its-mega-anime-man">Azure Striker Gunvolt</a>&nbsp;</i>and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blaster-master-zero-2-review-nostalgia-done-right"><em>Blaster Master&nbsp;</em>revivals</a>, as well as, uh, cheesecake-tastic games like&nbsp;<em>Gal Gun</em>.</p>

<p>It looks like the studio is essentially seeking to marry its two great loves in&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel</em>; it's a very&nbsp;<em>Mega Man</em>-esque game with some pretty gratuitous-feeling anime fanservice in it.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>when it launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2730540/CardenCiel/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on October 24th.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/deadlock-footage-leak-characters-world-details/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deadlock-footage-leaks-showing-the-steampunk-world-and-characters-of-valve%E2%80%99s-new-shooter.878397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/deadlock-footage-leak-characters-world-details/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week details emerged that a new hero shooter from Valve, <a href="https://wccftech.com/deadlock-might-be-valves-upcoming-third-person-hero-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entitled Deadlock</a>, had secretly entered alpha testing. Needless to say, a new shooter from Valve is a <em>pretty big deal</em>, and there’s no way those alpha testers aren’t going to keep on leaking things. Case in point, a short clip of the game in action is now in the wild – Valve is trying to pull the footage down, but for now, <a href="https://streamable.com/gjm033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s available here</a>.</p>
<p>As we’ve heard previously, Deadlock is a 6v6 team-based hero shooter, with a little bit of MOBA flavor mixed in as the game’s maps have multiple lanes with floating grapple lines that can be used for quick travel. The new footage shows a player using one of these grapple lines during training mode. We also get a better taste of the game’s BioShock-esque steampunk aesthetics, with various ads for cigarettes and other things adorning the environment.</p>
<p>The footage also provides a peek at Deadlock’s character select screen. At least in alpha, it looks like the roster will consist of 19 characters, which include steampunk-style robots like “Infernus,” more supernatural characters like the bat creature “Ivy,” and multiple highly-stylized human characters. It seems like many of the characters will have some sort of elemental theme – Infernus uses fire, “Kelvin” uses ice, and so on. While we don’t have details about all the characters, the footage hovers over the following heroes, providing us some details.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ivy</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sets up a power duo with a lucky ally</em></li>
<li><em>Ivy has disruptive combat tricks that slow and stun enemies. She's most effective when linking up with an ally, empowering her and her ally's guns as well as sharing heals.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Infernus</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Lights up enemies and watches them burn</em></li>
<li><em>Infernus has many ways to deal damage over time, burning foes before swooping in for the kill. Due to Infernus' blazing speed, his enemies won't be able to escape the flames.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Haze</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sneaks in and sprays bullets</em></li>
<li><em>When Haze fixates on a target she can hold her own in a firefight. She prefers to creates one-sided exchanges, avoiding damage then picking off unsuspecting targets up close.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Grey Talon</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Delivers long-range skill shots</em></li>
<li><em>A cunning predator, Grey Talon uses a combination of deadly accuracy, traps, and clever positioning to bring down the toughest opponents.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Kelvin</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Freezes enemies in their tracks</em></li>
<li><em>Timely heals and splitting a team fight properly is the difference between an easy victory or a ruinous defeat. Gliding around slowing enemies gives Kelvin's team the maneuvering advantage to make this happen.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Lady Geist</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sacrifices health then drains it back.</em></li>
<li><em>Expending health to achieve devastating effects is the source of Lady Geist's power. When running low she can drain the life out of her rivals.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Seven</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Electrocutes crowds of enemies</em></li>
<li><em>Seven thrives in a skirmish waiting for the time to strike. Then he rolls into the fight like a storm and batters his enemies with a cascade of lightning.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Vindicta</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Snipes the unsuspecting</em></li>
<li><em>Vindicta has the mobility to engage at her leisure, picking at her prey and bleeding them out slowly. Injured enemies at any distance should fear being picked off when she is on the map.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Warden</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Weakens his enemies and chases them down</em></li>
<li><em>Warden leads from the front, jumping into the fray and hindering his opponents' ability to fight effectively. But what Warden considers brave, others consider reckless, and if he's not careful he can easily find himself in over his head.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Wraith</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Melts isolated targets</em></li>
<li><em>Excelling at one-on-one combat, Wraith isolates targets, eliminating them with ruthless efficiency, then teleporting away before anyone can retaliate.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Yamato</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Delivers charged attacks with finesse</em></li>
<li><em>Yamato uses precise strikes to decimate her rivals. However, such damaging attacks often will leave her exposed, so she needs to make every shot count.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Deadlock has not been officially announced by Valve yet, and there’s no word on when that may happen. Given the game is in alpha testing, an announcement likely isn’t too far away, although aspects of the game still look a bit rough, so we’ll see.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/make-the-most-of-grahm%E2%80%99s-meat-cook-in-fallout-76.878394/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/make-the-most-of-grahms-meat-cook-in-fallout-76/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Following its rough launch, Fallout 76 turned around to become one of the most entertaining experiences in gaming today. I’ve spent countless hundreds of hours across multiplayer characters enjoying Appalachia, and a big part of that is because of the regular events and community. Now, it’s time for Meat Week! Here’s how to make the most of Grahm’s Meat Cook in Fallout 76!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-grahm-s-meat-cook-in-fallout-76">What is Grahm’s Meat Cook in Fallout 76?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, what the heck is Grahm’s Meat Cook? It’s a seasonal public event that takes place every so often as part of the Meat Week Community Event. During this seasonal event, players will take part in the Primal Cuts Event, which occurs every 15 minutes in there of the five regions across the map. If you take part, you’ll earn items and rewards to help Grahm’s Meat Cook—the second event of the season—succeed!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-grahm-s-meat-cook-start">When Does Grahm’s Meat Cook Start?</h2>



<p>As mentioned, you can take part in Primal Cuts every 15 minutes in three unique zones across Appalachia. As for Grahm’s Meat Cook, it begins on the hour, every hour.</p>



<p>You can find Grahm’s Meat Cook south of Fallout 76 and northwest of the Moonshiner’s Shack. It’s hard to miss, as everything is on fire and glowing. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-to-do-with-prime-meat-in-fallout-76">What to do With Prime Meat in Fallout 76</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Prime Meat is the key ingredient to Meat Week. You’ll accumulate as much as possible before bringing the entire lot to Grahm’s Meat Cook. There, during the secondary event, you’ll unlock Legendary Scrip.</p>



<p>You want Legendary Scrip, as it allows you to purchase Legendary Items and Components from Purveyor Murmrgh. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-prime-meat">How to Get Prime Meat</h2>



<p>To get Prime Meat in Fallout 76, you must take part in Primal Cuts. It appears on the map every 15 minutes in three different zones across the game world, so keep an eye out. Upon completing the community event, you’ll earn Prime Meat as a reward, which you’ll later bring to Grahm’s Meat Cook.</p>



<p>Primal Cuts tasks players with banging a drum in the center of the arena to attract predators. You’ll then fight waves of various creatures, with each wave becoming progressively larger and more challenging. The final wave culminates in a boss fight, which is typically a legendary monster.</p>



<p>Once finished, you’ll earn Prime Meat!</p>

<p>We’re big fans of Fallout 76 here at Insider Gaming, but we also cover a lot more on a daily basis:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/what-should-you-do-with-tomestones-of-poetics-in-final-fantasy-xiv/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-should-you-do-with-tomestones-of-poetics-in-final-fantasy-xiv<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Tomestones of Poetics are a type of currency in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> gained through running a myriad of duties. They’re easy to get, and you’ll frequently find yourself reaching the 2,000 maximum that you can carry. But what do you do with them? Well, you’ve got some options.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">You’ll start to earn Poetics after reaching level 50 in your first Job, and they’re earned by doing basically anything – The Hunt, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-deep-dungeon-how-to-unlock-palace-of-the-dead/">Deep Dungeons</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-ffxiv-raid-unlock-guide-coil-alexander-omega-eden-pandaemonium/">Raids</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-loporrit-tribal-quests-in-ffxiv/">Tribal quests</a>, and even large-scale content such as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-bozjan-southern-front-zadnor-in-ffxiv/">Bozja</a> or Eureka all reward Poetics, as long as they’re from a previous expansion. The only common content I can think of that doesn’t reward Poetics is FATEs.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true">So with that in mind, you’ll very quickly reach the 2,000 maximum Poetics you can hold at any one time. Don’t be like me and exist with them permanently capped, it’s a good idea to spend them on <em>something</em>, but what?&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-augmented-gear" data-injectable="false"><strong>Augmented gear</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true">If you’re leveling alt Jobs, you’ll need to kit them out in the best gear, and this is—without argument—the Augmented gear in each expansion. You purchase Augmented Gear with weekly capped Tomestones for its current expansion, but after a new expansion is released, older gear becomes purchasable through Poetics.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="100" data-current-count="100" data-injectable="false">This gear becomes available to you in stages, only unlocking after you complete a certain MSQ quest:</p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Gear name</strong></td><td><strong>Level</strong></td><td><strong>Expansion</strong></td><td><strong>Unlock quest</strong></td><td><strong>Vendor</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Augmented Ironworks</td><td>50</td><td>A Realm Reborn</td><td>The Ultimate Weapon</td><td>Auriana<br>Mor Dhona<br>(X:22.7, Y:6.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Augmented Shire</td><td>60</td><td>Heavensward</td><td>A Great New Nation</td><td>Bertana<br>Idyllshire<br>(X:5.9, Y:5.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Augmented Scaevan</td><td>70</td><td>Stormblood</td><td>Stormblood</td><td>Enna<br>Rhalgr’s Reach<br>(X:13.9, Y:11.6)</td></tr><tr><td>Augmented Cryptlurker</td><td>80</td><td>Shadowbringers</td><td>Shadowbringers</td><td>Aymark<br>Eulmore(X:10.2, Y:11.8)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false">Once <em>Dawntrail</em> releases on July 2, the current Augmented gear (Credendum) will become available to purchase with Poetics, so there’s not much point running Alliance Raids for coins if you’re still thinking about it.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="70" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">Augmented gear costs a fixed number of poetics, depending on the item:</p> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true"> <li>Weapons (600 Poetics) <ul> <li>Paladin weapons are sold separately, costing 430 Poetics for the Sword and 170 Poetics for the Shield</li> </ul> </li> <li>Helm (355 Poetics)</li> <li>Chest (510 Poetics)</li> <li>Gloves (345 Poetics)</li> <li>Legs (510 Poetics)</li> <li>Feet (345 Poetics)</li> <li>Accessories (280 Poetics)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="99" data-current-count="99" data-injectable="false">To get a full set of Augmented gear for a single Job class, you’ll need a total of <strong>4,065 Poetics</strong>.</p> <h2 id="h-relic-weapons" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic weapons</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="137" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true">If you’re currently working towards either a Zodiac or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-anima-weapons-guide-every-quest-item-and-duty-required-for-heavensward-relic/">Anima relic</a>, then you’re definitely going to need all the Poetics you can get.</p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Both Zodiac and Anima relic weapons require large amounts of Poetics in order to complete a single weapon. Currently, other Relic weapons (Eureka and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-begin-ffxiv-manderville-weapon-quest-endwalker-relic-guide/">Manderville</a>) require no Poetics to complete and Resistance weapons (<em>Shadowbringers</em> relics) require only 1,000 Poetics to get started.</p> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">Here’s how many poetics you’ll need to complete one Relic for Zodiac and Anima weapons, if you only use Poetics to complete the required steps, rather than the alternative options available:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Zodiac</strong> <ul> <li>3,575 Poetics maximum</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Anima</strong> <ul> <li>23,000 Poetics maximum</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id="h-swap-poetics-for-gil-or-grand-company-seals" data-injectable="false"><strong>Swap Poetics for Gil or Grand Company Seals</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="721" data-injectable="true">While purchasing items with Poetics and selling them on the Marketboard certainly isn’t going to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-make-gil-without-crafting-in-final-fantasy-xiv/">make you rich</a>, it is a solid way to use those Poetics if you’ve got nothing else to do with them. The items worth the most are always changing, but you can use resources such as <a href="https://universalis.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universalis</a> to check how much items are currently selling for.</p>
 <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="312" data-injectable="false">If you want some <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-grand-company-guide-how-and-which-to-join/">GC Seals</a>, the best method to do this is by purchasing the highest level of Augmented Shield available (at this time, that’s Cryptlurker), then turning them over to the GC. With these Seals, you can buy items that sell for a profit on the Marketboard, or take your chances with Materiel Crates.</p> <h2 id="h-increase-your-desynthesis-levels" data-injectable="false"><strong>Increase your Desynthesis levels</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">This is a bit of an obscure option, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t an option.

<p data-characters="195" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Keeping your parties at maximum efficiency isn’t always easy, and with lots of characters to pick from in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, you may want to have a little advice on where the real power lies.</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">Now, tier lists are not easy, so feel free to read through the multiple disclaimers I always put on advice like this before you get to the meat of the article. I’ll break the characters into three main battlefield roles and let you know where I think they lie in the pantheon of power in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-wuthering-waves-character-tier-list" data-injectable="false">Wuthering Waves character tier list</h2> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">Okay, let’s get down to it. Tier Lists are hard because characters have more nuance than just their primary function. Oftentimes, it is combinations of characters that will really take each other to the next level, or perhaps items or weapons can give them a new lease on life. For simplicity’s sake, this Tier List is judging the character kits alone. </p>
 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">We will be doing individual guides for the characters that detail weapons to use, Echoes to use, and team comps to really take advantage of them, but that is way too complicated to take into account here. So, this is really just about the basic kit for each character rather than their potential upper limit if you get perfect weapons.</p> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">The final thing to note is that a lot can change at launch. Some characters will be getting buffs or kit changes, so we will take that into account when we come back to this for an update. There is also a degree of theory crafting involved in these lists, so they will constantly be updated as we explore more of the game or discover some exciting nuance of a character.</p>
 <p data-characters="665" data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true">Ultimately, I advise you to treat this Tier List as it is intended, which is as a rough benchmark of a character’s power within their role only. I’ve limited each character to one role. I’m aware this is not the approach many folks take, but I tend to assume people are looking at these lists to decide where to invest their resources. If you are considering Yinlin as a main DPS, and she is not on that list, it is because I do not think she is a good option compared to other potential characters. The character I have broken this rule for is Rover, as everyone will have them and be trying to build their team around them, one way or the other.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Main DPS Tier List</h3> <figure data-found-rows="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Character</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>S</td><td>Calcharo (Electro), Danjin (Havoc), Jiyan (Aero)</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>Chixia (Fusion), Encore (Fusion), Lingyang (Glacio)</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>Rover (Spectro)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arctic-eggs-is-a-beautiful-game-about-flipping-eggs-at-the-end-of-the-world.878379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/arctic-eggs-cooking-eggs-retro-egg-flipping-simulator-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is a recurring question in <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, asked by several characters, and repeated almost like a koan: “Do you think you can you fry eggs on top of Mount Everest?” Sometimes the answer is practical, discussing the thermodynamics of the act. Other times the answer is social or existential, addressing the potential motivations behind someone attempting the act. But uniformly the responses are cryptic, haunting, and hilarious, which are not descriptors you would anticipate about a game whose primary verb is frying eggs.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>A balanced breakfast. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p><em>Arctic Eggs</em> is a low-poly, sci-fi cooking simulator. I would throw in the term cyberpunk as well, but in the original bleak sense of the genre, as the last few years have not been too kind to that descriptor. The backdrop is Antarctica in 2091, in a dire city that looks almost post-Soviet. Following your attempted escape from this place, the ruler of the area, known as The Saint Of Six Stomachs, had stripped you of your main functions, reducing you to a “Poultry Peddler” whose only abilities are to walk and cook. You may be granted your freedom, but only if you cook your way to the top, feeding 27 hungry people and potentially gaining an audience with the Saint themselves.</p><figure><figcaption>Moments of kindness. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p><em>Arctic Eggs </em>is a fairly simple game mechanically. You control a frying pan, a low poly version of a T-fal that you may own now, because nonstick pans disintegrate after 2-3 years so it doesn’t make sense to buy anything but the budget option. You tilt the pan back and forth by moving the mouse, and increase or decrease the sensitivity with the mouse scroll. Heat is generated by moving the pan, and you must cook items evenly on all sides by flipping them with a quick wrist flick.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>My boy can work a grill. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p>The game starts you off with eggs, but as you progress between hungry people, new food and non-food items are introduced, each with their own challenging behaviors, from pufferfish that behave like living basketballs to cigarettes that act like slowly burning timers and are added exclusively for flavor. As far as I can tell, this is one of the few games that makes you cook eggs alongside live rifle rounds. The game has multiple difficulty settings, but the only difference is the depth of the pan’s lip, with a wok being easy, and a crepe pan being hard.</p><figure><figcaption>This is more or less how I feel all the time. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p>Different meals are requested by different NPCs, and this is where the mood and writing in <em>Arctic Eggs </em>shines. Each of the character models is rendered with rough and undulating skin, like you’re playing a PC game from 1999 while dosed substantially. It’s deep fried <em>Deus Ex</em>. The characters themselves speak in beguiling and brusque language, oftentimes with intentional and self-correcting typos. I found myself laughing hysterically multiple times less because of jokes and more because of how sentences are phrased.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>That's so sweet of you. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p>The topics are broad. A man expresses regrets wasting his 20s raising a stingray. Another espouses the benefits of drinking early because it’s good to get your crying done before it’s dark.&nbsp; Some motifs repeat, like flamingos, dolphins, cigarettes, and having a Polish girlfriend. And then you get these beautiful, eerie moments of sadness and ennui. In one scene, a fisherman describes how his son is slowly replacing every organ in his body mechanically. He does not dwell over the loss of self, as he can recognize his son despite being mechanically replaced as well, but he is spending his remaining days savoring food because they’re taking his tongue next.</p><p>There are many games that <em>Arctic Eggs</em> reminds me of, but only in its parts. It is funny and abrasive like <em>Cruelty Squad</em>, features haunting vignettes with characters like <em>NieR: Automata</em>, and it’s mechanically absurd like <em>QWOP </em>or <em>Katamari Damacy</em>. But to the game’s credit, none of those comparisons alone capture the totality. Like the taste of an egg, a fish, and a cigarette fried in the same pan, <em>Arctic Eggs </em>has an unforgettable flavor unlike anything else. And it achieves this by sandwiching slivers of absurdity and sadness between slabs of the most absurd gameplay possible. These little scenes, unconcerned with how they would break the larger reality of the world they populate, are more affecting than writing in much larger games, in part because they are cryptic and leave the player to stew in their potential significance.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Egg question. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p>Can you fry eggs on top of Mount Everest? The game has an answer, but I can’t claim to know personally. I do know that it’s a funny thing to think about for a few hours, a terse hypothetical and a wonderful starting off point to one of the funniest and most memorable indie games I’ve played this year. And that’s high praise indeed given the <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-games-pc-2024-may-hades-2-little-kitty-1000xresist-manor-lords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">competition</a>.</p><p><em>Arctic Eggs </em>is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2763670/Arctic_Eggs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available now on Steam</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/f1-24-preview-%E2%80%93-hands-on-the-dynamic-handling-circuit-updates-career.878361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/22/f1-24-preview-hands-on-the-dynamic-handling-circuit-updates-career/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The last couple of races have given Formula 1 fans a fresh injection of high octane excitement, with Max Verstappen and Red Bull’s inevitability suddenly in doubt thanks to a resurgent McLaren at the hands of Lando Norris. Throw a healthy step forward for Ferrari, and it this could turn into a very fun season to watch. You know what else is fun? Video games, and Codemasters will be glad of the real sport’s entertainment to drum up interest for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/f1-24">F1 24</a>, which is shaping up to be another big step forward for their motorsports series.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 24 First Look at Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKbpm3LQppU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once again, Codemasters has committed to making some significant changes to the game’s simulation and physics modelling. Coming under the capitalise branding of Dynamic Handling – something shared with last year’s excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/ea-sports-wrc-review/">WRC</a> – there’s a new suspension kinematic system that will more accurately represent how cars move around under the massive aerodynamic loads, modelling of how tyres heat up, improved aerodynamics modelling and more.</p>


<p>It’s difficult to truly quantify how meaningful the all-new suspension model is, but without any tweaking it presents a more challenging drive than F1 23, feeling twitchier and more abrupt than its predecessor. There’s a raft of options though to tailor the handling to your personal preferences, and I was able to dial it in to a point that felt comfortable and responsive.</p>


<p>Alongside the handling, there’s been several updates made to the accuracy of each track, but in particular the development team has focused on fan favourites Silverstone and Spa-Francorchamps, as well as giving recent additions Losail and Jeddah another pass, adding extra detail to both the track elements, and the wider setting. You can see this in Saudi Arabia with the arrival of the vibrant colours of the track limits and cut-off areas, making it feel closer than ever to the real thing.</p>
<p>That commitment to replicating the real thing extends this year to the inclusion of speech from each driver, so you can hear Daniel Riccardo’s downbeat response to Lance Stroll causing yet another pile-up, or Lando Norris congratulating his team on their work. Codemasters has been able to draw from broadcast archives for these soundbites, but don’t expect hours of additional dialogue.</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, be prepared to hear the same lines time and time again, and it’s a bit disappointing not to hear them respond mid-race to events that are playing out. It’s an improvement, but an undercooked one. However, your created player can gain additional speech options via the in-game shop, or more can be unlocked via the in-game VIP pass – a premium battle pass for the game which is included if you buy the more-expensive Champions Edition.</p>
<p>What doesn’t feel realistic is the way the game treats its wider simulation, and F1 24 can certainly spit out some very odd results. We’re not just talking about the occasional car failing or crashing out, but races where a driver can have won, despite suffering significant damage earlier on in the session.</p>

<p>As it stands, there are also some oddities to the more… impactful physics model. While the way rogue wheels behave has always caused some issues, they look particularly weird here. It’s a shame that a high-force crash doesn’t result in a realistic-looking wreck, and while the aim of the game is clearly not to crash, it definitely happens with enough regularity that you’ll witness some very odd physics at play.</p>
<p>The visuals have been given a good scrub-up for 2024, and many of the tracks look better than they ever have. One of my personal favourites, Monaco, just looks that much more eye-catching than it did last year, and that’s gratifying after 12 months with the previous game. Foliage, hoardings and track furniture are fuller, more detailed and just nicer to look at, and at this early stage in our F1 24 career it’s pretty enough to be distracting at times. Luckily, you can still rewind your mistakes.</p>
<p>As part of those visual improvements, the drivers themselves look genuinely phenomenal. If you compare them to the previous year’s versions, the improvements are deeply impressive, with revised skin, hair and facial detail ensuring that it feels as though you’re part of the Formula 1 world.</p>

<p>While the current raft of drivers are stars in their own right – particularly after Drive to Survive has made them household names, even in households that don’t like F1 – one of my favourite additions is the ability to take legendary drivers like Nigel Mansell and Ayrton Senna into the career mode. While F1 23 allowed you to choose a number of iconic racers as your teammate for the season, now you can play through a further career with them, perhaps returning them to the spotlight after many years away from the grid.</p>
<p>F1 24 brings VR support to PC players, but PSVR 2 will miss out once again this year, which is disappointing given that it’s the most accessible route into home VR. I really hope that this is an update that PS5 owners can look forward to, but there’s no word on that becoming a reality.</p>
<p>Thus far, PC performance is impressively smooth, with my GeForce 3070-equipped rig sitting right on the Recommended specifications. We were able to run nearly everything at ultra-high graphic settings while maintaining a framerate over 100 FPS, and even in the early review build all of the external options and menus operated exactly as you’d hope. One of the clear improvements is the cinematic view, and replays look and perform more realistically than ever before.</p>
<p>If you’re ready for a new season of Formula 1, F1 24 is already shaping up to be a clear step up from its predecessor, bringing smart changes and improvements to what was already an enveloping driving experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mattel-outright-games-partnership<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Barbie&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Matchbox&nbsp;</em>company Mattel has announced a partnership with Outright Games, which is apparently a "leading publisher" of family-friendly games.</p>

<p>According to a press release, Mattel is looking for "top-tier" studios with which to work on video game adaptations of some of its most beloved IPs, and to that end, the toy giant has apparently settled on&nbsp;<em>Bluey: The Videogame&nbsp;</em>developer Outright.</p>

<p>In said press release, Outright's Stephanie Malham says her studio prides itself on expanding major IPs into "cherished video games", which <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/15882/bluey-the-videogame" rel="noopener" target="_blank">feels</a> just a <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/14459/peppa-pig-world-adventures" rel="noopener" target="_blank">touch</a> like an <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/13427/dc-league-of-super-pets-the-adventures-of-krypto-and-ace" rel="noopener" target="_blank">overstatement</a> to me, but hey.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mattel-outright-games-dc-league-of-super-pets.jpg?itok=sbv5Jtzs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mattel-outright-games-dc-league-of-super-pets.jpg?itok=U0Fa54Jm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Outright Games is best known for "cherished" titles like&nbsp;<em>DC League of Super-Pets: The Adventures of Krypto and Ace</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Together, Mattel and Outright are working on three major projects based on Mattel IPs, and all three of them are set to launch on PC and consoles before the end of 2024.</p>

<p>Those games are&nbsp;<em>Matchbox Driving Adventures</em>, <i>Monster High: Skulltimate Secrets</i>, and&nbsp;<em>Barbie Project Friendship</em>. No prizes for guessing which Mattel IPs they'll all be based on.</p>

<p>According to the aforementioned press release,&nbsp;<em>Matchbox Driving Adventures&nbsp;</em>will offer "high-speed competitive driving adventures", while&nbsp;<em>Barbie&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster High&nbsp;</em>will provide "stories that emphasize teamwork and foster friendship".</p>

<p>Whether or not that means the latter two will be primarily co-op focused remains to be seen, but more information will be available in the coming months. Better get those tenterhooks ready.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-mattel.jpg?itok=5YWQ9_Pp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-mattel.jpg?itok=YVyXxnz1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mattel is already well-known in the gaming space thanks to games like&nbsp;<em>Hot Wheels Unleashed</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time Outright has teamed up with a well-known company whose products are largely intended for kids. All the way <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outright-games-partners-with-crayola-for-unnamed-upcoming-games">back in 2018</a>, Outright teamed up with Crayola for the&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk</em>-esque&nbsp;<em>Crayola Scoot</em>, which is presumably <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/6754/crayola-scoot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another one of the publisher's "cherished" titles</a>.</p>

<p>Mattel is also already pretty well-represented in the gaming space thanks to titles like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-into-high-gear">Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 - Turbocharged</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-barbie-collab"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Barbie</em>-themed content</a>, although Outright isn't involved with either of these, naturally.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what this collaboration yields, but I'm sure the three games outlined by the two companies will be all-time classics. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/22/24162373/super-mario-maker-builder-64-rom-hack-nintendo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18758773/super-mario-maker-2-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Maker</em> series</a> of games lets you create your own sidescrolling platformer levels using sprites and 3D objects from several entries in the franchise. It’s created a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24127340/super-mario-maker-nintendo-wii-u-shutdown">deeply devoted fan base</a>, but it’s only ever let you make sidescrolling levels. Now, a pair of fans have changed that with <a href="https://romhacking.com/hack/mario-builder-64">Mario Builder 64</a>, a new way to make and play your own <em>Super Mario 64</em> levels — and do so on Nintendo 64 hardware. </p><p>It’s technically a ROM hack, but the term doesn’t really capture what this is. The developers, <a href="https://romhacking.com/user/Arthurtilly">Arthurtilly</a> and <a href="https://romhacking.com/user/rovertronic">rovertronic</a>, describe it as “a toolbox letting you fulfill all of your SM64 dreams.” Just like the <em>Super Mario Maker</em> series, it lets you create your own levels using a special creator interface that borrows a lot from <em>Minecraft, </em>giving you low-res textured (this is the N64 after all) cubes that you can drop in place. </p><p>You can also decide what music you want, place items and villains, and even play with <em>Mario 64 </em>conventions. For instance, there’s no hard limit on how many red coins you can require players to collect to get a star. </p><p>To use it, you have to patch a <em>Mario 64</em> ROM file yourself. The developers have a <a href="https://rentry.co/mb64-setup-guide">guide for doing so</a> (in addition to the video above), and you’ll need an emulator or an actual Nintendo 64 to play the game with the Builder 64 modifications in place. As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-super-mario-64-mod-may-be-as-close-as-we-ever-get-to-mario-maker-3d-204024562.html?src=rss"><em>Engadget</em> points out</a>, you can do that with a flashcart that supports SD cards — several options are listed in the guide linked above.</p><p>I haven’t been able to play around with Mario Builder 64 just yet, but I’m eager to do so as soon as life affords me the time. It looks like a blast, judging by <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_UnDcfx1Dn4">this video</a> from the Good Vibes Gaming YouTube channel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161985/tom-king-archie-comic-decision-bettie-veronica<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="KUKiZC">Archie’s been putting his tough choices off for too long. It’s finally time for Riverdale’s favorite son to decide between Betty and Veronica, and thankfully he’ll have a special guest writer to help make sure things go smoothly. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22824979/best-dc-comics-2021-rorschach-watchmen-tom-king">Legendary comic scribe Tom King</a>, along with artist Dan Parent, will step in for a full-length one-shot called <em>Archie: The Decision</em>, in which Archie finally makes his choice. </p>
<p id="MRp3g0">As you might expect for such a landmark moment in Riverdale’s history, <em>The Decision</em> will feature many of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23824779/archie-comics-danni-malloy-trans-representation">Archie Comics’</a> fan-favorite characters, from Josie and the Pussycats to Sabrina the Teenage Witch, all reacting to the decision and sharing their thoughts. </p>
<p id="wsRNjw"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/2/6/18186853/mister-miracle-5-explained-tom-king">King</a>’s reputation as a writer of the biggest, thinkiest superhero comics of the last decade tends to overshadow the consistent humor in his books. The writer of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/20/22240734/wandavision-comics-vision-scarlet-witch-marriage-explained"><em>The Vision</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2016/12/29/14093714/rogue-one-comic-omega-men"><em>Omega Men</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/2/6/18186853/mister-miracle-5-explained-tom-king"><em>Mister Miracle</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/12/19/21028752/batman-85-tom-king-final-issue-joker-dc-comics"><em>Batman</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/7/26/22591012/new-supergirl-superman-comics-tom-king-dc"><em>Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow</em></a> seems excited to fully embrace Archie-style comedy. </p>
<p id="7ZAYPA">“As a massive Archie fan, this is just a pure joy project for me,” King told Polygon via email. “I wanted to do something zany and cool and screwball and hysterical and gorgeous and harebrained and maybe a little tiny itty-bitty bit profound as a tribute to my Golden and Silver Age Archie heroes — people like Dan DeCarlo, Harry Lucey, Bob Bolling, Bob Montana, and Samm Schwartz. And who better to do that with than the modern Archie maestro, Dan Parent, who inherited and brilliantly carried on the legacy of those giants. [<em>The Decision</em>] is an epic, riotous story featuring scores of Archie characters where Dan and I wrestle with the greatest dilemma in the near 85-year history of comics: Betty or Veronica!? I’m not sure we can solve it, but, like all of Riverdale, we’re going to have a ton of fun trying.”</p>
<p id="EvCoz6"><em>Archie: The Decision</em> hits shelves on Aug. 28, clocking in at a full 32 all-ages pages. Archie Comics has shared a sneak peek of the issue with Polygon, including a variant cover by Stephen Byrne and one page of the book itself, that you can check out below:</p>

<p>With the success of Helldivers 2, Arrowhead Games Studios has some big new aspirations. In a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-game-studios-appoints-new-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former CEO, now Chief Creative Officer,</a> Johan Pilestedt said that the studio wants to become the next major studio like Blizzard of FromSoftware. </p>



<p>“We pride ourselves on being an independent studio,” he told the outlet when talking about making the games they want. “We have to see what the future holds, but there’s nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody.</p>



<p>“I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realize that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard.”</p>



<p>How that looks, exactly, isn’t clear because it’s not something that happens overnight. Even with the fast rise of Helldivers 2, new CEO Shams Jorjani says he knows there is work to be done, but that he doesn’t want the company to lose focus of why they do what they do.</p>



<p>“We will see growth, but growth as a means to an ends, not as an end itself,” Jorjani said. “We don’t have plans to go public. None of those shenanigans. Measured growth that allows us to make amazing game and be a good place to work.</p>



<p>“We don’t run the business for monetary gain,” Pilestedt said. “The humbleness and the desire to just make great games is the only reason we exist.”</p>

<p>Countless players worldwide didn’t upgrade their last-gen systems to the current-gen, most likely due to the rising cost of console hardware. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X remain costly, and the exclusives aren’t up to snuff, so why upgrade? If you’re one of the many playing on an old system, you still don’t want to miss out. So, can you play XDefiant on Xbox One?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-xdefiant-on-xbox-one">Is XDefiant on Xbox One?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, you cannot play XDefiant on Xbox One. Despite being a free-to-play game that one would imagine Ubisoft wants everywhere all at once, the arena shooter is only available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>That said if you have a PC—not even a top-of-the-line system—you can likely play XDefiant. The overall system requirements, especially the minimum and recommended, are welcoming to most players. To enjoy the free-to-play shooter on PC, download Ubisoft Connect, visit the store page, and add the game to your account. You may then download and install it via your game library and hop into the game!</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-xdefiant-free-on-xbox">Can You Play XDefiant Free on Xbox?</h2>



<p>While you can’t play XDefiant on Xbox One, you can play free on Xbox Series X|S. You can play XDefiant free on all its supported systems: PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It’s a completely free-to-play arena shooter, though it does have microtransactions, that you can download and enjoy without paying a dime.</p>



<p>On Xbox Series X|S, visit the Xbox Store, search for XDefiant, and add the game to your account to start downloading. Once finished, boot up the game and enjoy!</p>



<hr>



<p>XDefiant is taking the gaming world by storm, which is a pleasant surprise. But does it have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-xdefiant-have-search-and-destroy-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Search and Destroy</a>?

Now, according to former Arrowhead CEO and now Arrowhead Chief Creative Officer Johan Pilestedt, bigger success means bigger toxicity.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Helldivers 2 Polar Patriots Premium Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>"The big difference now, which is horrifying, is the amount of threats and rude behavior that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community," Pilestedt told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "That’s something new we have to deal with."</p><p>When Helldivers 2 launched it faced significant server issues that made the game unplayable for many, sparking an initial backlash. But since that issue was largely resolved, Arrowhead has faced complaints about everything from weapon balance to low impact Premium Warbonds. But by far the biggest backlash was sparked by Sony’s controversial decision to force PC gamers to link to a PlayStation Network account to play. Sony eventually reversed its decision, but not before a review-bombing campaign savaged Helldivers 2 on Steam. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-to-revert-patrol-and-spawn-rate-changes-admits-psn-controversy-diverted-studios-attention">Arrowhead community managers have said the PSN backlash caused staff to lose a week simply having to deal with the fallout</a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The big difference now, which is horrifying, is the amount of threats and rude behavior that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community.</p></div><p>That’s plenty to contend with in just a few months post-launch. But Pilestedt suggested the way Helldivers 2 was designed, with frustration deliberately in place to craft the co-op experience hardcore players fully understand and appreciate, may also fuel toxicity from the wider playerbase. “If you don't have those lows, you can't get those highs,” Pilestedt said.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs">New Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani</a> added: "Arrowhead’s philosophy has always been 'a game for everyone is a game for no-one.' That is the company slogan. It’s how our games are designed. You can feel it in every feature. I think it’s one of the big reasons that Helldivers 2 has been so successful. It feels fresh because it does a lot of unpopular stuff.</p><p>"When you hit this big, much bigger than anyone thought – Sony, us, everyone – what happens is the game finds an audience outside of that niche fan group. So you get this amplification of different voices. Almost all games have a bit of toxicity in the community, but with these big numbers you just get so many, so we need to work with the community to get them to self-moderate, give people the tools to speak with each other in a positive fashion, so we can keep talking to the players openly. The more voices being added to the choir does add complexity."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The more voices being added to the choir does add complexity.</p></div><p>Jorjani said that Arrowhead is currently “learning painfully” how to create systems to deal with this level of toxicity, but the work will benefit the studio’s “next thing, whatever that may be.”</p><p>Arrowhead isn’t the first developer to call out toxicity within video game communities. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-dev-calls-out-growing-tendency-of-toxicity-in-its-community">Cities: Skylines 2 developer Colossal Order asked players to help create a more positive environment after noticing “a growing tendency of toxicity” in its community</a>.</p><p>As for Helldivers 2, Arrowhead is full steam ahead on adding content to its live service, although <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-it-will-take-more-time-with-patches-to-maintain-the-quality-standard-we-want-and-you-deserve">it has indicated plans to slow down the frequency of patch releases</a> to make sure it gets them right.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Now, Johan Pilestedt, who was Arrowhead CEO, becomes Chief Creative Officer. In a tweet, Pilestedt said this means he will get to focus more on the studio’s games as well as its community.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey everyone,</p><p>Big update, I've decided to hire <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ShamsJorjani</a> as the new CEO of <a href="https://twitter.com/ArrowheadGS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ArrowheadGS</a>! We go way back and I wouldn't trust the business in any other hands than his.

Jorjani now takes on the day-to-day running of the business. In a tweet, Jorjani said he was “humbled and excited to get to work with such talented nerds (again!).” Pilestedt remains Arrowhead chairman amid the reshuffle.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Shams Jorjani (@ShamsJorjani) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1793267715756458049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The shakeup at the top of Arrowhead comes after a particularly difficult time for the developer, which butted heads with Helldivers 2 publisher and IP owner Sony over the PSN account requirement backlash. Sony eventually reversed its decision, but the game remains unavailable in countries where PSN is not live.</p><p>Arrowhead has also indicated it wants to spend more time focusing on things like patches and weapon balance after community complaints around nerfs and low impact Premium Warbonds. Just this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-it-will-take-more-time-with-patches-to-maintain-the-quality-standard-we-want-and-you-deserve">Arrowhead said it was pumping out balance patches too fast</a>, and wanted to slow the live service down a bit.</p><p>In a subsequent <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1793268430734340405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Pilestedt explained his decision to step down as CEO further: “Not nearly done. But I care more about weapon balance than QBRs [Quarterly Business Reviews].”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I care more about weapon balance than QBRs.</p></div><p>Helldivers 2 is an astonishing success story for Arrowhead and PlayStation, and it seems likely the live service aspect of the game will continue to develop over many years.

                <p>The Philippines-based Polychroma Games is set to release the narrative adventure game Until Then later this year. It follows a young teenager named Mark in the Philippines as he goes through the trials and tribulations of high-school life, such as hitting deadlines and making presentations. However, people from his life start disappearing and his memories become unreliable, meaning it's up to him to check up with his friends to untangle the mystery surrounding his memories. Until Then explores the lives of Filipino students through its gorgeous pixel-art style and how themes like communication and friendship are so integral to Filipino culture.</p><p>Slice-of-life, coming-of-age stories that depict daily school lives are incredibly popular in Asian media, especially in video games. The most prominent example is the Persona series, which is set in Japan. Until Then follows similar footsteps with Mark. "It's the same with the Philippines as well," Polychroma Games senior environmental artist Pia Demanawa tells GameSpot. "This is the part that we romanticize the most, because we feel furthest away from adult responsibilities here, and we can just mess around with our friends."</p><p>Director Mickole Klein Nulud adds that academics and achievements play a big part in many of Asia's youth, saying, "We spend a lot of our time in youth here and, as a result, end up making it a stage for interesting things to happen in stories, both good and bad."</p><p>Until Then also features many nuances of Filipino culture within its themes. Demanawa says that communication is the most important theme in Until Then. In Filipino culture, there's a word, "torpe," which describes a person who doesn't show their feelings towards someone they like. Throughout the game, Mark shows some interest in a few girls, and things sometimes don’t go his way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQQgY2fVTOY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PQQgY2fVTOY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>What exemplifies the concept of torpe more than unrequited teenage love? "Because the characters don't open up with each other, they end up misunderstanding and assuming a lot of things about each other," Demanawa explains. "That threatens and breaks apart the relationships that they have, and in the end, they can only really strengthen their bonds as friends."</p><p>Until Then is presented in a 2.5D pixel-art style, similar to other Southeast Asian-developed games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/chinatown-detective-agency-review-carmen-singapore/1900-6417856/" data-ref-id="1900-6417856">Chinatown Detective Agency</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/a-space-for-the-unbound-launch-trailer/2300-6460495/" data-ref-id="2300-6460495">A Space for the Unbound</a>. He says that he enjoyed the pixel-art style and thought that having an eye-catching visual style was important for the game. Nulud also specifically cites the cinematic platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/612400/The_Last_Night/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Last Night</a> as an inspiration.</p><p>Nulud says that one of the biggest challenges in developing the game was the sheer number of sprites that needed to be managed. There are tens of thousands of PNG files from all character animations combined just to make the faces of the 2D characters' faces expressive.</p><p>"In scenes, we manually change each characters' facial expressions almost line by line in addition to perfecting the timing of delivery and pauses," he says. "I find it a little funny because, as the director, I am literally directing how these characters act as if they were real people."</p><p>Demanawa adds that the character sprites started with the same number of pixels as their backgrounds. However, the pixel density of the sprites was later increased in order to emphasize the characters' mannerisms. They explain, "This would allow us to have more real estate with poses and expressions, which is necessary to really let the characters' unique identities shine through."</p><p>The game also has many inspirations and references from real-life places in the Philippines. In the beginning of the game, Mark rides the train station to school, which is modeled after the real-life Katipunan station and LRT-2, a transit line in Metro Manila. The Quezon Memorial Circle also shows up in-game briefly, and Mark's school--the fictional Liamson Integrated School--is based off of Nulud's real-life alma mater, Rizal National Science High School.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304473-liamsonintegratedschool.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304473" data-ratio="0.56225528582616" data-width="1277" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304473-liamsonintegratedschool.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304473"></a><figcaption>Until Then</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304473-liamsonintegratedschool.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304474-pixelrenderingguide.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304475-quezonmemorialcirclebyjoshuakyleonunsplash.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304476-quezonmemorialcircle.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304477-spriteaaartstyleprogression.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304478-ss_7a6b9d48d8d4d993560c9bc44bb3c02ceca52c3f.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304479-ss_8403d06de2c801d99bc743c105cd6ef049743d60.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4304474,1300-4304475,1300-4304476,1300-4304477,1300-4304478,1300-4304479" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304474-pixelrenderingguide.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304475-quezonmemorialcirclebyjoshuakyleonunsplash.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304476-quezonmemorialcircle.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304477-spriteaaartstyleprogression.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304478-ss_7a6b9d48d8d4d993560c9bc44bb3c02ceca52c3f.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4304479-ss_8403d06de2c801d99bc743c105cd6ef049743d60.1920x1080.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304474-pixelrenderingguide.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304475-quezonmemorialcirclebyjoshuakyleonunsplash.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304476-quezonmemorialcircle.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304477-spriteaaartstyleprogression.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304478-ss_7a6b9d48d8d4d993560c9bc44bb3c02ceca52c3f.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4304479-ss_8403d06de2c801d99bc743c105cd6ef049743d60.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>Nulud says, "If it's not any particular place, we take general inspiration from the houses you'd find in the streets, Filipino architecture, and so on."</p><p>Until Then's development started during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dmanawa says that the team couldn't physically visit places for inspiration, so they had to rely on things like Google Earth and their own memories in order to recreate them. While the locations in Until Then aren't pulled straight from real life, they're the result of amalgamations that the team brainstormed together.</p><p>There were also inspirations from anime and movies as well, and Nulud's taste in film and anime changed throughout the game's four-year development cycle. At the beginning, Until Then's story aspirations were inspired by Naoshi Arakawa's Your Lie in April and Makoto Shinkai's work. However, as development continued, more artful and slower films such as ones by Ryusuke Hamaguchi took a stronger hold on his influences.</p><p>"Now I know we can't just do a 180 and change the story's fundamentals in response to new inspiration," he explains. "We have to strike a certain balance, and indeed, there are times where this side of our influences shows and those are my favorite moments in the game."</p><p>Nulud also notes that human relationships and communication are some of his favorite ideas to tackle, saying, "As for how they're reflected in the game, it's best that players find out for themselves in this beautiful, cathartic journey we crafted."</p><p>Until Then will launch for PS5 and PC later this year--it had been due out on May 23, only to be delayed by a few weeks, with no new date set yet. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574820/Until_Then/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A demo is available on Steam</a>.</p>

                <p>The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt has a number of projects in the works, including a new IP in the works under the codename Hadar. Maria Mazur, a quest designer on Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty expansion, told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-3-and-cyberpunk-2077-studio-dev-thinks-it-only-makes-sense-for-cd-projekt-red-to-make-a-new-ip-that-comes-straight-from-us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that it "only makes sense" for the Polish game studio to branch out and make something brand-new. Mazur also debunked a rumor about the new IP.</p><p>"I feel like it only makes sense given how many kinds of people we have on this, like the storytelling side of things but also our artists," Mazur said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/22/hunt-showdowns-new-gen-console-update-arrives-in-august-rendering-last-gen-versions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown’s new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.</p>

<p>That means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game.&nbsp;Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0lAW63LTYo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>In addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="311" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been putting off your <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-prepare-for-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> preparations</a> until now, it’s time to put things into high gear at long last. Notably, Bungie’s just announced that <em>all</em> of the game’s Brave weapons now drop at substantially higher rates, giving you a better shot at farming them.</p> <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">For those who aren’t in the know, Brave weapons are the snazzy new kit that’s been added to the game as part of the free <em>Into the Light</em> interim DLC, which has successfully served its role as a lead-up to <em>The Final Shape</em>. Now, with just a few weeks to go before the hotly anticipated DLC launches, Bungie has bumped up the overall drop rates for all the featured Brave weapons <a href="https://reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cxczmt/brave_weapon_rewards_increased/l52ikg4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by a fair margin</a>, according to the community.</p>
 <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">Now, do note that nobody is quite sure <em>how much</em> Bungie has increased the drop rates, with <a href="https://reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cxczmt/brave_weapon_rewards_increased/l53tc9a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some claiming that it’s only the Brave tokens</a> that are more common. The evidence <a href="https://reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cxczmt/brave_weapon_rewards_increased/l52qo6b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">goes both ways</a> so far, but one thing’s for sure: it’s worth spending some time in <em>Destiny 2</em> if you want to fill out your inventory with solid gear ahead of <em>The Final Shape</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-don-t-let-the-fomo-get-you-but-do-grab-brave-weapons-while-you-still-can" data-injectable="false">Don’t let the FOMO get you, but do grab Brave weapons while you still can</h2> <p data-characters="547" data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true">This is particularly important because, even though the Brave weapon set itself <em>is</em> sticking around after <em>The Final Shape</em> comes out, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-shiny-destiny-2-into-the-light-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the awesome Shiny Brave weapons</a> are <em>not</em> going to be accessible anymore. Likely ever, considering Bungie’s stance on exclusive ‘you had to be there’ cosmetics. And, since the announcement specifically points out that you may also want to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-into-the-light-brings-back-fan-favorite-superblack-shader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grab the Superblack shader</a> while it’s still around, it’s entirely possible that it, too, will be effectively sunset after <em>The Final Shape</em> comes out.</p>
 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">That’s just how it goes in <em>Destiny</em> land, I suppose. A similar fate is about to befall <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/did-you-know-destiny-2-is-probably-going-to-sunset-fishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fishing mini-game</a> too, though I’d be hard-pressed to say that it’s even remotely as enticing or important as the Pantheon, Brave gear, and other such goodies.</p> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="662" data-injectable="true">If you don’t really care all that much about any of these items, then simply waiting until <em>The Final Shape</em> comes out proper is obviously the way to go. The DLC is due to come out on June 4, and its patch notes are so massive that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shapes-patch-notes-are-so-big-that-bungies-splitting-them-across-three-previews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie’s had to split them across three <em>massive</em> preview blogs</a> just to stay on top of them all. That’s pretty exciting, even if you’re a cynic.</p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">So, all in all, you may as well consider this a last-call sort of thing for a huge list of <em>Destiny 2</em> content. If you have the chance and the inclination to do so, put your farming galoshes on and grind on.</p>

<p data-characters="210" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you are tired of being killed by the MP7 in <em>XDefiant</em>, it might be time to start using the devastating SMG yourself. Here is the best set of attachments, and Faction to use in tandem with the popular weapon. </p> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true"><em>XDefiant</em> supports several different play styles, depending on how you enjoy approaching a match. For players who enjoy being aggressive, shotguns and SMGs are the two best weapon classes for running and gunning. <em>XDefiant’s</em> meta will still take some time to settle in fully, but the MP7 is the preferred weapon for any gunfight 10 meters away or closer. The MP7 has it’s fair share of shortcomings, but that tradeoff is worth it for one of the best weapons in the title. </p>
 <h2 id="h-best-mp7-loadout-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">Best MP7 loadout in <em>XDefiant</em> </h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Lightweight </li> <li><strong>Front Rail: </strong>Pistol </li> <li><strong>Magazine: </strong>Fast Mag </li> <li><strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Quick Draw </li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Collapsed </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="568" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">The MP7 doesn’t offer much in the way of accuracy, but that’s alright, considering this SMG dominates in mobility, firepower, and reload speed. With this set of attachments equipped, enemies will have a miserable time trying to fight while you slide around and make life difficult for them. I wouldn’t recommend trying to use this loadout for any mid-range gunfights, but it’s perfect for anything within 10 meters. The MP7 is never going to be an accurate weapon, so we leaned in to its strengths and went for attachments that improve mobility even more. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best <em>XDefiant</em> Faction for the MP7</h2> <p data-characters="602" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="false">There might be better options, but Echelon is the most fun Faction to have while using the MP7. The Low Profile Passive Trait hides you on the mini-map even if you fire your weapon unsuppressed, which is perfect for MP7 flank routes. Additionally, the Digital Ghillie Suit makes you invisible while you attempt to get behind and closer to enemy lines. Players can also choose to equip the Intel Suit instead, if they want to temporarily reveal the location of enemies. And finally, the Sonar Goggles Ultra ability reveals every enemy on the map and gives you a pistol that annihilates the competition. </p>

<p data-characters="395" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With Riven&nbsp;being featured&nbsp;in the last week of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-pantheon-rhulk-indomitable-guide/">The Pantheon</a>, there’s never been a better time to learn how to defeat that&nbsp;big&nbsp;old wish dragon properly.&nbsp;The truth is, Riven&nbsp;isn’t&nbsp;actually&nbsp;all that hard&nbsp;when attempted&nbsp;normally.&nbsp;And with everyone participating in one way or another, the encounter can even prove to be a bit of fun.</p> <p data-characters="563" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Riven is one of the final encounters in the Last Wish Raid and one of the pivotal characters in Season 23,&nbsp;<em>Season of the Wish</em>. While Last Wish is still heralded among the best <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-destiny-2-raids-in-release-order-listed/">Raids&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>&nbsp;offers</a>, Guardians seem allergic to learning the fight, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/116ejn6/anyone_know_the_most_reliable_way_to_kill_riven/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various “cheese” methods have persisted</a>&nbsp;over the actual mechanics. While it’s easy enough to have two Stasis Titans smash Riven to smithereens in a few seconds, it’s much more rewarding to have mastery over the encounter. And who knows, this knowledge might even help in The Pantheon.</p>
 <h2 id="h-setup-and-descent" data-injectable="false">Setup and descent</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="689" data-current-count="989" data-injectable="true">Soon after the encounter starts, Guardians must split up to handle mechanics in two separate rooms. Knowing where you’re going and what you’re doing ahead of time can make all the difference. While it’s not required to prepare by assigning players roles and splitting them into teams, it can help keep the run more coordinated. The Fireteam will ideally want two teams of three, with one pre-assigned runner, one reader, and one player to clear enemies. Players will also want to have a sniper or similar precision weapon available. For boss damage, many strategies can work, but keep in mind to avoid anything that might accidentally pop one of Riven’s eyes early.</p>
 <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">Once the composition is decided, the Fireteam can rally and start the encounter by having a player stand on each of the six plates around the room. After the last plate is stepped on, the floor will drop out from below players, and they’ll begin a safe, slow fall to a chamber below housing Riven. The lower chamber has two doors by either end of the walkway. This is where the group splits, with each team heading into a different door.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Riven hide-and-seek</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="735" data-current-count="1035" data-injectable="true">After a short jog, the next part of the encounter will begin when each team has made it to their rooms. In these rooms, Riven will first appear to one of the two teams and move to attack. Emerging from the wall, Riven will either open its mouth to do breath attacks or ready its tentacles to slam Guardians. If it’s a breath attack, Guardians should take cover and shoot Riven’s open mouth in between breaths. For the tentacles, someone will need to get close to bait one, and then the team can all shoot it after it slams down. After either of these mechanics is complete, two of Riven’s ten eyes will sparkle. These should be assigned callouts (typically L1-L5 and R1-R5) so&nbsp;they can be communicated&nbsp;ASAP.</p>
 <p data-characters="723" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="true">If Riven didn’t initially appear on your side, you’ll have another mechanic to complete.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is where the team roles come into play. Before long, an enemy called Eye of Riven will spawn into the room and drop a Taken Orb when defeated. The runner should grab the Orb and look toward the entrance to see a symbol repeated along a wall. The reader should position themselves behind the glass wall at the front of the room, as they’ll see symbols all over&nbsp;the room&nbsp;when looking through the glass. After the runner communicates their symbol, the reader must help guide them to where that symbol appears in the room. Once there, the runner can use their grenade to cleanse the&nbsp;symbol.</p>
 <p data-characters="716" data-current-count="716" data-injectable="true">If both sides are in sync, each should finish around the same time, and&nbsp;then&nbsp;team roles will swap. Riven will appear in the room she wasn’t in initially, and the other team can begin their reading puzzle. When Riven&nbsp;appears&nbsp;to the second group, she’ll immediately go for a new attack, opening her mouth to reveal a Taken Blight. The team must focus the Blight and then shoot the eyes called out by the previous team. Once this process is complete, the lifts in the front of the room will activate, and players can head to the next room. From there, this process repeats&nbsp;again, with players having called out six of Riven’s ten eyes by the time they head up the lifts again.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Regroup and damage</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="575" data-current-count="875" data-injectable="true">After taking the lifts for the second time, players will emerge in the large chamber where the Rally banner was, and the whole Fireteam&nbsp;will be able to&nbsp;meet up. Riven will periodically poke her face out to attack the team with either her tentacles or a breath attack, followed by more eye shine. The boss will do this three times, giving three new callouts for eyes, before opening her mouth to reveal another Taken Blight. Once this Blight&nbsp;is destroyed, Riven’s eyes will be available, and all six new callouts must&nbsp;be destroyed&nbsp;quickly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="679" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">If successful,&nbsp;players can run back to their plates and drop down again.&nbsp;This time, Guardians&nbsp;will be able to&nbsp;target the bulging growths on Riven’s body, dealing massive damage to the boss.&nbsp;If&nbsp;this is enough to push the boss, the fight will move on.&nbsp;Otherwise, players will go through the above steps again. Once&nbsp;pushed, players will be teleported into the Ascendant Plane and must navigate upwards towards a portal out. When Guardians make it out, Riven will make one last push, opening her mouth and revealing another Taken Blight. The Fireteam can unload everything they’ve got, stunning Riven and making her collapse.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="false">It may look like the battle&nbsp;is won, but there’s&nbsp;actually&nbsp;one more step to defeat Riven: charge into the dragon’s mouth. Guardians can then head into Riven’s mouth and to her heart, finishing off the boss with one final DPS burst.&nbsp;From there,&nbsp;Riven will&nbsp;be defeated, but Guardians still have one final step before the Last Wish Raid is complete.&nbsp;All that’s left is the relay race known as the Queenswalk.</p>

<p data-characters="315" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga</em> is finally out, following on from the award-winning 2017 hit by Ninja Theory. Despite the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-says-it-needs-smaller-prestigious-games-right-after-killing-the-studio-behind-the-small-prestigious-hi-fi-rush/">bleakness that appears to accompany the gaming world</a> at the moment, many have been looking forward to this release, so it’s worth going over the basics of what systems you can play it on.</p> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Now, being as it’s published by Xbox Game Studios, it stands to reason that <em>Hellblade 2</em> is exclusive to the Xbox Series X|S. And, indeed, it is. It’s also available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2461850/Senuas_Saga_Hellblade_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, where it’s currently looking pretty good, with a current review score of “Very Positive.” But it’s early days yet.</p> <figure data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">However, there’s likely to be a few PlayStation users out there who will be wondering whether the game will come to the PS5. Currently, there don’t appear to be any plans to release it on Sony’s systems. However, in this humble reporter’s opinion, the fact that Xbox is making some of its exclusives available on rival consoles suggests it may not be out of the realms of possibility just yet. Don’t quote me on that, though.</p>
 <p data-characters="142" data-current-count="142" data-injectable="false">So, quick summary: <em>Hellblade 2</em> is <strong>available on Xbox Series X|S and PC only</strong>. It’s also available on Game Pass, so that’s something.</p> <h2 id="h-decks-out-for-ninja-theory" data-injectable="false">Decks out for Ninja Theory</h2> <p data-characters="166" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">Of course, we’re talking about a new game you can get on Steam, so the next question is to ask whether it’s also compatible with Valve’s Steam Deck.</p> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">Now, despite the general hype around <em>Hellblade 2</em>, the store page doesn’t show whether or not it’s verified or even playable on the portable device. However, it’s a fairly new release and it’s likely that Ninja Theory could tweak it for the system, so be on the lookout for future updates that mention that.</p>
 <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="64" data-injectable="false">Having said that, it’s worth checking out the below video:</p> <figure data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Steam Deck gameplay &amp; best settings" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gl4iW-mhiSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true">According to the channel, <em>Hellblade 2</em> is playable on the Steam Deck, but with a few caveats. For starters, you’re unlikely to get a consistent framerate above 30fps, especially with additional graphics features turned on. Certain cutscenes and visually heavy sections of the game can even drop it to the low 20s.</p>
 <p data-characters="126" data-current-count="126" data-injectable="false">There also appears to be a bit of ghosting as well as some blurring effects, depending on which settings you’ve enabled.</p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="false">So, yes, it is <em>playable</em> on the Deck, but it’s not going to be a smooth ride for much of it, it seems. If you have the PC hardware to run it, it’s probably best to stick with that. Failing that, Nvidia has added the game to its <a href="https://x.com/NVIDIAGFN/status/1792948768892944647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GeForce NOW</a> cloud service, if that’s your bag.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doctor-who-put-steven-moffat-back-where-he-belongs.878295/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161071/doctor-who-steven-moffat-boom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="78nCF5">You could probably consider it a law, like gravity: Any popular entertainment fortunate enough to amass a fandom will eventually find said fandom at odds with at least some of its creative team. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-trek">Star Trek</a> probably invented it (what the hell, it’s invented every other <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24033366/star-trek-sexiest-episodes-ranked">modern pop culture quirk</a>), but most every fanbase has experienced it. In the realm of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/10/5/17938178/doctor-who-tardis-black-fans">21st-century <em>Doctor Who </em>fandom</a> specifically, this nexus of passion and ire is centered around writer Steven Moffat.</p>
<p id="Jz8fPz">Mostly known at the time for the BBC sitcom <em>Coupling</em>, Moffat very quickly began to establish a reputation as one of the most exciting writers working under then-showrunner Russell T. Davies’ 2005 revival of <em>Doctor Who</em>, a guy who would drop in every season for a standalone episode or two-parter that reliably brought the house down. When Moffat took over as <em>Who </em>showrunner in series 5, at the start of Matt Smith’s tenure as the Eleventh Doctor, it didn’t seem like there was a better pick. </p>
<p id="0uPsqG">The grass is always greener though, and while the man responsible for two-thirds of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/5/18127351/tumblr-ban-content-memes-community">SuperWhoLock era of internet fandom</a> had amassed a zealous following, he had a rockier go of it as the man in charge. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23172599/steven-moffat-tv-doctor-who-sherlock">Moffat fell out of favor</a> as audiences tired of his recklessly plotty vision and smug voice, and <em>Doctor Who</em> entered a fallow period — only to be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23979689/doctor-who-the-star-beast-review">brought to vibrant life by Davies once again</a>. And so an old dynamic re-asserts itself, 20 years later, with Russell T. Davies steering the ship, and — surprise — Steven Moffat back as his ringer. </p>

<p id="EW93Iu">“Boom,” the third episode (fourth if you count <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24016644/doctor-who-christmas-special-review">the Christmas special</a>, which Disney Plus does) of the Davies 2.0 era of <em>Doctor Who </em>is such a return to form for Moffat that it is genuinely astounding. With the exception of a brief prologue, “Boom” is a bottle episode in <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/disney-club-33-movie-darren-lemke-shawn-levy-1235904632/">the truest sense of the word</a>, taking place on one set and revolving around a very simple problem: The Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa) has stepped on a sci-fi landmine on an alien world and cannot move without setting it off. </p>
<p id="hKiPvA">What makes “Boom” such a gripping hour of television is the way that it takes its premise and adds layer after layer of thematic and dramatic tension, loading its dilemma with nigh-unbearable levels of stress. The planet the Doctor and companion Ruby Sunday are visiting? It’s embroiled in a never-ending war. The soldiers are Anglican Marines, a faction of religious soldiers <em>Who</em> fans will remember from Moffat’s tenure as showrunner. They will never stop fighting, even if they don’t know why, and there’s <em>definitely</em> reason to doubt why. A girl’s father goes missing, and she thinks the Doctor knows where — whoops, now that’s a life imperiled, because she doesn’t realize the Doctor’s predicament. Making matters even <em>worse </em>is a small fleet of AI-piloted robots designed by an arms manufacturer to keep the battle running smoothly and <em>profitably</em>. </p>
<p id="gQwAhO">In “Boom,” Moffat’s long-established tics — showy, caustic dialog and an inclination towards sentiment — are once again strengths here. Like a lot of the best <em>Who</em> writers, Moffat understands that the Doctor feels most special not when he’s merely being smart, but when he’s <em>communicating</em>; when he’s talking his way out of trouble by showing empathy, not just by being clever. In Moffat’s worst moments of excess, this results in a Doctor that is self-satisfied at being the cleverest in the room, arrogant in his own intellect. At his best though, in the hands of a talented, emotive actor like Ncuti Gatwa? It’s remarkable theater, as a man desperately tries to connect with people who have no reason to listen to him, who have been <em>conditioned</em> against everything he might have to say. </p>
<p id="NttD3F">And, of course, there’s a bit of classic Moffat devilishness to the affair, a joke and a dare in the episode’s very premise: An alien who can travel to all of time and space, stuck in one spot. Will we still watch? </p>

The base Hero Mastery mode, which creates hero-specific obstacle courses that have been rolling out in waves since September, will continue, with more hero courses expected in future seasons. The full message reads as follows:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>As we prepare for Season 11, we’ve taken the time to evaluate a variety of game modes based on how much they are being played. Hero Mastery Gauntlet was intended to bring the high score-chasing excitement of Hero Mastery missions into a multiplayer format. Unfortunately, it hasn’t resonated with players in the ways that we hoped. With this in mind, we have decided to discontinue Hero Mastery Gauntlet as a permanent mode, and it will not be available to play starting in Season 11.</p><p>Players have until the end of Season 10 to complete the Lifetime Challenges for Hero Mastery Gauntlet and compete on the mode’s Top 500 leaderboards.</p><p>Thanks to all of you who jumped into the Gauntlet. If you are still looking to improve your hero skills, Individual Hero Mastery Solo Courses will continue to be available, and there will be more Hero Mastery Solo Courses coming in upcoming seasons. We’ll see you in-game!</p></blockquote><p>The next season of <em>Overwatch 2 </em>begins on June 18, so you have a little over three weeks to play through Hero Mastery Gauntlet. Ultimately, it’s not that big of a loss compared to the likelihood that the entire story campaign was canned after Activision Blizzard’s layoffs <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192">gutted the team in January</a></span>, but every time <em>Overwatch 2 </em>loses a new game mode its justification of that sequel title feels more nebulous than before.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For the past few months and years, Microsoft has been talking a lot about bringing Xbox to “every screen”. While details on that remain both scarce and confusing, a new claim from journalist Jez Corden of Windows Central gives a bit of insight into what they looks like.</p>



<p>In speaking on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A93N7Uu3-9s&amp;t=5409s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Xbox Two podcast</a>, Corden spoke about what he’s heard about the cocept.</p>



<p>“I actually have some details on exactly what Xbox on every screen looks like now,” he said. “And I think what it is, is that every Xbox game will have a consistent social UI across all the games, so like if you’re playing Sea of Thieves, for example, on the PlayStation, you will be able to bring up a mini Xbox guide, or something like that. Kind of like Battlenet, sort of.”</p>



<p>Corden then added that it’s at the point in development that it has a codename within Xbox called Roseway.</p>



<p>Obviously this is likely just a small part of Microsoft’s larger plan for an “Xbox on every screen”. The company is still working on next-gen hardware, a possible handheld device, and even improvements to its cloud gaming offering.</p>

            <p>
Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead has a new CEO.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, it was announced that Shams Jorjani - who was previously part of the team that published Arrowhead's game, Magicka - will take over the leadership role at the company, replacing founder Johan Pilestedt. 
</p>
<p>
Pilestedt will remain in a leadership position following this change, and will now serve as Arrowhead's chief creative officer and chairman.

<p>
"We were both at a stage where we're wondering what's next in our careers," Jorjani told Eurogamer's sister-site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard">GamesIndustry.biz</a> today. "And we realised we probably couldn't quite get to those places if we didn't have the other one to help us get there."
</p>
<p>
Pilestedt added: "When it comes to the overall direction of the organisation, I am still the chairman. So me and Shams are still going to have strategic conversations on how we are going to take Arrowhead into the future."
</p>
<p>
The pair likened themselves to Frodo and Sam from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy making their way to Mordor. "The oblivious approach of 'we'll take one step at a time, and then we will solve the issues as they come'," Pilestedt said, adding the "strength of Arrowhead is the camaraderie that we share amongst the team, and the desire to help each other".

<p>
Elsewhere in the conversation, the duo also touched on any potential acquisitions following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">the huge success of Helldivers 2</a>. For now, the plan is for Arrowhead to remain an independent studio. "I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realise that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard," Pilestedt said. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, while the focus for the team remains on Helldivers 2 for now, Arrowhead is also looking to the future and what may come next. 
</p>
<p>
"We feel there we have so much more to give, and so many more games we want to make," Pilestedt shared. "The ambition level and appetite of the organisation has grown significantly. We now have a taste of blood, and we want more."
</p>
<p>
Jorjani added Arrowhead's goal is to "make really great co-op games", and ultimately turn the company into a "flagship studio, where people who want to make these kinds-of games say to themselves: 'I want to work at Arrowhead'". 
</p>
<p>
The newly-appointed CEO stated this does not mean the studio will suddenly begin employing 500+ members of staff. "We will see growth, but growth as a means to an ends, not as an end itself," he said. "We don't have plans to go public. None of those shenanigans. Measured growth that allows us to make amazing games and be a good place to work."
</p>
<p>
"We don't run the business for monetary gain. The humbleness and the desire to just make great games is the only reason we exist," Pilestedt closed.
</p>

</p>
<p>
"We want to take some more time for this one and potentially between future patches," Helldivers 2 community manager Twinbeard explained on Discord. "We feel cadence has probably been a bit too high to be able to maintain the quality standard we want and you deserve."

<p>Per <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, ex-Paradox and Hooded Horse exec Shams Jorjani will step into the CEO role at Arrowhead, while Pilestedt will remain the studio's CCO (chief creative officer) and chairman.</p>

<p>Pilestedt says that appointing a new CEO will allow him to focus more on the creative side of game development. He says that having a "reluctant CEO" at the head of Arrowhead would not "turn out that well", and that this decision was made "for the success of the business but also myself".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo-soldiers.jpg?itok=0eLEkLek 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo-soldiers.jpg?itok=mZCkFcpU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's a new CEO in town at&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>studio Arrowhead.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as looking after the health of Arrowhead, it's possible that Pilestedt's decision to appoint a new CEO was inspired partially by the recent&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>PlayStation ID controversy.</p>

<p>If you missed out on that, here's a quick refresher. When&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>launched on PC, it was originally intended to require a PlayStation ID linked to your Steam account to play, but that requirement was temporarily postponed owing to technical problems.</p>

<p>After a few months, it was announced that Arrowhead and Sony would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">once again</a> require&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>PC players to have a PlayStation ID to play, and the community responded with outrage and fury, review bombing the game on Steam in droves.</p>

  <p id="LuZ4Jq">Who is <em>IF </em>for? Looking at any of the film’s marketing or the trailer, the answer seems easy: kids. But after seeing <em>IF</em>, written and directed by John Krasinski (a considerable departure from his <em>A Quiet Place</em> movies), that answer stops seeming so simple. This “family comedy” isn’t particularly family-friendly, or particularly comedic. There are, at most, a handful of lines resembling jokes. Judging by the restlessness of the children in my screening, it isn’t for them at all.</p>
<p id="Jh5cyU"><em>IF </em>feels more like a film targeted at millennial parents: It’s overflowing with symbols of millennial childhood. Characters listen to music on cherished vinyl records, and tap into their memories not on iPhones, but on old video cameras. Cellphones aren’t part of this world. Everything from the carnival rides to the furniture seems to come from the 1990s. </p>
<p id="6G0D6u">Plot-wise, that focus on millennial nostalgia makes sense. <em>IF</em> centers on 12-year-old Bea (Cailey Fleming), who recently lost her mother, and may soon lose her father (John Krasinski) as well: He’s about to have heart surgery. Bea discovers she and her neighbor Cal (Ryan Reynolds) can see other people’s abandoned imaginary friends, and they launch a quest to reunite these “IF”s with the kids who imagined them, in order to keep the IFs – and people’s imaginations — alive. </p>

<p id="QDba6t"><em>IF </em>is all about how comforting and wonderful nostalgia is. This is an extremely familiar theme in current culture. Marketing trends have been <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenfriedman/2016/08/02/why-nostalgia-marketing-works-so-well-with-millennials-and-how-your-brand-can-benefit/?sh=5007b5ba3636">pushing the nostalgia agenda</a>. The same thing is happening in pop culture, with popular ’80s and ’90s films and shows from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/22280848/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark-curse-of-the-shadows-review"><em>Are You Afraid of the Dark?</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Rugrats</em> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23645071/oscars-2023-avatar-the-way-of-water-top-gun-maverick-new-sincerity"><em>Top Gun</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/22/18682634/toy-story-4-ending-spoilers-forky-sequel"><em>Toy Story</em></a> being rebooted and reimagined. This constant refreshing of the old is known as nostalgia-bait. Even ostensibly new shows like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/stranger-things"><em>Stranger Things</em></a> are kept alight by the warm, enticing glow of nostalgia. </p>
<p id="mklcFZ">While it can be exhausting to exist in a world that seems terrified of anything new, the rampant obsession with and reliance on nostalgia does make sense. Millennials have faced <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/14/economy/ppi-wholesale-inflation-april/index.html">endlessly increasing costs</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2024/01/22/why-career-stability-is-overrated-in-todays-world/?sh=471a4c1b6e55">poor job stability</a>, and a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nearly-half-gen-z-millennial-103546494.html">climate crisis</a> with no end in sight, making it seem impossible to get a leg up. We’re the first generation to be <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/11/politics/millennials-income-stalled-upward-mobility-us/index.html">worse off than the one before</a>. Wanting to retreat backward into familiar, comforting childhood wish-fulfillment is a logical next step. </p>
<p id="IodGIr">Krasinski’s film, however, employs nostalgia-bait in the worst imaginable way. Instead of rehashing familiar iconography to create new ideas, <em>IF </em>employs a barrage of fluffy, calorie-free whimsy, encouraging audiences to retreat backward into themselves and cling to the imaginary creatures from their childhood. The real world, it argues, is simply too hard, too painful.</p>

<p id="DDALP0"><em>IF</em>’s human characters are incapable of facing reality. Bea’s father is obsessed with using fantasy to make things easier for Bea. When we first see him in the hospital, he’s playing with his IV bag, which he’s dressed up with a wig to make it more appealing for his daughter. This infantilization — Bea constantly reminds him that she’s not a child, in a plea for an honest conversation — prevents her from being able to cope with the potential reality of losing both her parents at age 12. That’s a truly horrifying prospect, but <em>IF </em>treats Bea’s father like a hero, and is warmly receptive to both her retreat into the imaginary and the film’s eventual reminder that the past is exactly where she belongs. </p>
<p id="s8MEqI">Given that <em>IF</em> purports to celebrate the infinite nature of imagination, it’s telling that every IF in the movie is a generic variation of readily available toys, like stuffed animals, robots, and astronauts. Even the film’s primary IF, giant purple furry Blue (Steve Carell), is little more than a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23761120/mcdonalds-grimace-shake-game-boy-birthday-pride-memes">Grimace</a> knock-off. Some IFs are, conceptually speaking, even lazier — a bubble, a banana, a sunflower, a giant gummy bear, a literal ice cube in a glass. </p>
<p id="DCfgAJ">In fact, the one solitary chuckle I let out over the course of the movie’s 104-minute run time was when said ice cube (voiced by Bradley Cooper) reveals that his kid imagined him during a moment of thirst. The surprise factor on that line got me to laugh, but the joke is alarmingly hollow, and it gets to the root of the film’s problem. The best this kid could come up with to satisfy their thirst was <em>a glass of water with an ice cube in it</em>? Not, say, an infinite fountain of all their favorite flavors of lemonade and soft drinks, including flavors not yet conceived? Perhaps a free vending machine full of tantalizing, Willy Wonka-esque magical beverages? Or at least a glass of apple juice?</p>

<p id="XMKfda">If <em>IF </em>was a smarter movie, I’d take this parade of overly obvious, unimaginative imaginary characters to be a comment on how infantilized this forced obsession with nostalgia has become — a warning that our nostalgia-coddled minds are incapable of conjuring any legitimately original images, relying exclusively on variations of familiar themes. The most subversive interpretation of this movie is that Krasinski is actually saying all we can do is revel in our past, which is deeply concerning. But believing that would mean completely misunderstanding what <em>IF </em>is so blatantly <em>meant</em> to say.  </p>
<p id="0iiDXn">[<strong>Ed. note: </strong>From here, major <em>IF </em>spoilers.]</p>
<p id="S7JIbq">The reunification between adults and their childhood imaginary friends is a key aspect of <em>IF</em>. A pivotal scene finds Blue discovering his creator-child Jeremy is now an ineffectual, anxiety-ridden adult (played by Bobby Moynihan), preparing for a big business meeting. Jeremy is deeply unhappy, you see, because he’s an adult, and there’s no joy in that. He can only find any semblance of joy in this unfeeling world when Bea and Cal help Jeremy remember Blue. The whimsy hits toxically high levels as Jeremy and Blue glow with an orange hue, and Michael Giacchino’s constant, over-the-top score signals that finally, Jeremy is at peace. As Jeremy retreats into his own childhood, he’s able to crush the meeting he was so worried about. </p>
<p id="m1Nz5v">If the message wasn’t abundantly clear then, it becomes unavoidable in the film’s big reveal: Cal isn’t Bea’s neighbor, he’s her own childhood IF. The fact that our protagonist imagined a generic adult man as her imaginary friend really exposes how lazy this film thinks childhood imaginations are.</p>

</p>
<p id="S5VI5D">But it’s more sinister than that, <em>IF </em>suggests: The only reason Bea was able to process her complicated feelings and the potential loss of her father was that she retreated from adolescence and dove head-first into the recesses of her early childhood. The film’s final sequence backs this up further, as the lost IFs are reunited with their adults, all of whom seem instantly transformed to see the creatures they created as kids. The resulting montage of loving, happy faces is meant to be tear-jerking, but it feels ugly — an absolute repudiation of reality and adult life, in favor of the emptiest, most imagination-drained fantasies possible. </p>
<p id="2HjSqP">Instead of nostalgia-bait, <em>IF </em>has created a nostalgia trap. This is a movie that vehemently rejects one of life’s greatest features — growth and development — and encourages us to live inside our pasts. It isn’t really any safer there. But as far as Krasinski and the filmmakers are concerned, at least pretending it is feels comforting. </p>

<p>MADFINGER Games has pushed out Gray Zone Warfare’s first major patch, addressing hundreds of issues in the game and improving stability across the board. Since it was suddenly released on April 30, GZW has taken the extraction shooter world by storm, giving players a vast open-world environment to explore either alone or with teammates, searching for loot and completing more than 150 tasks.</p>

      </div>
<p>For now, Arrowhead plans to remain independent and it doesn't foresee a massive increase in its workforce. "We pride ourselves on being an independent studio," Pilestedt said to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. "We have to see what the future holds, but there's nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody. I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realize that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard."</p><p>Jorjani added that the studio still aims to make "really great co-op games" and transform Arrowhead into a big name in the games industry. "When we were growing up, we really wanted to work at Blizzard, it was one of the bucket list places to work at. I think Arrowhead has the potential to be that," Jorjani said. "But that doesn't mean we have to be a 500-person company. In fact, a 500-person company is quite painful in a lot of ways. We will see growth, but growth as a means to an ends, not as an end itself. We don't have plans to go public. None of those shenanigans. Measured growth that allows us to make amazing games and be a good place to work."</p><p>Pilestedt added that the two don't run the company for monetary gain, as the "humbleness and the desire to just make great games" is the driving force behind them.</p><p>Helldivers 2 has been very successful on PC and PS5, as Sony revealed that the game sold 12 million units at launch to become the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time</a>. This eclipses the previous record set by God of War Ragnarok, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-sells-5-million-copies-in-a-week-becomes-fastest-selling-first-party-playstation-game/1100-6509445/" data-ref-id="1100-6509445">which sold 5 million copies in the first week</a>. So far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">Helldivers 2 is the best-selling game of 2024 in the US</a>.</p>

A new teaser shows what looks like Snooty Steppes featuring a post-apocalyptic makeover, plus confirms that the T-60 power armor will appear in the battle-royale game soon with Chapter 5 Season 3.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Fortnite account <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1793056269177360818" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter) posted a brief 2-second clip that was packed full of small details. For instance, there are several color styles of Fallout's power armor on display. One character uses some sort of new item, like a nitro juice that can splash onto teammates. Additionally, the short video seems to showcase a variety of weapons: the laser rifle, mini-gun, harpoon gun, and repeater.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-teases-fallout-crossover-ahead-of-post-apocalyptic-season-3/1100-6523546/" data-ref-id="1100-6523546">Fortnite teased the Fallout crossover</a> for a rumored post-apocalyptic theme for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-start-date/2900-5356/#3" data-ref-id="2900-5356">Chapter 5 Season 3, which should begin this weekend</a>. That's because Season 2 is slated to end this Friday, May 24. A previous image hinted at a Nitro Dome for the upcoming season, with thoughts that a Mad Max collaboration could be in the cards, too. However, that hasn't been announced.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-just-did-something-its-never-done-before/1100-6523556/" data-ref-id="1100-6523556">Fortnite Festival just did something it's never done before</a> by offering three new tracks from Billie Eilish at the same time they were officially released.
