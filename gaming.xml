            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/izzy-rowland-and-alex-song-xia-talk-never-stop-blowing-up-how-cowardice-shaped<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Never Stop Blowing Up </em>is the latest season from Dimension 20. When a group of employees at a VHS Rental Store going out of business get Jumanji'd into an action movie filled with hard one-liners, convoluted plotlines, and every action trope in the book they need to gather their Macguffins to survive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We got to talk with Isabella Roland and Alex Song-Xia about their experiences in the world of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> and what influenced their characters.</p>
<p>If you're interested in more<em> Never Stop Blowing Up</em> you can check out our interview where we talked about showing off your nerd with Ify Nwadiwe and Jacob Wysocki, or our conversation with Brennan Lee Mulligan about the creation of Never Stop Blowing Up and letting others take on the role of DM.</p>

<h2>Yippee-ki-yay Jack Manhattan</h2>
<p>In <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> Isabella Roland plays Paula Donvalson, a security guard for the Lake Elsinore strip mall that Dave's Video Rental inhabits. While in the real world, she's a 58-year-old divorcee who enjoys <em>Muriel's Wedding </em>and <em>Under the Tuscan Sun</em> when pulled into<em> Never Stop Blowing Up</em> she becomes Jack Manhattan a detective who came to LA to solve the case of his partner's death.</p>
<p>It was the shared love for action films between Brennan Lee Mulligan and Izzy Roland that led to Mulligan writing this adventure. I asked Izzy where her love of action movies came from.</p>
<p>Pausing for a moment Roland expressed that she wasn't entirely sure where it originated, that there wasn't a single point that fueled her love. "I think it's a love of all things very over the top, all of my biggest heroes and inspirations in comedy and acting are the ones who are bigger than life."</p>
<p>Listing off some of her inspirations Roland continued "Gilda Radnor was huge for me and Maya Rudolf, I love people who can't be reigned in and I think a lot of that is present in action movies too."</p>

"I watch it multiple times a year and I watch it every Christmas because it is a Christmas movie"</p>
<h2>Kingskin, The Tortilla Chip Shaped Man</h2>
<p>Alex Song-Xia plays the valedictorian Liv Skyler who has been working at the rental store while trying to figure out if she wants to follow through with attending Stanford or whether she'll continue to search for something she'd rather do. A complete juxtaposition to her real form once she is pulled into <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> she becomes Kingskin, a hulking mob boss who could (and does) crush a man's body without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>While Kingskin is tough on the outside, especially at the outset of the game, he really becomes the heart of the team of Amazing Action Stars but also of his own mob commonly complementing members like Doug Meat.</p>
<p>Song-Xia explained that this difference in position to character was due to "cowardice." Expanding on the idea Song-Xia continued "I couldn't commit to brutality."</p>
<p>Roland cut in to offer that she thinks it's down to Song-Xia being "a very compassionate and loving person"</p>

<p>"I was like 'I'm going to play so different from Conrad'," here referencing their character Conrad Schintz, a newsie in the cerebral city murder mystery of Mentopolis, "and immediately I went back to being earnest and compassionate."</p>
<h2>Into The Action Of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em></h2>
<p>Prior to playing in this season of Dimension 20 I was interested to hear what kind of primer they received for what they might have expected going into the game and it's homebrewed version of the Kids on Bikes game system.</p>
<p>Pausing momentarily to think about it Song-Xia revealed that there really wasn't much information that they were given. "We talked about action movies, and we discussed all watching one together, but I dont think that happened."</p>
<p>"I don't think that happened," Roland confirmed "Brennan told us 'be crazy, [...] we picked all of you for a reason so you should feel so inclined to go ballz to the wall'"</p>

<p>"It was a really good pep talk" Song-Xia added</p>
<p>As Jack Manhattan and Kingskin characters went from killing needlessly and throwing around bricks of cocaine to storming the White House dressed as a senator protecting themselves from bulletfire with a briefcase. Knowing that the season was filled with a series of circumstances each crazier than the next, many brought on by player made decisions, I asked if there was any point that they felt like they had gone too far.</p>
<p>Before responding I received affirming head nods from both Roland and Song-Xia</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Every episode."</p>
<p>Roland spoke specifically in regards to the final episode "I was like… we can't do this… we're not allowed to do this. But Brennan [Lee Mulligan] seemed confident and seemed like he had it all under control so… okay"</p>
<h2>The Lessons We Teach Each Other</h2>
<p>A key aspect of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> is that each of the 'real world' characters are able to learn from their movie counterparts and experiences through the movie. Having heard in the final episode how the 'real world' characters had grown I was interested to hear what action heroes Jack Manhattan and Kingskin had taken away from the experience.</p>
<p>"I think maybe Jack, he's an homage to John McClain, I think he would come out of it wanting to be less selfish and less self-involved. You can't just make every insane move that you want to make. People's lives are at stake."</p>

<p>For Kingskin Song-Xia hopes that "he would embrace his softer side a little more, his genuine warm feelings towards his henchmen and to not be so scared to show them how much he loves them." The sentiment took a comedic turn as Song-Xia mused on Kingskin's growth "I don't know if he would let them unionize or have better benefits, but he would say 'love you' sometimes"</p>
<p>Roland offered an alternative path of growth suggesting that Kingskin could become a therapist. Loving the idea Song-Xia added that they "hope Jack suggests it to Kingskin."</p>
<p>All ten episodes are now available of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> available on <a href="https://dropout.tv/">Dropout.tv</a>, you can also watch the first episode for free on the Dimension 20 YouTube channel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-addresses-controversial-leveling-changes-in-world-of-warcraft-the-war-within<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Slow down, life is to be savored.</h2></div><section><p>Earlier this week, Blizzard announced changes to how leveling from level 70 to 80 will work in recently-released World of Warcraft expansion, The War Within. And now, after criticism from players, developers are reassuring that the overall impact to leveling time will be "minimal."</p><p>The changes were announced yesterday in <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/leveling-difficulty-changes-incoming/1931861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an official post</a>, with community manager Kaivax sharing that the team had noticed players coming into the new expansion content with endgame gear from the previous expansion, Dragonflight, were "extremely powerful relative to that intential content." The post goes on to say that a hotfix to be pushed today would "adjust the scaling of enemies in War Within leveling content to increase the power of lower-level enemies, bringing the duration of combat more in line with expected WoW behavior. These changes will be most noticeable at level 70, and will have a reduced impact as your level increases."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>All of that sounds relatively normal, and as someone who started playing The War Within in full Dragonflight endgame gear, they were desperately needed. Especially in the first half of the new expansion, I found I was easily killing even supposedly difficult enemies in just a few hits, and while it evened out over time, the speed of the experience meant I was blasting through content and levels so quickly I barely had time to blink. In fact, much of the community agreed something needed to be changed. But in the ensuing discussion, it became clear that there was significant frustration as to how Blizzard was handling it.</p><p>Players expressed two main concerns. The first, as demonstrated in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1f2m4qk/leveling_will_be_made_harder_with_hotfixes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several of the top comments on this thread</a>, was that players coming into the expansion with terrible gear (perhaps because they skipped playing Dragonflight, or were leveling a new character) would be relatively underpowered and would disproportionately struggle with the content if their power was nerfed.</p><p>But a second issue players surfaced was the timing of the changes. The War Within technically launched back on August 22 for people who purchased the Epic Edition of the game. Its global launch was on August 26. That meant that people who paid for the more expensive version for earlier access essentially got four extra days of super speedy, overpowered leveling (including a period over a weekend) while those who didn't shell out the extra cash only experienced roughly a day and a half. </p><p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1f2m4qk/comment/lk7gxc6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one Redditor put it</a>: "The time to make that change was almost exactly a week ago. It's absolutely asinine to arbitrarily slow things down for people who are already behind the curve due to the late release. This is a situation where you need to just acknowledge you dropped the ball and leave things the way they are."</p><p>In response, Blizzard has issued some clarification on what the changes to leveling actually are in an attempt to assuage at least some of these worries.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We want to provide additional details on today's leveling changes and balance fixes to group content.</p><p>• Changes aim to make the difficulty curve more gradual - enemy strength will actually increase by less per level in the mid-to-high 70s than it used to</p><p>• Players coming in…</p></div>— World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1828839377042374995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Warcraft/status/1828839377042374995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Blizzard shared that the changes to leveling scaling would make the difficulty curve "more gradual" and that players coming into the expansion with basic leveling gear would find leveling "manageable" and "get powerful gear quickly." Meanwhile, players at level 78 and up should find combat "unchanged."</p><p>With the change now live, players are reporting that Blizzard's description of the shift is largely accurate, and is a much-needed balance adjustment. But frustrations about the update's timing still remain, exacerbated by existing irritation about The War Within's early access period in general. The four-day headstart for Epic Edition buyers has been fairly controversial, with top-level players expressing anger that it forced them to pay extra to stay on top of the early expansion competitive scene, and others just aggravated about missing out on what is technically the "launch day." </p><p>In Blizzard's favor, perhaps, is the reality that the early access period drastically cut down on server issues and queues on both the 22nd and the 26th, with players barely reporting any of the usual launch day friction in either scenario due to the split playerbase.</p><p>Game director Ion Hazzikostas called the early access period a "bit of an experiment" in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-game-director-calls-controversial-the-war-within-paid-early-access-an-experiment">an interview earlier this year</a>, and it's not clear whether we'll see Blizzard try the same thing for future expansions <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-announces-next-three-expansions-in-world-of-warcraft-the-worldsoul-saga-blizzcon-2023">Midnight and The Last Titan</a>.</p><p>We're currently in the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-review">process of reviewing The War Within</a> as its launch content slowly rolls out over the next few weeks, but our review-in-progress says that, "There's still a lot of The War Within I haven't seen yet, but I'm thoroughly enjoying myself so far, and that’s just about the highest praise I can give an expansion at launch."</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[How Brennan Lee Mulligan Created Never Stop Blowing Up, A Love Letter To 80s Action Movies In TTRPG Form]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-a-love-letter-to-80s-action-movies-in-ttrpg-form.966687/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today the final episode of the latest season of Dimension 20, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-never-stop-blowing-up-pulls-cast-of-mall-employees-into-vhs-to-live"><em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em></a>, wrapped up. This '1980s action movie meets Jumanji' themed season saw the Amazing Action Heroes get pulled into a VHS and face some of the most insane Dimension 20 scenarios ever conceived.</p>
<p>As the series is ending I had a chance to talk to Dimension 20 creator and GM of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em>, Brennan Lee Mulligan, about homebrewed mechanics, character choices, and his own favorite action movie.</p>
<p>We also had a chance to talk with other cast members. If you're interested to hear about Ify Nwadiwe and Jacob Wysocki going 'full nerd' or what life lesson Izzy Roland and Alex Song-Xia's action personas took away from Never Stop Blowing Up you can check out our full conversations.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//BHceSxQiIqw"></iframe></p>
<p>Upon announcement <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> was described as an "explosive, high-octane, action-packed thrill-ride unlike anything you've ever seen!" Six employees at a closing Video Rental Store are pulled into a VHS take inhabiting action movie avatars while Brennan Lee Mulligan provides voices and actions to every ally and enemy the party comes across.</p>
<p>Never Stop Blowing Up uses the<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kids-on-bikes-second-edition-now-available"> <em>Kids on Bikes</em> TTRPG system</a> but with an additional twist that every character's stats begin at a d4, then if the dice lands on its highest number it 'explodes' allowing the players to not only roll their dice again, but roll the dice of the next higher value.</p>
<h2>How <em>Kids On Bikes</em> Was Tweaked For <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em></h2>
<p>"I love <em>Kids on Bikes</em> so so much, I've so enjoyed it for Mentopalis and Misfits &amp; Magic, when we were crafting <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> as a game system we were heavily inspired by <em>Kids on Bikes</em> with the 'blowing up' mechanic."</p>

<p>In talking about why tweaks were necessary for <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> Mulligan explained "The main thing was accommodating the action genre and within the action genre characters say they have specializations but they really don't. You look at action movies and someone's the hacker and someone's the sniper but really they all know kung-fu, they all drive cars fast, everyone is great at everything."</p>
<p>"For the leveling up mechanic we thought the idea of the characters having to unlock the capabilities of their action persona would be a really fun growth arc starting as bumbling bozos and by the end being these action demi-gods."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think that one of the elements of TTRPGs that is always going to stay as a part that players seek out is the power fantasy of improvement." Mulligan continued to expand on power scaling in role playing games "It doesn't need to get to 20th level <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>D&amp;D</em></a> archmage worldbending power, but because of the choices that I made I got a little bit better."</p>
<h2>Does <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> Know The Meaning Of "Too Far"?</h2>
<p>As <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> progressed each of the characters continued to expand their abilities and available dice creating more ridiculous scenes as the adventure went on. For a GM wanting to create an adventure not only entertaining to the players but also an audience watching at home I wanted to know what kinds of checks and balances were in place to ensure the series never took things too far, or if "too far" was even an option?</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/brennan-nsbu-outfit-change.jpg?itok=s_hEjKg7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/brennan-nsbu-outfit-change.jpg?itok=kMpWY8Ag 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"We bought ourselves a health amount of cushion with the double dip unreality," Mulligan began explaining that while insane events were occurring for the action heroes the players still needed to keep in mind their 'real world' selves. "You have this nice play space where characters can really do outrageous and surreal things, with the understanding that their real lives are being impacted"</p>
<p>"You fly to space, you stab someone with the Washington Monument, a car gets split in half [...] all of these impossible things are accommodated [...] while the characters get to say 'Yeah this is cartoonish, but if I die here I die in Lake Elsinor.'"</p>
<h2>Sharing The GM Chair</h2>
<p>One of the many insane abilities that the players were able to unlock was the ability to take over the GM seat if they rolled a natural 20. This power came up a handful of times and was used to successfully obtain powerful items, navigate around fights that the party didn't even know was on the horizon, and with some monkey-paw thinking also opened some entertaining avenues for Mulligan.</p>
<p>"This was my ultimate test for. There's a certain amount of zany you can get to but as a GM don't I always have this last card up my sleeve where I can warp reality to my benefit?" Mulligan began to explain his logic behind introducing this ability. "It felt like if we're really going to honor the premise of this season [...] then we've gotta open up the hot seat, we gotta let people come in here and do whatever the hell they want."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ify-nsbu-gm-chair.jpg?itok=65xWKXpd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ify-nsbu-gm-chair.jpg?itok=MGqz43wQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first example of this ability's use had Ify Nwadiwe become the GM, providing Vic Ethanol and Kingskin with powerful new weapons, and having an entire secret hotel of assassins promise that they would protect the party members from any threat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It felt like now not only am I tying both hands behind my back, but I'm also tying my legs behind my back"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Running The Chaos</h2>
<p>An aspect of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> that viewers may not notice is that while the game is ongoing on top of running the game and putting on a show Mulligan is also controlling a variety of effects including the explosions that appear at each 'blow up' and coursing electricity around the dome.</p>
<p>Mulligan let me peak behind the scenes to know what his setup looked like while GMing.</p>
<p>Mulligan began by gesturing with his hands, recreating his setup. "My laptop in front of me, tray with dice to my right, usually I'll have some cards with some game stats up in that area, to my left there will normally be some hand props or production elements, snacks — almonds and a drink like coffee scattered throughout the area — right-lower I'll have my computer bag and books, and to my right I'll have my stream deck which is where I move through my effects and stings that I want to trigger on the Dome walls."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nsbu-animatic.jpg?itok=A0sqzvQf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nsbu-animatic.jpg?itok=Aizdc3cb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some crazy scenes are accompanied by animatics</figcaption></figure><p>To round out our conversation I was interested to finally know, in a season filled with every action trope you could imagine, what was the action film that Mulligan held above them all. While it looked like there would be a moment of pause and contemplation the response quickly came out; <em>Die Hard</em>.</p>
<p>"Favorite action film is <em>Die Hard</em>, it's not close. Me and Izzy's favorite, it's one of the greatest screenplays ever written, it's unbelievable. The pacing of the plot and the story and action. Ya know, 'yippee ki-yay motherfucker' is one of the greatest lines of all time."</p>
<p>Mulligan highlighted that Izzy Roland's action persona character, Jack Manhattan, was very much based on Bruce Willis' John McClain. An additional shoutout was given to <em>Spy</em> with Melissa McCarthy as a favorite action-comedy of the household.</p>

Two and a half years after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">announcing</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> - or rather the "the first instalment in the new Witcher saga", as it's now more officially known - CD Projekt has confirmed pre-production is almost over and that full production on the game will begin "soon".
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt's joint CEO Michał Nowakowski shared the news in a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-looks-back-at-the-first-half-of-2024/">press release</a> outlining the studio's work so far in 2024, explaining development on the new Witcher game (codenamed Polaris) is "nearing a major milestone which will mark the end of the pre-production phase".
</p>
<p>
In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTl6U3WppEs">earnings video</a> accompanying CD Projekt's latest financial results, chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz expanded on Nowakowski's comments a little, saying, "The Polaris team, working on the next game in The Witcher saga, made substantial progress, which will soon enable us to wrap up pre-production and take this project to the full production phase."

<p>
Little has been revealed about CD Projeckt's next Witcher game beyond a tantalising bit of promo art, but actor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">Doug Cockle recently confirmed</a> that while he'll be returning as Geralt of Rivia, the game "won't focus on Geralt. So it's not about him this time."
</p>
<p>
Alongside Polaris, CD Projekt is also continuing to work on projects Orion, Sirius, and Hadar. Sirius is the Witcher spin-off that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-its-better-to-cut-costs-early-following-project-sirus-rethink">re-evaluated and rebooted</a> last year, while Hadar is the studio's new unannounced IP. As for Orion, that's the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> sequel (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiplayer-being-considered-for-cyperpunk-2077-sequel-says-cd-projekt">may or may not have multiplayer</a>), and its Boston-based development team is still "laying the groundwork" for the project, according to Nowakowski in today's studio update.
</p>
<p>
And in other Cyberpunk news, Nowakowski confirmed during the company's latest earnings call (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-definitely-planning-more-cyberpunk-2077-animation-projects">IGN</a>) that CD Projekt is "definitely planning to do more in terms of animation with Cyberpunk" following the success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-edgerunners-shows-cd-projekts-cyberpunk-is-still-worth-fighting-for">Netflix's Edgerunners series</a>. And while a Season 2 isn't on the cards according to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-2-is-currently-not-in-the-works-producer-says/">comments</a> made by CD Projekt's Japan country manager Satoru Honma back in 2022, Nowakowski has insisted more animation is coming "for sure".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/play-star-wars-outlaws-steam-deck/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I don’t always get to sit at my computer to play the latest game releases for coverage. As a parent, I play on my Steam Deck frequently, whether waiting for an appointment to start or finish, a few minutes before bedtime, or what have you. But my current obsession this past week is Star Wars Outlaws, and I wouldn’t mind taking the open-world adventure with me everywhere. So, can you play Star Wars Outlaws on Steam Deck?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-star-wars-outlaws-work-on-steam-deck">Does Star Wars Outlaws Work on Steam Deck?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, as Star Wars Outlaws isn’t yet on Steam, it’s not natively supported on Steam Deck. If you want to play on the handheld, you must use a workaround to play via Ubisoft Connect or Epic Games Store. The best way to accomplish this task is by using the Heroic Launcher, which allows you to download various third-party launches, including both we’ve just mentioned here, and download your games through them. It’s easier but not foolproof.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Star Wars Outlaws doesn’t run well on Steam Deck, even using Heroic Launcher. In fact, it doesn’t run well anyway currently, with recent reports claiming Ubisoft is asking PlayStation 5 players to restart their games with a new save file to avoid significant performance issues. It’s unfortunate, especially for those who dove in on day one and spent hours playing as Kay Vess.</p>



<p>In any case, those performance problems plague players on Steam Deck. It drops frames constantly, lags, and stutters, and it’s just an overall poor experience that’s not worth your time!</p>







<h2 id="h-will-star-wars-outlaws-eventually-offer-steam-deck-support">Will Star Wars Outlaws Eventually Offer Steam Deck Support?</h2>



<p>Following the somewhat rocky launch plagued by performance issues and its exclusivity on Ubisoft Connect and Epic Games Store, I suspect Outlaws will inevitably launch on Steam. Sometimes, Ubisoft takes one year to launch its games on Valve’s competing platform. Other times, it’s only about six to eight months. I suspect the latter in this case, but we’ll have to wait and see.</p>



<p>When it inevitably launches on Steam, I hope Ubisoft takes steps to improve Steam Deck performance. By then, they’ll have ironed out many of the game’s bugs and performance problems, though!</p>

Based on the reveal trailer and early information about the game, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma looks to be an evolution of the established RPG-meets-farming-sim formula of previous Rune Factory games. The game is set in Azuma--a fantasy world inspired by Japanese folklore, where players take the role of a magical martial artist known as an "Earth Dancer" on a quest to restore the land by building farms, repairing villages, and taking on RPG-style quests and boss battles.</p><p dir="ltr">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma will feature two physical versions on Nintendo Switch, including a <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1852066891932500530%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Frune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-preorder-guide%2F1100-6526172%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">standard edition</a></strong> with the base game and a limited <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1852066430629796318%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Frune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-preorder-guide%2F1100-6526172%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Earth Dancer Edition</a></strong> that comes with collectible goodies and bonus in-game content.

As mentioned above, several Bethesda-published titles are available, including The Elder Scrolls Online collection--which includes the MMO's base game and all expansions up to and including High Isle--and Fallout 4's Game of the Year Edition, which includes all its DLC. There's also Ghostwire Tokyo, the underrated, supernatural open-world game from Evil Within and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks.</p><p>You can also pick from several Capcom titles for the bundle, including the Resident Evil 3 remake, Devil May Cry 5 + Vergil, the Devil May Cry HD Collection, and the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy. The Summer Superstars Collection also has some lesser-known gems that are worth your attention, like the side-scrolling brawler River City Girls 2, Lovecraft-themed boomer shooter Forgive Me Father 2, and Hard West 2--a turn-based strategy game set in a supernatural-tinged Wild West, among many others.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-set-to-launch-with-two-maps/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty Zombies has always been incredibly popular, appearing in multiple games. Players were first introduced to the game mode during Call of Duty: World At War in 2008. Since then, it has appeared in many of the other Call of Duty games, with the most recent iteration being Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-showcased-in-codnext-showcase/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> will launch with zombies available, and it was revealed during COD Next that it will launch with two maps.</p>
<p>The two maps are called Liberty Falls and Terminus Island, respectively. These maps will see the return of round-based zombies, with Liberty Falls being a derelict West Virginian map. However, while exploring and surviving, players will get to experience a built-up world that highlights stories of people who used to live in Liberty Falls. There are also some side quests for players to pick up and complete for both Liberty Falls and Terminus Island.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Liberty Falls Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jswLipfg94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For Liberty Falls, players will get to experience a rush of nostalgia, as it embraces 90s America. Players can explore a comic shop, a video store, and a bowling alley, for example. The two maps arriving to Black Ops 6 Zombies are vastly different from each other, with Liberty Falls being somewhat more "upbeat" and vibrant and Terminus Island being dark and gloomy.</p>
<p>Although it may sound like the Black Ops 6 Zombies game mode adds very little to the game, there are also plenty of new weapons to use, such as the Thrustodyne M23 and the Wunderwaffe DG-2, both of which have powerful capabilities and can easily clear waves of zombies.</p>
<p>There is also a new Perk Machine for players to utilize, where players can charge up their Dedicated Melee with a perk called the Melee Macchiato. However, that's not all. While you roam around the two maps in Zombies, you can also find unique traps across both maps, such as "Trigger the Aetherella Trap in the Liberty Falls Comic Shop."</p>
<p>During this deep dive at COD Next, they also mentioned the quality-of-life changes that will be happening in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies. Door costs will now be shared across players, so there's no more worrying about another player rushing ahead without you. There will also be player-specific drops and three self-revives per player. Plenty of minor updates are being made to make the Zombies experience more enjoyable, and they have all been detailed in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-next-black-ops-6-reveal-zombies-liberty-falls-showcase-intel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new blog</a> to recap the events of the COD Next showcase.</p>

The announcement marks the end of rumors that the map would be making a comeback for months.</p><p>Now we know that Verdansk – along with iconic points of interest like Stadium, the Train Station, and Superstore – will finally return in spring 2025. It’s unclear if it will be altered in any way or if it will be just as players remember it when it eventually drops in Warzone. A specific release date has also not yet been revealed.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Run it back.

It was a momentous occasion for Call of Duty players that coincided with COVID-19 lockdowns, giving fans ample time to fully explore the map in what has evolved into a worthy standalone battle royale mode. However, as Activision continued to release additional installments in its first-person shooter series, Verdansk was phased out in 2021 in favor of new maps like Urzikstan, Vondel, and Al Mazrah. While fresh maps shook up gameplay with new areas to fight through, many have argued that no Warzone map has come close to matching Verdansk’s highs.</p><p>The location did eventually <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-explains-why-call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-has-120-player-verdansk-and-pc-and-console-do-not"><u>return as a playable map in Call of Duty Warzone Mobile</u></a>, but those on console have been without it since 2021. That will change early next year. News that Activision is bringing back the first Warzone map has players excited, with many taking to X to celebrate what might be the mode's biggest reveal in years.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I just fell to my knees in the GameStop parking lot 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏</p>— JaredFPS (@JaredFPS) <a href="https://twitter.com/JaredFPS/status/1828874334166806980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We're returning home! ❤️</p>— 𝗡𝗛' -Hotel Six- 🧼🥇 (@ModenasHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModenasHD/status/1828874276545417527?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/e56PlEUgyV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/e56PlEUgyV</a></p>— Nick - Toxic (@TOXICYTT) <a href="https://twitter.com/TOXICYTT/status/1828874915711193224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, COD: Next has featured a crate full of other announcements related to Warzone, zombies, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 in general.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/democratic-national-convention-creators-palestine-tiktok-instagram-twitch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you only caught the highlights, last week’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago looked like <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2024-08-23/hollywood-celebrities-dnc-kamala-harris" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a glamorous, four-day-long coronation</a> for Kamala Harris. But outside the United Center, protests raged, and delegates from the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/21/meet-the-uncommitted-how-gaza-hangs-over-democratic-national-convention" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uncommitted Movement</a> waited for a chance to speak as part of the party, which they never received.</p><p>On the ground, the tension was more than just palpable, according to <a href="https://x.com/abughazalehkat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kat Abughazaleh</a>, a content creator who makes fun of conservatives on TikTok when she’s not analyzing them for <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/press-releases/mother-jones-hires-tiktok-star-kat-abughazaleh-as-video-creator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her job at Mother Jones</a>. It was downright uncomfortable.</p><p>"That night, when we were sitting on the concrete [outside the convention], the CNN-Politico grill – that was a pop-up there – was having a big party,” she told Aftermath. “And so you were hearing 'Espresso' by Sabrina Carpenter and seeing all these people dressed up having a party while we were just sitting there waiting for this call to say that, you know, you're still welcome in the party despite your race."</p><p>As far as Abughazaleh knows, she was the only Palestinian American among <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/22/dnc-tiktok-influencers-content-creators-credentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 content creators invited to the DNC</a> – a first for an event that has historically catered to press and politicians. But unlike the press, who ostensibly attended to inform the public about those with their wrinkled, unsteady grips on the levers of power, creators at the DNC had no uniform purpose. Some were there to ask tough questions and offer commentary, while others <a href="https://x.com/AndrewSolender/status/1825988112918429921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did dances</a> and peppered public figures with softballs about <a href="https://archive.is/AaXVb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which dishes they’d describe Harris and Trump as</a>. A few even <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/20/g-s1-17896/gen-z-activist-deja-foxx-is-the-first-content-creator-to-speak-at-the-convention" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke</a> on the main stage about matters like immigration and reproductive rights.</p><p>Nonetheless, press and creators were <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dnc-influencer-convention/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credentialed using the same tiered system</a> – which identified attendees with titles like “producer,” “editor,” and “reporter” – leading to resentment between the groups as a result of some high-profile creators getting more access than your average journalist. Around 15,000 journalists attended the convention, and unlike creators, they had to pay for workspace and accommodations, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/us/politics/dnc-social-media-influencers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the New York Times</a>.</p><p>Creators also had access to special fifth-floor creator spaces and exclusive events like a yacht party hosted by the Harris campaign. Additionally, the DNC circulated a list of potential interviewees among creators, which Aftermath has viewed. This included numerous politicians like California governor Gavin Newsom, Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and senator Cory Booker, but also celebrities like former NFL player Marshawn Lynch and comedian Hasan Minhaj. All of this gave some journalists the impression that the DNC was rolling out the red carpet for a bunch of unserious upstarts while cold shouldering The Fourth Estate.</p><p>Meanwhile, content creators felt like journalists weren’t taking them seriously despite the sizable audiences they’ve amassed, which in some cases go toe-to-toe with or even surpass traditional media. (For example, leftist politics streamer Hasan Piker spent part of his time at the convention <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2230259058?filter=archives&amp;sort=time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commentating over an NBC news stream</a> to augment his own coverage. At the time, NBC had around 24,000 concurrent viewers on YouTube. On Twitch, Piker pulled in more than double that.) And so the tension calcified: Some journalists believed that content creators didn’t belong at the DNC unless they were going to act like journalists, and some content creators thought journalists were overestimating their own importance and using it as an excuse to adopt holier-than-thou attitudes.&nbsp;</p><p>Journalists and content creators bickered throughout the week, mainly via “passive-aggressive tweets and TikToks,” Wired reporter Makena Kelly, who <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dnc-influencer-convention/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attended the DNC</a>, said on <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-black-myth-wukong-dnc-content-creators" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent episode of the Aftermath Hours podcast</a>.</p><p>A creator who was granted anonymity on the basis that they were not authorized to publicize information from private chats and communications relayed messages from a DNC creator WhatsApp group to Aftermath.&nbsp;</p><p>"Should I just piss off the press more by posting the video tour of my suite at the Waldorf Astoria?" read one message from a creator to the group.</p><p>"Creators are shallow?” read another. “I'm pretty sure it was us creators who gave our merch to an intern and bought her dinner when a press member made her cry."</p><p>This is illustrative of another difference between press and content creators: While journalists are still human beings – and many have knowingly stepped into ethical quagmires – most would turn up their noses at the idea of buying things for the staff of an institution they’re supposed to be holding accountable. But creators are much more used to openly transactional relationships with the companies and organizations about which they’re producing videos, podcasts, and streams. Some of this is direct; while the Harris campaign did not pay creators, <a href="https://archive.is/AaXVb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the New York Times reports</a> that other Democratic groups – like a nonprofit called the Hub Project and an “influencer advocacy network” called Good Influence – covered travel costs for a handful and, in some cases, paid for posts with specific talking points in them.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>But they were still dancing on the yacht in the background. That just felt kind of emblematic of a lot of this.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Creators to whom Aftermath spoke said that many viewed their purpose at the DNC as promotional – to get the word out about the shiny new Harris/Walz ticket, rather than to hold politicians’ feet to the fire. At one point Abughazaleh told other creators that she was looking for Democratic Party surrogates to talk to about Palestine. Some were wary of her approach.</p><p>"Someone replied 'I just don't know if it's a good idea, if we're trying to promote and endorse Kamala Harris, to talk about this. It's a very controversial issue,'" Abughazaleh said.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/AustinOnTwitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Austin Show</a>, a Twitch streamer known for his livestreaming riffs on popular game show formats, viewed his role similarly in DNC collaborations with <a href="https://ivehaditpodcast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“I’ve Had It,”</a> a comedy podcast, and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2230259058?filter=archives&amp;sort=time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a cameo on Piker’s stream</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I was hoping to talk about [and] elevate the Harris/Walz ticket in any way I personally could – just being a part of the broader group of folks elevating the Harris ticket, any opportunity I could [find] to talk about how scary the Trump administration would be in a second term,” Show told Aftermath. “That's what I was hoping to accomplish, [to add] my perspective, the perspective of a queer person that our rights are on the line in this election."&nbsp;</p><p>Show’s situation is also emblematic of another challenge creators faced: When political content isn’t what your audience is used to, how do you contort your approach to fit your surroundings? How do you avoid alienating portions of your audience with subject matter they might find divisive? Show opted to keep DNC videos off his main channels and instead bolster on-site efforts of collaborators while saving tales of his experiences for Fear&amp;, a podcast he does with Piker.&nbsp;</p><p>"It wasn't really native to me,” said Show. “I was going like, hey, how can I elevate other people's content – go on Hasan's stream or collaborate with other people that are more native when it comes to political content. I really enjoy it, but it's not really native to my social channels. I'm definitely not a stranger to talking about politics. I just like to do it in places that have more of an audience for it."</p><p>Others tried to jam a square peg into a round hole, to varying degrees of success.</p><p>"There was this yacht party the first day,” said Abughazaleh. “Two people that I actually really respect, that do great content, were doing a TikTok dance there, and they posted it after the DNC with a comment about 'We don't want private conversations. We want Palestinian representation' – all this stuff. But they were still dancing on the yacht in the background. That just felt kind of emblematic of a lot of this."</p><p>The yacht party, it turns out, was a lightning rod for conflicted feelings.&nbsp;</p><p>"There are people who were posting a lot from that yacht party and interviewing these people who were on there,” said Kelly, “but there are creators I spoke to who were like 'Yeah, [I went to the party], but I didn't post a lot of pictures from it because it felt weird with everything going on.' So I don't think it's lost on everyone."</p><p>Every creator to whom Aftermath spoke supports a ceasefire in Gaza, but the extent to which they directly covered the pro-Palestine protests around the DNC varies. Abughazaleh devoted significant focus to them, advocating for the DNC to bring a Palestinian American speaker on stage and livestreaming <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@katmabu/video/7406059035327253791?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Uncommitted Movement sit-in</a> that took place after the DNC refused their request. Show, meanwhile, stuck to the “I’ve Had It” podcast’s content plan, which was more focused on asking public figures comedically-oriented questions than interviewing protesters. </p><p>One Twitch streamer, <a href="https://x.com/gremloe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Austin "Gremloe" MacNamara</a>, wasn’t able to get credentialed for the DNC ahead of time, but he still opted to travel out to Chicago to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2230117484?filter=archives&amp;sort=time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cover the protests</a>. His approach was similar to that of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCugwC1ZMKk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other streamers who’ve attended previous pro-Palestine protests</a>: Spend time in the space, let protesters speak for themselves, and show viewers that these things are not unruly, inhuman mobs, but rather groups of people with reasonable demands – on-the-fly communities united by a common goal. There is still something to be said for articles and videos that succinctly depict what protests are about, but this unedited approach has allowed viewers to better understand the quiet moments – the mundanity, even – of movements they’ve been told to fear by traditional news outlets.</p><p>"Too often [protesters’] narrative is told for them,” MacNamara told Aftermath, “and I wanted to let my audience see it authentically for themselves while taking time to teach them about how protests work, such as the legal observers and marshals. The creators that were given credentials were entirely in their own bubble; those of us who weren't couldn't even see that bubble. There's a profound sense that access journalism is deeply entrenched in the Democratic party. We aren't taken seriously, especially those of us who are critical of the party."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The DNC did accept applications from and invite some creators on the left who’ve been openly critical of the Democratic party, but MacNamara doesn’t believe it was necessarily trying to give dissenting voices a seat at the table and demonstrate that it was taking their concerns seriously. Instead, he thinks the party was mostly trying to appeal to The Youths, and some of the most prominent political creators – like Piker – happen to lean further to the left than traditional news sources.&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't think the Democratic party cared about the creators beyond appealing to the youth vote,” MacNamara said. “It seemed more of a cynical identity politics play than an embrace of new media. The only prominent oppositional content creator that was given significant access was Hasan Piker, and it seemed like he was kicked out before Kamala took the stage."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I don't think the Democratic party cared about the creators beyond appealing to the youth vote. It seemed more of a cynical identity politics play than an embrace of new media.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Piker was, indeed, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2231129523?filter=archives&amp;sort=time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed a few hours early from a DNC suite</a> in which he was told he was going to be able to stream – and interview big names like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar – until the end of the final day, but at the time, the reason why was unclear. The next day, Piker claimed on Discord and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2231973008?filter=archives&amp;sort=time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a stream</a> that it was because he had been wearing a Palestinian flag and interviewing Uncommitted Movement delegates. However, he stopped short of providing a source for this information, saying that he couldn’t reveal who confirmed his suspicions on this front – only that they had.&nbsp;</p><p>"Did I confirm it? I did. Also, you saw it happen," Piker said during his first stream after the DNC, noting that he’d heard there was some friction between the Harris campaign, who wanted him there, and the DNC, which was iffier on the matter. "They didn't say 'Fuck off, you're done, we're revoking your access, you need to leave the premises.' ... But they made it as impossible for me to stream as possible."</p><p>The DNC did not respond to a request for comment from Aftermath about why Piker was removed from his suite on the final day.</p><p>Even so, during the stream, Piker went on to say that he was still “overall very, very happy with everything” and that, final day aside, he felt like he’d been granted “insane access,” in some cases on level with major networks like CNN and MSNBC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seeing so many in the community out doing the real work for Palestine has made me so proud of what I do. I'm incredibly grateful for being able to do what I do. <a href="https://t.co/DdyKWHFhjK">https://t.co/DdyKWHFhjK</a></p>— Austin MacNamara - Gremloe (@gremloe) <a href="https://twitter.com/gremloe/status/1826635045454709019?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>From a pure numbers standpoint, granting somebody like Piker that kind of access makes all the sense in the world. Again, his biggest broadcasts compete with those networks in terms of viewership. Many of his viewers rely on him as their primary news source. But over the years, Piker has repeatedly emphasized that he’s not a journalist, despite occasionally conducting interviews amid lengthy 8+-hour broadcasts. He views himself as a political commentator. Other content creators who at least dip their toes into the murky waters of politics label themselves similarly: They are hosts, entertainers, or outsiders with a penchant for occasionally breaking down current events.&nbsp;</p><p>But for viewers, the purpose they serve – especially at events like the DNC – is growing increasingly similar to that of journalism, sometimes even covering blind spots invisible to traditional press after years of working within entrenched systems. This comes with its own challenges: Creators might be able to talk about subjects like Palestine more freely than, say, a New York Times reporter, but they’re also not constrained by any particular code of ethics, except those enforced by their audiences.</p><p>Abughazaleh thinks the key, at this point, is for creators to recognize the difference between what they do and what journalists do – and to communicate it regularly.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think getting over yourself and stressing that difference is really important, because otherwise you're kind of like Tucker Carlson -- not in ideology, but he'd always say 'This is a news show' over and over again.”</p><p>That said, Abughazaleh also believes that sometimes creators end up in the same territory as journalists, and when they do, they need to recognize how important that work is no matter who’s doing it.</p><p>“I consider myself more of a creator, but I also do original reporting,” she said. “I'm currently working on a video that's requiring interviews, all this stuff. I would describe that as journalistic work. I would not describe one of my commentary videos as that. We just need to be really honest about it, and everyone needs to get over themselves and also recognize how important the press is."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/spiders-management-respond-to-allegations-made-by-stjv/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just a day ago, members of the Spiders game studio were speaking out about their experiences at the company in a <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/08/open-letter-from-spiders-workers-to-their-employer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20-page open letter</a>. This isn't the first time <a href="https://wccftech.com/members-of-spiders-go-on-strike-due-to-issues-within-the-company/">Spiders employees</a> have spoken out, as they spoke out in January and were met with silence. Today, Spiders management posted a public response to the allegations made by STJV (Syndicat des Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Video), one of the unions representing the studio members. In the response, they said the following:</p>
<p>"The false and even defamatory accusations made by STJV in no way reflect the day-to-day working life of the company's employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access release of Greedfall 2."</p>
<p>The statement also says that they have made unsuccessful attempts to reach out to a delegation of employees but will try again in the following week to contact them. Spiders management has stated that they are "committed to open and constructive social dialogue," to try and meet the demands or to negotiate terms that suit both parties.</p>
<p>For those who missed the open letter, members of the Spiders game company, responsible for games such as Greedfall and Steelrising, have written the open letter to try and make the environment healthier for those working at the company. They have been allegedly facing a myriad of issues while working at the company.</p>
<p>These issues include gender inequality and no job or financial security. There is no possibility of climbing the ladder within the company to get into senior roles, with people stuck in stagnant junior roles. Equally, plenty of those working at the company are now struggling to maintain their lives in Paris, as the city is increasingly expensive, and their wages are insufficient.</p>
<p>Spiders management's statement is signed off with, "Spiders' employees are at the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an inclusive and stimulating work environment in which every talent can flourish and of which we can all be proud."</p>
<p>Spiders is working on Greedfall 2: The Dying World, intending to release an Early Access version of the game in September. However, with the strikes starting shortly, it's uncertain whether they will meet the goal should negotiations not be successful for the employees developing the game. For now, Greedfall 2: The Dying World will be released in Early Access on 24 September 2024.</p>

The program was built off the back of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-store-shutdown-offline-july-2024-1851587402&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-store-shutdown-offline-july-2024-1851587402">Xbox 360’s marketplace</a></span>, which famously <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-tribute-retrospective-halo-3-red-ring-e3-1851609358&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-tribute-retrospective-halo-3-red-ring-e3-1851609358">became a haven for indie games</a></span> in the late ‘00s and early ‘10s, such as <em>Bastion </em>and the original <em>Geometry Wars</em>. Xbox remains a powerhouse for indies, thanks in no small part to their frequent releases on the platform’s Game Pass subscription service, which provides access to hundreds of games (many of them indies) on a rolling basis. Now, Xbox is holding a sale on a number of its ID@Xbox titles, and we’ve gone to the liberty of picking out a few games you should pick up. Alternatively, a few of these are available on Game Pass but, in my opinion, the last year has borne out that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">subscriptions are theft and ownership is the way forward</a></span>. Without further ado, comrades, the highlights of Xbox’s ongoing sale. </p></div><div><p><em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>Is one of my favorite games of the last several years. In the middle of the dreaded pandemic, I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/left-4-dead/left-4-dead&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/left-4-dead/left-4-dead" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rekindled my relationship with my closest friends</a></span> in the world over games like this and <em>Left 4 Dead</em>. Cooperative first-person shooters in which you face endless onslaughts of enemies are just a wondrous recipe for the most fun imaginable in games, and <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>taps that vein for all its worth. You are dwarves who are sent on hellish expeditions to mine resources for a blatantly awful corporation and I love how much <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>feels built to facilitate a workplace sitcom. You have a nightmare day in the mines, but when you come back to your base, there’s a bar that you can all drink and dance at, and there are small secrets and games hidden around for you to engage with you as you engage in idle late-night banter with your pals.</p><p>Besides that, <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em> is one of the most accessible live-service games, with a deeply welcoming and dorky community that yell “Rock and stone” at each other in passing. It has a seasonal model but every season is completely free, and the developers have even made it possible to go back and unlock every battle pass that has come and gone. The game’s also wildly deep, offering four distinct classes of character with their own weapons, tools, skill trees, and customization options. And if you want to be especially hardcore, you can always amp up the difficulty of your missions, or jump into endgame dives. <em><strong>Deep Rock </strong></em><strong>has something for everyone, and it’s a steal for just about $10, though it’s also available on Game Pass.</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Desert Child </em>is just plain old-school cool. Clearly developed by folks who love <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, it’s a game in which you vibe out to lo-fi hip hop, race people on hoverbikes in slickly animated sequences, and stop into ramen shops to refuel between bouts. Along the way, you also pick up odd jobs and bounties because despite your skill as a racer, you’re also flat broke.<strong> If you want relaxing meditations on the future of the gig economy in an anime-inspired pixel art game that’s short and sweet, you can’t go wrong picking up </strong><em><strong>Desert Child</strong></em><strong> for just $3.</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent </em>is probably the single most important horror game of the 2010s. Inspiring a handful of imitators that have seemed to lap it ever since, like the <em>Outlast </em>games, <em>Amnesia </em>gave rise to the genre of horror titles that disempowered the player character. Rather than provide tools or weapons to combat the terrors with, <em>Amnesia </em>has always leaned into the notion that these nightmares are absolutely terrifying things that we’re better served running away from. <em>Amnesia</em> plunged players into darkness, asking them to take care of their sanity and flee from things that dare lurk in the dark.</p><p>Since the first game was released, <em>Amnesia </em>has spawned a series of increasingly weird and experimental games, including <em>Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs </em>and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-amnesia-the-bunker-review-release-date-ps5-xbox-1850507768&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-amnesia-the-bunker-review-release-date-ps5-xbox-1850507768">immersive sim <em>Amnesia: The Bunker</em></a></span>. <strong>Though <em>The Bunker</em> is available on Game Pass, it is also on sale for $10 bucks right now. <em>Amnesia: Collection </em>(compiling <em>The Dark Descent, A Machine for Pigs, </em>and<em> Justine</em>) is going for $4.49. Another sequel, titled </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/amnesia-rebirth-makes-motherhood-scary-1845513177&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/amnesia-rebirth-makes-motherhood-scary-1845513177"><em><strong>Amnesia: Rebirth</strong></em></a></span><strong><em>, </em>is also available for the same price.</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Gang Beasts </em>has been a staple of game nights forever. A party game all about flopping around while duking it out with your friends, <em>Gang Beasts </em>is a certifiable good time, especially if y’all are already feeling a little silly. The joy of <em>Gang Beasts, </em>as well as similar games like <em>Party Animals</em>, is in how messy it is. They’re games built to be taken as jokes, and because of that, they are the easiest to get into. Seriously, suggest this to your game night friends, or throw it on if you’re having a party, and I’m sure it’ll have its fans by the end of the night. <strong>You can pick up </strong><em><strong>Gang Beasts </strong></em><strong>for $8 or alternatively check it out on Game Pass. </strong></p></div><div><p>Do not let <em>Overland</em>’s cute polygonal look fool you, this tactics game is <em>tough</em>. But therein lies the satisfying feeling of triumph that <em>Overland</em>’s so good at producing. Part strategy game, part roadtrip survival sim, <em>Overland </em>is a grueling trek across post-apocalyptic America where subterranean aliens threaten your ability to simply refuel your car, which you need to maneuver to the end of every stage in order to succeed and live to see another day. Because there is such a scarcity of things in the apocalypse, <em>Overland </em>is much more about making the best of a constantly shitty hand than ever growing into some all-powerful brute that wipes the floor with any challenge. <strong>It’s a different take on a strategy game that I don’t think got a fair shake when it first came out, but you can fix that by picking up </strong><em><strong>Overland </strong></em><strong>for $8.</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Paradise Killer </em>is the only game I’m recommending purely based on the praise of everyone around me. I’ve heard time and time again that this visual novel features some of the best writing of the last few years, and wraps it up in gorgeous character art and a wonderful premise about unraveling the mystery of a serial killer on an island dubbed a paradise. <strong>If vaporwave aesthetics and a game I’ve heard is more or less like “if </strong><em><strong>Ace Attorney </strong></em><strong>fucked” rings any amount of bells for you, you might want to get in on </strong><em><strong>Paradise Killer </strong></em><strong>for $6. </strong></p></div><div><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>Sable </em>is one of the most gorgeous games I’ve played. Rendered in a completely arresting visual style, <em>Sable </em>is like a pacifist’s 3D <em>Zelda </em>game. You are the young Sable as she embarks on her Gliding, a kind of coming-of-age ritual that members of her nomadic tribe must make at a certain point in their lifetimes. In practice, you spend the game piloting her hoverbike over the most beautiful desert, going from town to town sifting through people’s troubles, and trying to piece together the person that Sable wants to be. At the end of the game, you must pick a mask that’ll communicate to the world what that is. It is one of the most overlooked games of the last few years, it’s endlessly charming, and you can look at it all day and still constantly find new things to be in awe of. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sable-the-kotaku-review-1847762599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sable-the-kotaku-review-1847762599"><strong><em>Sable </em>is an absolute must-have game</strong></a></span><strong> and you can pick it up for $8.74.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>The <em>Warhammer </em>games have been around forever, but it does feel like they’ve been enjoying a bit of a renaissance of late. A lot of folks are looking forward to the upcoming release of <em>Space Marine 2</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076">which looks great</a></span>, but if you’re looking for a different speed of game to enjoy with friends, perhaps consider <em>Vermintide 2 </em>and/or <em>Darktide</em>. These cooperative first-person shooters are similar in style to <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>and <em>Left 4 Dead</em>, though they hew closer to the latter thanks to their mission-based gameplay. <em>Vermintide 2 </em>is a perennial favorite, having been supported for a number of years with free and paid DLC that added new missions and character classes to the dark-fantasy game. If <em>Warhammer</em>’s traditional sci-fi trappings are more your speed like they are mine, <em>Darktide, </em>which released just about two years ago, should be up your alley. Though it started out in a rough spot, <em>Darktide </em>is doing better these days, and the developer behind both has shifted the bulk of its resources to supporting <em>Darktide </em>well into the future. <strong>You can pick up </strong><em><strong>Darktide</strong></em><strong>’s imperial edition for $24 and the ultimate edition of </strong><em><strong>Vermintide 2 </strong></em><strong>(packing some hefty paid expansions) for $11.</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Enter the Gungeon </em>is just a blisteringly ludicrous game. If you need the elevator pitch beyond that incredible name, here it is: you are a Gungeoneer who must plumb the depths of procedurally generated dungeons filled with enemies themed after guns and bullets—all the while picking up increasingly exotic weapons yourself—in order to find a gun to kill the past. Need I say much more? I will anyways. <em>Enter The Gungeon </em>is a game I’ve never beaten, but one that I’ve frequently enjoyed watching, especially at charity speedrunning events like Awesome Games Done Quick. Seeing everything the game has to offer, including content across numerous free updates, always leaves me craving a return to the gungeon, which has some of the most dynamic gameplay ever seen in a roguelike. It feels good to play and features hilarious gun puns, I don’t know what more you could want from a game. <strong>You, too, can become a pun-spewing gungeoneer by picking up </strong><em><strong>Enter the Gungeon </strong></em><strong>for $4.49. </strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At the end of the day, every pro-style controller for Xbox ultimately competes with Xbox's Elite Series 2 controller, which has been the gold standard in the premium controller market for years. Each of its main competitors so far have excelled in their own ways, with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Remappable-Customizable-Console/dp/B0CQ3NL4QG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Remappable-Customizable-Console/dp/B0CQ3NL4QG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro BFG</a> offering a unique modular design and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Wireless-Controller-Licensed-Xbox-X/dp/B0CJVQFZ1S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Wireless-Controller-Licensed-Xbox-X/dp/B0CJVQFZ1S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra</a> sporting the most robust internal customization features. The Wolverine V3 Pro is an all-around success that surpasses its third-party competitors and stands toe-to-toe with the Elite Series 2.</p><h3>Wolverine V3 Pro's most impactful changes</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358722-razerwolverinev3pro.png" data-ref-id="1300-4358722" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358722-razerwolverinev3pro.png" data-ref-id="1300-4358722"></a><figcaption>Razer Wolverine V3 Pro wireless controller for Xbox and PC</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358722-razerwolverinev3pro.png"></figure><p>Naturally, the biggest surface-level change with the V3 Pro is its wireless connection. Razer has released several Wolverine controllers for Xbox over the years, all of which were restricted to a wired connection. The manufacturer often mentioned latency as a reason why wired was better for a pro-style style controller, but it also wasn't able to make one due to Microsoft's in-house wireless protocols. Wireless connections have come a long way in recent years, and while wired controllers still <em>technically </em>offer the fastest response times, technologies such as Razer's HyperSpeed wireless make latency with a good wireless controller, synced with a good protocol, virtually impossible to notice.</p><p>Razer utilized its HyperSpeed wireless connection with the V2 Pro, a PS5 and PC controller, and the V3 Pro communicates the same way with the 2.4GHz USB dongle. I tested the controller for over 30 hours the last few weeks and didn't notice any input latency. But for discerning players who take competition seriously, you can still use a wired connection with the braided 10-foot USB-C cable. On PC, there's a dedicated feature for wired play called Tournament Mode. Once enabled, the V3 Pro has a 1000Hz polling rate. I didn't notice a performance difference, but maybe you will. Regardless, if you're used to wireless controllers on Xbox, you won't be disappointed with the wireless connection here. I maxed out at around 20 hours of battery life on a full charge.</p><p>The lack of a wireless connection has always been the biggest downside with Razer's Xbox controllers, but the V3 Pro also addresses a few other important issues. Though Hall Effect analog sticks are quickly becoming a routine feature in pro-style and even budget controllers, this is the first Wolverine controller to make use of the technology that prevents analog stick drift. Sticks that activate via Hall Effect sensors aren't the same quality from controller to controller; the V3 Pro's lightweight sticks have the smoothest range of motion I've tried. They have just the right amount of resistance for precise movements. It's not really a fair comparison since the technology is different, but the difference between these sticks and those of the Wolverine V2 Pro is quite noticeable.</p><p>It's not a new feature, but you can swap out the default sticks with two other styles: one taller stick that's typically used for first-person shooters and a dome stick. It would've been nice to get two dome sticks, but it only comes with one of each.</p><p>My longstanding complaint with the Wolverine line has been the back triggers. Simply put, they never made sense. Up until now, Razer arranged the four triggers in two columns close to the center of the controller, forcing many players like myself to tweak their grip to rest our fingers on the triggers. Razer has finally ditched that design, completely retooling the shape and location of the four back triggers to follow standard conventions. The four built-in triggers are shaped like paddles and curve across the handles. This design combined with an excellent form factor and textured handles--it's very similar to the V2 Chroma in shape and chassis feel--makes holding the V3 Pro for hours a consistently comfortable experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358682-razerwolverinev3proback.png" data-ref-id="1300-4358682" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358682-razerwolverinev3proback.png" data-ref-id="1300-4358682"></a><figcaption>The V3 Pro revamps the Wolverine's back button design.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358682-razerwolverinev3proback.png"></figure><p>When Razer released the V2 Pro for PS5, I was quite surprised it didn't come with a hardshell carrying case, especially since it was the priciest officially licensed PS5 controller at $250. Thankfully, the Wolverine V3 Pro does come with a hardshell carrying case with a formfitting recess for the controller, snug compartments for the extra sticks and dongle, and a mesh pocket for the USB-C cable.</p><h3>The return of the microswitch king</h3><p>Microswitch inputs might soon become a trend. Turtle Beach featured them in its Stealth Ultra, and PowerA used them in its upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Lumectra-Charging-Console/dp/B0D8TB5MM8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Lumectra-Charging-Console/dp/B0D8TB5MM8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">OPS V3 Pro</a>--the prolific manufacturer's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/poweras-new-ops-v3-pro-controller-punches-above-its-price/1100-6525934/" data-ref-id="1100-6525934" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/poweras-new-ops-v3-pro-controller-punches-above-its-price/1100-6525934/">best and most premium PC controller</a>. But if microswitches over membranes becomes a trend, Razer would be the pioneer of that shift.</p><p>The Wolverine V3 Pro retains Razer's "mecha-tactile" face buttons, D-pad, and bumpers--RB and LB as well as the small M1 and M2 bonus bumpers next to them. They feel great and offer a speediness you won't find in controllers with traditional buttons. I know some people who can't stand the mouse-click sound of these buttons, but if you enjoy them, it could be hard to return to membrane inputs. Razer's microswitches are still the best I've used in a controller. A long history creating some of the best gaming mice certainly gives Razer an edge with this technology.</p><p>Though I really enjoy the eight-way D-pad, which has a "loose" feel to it--Razer calls it a "floating D-pad"--it does take some time getting used to. And unlike many other pro-style controllers, you can't swap the D-pad for a different style. This is one of the areas where the Elite Series 2 still wins. The two extra analog sticks are the only swappable components, so physical customization is very limited with the Wolverine V3 Pro. It does have built-in trigger locks, though with only two pull settings, full or instant (essentially turns RT and LT into bumpers).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358724-razercarryingcase.png" data-ref-id="1300-4358724" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358724-razercarryingcase.png" data-ref-id="1300-4358724"></a><figcaption>The Wolverine V3 Pro comes with a nice hardshell carrying case.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358724-razercarryingcase.png"></figure><p>Most of the customization is done inside the Razer Controller App for Windows and Xbox. The software suite has an easy-to-navigate interface and lets you make tweaks to a variety of settings, including stick sensitivity, haptics strength, and RGB lighting effects for the Razer logo. This is also where you remap the six extra buttons and create custom profiles that can be cycled through on the fly with the controller's multi-function settings button.</p><h3>The bottom line</h3><p>The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro is a competitive controller that's difficult to knock in any area. The Elite Series 2 has more physical customization options, Bluetooth support, better battery life, and remains unrivaled when it comes to general feel--there's just something about the weightiness of the Elite Series 2 that makes it hard to beat. That said, the V3 Pro has superior analog sticks, buttons, remappable rear triggers, and comparable software customization features.</p><p>Compared to previous Wolverine Xbox controllers, it's really no contest. The V3 Pro is vastly superior to the V2 Chroma and V2 Pro. Even if you want a wired controller, you should probably opt for the Razer Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition. We didn't test this other new model, but it has the same general design with a wired-only connection for $100. The V3 Tournament Edition is compatible with Xbox and PC, too.</p><div title="[Various] Razer Wolverine V3 Pro Controller" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2626" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Razer Wolverine V3 Pro Controller" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console\/dp\/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro Wireless Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console\/dp\/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$200 | For Xbox and PC</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li>2.4GHz Wireless on Xbox and PC</li><li>Wired Tournament Mode with 1000Hz polling rate on PC</li><li>Four remappable back triggers</li><li>Two remappable claw bumpers</li><li>Swappable Hall Effect analog sticks (Two extra styles)</li><li>Mecha-tactile face buttons and D-pad</li><li>Hardshell carrying case</li><li>10-foot braided USB-C charging cable</li></ul></div>                      </div><hr><p><em>Disclosure: Razer provided GameSpot with a sample unit for testing.</em></p>

                <p>Metal Gear Solid 4 remains solely available on PlayStation 3, but that situation might finally be changing. Fans have long called for the game to be ported to other platforms, and those voices only became louder with the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection being dubbed "Volume 1." Although Volume 2 has not yet been announced, Konami has teased that MGS4 could be a part of such a release.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-about-metal-gear-solid-4-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-stay-tuned-konami-says" rel="nofollow ">While speaking to IGN in an interview</a>, Konami producer Noriaki Okamura was asked if Metal Gear Solid 4 would ever come to modern consoles. This prompted Okamura to say that the studio is aware of the situation surrounding Metal Gear Solid 4.</p><p dir="ltr">"Unfortunately, we can't really say too much at the moment with Vol. 1 containing MGS 1-3 dot dot dot… you can probably connect the dots! Right now, we still are internally concerned about what we should be doing for the future of the series. So sorry, we can't really reveal anything at the moment. But stay tuned!"</p><p dir="ltr">This wasn't the only time Metal Gear Solid 4 was teased. Earlier last year, David Hayter, the voice of Solid Snake, posted a photo of themselves next to Old Snake.</p><p dir="ltr">To add more fuel to this speculative fire, shortly after the first Master Collection was released, a Reddit user released a string of code that was from the collection's launcher. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collections-code-is-seemingly-hiding-references-to-mgs4-and-more/1100-6518662/">The code contained placeholders for various Metal Gear games, including Metal Gear Solid 4.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Metal Gear Solid 4 was originally launched in 2008. Since then, nearly all of the mainline games have seen various ports, such as Metal Gear Solid 1, 2, and even Peace Walker, which originally launched on the PSP.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Metal Gear news, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-stays-loyal-to-the-mission/1100-6526099/" data-ref-id="1100-6526099">our preview for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, in which Dan Ryckert wrote, "All signs point to Delta being the Snake Eater remake that fans have wanted for years."</p>
