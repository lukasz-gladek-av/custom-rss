		<p>Bioware have announced a full reveal of the next Dragon Age game on Tuesday June 11th 2024 but ahead of that they have revealed the title, Dragon Age The Veilguard. Well, that’s what the image shows, Bioware write it with a colon, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, so who knows which is correct.</p>



<p>“After Dragon Age: Inquisition launched, the studio was given an incredible opportunity to explore, test, and validate a variety of gameplay concepts as we worked to determine what the next Dragon Age could look like,” explains Gary McKay,&nbsp; Executive Producer, for Dragon Age, and General Manager at BioWare.</p>
<p>“We brought everything to the table which, yes, even included a multiplayer concept. The time we spent experimenting and iterating gradually taught us a lot. This work, and the amazing support from EA, helped us re-focus on creating an incredible single player game, with all the choices, characters and world building you’d expect from us.”</p>

<p>He confirms that you play as a brand new character and will be supported by “seven unique” companions. “You’ll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world. Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions – not your enemies – are the heart of this new experience,” adds Gary.</p>
<p>The full reveal on Tuesday June 11th at 8:00am PT (a very pleasant 16:00 BST for us here in the UK) will include over 15 minutes of gameplay&nbsp; from the start of the game, You will be able to watch via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dragonage"><strong>Dragon Age YouTube channel.</strong></a></p>
<p>Bioware had previously revealed that Dragon Age Dreadwolf, the old title for the game, takes place in a world where the legend of Solas has grown, with different people having different opinions of him. To some he is an elven god while to others an individual that betrayed people who trusted him. Some see him as someone who is there to save others, but at a great cost. How much that of still relevant remains to be seen, it seems like the game has been reworked in the past year.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft is reportedly working on a remaster of Bungie's classic first-person shooter Halo: Combat Evolved and is eyeing up a PlayStation release - alongside multi-console releases for the likes of Hellbalde 2 and the next Doom - potentially marking a landmark moment for one of Xbox's most recognisable exclusives.
</p>
<p>
That's according to The Verge's Tom Warren, who (in the site's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024">paywalled Notepad newsletter</a>) says a new Halo: Combat Evolved remaster is currently in the early stages of development. It's one of several new games reportedly being considered for Project Latitude - Microsoft's internal name for its new multi-console release strategy - following multi-console launches for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-did-we-think-of-microsofts-multiplatform-xbox-soft-launch">Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Pentiment, and Hi-Fi Rush</a> earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
Other Xbox games currently being considered for a multi-console release are said to include Doom: The Dark Ages (seemingly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-trademark-offers-doom-hint-as-suggestion-of-an-imminent-reveal-swirls">set for a reveal</a> during this weekend's Xbox Games Showcase), Hellblade 2, Starfield, Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, and Age of Mythology.

<p>
Warren notes this doesn't mark a full multi-console strategy shift for Microsoft, with the company still retaining some titles as Xbox exclusives. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-6-will-be-announced-in-june-leak-suggests">Gears 6</a>, Playground Games' Fable reboot, and We Happy Few developer Compulsion's South of Midnight - all set to feature in this weekend's showcase according to Warren, with the latter two likely getting 2025 release dates - are reportedly <em>not</em> currently being considered for a multi-console release.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time we've heard Microsoft is considering bringing more Xbox titles to other consoles, of course. Reports <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-mulls-major-xbox-exclusives-starfield-indiana-jones-for-playstation-5-reports">surfaced in February</a> claiming Starfield had been earmarked for a potential PlayStation release, alongside MachineGames' upcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.
</p>
<p>
In May, it was reported Microsoft executives have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-bosses-reportedly-pushing-for-no-red-line-around-which-xbox-games-launch-on-playstation">pushing for a no "red line" approach</a> to bringing Xbox titles to PlayStation and Nintendo platforms, in a bid to increase margins. That claim came in the wake of last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-buying-zenimax-parent-company-of-bethesda-id-software-and-more-report">$69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, and Microsoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">close a number of Bethesda studios</a> - including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall studio Arkane Austin - as it refocuses on what it called "priority games".
</p>
<p>
There's no word on when Microsoft might announce a fresh batch of multi-console releases for its Xbox titles, but Warren says he's not expecting any Project Latitude news during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-showcase-2024-time-date-where-to-watch">Sunday's Xbox Games Showcase</a>. That's being livestreamed at 6pm UK time (10am PT, 1pm ET) on 9th June, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-alert-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch">an hour-long Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 presentation</a> will air immediately after.

<p id="s340IZ"><strong>Director:</strong> Philip Kaufman <br><strong>Cast:</strong> Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Prime Video </p>
<p id="n35rFj"><em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> has a timeless, perfect premise: What if the people you know weren’t themselves anymore? What if they had been replaced by something that looked like them, talked like them, and remembered like them, but didn’t feel the same? It’s viscerally upsetting, even as an idea, which is probably why this story has been remade nearly a dozen times since the original was released in 1956.</p>
<p id="h0T8kG">But for all the remakes, the 1978 version of the movie stands out as a particular highlight. Starring Donald Sutherland and Leonard Nimoy, Philip Kaufman’s version of the story imagines a San Francisco slowly overrun by aliens who steal the faces of humans. The lurking paranoia of the original movie is similarly on display in this one, but its real step up is in the effects department. </p>
<p id="pe9G47">Where the original movie left the body snatching mostly to the audience’s imagination, this version shows the process in all its gross, gooey, alien detail. Fresh, formless bodies slide out of pods while sentient threads of plant fur creep across victims, giving details and features to the newly printed doubles, all before the person’s old body disintegrates. It’s a wildly effective, extremely off-putting effect that the movie makes tremendous use of to both heighten its paranoid atmosphere and justify it. All that, and the movie has one of the greatest endings in horror movie history. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="mRWneQ"><em>Annihilation </em>might be the creepiest movie about plants ever made (with all due respect to <em>The Ruins</em>.)</p>
<p id="BbGnjc"><em>Annihilation </em>follows a group of scientists (played by a phenomenal group of actors) investigating an area struck by a meteor. The area that was hit has slowly spread and grown into what’s now known as The Shimmer, an area where nature seems to be taking over everything around it, but it’s a different kind of nature; strange, unnaturally green plants grow over everything, and creatures (animals and humans) slowly merge with the vegetation around them. At the center of all of this is a lighthouse the group must reach. <em>Annihilation</em> helps realize this strange Earth-but-not incredibly well, with beautiful and haunting production design and a finale as memorable as any horror movie on this list. — <em>AG</em></p>

<p id="8Rp2pG">Sequels to <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> are very dicey propositions. After <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23933306/blair-witch-2-book-shadows-what-the-heck-happened"><em>Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2</em></a> was greeted as a disaster immediately after release, the franchise stalled out and the idea of returning to the black forest faded from the minds of aspiring horror filmmakers. But in 2016, writer Simon Barrett and director Adam Wingard, the duo behind the excellent <em>You’re Next</em>, went back into the woods for a new <em>Blair Witch</em> sequel. And it’s actually pretty great.</p>
<p id="YcwX2r">The movie follows James Donahue, the brother of Heather from the first movie, as he sets out to investigate what happened to his sister. James and some friends, including film student Lisa, set out on an adventure through the Maryland woods and, of course, run into some very creepy activity when they get there.</p>
<p id="p8vRw3"><em>Blair Witch</em> isn’t interested in trying to recapture the formal magic of the first movie, exactly. There’s no mistaking this one for a documentary, and there’s clearly a lot more going on production-wise than a few kids in the woods with a video camera. It’s decidedly a studio version of found footage, but that isn’t a bad thing; it means the movie is full of delicately framed shots that really capture and amplify the terror of this new group of kids stuck in the woods. And when things really start to pop off in the second half, it means that we get careful, tantalizing, terrifying glimpses of whatever lurks in the darkness, but never too much to ruin the scare. <em>—AG</em></p>

<p id="9y5m2v"><em>Climax </em>isn’t for the faint-of-heart — and we’re saying that in the context of a horror movies list. The movie is set at an all-night dance party inside a gymnasium, which turns sour after someone spikes the sangria with a little too much LSD. <em>Climax </em>is told in beautifully disorienting long takes that go from dozens of minutes of uninterrupted and propulsive dance sequences to hazy walks through hallways as the camera mimics the dizzy stumbling of the movie’s characters. As the psychedelics kick in, so too do some of the attendees’ long-held feuds, leading to disastrous and horrifying consequences. It’s rare that a movie truly defies description, but if you’ve got a strong stomach and a will to see something you haven’t before, <em>Climax </em>is the perfect movie for you. —<em>AG</em></p>

What the fuck is it doing to our bodies? We don’t really know, but David Cronenberg’s 2022 body horror drama sure has an idea of what it might mean for our children. <em>Crimes of the Future</em> imagines a world where humans have lost the ability to feel pain. In addition to that, several people have developed a disturbing disorder which causes their bodies to spontaneously spawn new organs. </p>
<p id="S7SFTU">This new reality has spawned a trend: Live surgery, wherein performance artists plagued with this condition tear into their own bodies in an effort to shape meaning out of this strange new biological fact. Viggo Mortensen stars as Saul Tenser, a world-renowned performance artist who, alongside his partner Caprice (Léa Seydoux), stands on the cutting edge — both literally and figuratively — of this cultural phenomenon. When Saul’s activities catch the attention of a mysterious group of evolutionary activists, as well as the lascivious eye of a government employee named Timlin (Kristen Stewart), he’s forced to confront what he — and everyone else around him — is changing into, and whether what that is can even be considered “human” anymore.</p>
<p id="17fGm2">As macabre as it is moving, grotesque as it is sensuous; <em>Crimes of the Future</em> is an exquisite work of science fiction horror where surgery is the new sex and our very bodies have rebelled against us for the incalculable destruction we have inflicted on the planet. It’s a film that exists in intimate conversation with the anxieties of our present, as well as one that represents a stunning return to form for one of cinema’s most forward-thinking directors. Howard Shore’s growling, guttural score is engrossing, while the leading trio of performances by Mortensen, Seydoux, and Stewart are a virtual match made in heaven in bringing to life this speculative slice of post-human hell on Earth. In short: It’s a great film and highly recommended, but whatever you do, don’t see it on a full stomach. Trust me. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="qGpR9z">Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s 1997 horror masterpiece <em>Cure</em> follows Kenichi Takabe (Kōji Yakusho), a Japanese detective frustrated by an inexplicable rash of seemingly unconnected murders that nevertheless all appear to be connected, despite none of the perpetrators having known each other or having any recollection as to what possessed them to do it. When Takabe’s investigation leads him to a suspect, a student of psychology and mesmerism known as Mamiya (Masato Hagiwara), he finds himself plunged into a conspiracy that threatens to engulf anyone who gets too close.</p>
<p id="EXTxxj">In <em>Cure</em>, violence is less an act of premeditation or passion as it is a virus, coursing its way through the bloodstream of society, corrupting innocent bystanders not unlike aberrant cancer cells attacking from within without ever understanding why they did so in the first place. How do you confront a horror like that, much less stop it? The answer is as simple as it is terrifying: You can’t. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="5wByHh"><strong>Director: </strong>Sammo Hung<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Sammo Hung, Chung Fat, Dick Wei<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Criterion Channel</p>
<p id="lyXKZ6">This <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23893288/best-halloween-horror-movies-tv-watch-stream">Halloween</a>, I had one goal: Finally watch Sammo Hung’s jiangshi (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23938529/hong-kong-horror-jiangshi-movies-china-mr-vampire">Chinese hopping vampire</a>) martial arts comedy <em>Encounters of the Spooky Kind. </em>It was finally added to streaming via the Criterion Channel earlier this fall after years of being unavailable digitally. And reader, my priorities were correct, because this movie is an absolute blast.</p>
<p id="yPMhXm">Best known for his collaborations with childhood friends Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao, Sammo’s excellence as a director, choreographer, and performer are on full display in what is frequently a one-man show.</p>
<p id="oJ9Td0">Sammo directed the movie, co-wrote it, choreographed the action, and stars as Bold Cheung, a pedicab driver and skilled martial artist who’s also kind of a dolt. He is dared to spend the night in a haunted house with a hopping vampire — a dare he accepts, because he is “Bold” Cheung, after all. What follows is a Looney Tunes-style slapstick action horror movie with legitimate scares (the vampire makeup is terrific: gray with a gross texture, like a wet papier-mâché mask), dazzling rhythmic martial arts choreography, and perfectly placed dashes of comedy (there’s even an extended<em> Duck Soup</em> homage).</p>
<p id="SLcAXo">Sammo is truly one of the greatest directors to ever do it, but he doesn’t get the proper credit globally because of the genres (and nation) he’s primarily worked in. The jaw-dropping choreography and onslaught of funny bits are outstanding, but it’s his skill with the camera that has always separated Sammo from his counterparts. </p>
<p id="cdul4X">Bringing it back to his old friend Yuen Biao for a second — Biao co-stars as the silent vampire, and does a terrific job selling the undead creature’s fight sequences with stiff limbs and startling hops. This movie is colorful, funny, scary, tense, and an incredibly fun time. If you like the Evil Dead movies, this is one you must check out; Sam Raimi basically directly ripped one of <em>Spooky Kind</em>’s fight sequences for <em>Evil Dead II</em>. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="9GgpBw">Georges Franju’s influential 1960 film is a master class in supernatural fantasy horror. An unsettling tale about a plastic surgeon (played by Pierre Brasseur) who kidnaps young women and performs surgery on them to try and find a face replacement for his daughter (Édith Scob), <em>Eyes Without a Face </em>is equal parts haunting and beautiful. Scob’s iconic face mask in the movie was later referenced in her role in the also-excellent <em>Holy Motors</em> many decades later. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="0ohmYp"><strong>Director:</strong> Clive Barker<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Andrew Robinson, Clare Higgins, Ashley Laurence<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Prime Video, AMC+, Tubi, Pluto, Hoopla</p>
<p id="havgCr">Clive Barker’s 1987 directorial debut adapts his 1986 novella <em>The Hellbound Heart</em> to tell the story of Larry (Andrew Robinson) and Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins). The Cottons are a married couple who move into the home of Larry’s recently deceased brother, Frank (Sean Chapman), with whom Julia had a previous affair. After inadvertently being resurrected by a drop of blood spilled by Larry on the floor of the house’s attic, Frank seduces Julia into luring new men to the house so that he can drain their life force and fully regain his mortal form. Surrounding this core narrative is the the story of the Lament Configuration, a puzzle box Frank acquired before his untimely death. When solved, it conjures hellish beings known as Cenobites to the mortal plane of existence, which indulge in hellish exercises of sadomasochistic mutilation. Easily the best and most enduring of the Hellraiser movie series, Barker’s 1987 original is a must-watch for horror fans. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="p0O1hk"><em>Hereditary </em>is a victim of its own success. The poster child for the misguided term “elevated horror,” and the subject of more than a few memes (particularly around telephone poles), the thing that often gets lost about <em>Hereditary </em>is that it’s actually really fucking good. And it’s damn scary too.</p>
<p id="hrhmX5">The movie follows Annie Graham, a difficult mother of two, who just lost her mom. During the funeral service, Annie notices quite a few people are here to mourn the mother she thought had no friends. She eventually learns this group of old people all belonged to the same bizarre semi-cult her mother did. And that’s where the witchy stuff starts.</p>
<p id="PCQN3C">From there everything descends into a complicated mishmash of tightly coiled family drama, supernatural plotting, and years-old resentments, and it’s absolutely excellent. Who’s to say which is scarier in this movie, the verbal immolation or the literal one?</p>
<p id="g8wWbk">Even if you’ve seen it already, you probably owe this movie a rewatch. You definitely remember that it’s good, but you probably don’t remember just how great it really is. <em>Hereditary </em>is elegantly creepy, right up until the point that it becomes terrifying. You can’t really ask any more from a horror movie than that. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="33mXkZ"><em>The Host </em>was Bong Joon-ho’s follow-up to the smash success serial killer drama <em>Memories of Murder</em>. A critical and commercial success, it was the highest-grossing South Korean film ever after its release and won Best Film at the Asian Film Awards and the Blue Dragon Film Awards.</p>
<p id="C7m0S5">Years after chemicals are dumped into the Han River, a huge mutated fish monster emerges and kidnaps a young girl. Her father (Song Kang-ho) sets out to find and rescue her, before being kidnapped by the American scientists responsible for its existence. A fun monster thriller that doubles as insightful commentary on U.S. intervention, ecological disasters, and much more, <em>The Host </em>is a high mark in Bong’s impressive filmography. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="kyYjV6"><strong>Director</strong>: John Carpenter<br><strong>Cast</strong>: Sam Neill, Julie Carmen, Jurgen Prochnow<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, YouTube</p>
<p id="Ti4pO1">Among the wildest movies John Carpenter has ever made (and that’s saying something), <em>In the Mouth of Madness</em> follows insurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill), who is hired to find a missing fame horror novelist. Things become increasingly unhinged as the plots of the author’s books and the various monsters seem to invade the real world. Neill, a staple of this list, is absolutely fantastic responding to the horrors of hell, slowly becoming exactly as off-kilter as they are. By the time the movie makes it to the third act, the door to hell is halfway open and Trent is ready to dive headfirst into the void, which is honestly how every movie’s third act should go.</p>
<p id="U3T7ul">This is also the third in Carpenter’s apocalypse trilogy, which also includes two other stone-cold classics, <em>The Thing</em> and <em>Prince of Darkness</em>. They aren’t on this list, but you should watch them anyway. — <em>AG</em></p>

<p id="oj9rcm"><strong>Director:</strong> Tomas Alfredson<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Kåre Hedebrant, Lina Leandersson, Per Ragnar<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Hoopla, Kanopy, Plex</p>
<p id="fvqNIS">A 12-year-old Swedish boy finds a friend in a vampire who looks roughly his age, but is actually an old vampire permanently trapped in the body of a young child. The film is kaleidoscopic, each viewing revealing something different than the last. The first time I saw the film, I was a pessimistic college student, and I read the central relationship as a warning about the parasitic nature of love. After college, the children’s bond reminded me of the impermanence of youth, and why growing up is a mixed blessing. This past year, I was far more focused on the girl’s relationship with her caretaker, an older man who sacrifices everything for her existence.</p>
<p id="Ys5Hv7">The film was adapted from John Ajvide Lindqvist’s 2004 novel of the same name, which inspired not just this Swedish film, but a 2010 American adaptation, a comic-book prequel, and two stage plays. The latter has its own legacy — it was adapted by the magnificent National Theater of Scotland, and it eventually had a run at St. Ann’s Warehouse in 2015. Few books inspire so much additional great art. So I suppose I’m recommending the book just as much as the film. —<em>Chris Plante</em></p>

<p id="P04uFA"><strong>Director: </strong>James Wan<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Annabelle Wallis, Maddie Hasson, George Young<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Max, Tubi</p>
<p id="FO98NP">There was just no way to see it coming. After the Conjuring and Insidious franchises, plus blockbuster turns with <em>Furious 7</em> and <em>Aquaman</em>, James Wan could have cashed in chips to make another moody franchise-starter to stretch his jump-scare muscles. Instead, he made <em>Malignant</em>, a high-emotion <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22732575/giallo-movies-explained">giallo</a> stuffed into dingy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22674065/horror-movies-like-malignant">’90s direct-to-video pastiche</a> like some kind of horror-movie turducken. Wan pulls back the layers in an almost tedious fashion: The pregnant Madison (Annabelle Wallis) is first the victim of domestic abuse, then she encounters another killer, and <em>then</em> she starts dealing with psychotic episodes tied to her childhood imaginary friend Gabriel, and <em>theeeeen</em> it’s revealed… Well, please go behold it.</p>
<p id="m53ap6">Strung together with a melodramatic cover of The Pixies’ “Where Is My Mind,” reveling in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22738928/horror-movie-tropes-explained">horror tropes</a> to the point of parody, the final twists of <em>Malignant</em> are some of the most gratifying lunacy of the year, and the acrobatic actor Marina Mazepa brings it all home in a display of gruesome ballet. I won’t explain anything more out of fear of spoilers — just get on the <em>Malignant</em> train. Wan put his dream (nightmare?) on screen for us all to enjoy. —<em>Matt Patches</em></p>

<p id="5UE6L7"><strong>Director:</strong> Frank Darabont<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Freevee</p>
<p id="IldJcB">Any fan of Stephen King worth their salt knows that the so-called king of horror has a lot of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23056636/stephen-king-movies-best-adaptations-list">movie adaptations of his work</a>. Few films have managed to eclipse, let alone successfully adapt, King’s capacity for horror storytelling, with the exception of (a) Stanley Kubrick’s <em>The Shining</em> and (b) Frank Darabont’s <em>The Mist</em>. </p>
<p id="EJF0Po">Darabont’s third adaptation of a Stephen King story, the film stars Thomas Jane (<em>The Expanse</em>) as a Hollywood poster artist living in Maine who, along with his wife and son and the rest of his neighbors, takes shelter in a supermarket in the wake of a mysterious storm that covers the town in a deadly mist. </p>
<p id="a3l6mR">Supernatural, otherworldly horrors abound throughout <em>The Mist</em>, but the greatest horror of all is — you guessed it — humanity itself, as seen in the way the townspeople succumb to the temptation to scapegoat those among themselves under the influence of a local religious fanatic. The ending is a gut-punch and sincerely one of the most chilling in any mainstream horror film of its time. If you’ve managed to go unspoiled until now, I won’t ruin the surprise, but needless to say, it’s worth it. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="1ERqKP">The movie that launched the modern zombie film in the United States, George A. Romero’s debut feature was written, directed, photographed, and edited by the nascent zombie film master on a shoestring budget, which only adds to the eerie atmosphere and grounded terror. In this film, a group of survivors hide out in an abandoned house in western Pennsylvania at the start of a zombie apocalypse. Led by the level-headed Ben (Duane Jones), the group not only has to deal with the conflict of zombies trying to break in, but internal conflicts stemming from disagreements on how to handle their precarious predicament.</p>
<p id="gt20gB"><em>Night of the Living Dead</em> is the first example of Romero’s typical blend of jaw-dropping (and stomach-churning) practical effects and astute social commentary. Fun fact: This movie came out a month before the MPAA film rating system, which meant a heaping amount of controversy when children were able to see the quite graphic movie in theaters. And another fun fact: <em>Night of the Living Dead </em>was never copyrighted and is in the public domain because of an error by the original theatrical distributor. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="vhKBrt"><strong>Director:</strong> Andrzej Żuławski<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Isabelle Adjani, Sam Neill, Heinz Bennent<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Shudder</p>
<p id="H96nfR">Outside of the most ardent of cinephile circles, Andrzej Żuławski isn’t a name that inspires enthusiastic recognition in the United States. Known for his transgressive brand of arthouse cinema, Żuławski’s career was stymied by Communist authorities in his homeland of Poland, with many of his early films being either heavily censored, banned, or, in one instance, nearly destroyed upon release. It also doesn’t help that the few films of his that have been released in the States have since gone out of print — though that <a href="https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=31906&amp;fbclid=IwAR3Uu6ISTexJGT1lEJZcZa5tpanf7zrGLKrGP9XZVNlvLeaJVHS9HpHT7ko">appears to be changing soon</a>.</p>
<p id="tBREhE">If you do know Żuławski’s name, it’s likely for his 1981 psychological horror film <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22740902/possession-review-horror-movie-doppelgangers"><em>Possession</em></a>, a film whose cult status among horror connoisseurs has only been amplified in the decades since its release by its difficulty to obtain on physical media or to view online. Fortunately for everyone, that’s no longer the case.</p>
<p id="qnqfjB">Set in Cold War-era West Berlin, Żuławski’s film stars <em>Jurassic Park</em>’s Sam Neill as Mark, a Russian spy who returns home to find that his wife, Anna (Isabelle Adjani), has left him and wants a divorce. When Anna refuses to divulge why, only saying that she has not left him for  someone else, Mark grows suspicious and has her tailed. What he eventually discovers is a horrifying secret beyond his comprehension, one which awakens a long-dormant wellspring of anxiety, resentment, and despair between the two that threatens to tear apart not only their small family, but their very sanity as well. </p>
<p id="5I02nx">Inspired by Żuławski’s own tumultuous divorce in 1976 and his subsequent struggles with suicidal ideation, <em>Possession</em> blurs the line between the autobiographical and the phantasmagorical, with hysterical performances by Neill and Adjani that vacillate between disturbing, comical, and disquietingly sympathetic. An inspiration for everything from Ari Aster’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiDPsWE4FJ8"><em>Midsommar</em></a> to the 2016 music video for Massive Attack’s “<a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/30051/1/the-cult-inspirations-behind-massive-attack-s-new-video">Voodoo in My Blood</a>,” <em>Possession</em> is an essential watch for any serious horror fan. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="mLBSzP">One of the best and most disturbing found-footage movies ever, <em>[REC]</em> follows a TV reporter and camera person who follow emergency workers into an apartment building, only to discover the dark truth inside: Some of the residents are turning into monsters. Set squarely in the zombie-craze of the mid-2000s, <em>[REC]</em>’s undead creatures owe quite a bit to the raving cannibal infected of <em>28 Days Later</em>, but the Spanish movie’s flesh-eaters are quite a bit creepier and more disturbed than their predecessors. While many found-footage movies obscure their scariest moments, <em>[REC]</em> uses the format to enhance its creeping dread and drag out the character’s slow careful exploration of the apartment building, ramping the tension up to 11 just in time for the downright terrifying finale. — <em>AG</em></p>

<p id="935nKR"><strong>Director:</strong> Scott Derrickson<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Ethan Hawke, Clare Foley, Fred Thompson<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Max</p>
<p id="31ZLAq">A desperate true crime writer, played by Ethan Hawke, moves his family into a house that once played host to an extremely gruesome crime in Scott Derrickson’s terrifically dark horror gem, <em>Sinister</em>. Despite the fact that this movie preceded the latest renaissance of true crime by several years, Hawke seems to have a perfect bead on the genre’s worst creators. He’s one of the all-time-bad horror movie parents, throwing his kids into untold danger all in the hope of writing a new book that could save his career. </p>
<p id="LuqoDF">Of course, by the time he realizes he’s actually put his family in the path of genuine danger and certain death, it’s already too late for him to write a single word. It’s a straight-over-the-plate premise that feels like you’ll see the scares coming a mile away, but Derrickson takes the story to darker and creepier places than you’d ever expect at first glance, turning it into one of the most terrifying horror movies of the 2010s. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="7zTqNO"><strong>Director:</strong> Egor Abramenko<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Oksana Akinshina, Fedor Bondarchuk, Pyotr Fyodorov<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, YouTube</p>
<p id="wRrMkx">If you’re hungry for a great piece of contemporary Russian sci-fi horror (i.e., something not directed by either Andrei Tarkovsky or Yakov Protazanov), then Egor Abramenko’s 2020 directorial debut is just the film you’re looking for. </p>
<p id="o6rTCA">Set during 1983 at the height of Cold War tensions, <em>Sputnik</em> (which for your information is Russian for “fellow traveler”) centers on Tatyana (Oskana Akinshina), an uncompromising young psychiatrist with a staunch attitude with regard to the ends justifying the means. Tatyana is recruited by the Soviet military to treat Konstantin (Pyotr Fyodorov), a wounded cosmonaut and the lone survivor of a mysterious satellite crash. Only upon arriving at the remote hospital facility housing the patient and interacting with him does Tatyana come to realize the horrifying truth: Konstantin did not in fact return from space alone; rather, his body has now become the unwitting host to an organism unlike anything seen on Earth. Caught between her duty to study the creature and her desire to save Konstantin from further harm, Tatyana must make a hard decision upon which the very survival of all humanity may rest.</p>
<p id="jc7KQt">What makes Abramenko’s debut so compelling is how it takes the basic premise of the “trolley problem” thought experiment and twists it repeatedly (and successfully) to dramatic emotional effect. Akinshina (<em>The Bourne Supremacy</em>) delivers a convincing and compelling performance as Tatyana, a woman forced to confront and overcome the uncompromising attitude that had once assured her success but now threatens to endanger not only another man’s life, but potentially the lives of everyone on the planet along with her own soul. Fyodorov, for his own part, delivers a sympathetically complex (and on occasion, implicitly sinister) performance as Konstantin, a Russian “hero” torn between his perceived duty to his country and his emotional obligation to a loved one he all but abandoned before embarking on his most recent mission. The creature design in this movie is terrific, as is the cinematography and the film’s score.</p>
<p id="aOLxIs">Having previously been slated for a world premiere at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival and subsequently dumped on video-on-demand in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, <em>Sputnik</em> is exactly the kind of horror movie this list was intended to spotlight: a kind of rare gem of intellectually and viscerally stimulating horror that otherwise goes unappreciated if not given the opportunity to shine. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="PscgqY"><strong>Director</strong>: Dario Argento<br><strong>Cast</strong>: Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini, Flavio Bucci<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Kanopy</p>
<p id="lZ4iuY">One of the best-looking movies of all time with one of the best soundtracks of all time. What’s better than that?</p>
<p id="ZG0EYW">Dario Argento’s <em>Suspiria </em>tells the story of Suzy Bannion, an American dancer who moves to Germany to study at the prestigious Tanz Akademie. It just so happens that the academy is run by witches. As the facade of the school unravels, Suzy’s fellow students slowly start going missing or dropping dead in increasingly bizarre and horrible ways. </p>
<p id="kjvVBW">While the plot for <em>Suspiria </em>is interesting, what really makes the movie great is how it looks and how it sounds. Everything about the production design, the costumes, and the colors is eccentric in ways no other horror movie has ever matched. Couple all that with the incredible and haunting soundtrack from European rock band Goblin, and <em>Suspiria </em>becomes an unforgettable horror classic that everyone should see at least once. — <em>AG</em></p>

<p id="eFkOPu">Another shoestring production gone huge, Tobe Hooper’s 1974 masterpiece made over $30 million at the box office on a budget of around $140,000. The movie follows a group of friends who find themselves hunted by a family of cannibals in the middle of Texas, and is a chilling, violent fever dream that permanently lodges itself in the minds of those who watch it.</p>
<p id="PSr6ZZ">Eight films have followed, including a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22940937/texas-chainsaw-massacre-review-2022-netflix">Netflix version</a> in 2022, but the original stands out as an unhinged encapsulation of pure chaos and terror. At a tight 83 minutes, the original <em>Texas Chain Saw Massacre </em>is well worth the small time investment to catch up on one of the most influential horror movies ever made. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="6RPM7h"><strong>Director: </strong>John Carpenter<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, and YouTube</p>
<p id="UtZ0gN">John Carpenter’s postmodern creature feature takes the idea of alien monsters and makes them simultaneously more recognizable and more gross and unworldly than in any other movie in history. <em>The Thing</em>, the second adaptation of the excellent novella <em>Who Goes There?</em>, remains thrilling, terrifying, and absolutely disgusting more than 40 years after its release. </p>
<p id="cqryYD"><em>The Thing</em> follows a group of researchers working at an Antarctic base. Suddenly, a dog from a local Norwegian camp rushes into their base, with Norwegian men hot on its heels, trying to kill it by any means necessary. However, once the American crew takes the dog in and shelters it, they discover it’s an alien that can transform into any living creature, mimicking it perfectly — and that makes every one of them a suspect.</p>
<p id="ZhpT7r">It’s one of the great paranoid thriller premises of all time, but it just so happens to also be filled with gross and fantastic alien gore. There’s nothing quite like <em>The Thing</em>. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="Sv25r1"><strong>Director:</strong> Nahnatchka Khan<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Kiernan Shipka, Olivia Holt, Charlie Gillespie<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Prime Video</p>
<p id="4mWZyK"><em>Totally Killer</em> is a slasher with a sci-fi twist, not unlike the fabulous Happy Death Day movies. The movie follows Jamie (Kiernan Shipka), who has to go back in time to the 1980s to stop a masked serial killer before he kills her mom in the future. When she arrives in the past, however, the high school versions of her mom (Olivia Holt), her dad (Charlie Gillespie), and every other adult in her life aren’t exactly who she thought they’d be. </p>
<p id="SEImkZ">While <em>Totally Killer</em> isn’t the scariest horror movie on this list, it is undeniably one of the most fun. The cast elevates an already funny script thanks to some fantastic and ridiculous line readings, and the movie has a few novel approaches to time-travel shenanigans that keep the concept from ever overwhelming the movie or dragging it down with too much science. <em>Totally Killer</em> is endearingly silly with just the right amount of sweetness, making it one of the most fun and unique slashers of the last several years. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="t35Vz2">As many people have learned over the past few years, there aren’t that many things scarier than a video call you can’t leave.</p>
<p id="63GJH7">A masterfully contained horror movie that makes full use of its (at the time) groundbreaking gimmick, <em>Unfriended </em>is a tense teen horror movie that takes place entirely on a character’s laptop screen. Definitely watch it on a laptop if you can, and check out the very good sequel <em>Unfriended: Dark Web </em>if you dug this one. —<em>PV</em></p>
<p id="e1e8ja">From our list of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22325729/best-horror-movies-netflix">best horror movies on Netflix</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="xndPcA">Levan Gabriadze’s <em>Unfriended</em> pulls the audiences through the screen — almost literally. Viewed entirely from the perspective of a computer desktop, 2014 supernatural horror film centers around a Skype call between a group of high school students who are joined by an unknown presence known only as “billie227.” What at first appears to be a prank swiftly morphs into something much more horrific, as the mysterious stranger begins to reveal terrifying secrets about each of the friends before killing them off one by one. <em>Unfriended</em> is thoroughly gripping extrapolation of our always-online world, a world where vengeful poltergeists and doxxing exist side by side and no secret or offense goes undiscovered or unpunished. <em>—TE</em></p></blockquote>

<p id="bHY54g"><strong>Director: </strong>Jordan Peele<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Lupita Nyong’o, Winston Duke, Elisabeth Moss<br><strong>Where to watch</strong>: Digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, YouTube</p>
<p id="VKQKUT">Jordan Peele’s already a horror master just three movies into his career, but <em>Us </em>probably still doesn’t have the reputation it deserves. His 2019 psychological slasher had the unfortunate fate of following up the cultural phenomenon of <em>Get Out</em>, so it had a hard time breaking through, in the way that sophomore projects often do. But taken on its own terms, <em>Us </em>is a fantastic little horror movie with tons of atmosphere and an underground society’s worth of great scares. </p>
<p id="i2ownh">The movie follows the Wilson family, whose vacation is interrupted by the arrival of a group of doppelgängers who match up with each member of the family perfectly. The clones, it turns out, are called Tethered, and where they come from is very complicated. But before any kind of explanation of the Tethered, what we see is a parade of violent attacks, home invasions, and some very tense encounters between Lupita Nyong’o and herself. </p>
<p id="UcTZco"><em>Us</em> may not be Peele’s best movie, but it is a fascinating mix of slasher thrills and world- building, supported by a fantastic cast all operating at their A games. While the entire cast is great, Elizabeth Moss is a particular standout for her extremely brief but extraordinarily loathsome role as one of the family’s friends. Her performance gives this movie so much of its weird off-kilter vibe, and leads to some of its most unstintingly and gleefully over-the-top violence. Alongside the terrifying tone, Peele manages to build an entire second world underneath our own, and will give you a very unhealthy fear of what you’re really seeing when you look in the mirror. —<em>AG</em></p>

Dead Space fans should be keen to try <em>The Callisto Protocol, </em>a 2022 sci-fi survival horror game that wasn’t a total knockout but had plenty of the DNA that made Dead Space games great — so a perfect Game Pass game? Those looking for something new should keep eyes peeled on <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>, horror game set on an oil rig that’s going day 1 on the service. </p>

The 2011 BioWare RPG let players pursue whoever they wanted, regardless of what gender player character they chose.

McKay also talked about the importance of player agency. This included building relationships with your companions. He told IGN, “yes, you can romance the companions you want.” So it sounds like there will be no restrictions based on your character’s gender or race.</p><p>“We spent a lot of time making our companions feel authentic based on their own unique experiences within this larger fantasy world, which in turn makes the relationships you form with them feel even more meaningful,” McKay said.” We’ve tapped into<em> Dragon Age</em>’s deep lore and explored its most iconic factions to bring each of the seven companions and their stories to life,” he continued.</p><p>BioWare will likely introduce at least some of these characters when the studio releases 15 minutes of <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>footage on June 11, so we’ll all get a chance to start looking for our next beau. But bringing back <em>Dragon Age 2</em> ’s free-for-all structure will be a divisive inclusion. As a gay man who sometimes feels like I lack romance options in BioWare’s games (I don’t even like Zevran in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, but he was the only man I could kiss), I’m always happy to hear that everyone, especially queer folks who often get shortchanged, will get an equal slice of the pie. But <em>Inquisition</em>’s defined identities brought a lot to characters like Dorian, whose story dealt with his identity as a gay man in the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, informed the dynamics of your relationship, and told us new things about in the process. Ultimately, you lose and gain something in either approach, and it’s in the eye of the beholder about what takes priority.</p><p>Earlier this year, I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-romance-playersexual-baldurs-gate-dragon-age-1851253394">talked to developers</a></span> (including ex-BioWare writer David Gaider) about why making these decisions is more than just a numbers game, and it was fascinating to hear so many perspectives about what goes into that in terms of writing, coding, and resources. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Black Ops 6 is mere days away from being revealed by Activision Blizzard, and the leaks are coming thick and fast. In the last few weeks, we’ve been drip-fed content regarding Black Ops 6 – this year’s instalment of Call of Duty – and on June 9, the game’s core premise and the multiplayer are set to be revealed in full.</p>



<p>In the latest leak, it has been claimed that Black Ops 6 will be launching with a theatre mode, which hasn’t made an appearance in a major Call of Duty title since 2020’s Black Ops Cold War.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-theatrical">Theatrical</h2>



<p>In 2010, Black Ops was released worldwide with an innovative new feature called ‘theatre mode’, and the Call of Duty content creation scene was forever changed. With theatre mode, players could create mini-movies and montages with a few button presses, diving back into recordings of their recent matches and tweaking them to their heart’s content.</p>



<p>In a recent leak posted <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1798775541006520481" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitter by BobNetworkUK</a>, a reliable Call of Duty leaker, it was claimed that theatre mode will be coming back alongside Black Ops 6. That makes sense, as the last Call of Duty title to feature the iconic mode was Black Ops Cold War – the most recent game in the Black Ops sub-series.</p>



<p>Not only does this mean that content creators are about to foam at the mouth, but it also means that the shorts game is about to go wild, on-platform clip sharing might be a thing, and cheaters will be identified much easier with players getting the ability to spectate from the perspective of sus gamers with slick gaming chairs.</p>

Warren notes that it is in "early days" of development, so it is very unlikely that Microsoft will announce this project during <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june">this Sunday's Xbox Games Showcase</a>. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/halospeedrunblogroll-1533336736758-1717694718988.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A Halo Combat Evolved remaster may be unveiled at the Xbox Showcase on Sunday.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Halo: Combat Evolved was developed by Bungie and initially released in 2001 as a launch game for the original Xbox gaming system. The project was the first in what would become one of Microsoft's flagship first-party IPs that has seen at least one game released on an Xbox platform since the console's release over 20 years ago. </p><p>In 2011, Microsoft published <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-combat-evolved-anniversary">Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</a>, a remake that kept the plot unchanged but introduced achievements, Terminals, and Skulls. It was the first to offer a mix of two game engines, allowing players to toggle between the original and improved graphics at the press of a button. Combat Evolved Anniversary is often regarded as the definitive version of the original Halo due to its updated visuals and achievement support, and it is the version included in the 2014 compilation <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/10/halo-review">our review of the original Halo: Combat Evolved</a>, IGN wrote: "Is playing Halo worth the $350 it will cost for an Xbox and a game? If you can appreciate video games and have been waiting for the next step, then the answer is absolutely." </p><p>The report is part of the larger discussion of Xbox's gaming strategy after the publisher announced that some of its first-party games would <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-vision-of-the-future">see a release beyond the Xbox hardware ecosystem</a>. Some of the first previously Xbox console-exclusive games to receive multiplatform release include Grounded, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush. That list will likely grow as Microsoft continues to evolve and shift its strategy on what it wants to make accessible regardless of platform and what it will retain exclusively for its platform.</p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-6-xbox-handheld-and-doom-what-to-expect-from-the-xbox-showcase">what to expect from Sunday's Xbox showcase</a> as this week's events get underway.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/banjo-kazooie-spiritual-successor-yooka-laylee-is-getting-a-remaster-heres-a-first-look<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a>, the Banjo-Kazooie spiritual successor developed by former Rare developers, is getting a surprise remaster for PC and consoles.</p><p>Developer Playtonic Games said the 2017 3D platformer will re-release with a visual overhaul, new controls, and camera system, as well as new challenges and secrets. The game also has a new name: Yooka-Replaylee.</p><p>Yooka-Laylee released on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in April 2017, with a Nintendo Switch version following in December 2017. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review">Yooka-Laylee review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Yooka-Laylee is a good reminder that this genre, once thought to be dead, still has some life left in it.”</p><p>Yooka-Replaylee is the result of the growth of Playtonic over recent years, it said, and “the things we have learned while working on other projects as well as the feedback we have taken on board since the original release.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Yooka-Replaylee Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Here are the Yooka-Replaylee key features, per Playtonic:</p><p>• MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER – With an art and animations overhaul and enhanced performance and resolution, the favorite buddy duo has never looked or moved better.</p><p>• NEW AND IMPROVED CHALLENGES – Improvements to existing in-game challenges and many entirely new challenges to discover and undertake!</p><p>• NEW COLLECTIBLE CURRENCY – Capital B's inept minions have dropped their hard-earned coins all over the place. Collect the official currency of the Hivory Towers to spend on video games' most beloved sentient vending machine.</p><p>• NAVIGATING THE WORLD – Now you can get lost in the game, not in the world! A brand-new world map and challenges tracker helps you know where you are and what needs to be done. Hooray!</p><p>• VENDI HAS PLENTY TO OFFER – Tonics are back with all new flavors! With the option to equip multiple game-changing enhancements, you can truly customise your playstyle. And as if that wasn't enough, Vendi has new lines of merchandise for the modern fashionable adventurer.</p><p>• REVISED CONTROLS &amp; CAMERA – A new tweaked move set allows you to combine moves more fluidly while the new camera controls makes framing the action a breeze.</p><p>• A DREAMY ORCHESTRAL SOUNDTRACK – The original score from famed video game composers Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie) and David Wise (Donkey Kong Country) returns but as a beautifully arranged orchestral score. Now seriously, clean out those ears.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Yooka-Laylee spawned a 2D spin-off, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/yooka-laylee-and-the-impossible-lair">Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair</a>, which released on Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC in 2019. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/03/yooka-laylee-and-the-impossible-lair-review">IGN gave that one an 8.7</a>. "Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair brings the dynamic duo down to a 2.5D perspective to deliver one of the best platformers we’ve seen in years," we said.</p><p>Expect more on Yooka-Replaylee during a Q&amp;A session set for June 11.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

One week of action gave the development team a good idea of what needs to be adjusted, and Player First Games responded with the first batch of buffs and nerfs. </p> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">Before jumping into the MultiVersus1.01 update patch notes, Player First Games <a href="https://x.com/multiversus/status/1798452443849584699" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that performance improvements, end game statistics, and the option to turn off team colors won’t be a part of this update, but will be added at a later date. In addition, the development team assured players that the option to purchase extra lives was a bug and has since been removed from the title. And despite a series of changes in this update, Iron Giant will still be unavailable while a few more issues get ironed out. </p>
 <p data-characters="95" data-current-count="95" data-injectable="false">With that out of the way, let’s jump right into the Multiversus 1.01 update patch notes. </p> <h2 id="h-multiversus-1-01-update-patch-notes" data-injectable="false"><em>MultiVersus</em> 1.01 update patch notes</h2> <h3 data-injectable="false">General&nbsp;</h3> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false"> <li>Lowered Hit Pause on all Hits by&nbsp;<strong>10%</strong>&nbsp;in 1v1 modes</li> <li>Players can now try all Fighters in Training Mode, including Fighters they do not own</li> <li>Battlepass XP will now be granted after each PvP Match in addition to Events and Missions.</li> </ul> <h3 data-injectable="false">Bug Fixes&nbsp;</h3> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true"> <li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete daily rewards in Rifts Mode</li> <li>Fixed an issue that was impacting performance on Xbox Series X|S&nbsp;</li> <li>Fixed an issue where beam visual effects were occasionally invisible on PlayStation consoles&nbsp;</li> <li>Fixed an issue where certain keyboard configurations would cause phantom inputs in matches&nbsp;</li> <li>Fixed an issue with pause input conflicts in Training</li> </ul>

<p data-characters="138" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Many <em>EA FC 24</em> players have wondered if the Festival of Football celebrations will introduce the Copa America 2024 as a separate game mode.</p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">The question is not unjust, as EA Sports has introduced a dedicated Euro 2024 mode with plenty of content. This includes all participating nations along with the authentic squads, and players can choose between a host of different matches. However, fans of Copa America might not have such luck this year.</p> <h2 id="h-will-ea-fc-24-get-copa-america-2024" data-injectable="false">Will EA FC 24 get Copa America 2024?</h2> <p data-characters="74" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">As things stand, Copa America 2024 is <strong>not expected to arrive</strong> in <em>EA FC 24</em>. </p> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="713" data-injectable="true">If a new mode is set to be introduced in the game, EA Sports officially announces the information. There has been no official news or leaks suggesting the arrival of a separate Copa America 2024 mode in <em>EA FC 24</em>. EA Sports had already mentioned that there will be a dedicated UEFA Euro 2024 mode, which was released earlier on June 6.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">Certain tournaments are already present in the game, which were introduced at launch. This includes men’s and women’s football, but the premier South American tournament isn’t among them. </p>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">Things could change in the future if EA Sports manages to acquire the IP for the tournament. As of now, fans will have to be satisfied with the Euro 2024 mode. However, if you’re a fan of Ultimate Team, there’s some footprint of the South American champions.</p> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-ultimate-team-season-7-rewards/">Season 7 Festival of Football</a> has begun, and it includes a host of new milestone rewards. Some of these rewards include promo cards representing Copa America 2024. You can unlock all these items for free by completing various objectives that are life in Ultimate Team (more will be made available in the future).</p>
 <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="247" data-injectable="false">The upcoming Festival of Football promo is very likely to introduce cards from Copa America in packs as well. Few leaks have suggested that big names like Ronaldo Araujo are set to get special Path to Glory cards, all of which will be upgradeable.</p> <p data-characters="151" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">Hence, the only presence of the South American tournament in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-path-to-glory-greats-of-the-game-upgrades/">EA FC 24</a></em> is in the form of the various promo cards that will be part of the Ultimate Team.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24172809/steam-games-when-you-die-gog-itchio-estate-planning<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="CBSqeN">Not all <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163569/steam-games-when-you-die-will-estate-planning">video games go to gamer heaven</a> when you die. Some will stay right here on Earth, passed along to your next of kin — as long as you put it in your will. </p>
<p id="0IFhJr">The question of what happens to your game libraries when you die is still a relatively new one, a product of the digital-only era. Not only does <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamesindustrybiz-presents-the-year-in-number-2023">digital make up a big portion of video game sales</a>, but some stores <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23915567/best-buy-discontinue-physical-media-dvd-blu-ray">will reportedly no longer sell physical media</a> like video games. All this is to say that you should start thinking about passing your library on — otherwise, it might end up languishing on your password-protected Steam account.</p>
<p id="BDiE2w">A Steam customer service agent told ResetEra forum user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/to-anyone-who-is-curious-no-you-cannot-transfer-your-steam-account-via-a-will-you-can-only-take-your-games-to-your-graves.875634/">delete12345</a> that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163569/steam-games-when-you-die-will-estate-planning">you <em>can’t</em> pass down your Steam library to another person</a>. (That is, unless you give them your account information and password, which is technically against Valve’s terms of service.) When you purchase a game on Steam, you’re purchasing a license to use that game — you don’t actually own a copy of it.</p>

<p id="J1EmAc">But Steam is not the only platform that sells video games. Polygon reached out to Valve, Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony Interactive Entertainment, GOG, Itch.io, and Epic Games Store to ask about their policies. Distribution platforms GOG and Itch.io responded: With the right legal permissions — i.e., proof of legal transfer in a will — both stores will try to honor these requests.</p>
<p id="NysWRY">A GOG spokesperson told Polygon that, with a court order, the company is “willing to handle such a situation and preserve your GOG library — but currently [it] can only do it with the help of the justice system.” That’s because GOG doesn’t collect a ton of personal information, making it hard to establish a relationship between someone claiming an account and the original account owner.</p>
<p id="poxZdE">Here’s GOG’s full statement, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamernews/comments/1d5zxqo/what_happens_to_your_gog_account_if_you_die_gog/">which it drafted after receiving several queries from users</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="XFpXoB">As this is a particularly delicate matter with little to no existing legal guidance on the issue of video games preservation, we’d like to address it properly, so that you, and every other GOG community member, can be sure what can happen to your games in case of unexpected events, such as death. </p>
<p id="4l5nnN">As you may know, GOG does not collect information sufficient to truly identify a particular person (such as name and surname) or their family or marital status. For this reason, we are not able to establish that someone is related to a particular user or that a particular user has passed away.</p>
<p id="UrDa0W">In general, your GOG account and GOG content is not transferable. However, if you can obtain a copy of a court order that specifically entitles someone to your GOG personal account, the digital content attached to it taking into account the EULAs of specific games within it, and that specifically refers to your GOG username or at least email address used to create such an account, we’d do our best to make it happen.</p>
<p id="3liUvA">We’re willing to handle such a situation and preserve your GOG library — but currently we can only do it with the help of the justice system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="mt3qLJ">GOG doesn’t use any digital rights management (DRM) technology, though, meaning you can store your purchased games on an external hard drive and pass that along easily.</p>
<p id="u8ueSb">When it comes to indie distribution platform Itch.io, there’s no formal policy, according to founder Leaf Corcoran. Itch.io accounts are tied to email addresses, he said, so if a next of kin has the account’s password, that’s fine. Itch.io won’t revoke access. But if that person <em>doesn’t</em> have access to the email address, that’s a security problem — unless there is “conclusive evidence” that it’s theirs. </p>
<p id="6l2DCf">Corcoran doesn’t believe any Itch.io user has ever reached out to the company’s support line about recovering an account from someone who’s died, but he said he would try to help if the person could prove they should have access: “I think that’s a pretty unique case though so it’s possible we may go out of our way to help the requester prove that they should have access to the account.”</p>
<p id="6YZoUW">Again, that proof would likely have to be via a legal document, like a will.</p>
<p id="nQNuoV"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/usage-rules-for-digital-goods-rules-83812b1f-1ecd-9a46-d3a7-ad1eadce49d1">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/legal/sie-application-end-user-license-agreement/">Sony</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/sg/support/switch/eula/usage_policy.html">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/">Valve</a>, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/eula">Epic Games Store</a> did not respond to Polygon’s request for comment, so we looked to their respective terms of service for answers. All of these companies have similar policies: The games licensed to you are not transferable. Transferring your games to another person via a will is, seemingly, still a unique situation that plenty of companies have not yet had to deal with — they may be willing to make exceptions with legal proof of bequeathment, or if they were compelled to by a court. GOG’s end user agreement states, too, that you can’t share or transfer your GOG account or content, but in practice, it’s willing to do so under the right circumstances.</p>
<p id="ETShLr">One potential way around this is writing the devices your games are stored on into your will. Lawyer Claudine Wong <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1573&amp;context=chtlj">wrote in the Santa Clara High Technology Law Journal in 2013</a> that “digital content is transferable to a deceased user’s survivors if legal copies of that content are located on physical devices, such as iPods or Kindle e-readers.” Presumably, this would extend to your laptop or video game console, should you stay logged on or have the password. “So far there is no dispute that the devices, and the works fixed to them, can be passed on,” Wong wrote. Still, Wong’s research is more than 10 years old at this point — technology and companies have changed a ton, and information about digital estate planning is still limited.</p>
<p id="7KFX63">Wong suggested that regardless of the legality of it all, you should still write this stuff into your will. “[An] estate plan is an expression of what he desires should happen after his death, and knowing what he wanted provides his family with compelling arguments against the service providers,” Wong said.</p>
<p id="wXdV7V">It may all sound like a joke — writing your video games into your will — but it’s a problem that will continue to pop up as things keep going more and more online. What happens to your TikTok account, for instance? Your email address? Your Steam or GOG or Epic Games Store accounts likely have more value than both: Just 20 AAA video games cost more than $1,000 in total. And your game library is also a personal thing that someone else might cherish. Beyond how this plays out personally, digital-only video games — and their copyrights and licenses — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/01/12/video-game-preservation-emulation/">are a huge challenge for preservationists</a>.</p>
<p id="qGfOtE">Regardless, 100 years from now, I hope my descendants like my gaming laptop. </p>

Now Tom Warren at <em>The Verge</em> has followed up with more details <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in his newsletter, Notepad</a></span>. His understanding is that while while games like <em>Starfield</em>, <em>Hellblade 2</em>, and <em>Age of Empires II </em>are “under consideration” when it comes to getting PS5 ports, games like <em>Gears 6</em> and <em>Fable</em> are unlikely to go multiplatform. That suggests that franchises considered core to the Xbox brand might still be off limits. </p><p>What does that mean for <em>Halo</em>? While it’s unclear if a future sequel would ever come to PS5, Warren reports that a new remaster of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved </em>is in early development and being considered for Sony’s platform. You might be wondering why Microsoft is working on another remaster when the original game in the hit sci-fi shooter series is available with online multiplayer and improved graphics via the <em>Master Chief Collection</em>. </p><p>Well, that game is basically running the original code with a fresh coat of paint on top. It’s possible a new remaster might offer a deeper overhaul, while still being short of a full-blown remake. Microsoft <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mr_rebs_/status/1765832892804919595?s=46&amp;t=WocbT9i_LzihDyCxIlphpQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mr_rebs_/status/1765832892804919595?s=46&amp;t=WocbT9i_LzihDyCxIlphpQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly stopped ongoing development</a></span> on <em>MCC </em>at the start of this year, and a new remaster might serve as a perfect test case for how <em>Halo</em> performs on PS5 and what the backlash is from existing Xbox fans. We might have a better idea of Microsoft’s thinking on exclusivity coming out of the June 9 showcase on Sunday. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instilling joy and wonder, they provide a unique bond that enables you to utilize their skills for traversing the planet and solving environmental challenges. Once peaceful creatures, they now succumb to an unknown infection driving them to behave aggressively, which makes your mission to save them an urgent necessity.</p><p><strong>Exploration-Driven Gameplay</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The gameplay encourages curiosity-driven exploration of its distinct ecosystems—such as the colorful Nari jungle or mysterious Mâruba swamp—creating an interconnected world. With non-aggressive combat mechanics designed for healing rather than defeating and indigenous Flute melodies that you play to tame creatures, the game further highlights the creature-saver nature of the experience.</p><p><strong>Meaningful Narrative</strong></p><p>Step into the shoes of Vic, a 22-year-old nature adventurer as she navigates through the immersive expedition alongside Tabitha, a composed and astute researcher. Together, you confront the recurring infection—called “the withering” by the local race of Naam—threatening Ava’s inhabitants. The game’s narrative, co-created by Rhianna Pratchett, is a journey of wonder and mystery but also discovery, leading to the revelation of the planet’s captivating secrets.</p><p><strong>Saving Through Understanding</strong></p><p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> is a game featuring a dense, populated world of rich ecosystems filled with creatures that play a vital role in the planet’s natural balance. It goes beyond traditional creature-related genres, offering a deeper understanding and connection with the things you’ll encounter on Ava. Once you come to understand the true meaning of the infection, you will be challenged to step out of the human-centric point of view and learn about the real toll it takes to preserve the primal beauty at the very roots of Ava.</p><p>After all, can you save something you don’t understand?</p></blockquote><p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,424 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a> and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2304440/Creatures_of_Ava/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/creatures-of-ava-cacd2c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/creatures-of-ava/9NV5LTSPHQD2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/creatures_of_ava" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> in 2024.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172905/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-200-million-loss-wbd-rocksteady<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. Discovery took a $200 million hit after the launch of <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice</em> <em>League</em>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24062243/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review-ps5-xbox-pc">troubled looter shooter</a> released in February — and now we have a sense of what went wrong. A new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry">report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> details some of the studio’s struggles behind the scenes, including inexperience with the multiplayer genre and a “constantly changing vision.”</p><p>Rocksteady, the UK-based studio owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, was tasked with developing a <em>Suicide Squad</em> game in 2016. At this time, new Rocksteady employees were reportedly unaware that the studio was developing a multiplayer game, as Rocksteady is known for its single-player action-adventure games like <em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em>. This caused many employees to leave, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports.</p><p>The game’s development didn’t go smoothly. Rocksteady’s leaders kept changing their ideas for the game, turning their focus from melee combat to heavy gunplay, <em>Bloomberg </em>reports. The studio struggled with making its battles, levels, and bosses feel less repetitive — one of the biggest issues for live-service titles, where players are asked to retread large parts of the game. The studio also wasn’t accustomed to the level of complexity required to develop such a massive map and the four playable characters, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p><p>Rocksteady co-founders Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker <a href="https://www.rocksteadyltd.com/news/letter/">left the studio in 2022</a> to start a new endeavor, with continued setbacks like this pushing the game’s release date until this year. Warner Bros. Discovery revealed the game’s $200 million loss during the company’s earnings call in May, with CEO David Zaslav calling its release “disappointing.”</p><p>Financial pressure in the gaming industry only continues to mount as studios contend with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24009039/video-game-layoffs-2023">layoffs affecting thousands of workers</a>. Some major studios have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite">turned to live-service games</a>, like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, in an attempt to strike a constant source of revenue. But in Warner Bros. Discovery’s case, this backfired. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Rocksteady has now turned its attention to a director’s cut version of <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and may even start working on another single-player game. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-next-helldivers-2-warbond-has-new-rewards-%E2%80%94-and-some-big-changes.891633/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24172932/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Au91OD">A new Warbond is on the way to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24071317/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-video-game-great"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, and it’s the first step in Arrowhead shaking up the game’s update schedule. The Viper Commandos Warbond is themed after jungle combat — camo prints, red berets, bare arms, throwing knives, skull masks, and everything else you can equip while CCR’s “Fortunate Son” blasts over a speaker nearby.</p>
<p id="M4R79T">Warbonds can be unlocked with 1000 Super Credits, which can be purchased with real money or collected around minor points of interest on the map. Fans have criticized Warbonds for coming a little too frequently without enough unique items to justify them, and the Viper Commandos Warbond takes that feedback into account.</p>
<p id="0xFNRz">“Based on player input, we’re changing our approach to Warbonds moving forward in a couple of ways,” <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/helldivers-ii-enlists-the-viper-commandos-warbond-on-june-13/">wrote community manager Katherine Baskin on the official Sony site</a>. “Firstly, we’re slowing down the pace at which we release Warbonds to give us a little bit more time to polish these designs before they’re released. Secondly, we are changing the arrangement of items in each Warbond to make room for new item types. It’s time to focus on quality over quantity.”</p>
<div id="M1nw9x"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbb5ngK36x4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="7Tw1aT">Players can unlock a new Liberator Carbine, designed for close quarters combat, as well as a new secondary weapon that packs a lot of punch in the SG-22 Bushwhacker triple-barrel sawed off shotgun. The PH-9 Predator armor is a clear reference to, well, <em>Predator</em> — and I’m tempted to unlock it just for the cute beret. For those who prefer heavy armor, the PH-202 Twigsnapper keeps similar aesthetics with a little more protection. Both armors feature bare arms and a new Peak Physique passive, which improves melee damage and weapon handling.</p>
<p id="JwtaMj">The most exciting weapon is a new utility item: a throwing knife. I’m not sure if throwing knives will pack the same punch as shotguns and orbital lasers, but it definitely scores points for being cool and stylish.</p>
<p id="1nWRyY">The Viper Commandos Warbond also features camo skins for the hellpods, Exosuits, and Pelican-1. It should be nice to be able to customize these things, adding a certain panache to the otherwise plain-looking mech suits and hellpods. A new booster, Experimental Infusion, makes stims even more of a life-saver by giving injections a boost to movement speed and damage reduction.</p>
<p id="Lqub3P">The Warbond also comes with the typical rewards of capes, player cards, and emotes.</p>
<p id="rP57DP">It’s interesting to see Arrowhead shake things up. There are some big narrative happenings right now, since players <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24170825/helldivers-2-meridia-system-major-order-black-hole">turned the super colony of Meridia into an ominous black hole</a>. If things escalate further, at least we’ll have these fun new toys to throw at our alien enemies. The Viper Commandos Warbond will release on all platforms on June 13. </p>

And to get it out of the way, no, you don’t need to play the first <em>Octopath Traveler</em>. You shouldn’t, despite it also being available on Xbox Game Pass. It’s not that it’s a bad game, it’s just that <em>Octopath Traveler II</em> is a more refined title that improves upon its predecessor in every way.</p><figure id="" data-id="8541303344c4ccd974785cf7c1e95002" data-recommend-id="image://8541303344c4ccd974785cf7c1e95002" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Partitio saying &quot;*sniff* Mmm, the scent of commerce!

You choose one to begin the game as and quickly start unraveling each party member’s story till they eventually intertwine into a grand web.<br></p><p>Each of the eight protagonists falls into a traditional archetype defined by their job. There is Throne the thief, Agnea the dancer, Hikari the warrior, and on and on. Each one’s job defines the tone of their narrative, with Throne’s, for instance, involving heists, betrayal, and revenge in Solistia’s crime world. The ability to swap between characters and pursue their narratives however you see fit leads to a wonderful balance. Some stories may be emotionally and mechanically intensive, but you can always follow it up with something silly, such as Agnea’s charming journey to become a famous performer in the big city. All these clashing tones meld together remarkably well and evoke the tonal shifts of classic <em>Final Fantasy</em> adventures.</p><p>The job archetypes of each character also inform their mechanical abilities. Inside of combat, each character will have special attacks and skills you’d expect for a thief, a mage or whatever that character’s job happens to be.

It revolves around two specific features, boosting and breaking. Combat occurs in a turn order represented on the screen. By attacking an enemy’s weakness, they can be broken, pushing them to the back of the turn order. You can also use special attacks called boosts which can be done by spending boost points that accrue every turn. This boost and break system turns into a strategic game of knowing when to build up your boost and when to unleash a strong attack in tandem with breaking the enemy to keep them from attacking as much as possible. This is best shown off during the game’s intense boss battles that require you to be at your best at all times.</p><figure id="" data-id="0aba61d68a033e3444073403b9ff9ca8" data-recommend-id="image://0aba61d68a033e3444073403b9ff9ca8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter breaks an enemy in combat " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hunter breaks an enemy in combat " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0aba61d68a033e3444073403b9ff9ca8" data-recommend-id="image://0aba61d68a033e3444073403b9ff9ca8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter breaks an enemy in combat " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But the unique twist of <em>Octopath Traveler II </em>is that you can also use skills outside of combat. Many of the game’s quests require you to complete mechanical puzzles only specific characters can solve. That might involve using Throne’s steal ability to lift a key, or Hikari’s combat prowess to knock out guards and sneak past. With a day and night cycle, <em>Octopath Traveler II</em> also gives each character different skills for different times of day, so players need to experiment with not just their party makeup but also the time of day to solve specific problems.<br></p><p>As a vast, dozens-of-hours-long, retro-inspired RPG, there is a lot to see and get lost in while playing <em>Octopath Traveler II</em>. It’s a game best enjoyed at your own pace, which is why it’s so nice that the story is separated into chapters that are each just an hour or two long. All the while, the game’s gorgeous <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/live-a-live-switch-square-enix-dragon-quest-jrpg-1849341082&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/live-a-live-switch-square-enix-dragon-quest-jrpg-1849341082">HD-2D</a></span> visuals and phenomenal score are there to give your eyes and ears a feast.

"The thing is, Cyberpunk is very specific when it comes to its construction.</p><p>"It’s incredibly difficult to figure out a way where New Game Plus could be done in a way that doesn’t completely break the way the game is constructed."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"It’s incredibly difficult to figure out a way where New Game Plus could be done in a way that doesn’t completely break the way the game is constructed.</p></div><p>Sasko referenced Bethesda's latest RPG <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-review">Starfield</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfields-new-game-plus-is-its-most-intriguing-concept-if-you-get-lucky">its New Game Plus system</a>, which actually ties into the overall story and has a logical explanation for how and why the entire world is resetting, and seemed to suggest this was the only option for incorporating the New Game Plus mechanic.</p><p>He didn't address why Cyberpunk 2077 couldn't have a more traditional means of New Game Plus, however, that simply sees the player restart the story while keeping abilities or experience. This is how <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review">The Witcher 3's</a> version of the system worked, as it had no story connection or explanation for the reset whatsoever and just allowed players to experience the game again with a few extras.</p><p>Sasko even admitted Cyberpunk 2077 was designed to be replayed, which would suggest this style of New Game Plus would work well.</p><p>"It’s to be replayed. It’s to try different life paths, try different romances, try different builds," he said. "There’s so many things that you can at least, twice or three times, have a very varied experience in 2077. So this is another answer, the game was built to be replayed that way."</p><p>Fans still holding out hope for a New Game Plus mode shouldn't hold their breath, as CD Projekt announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/finally-35-years-after-launch-no-one-is-working-on-cyberpunk-2077-at-cd-projekt">there is no longer a dedicated Cyberpunk 2077 team</a> working at the studio as employees instead <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-gets-last-big-update-tomorrow-as-cd-projekt-moves-on-to-cyberpunk-2-witcher-4">turned their attention to its sequel</a> and, predominantly, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nearly-half-of-cd-projekt-now-working-on-the-witcher-4">the next Witcher game</a>.</p><p>That's not to say it won't receive any support in the future, however, as CD Projekt confirmed to IGN that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-will-get-fsr3-support-at-some-point">Cyberpunk 2077 will still get the long promised FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 (FSR3) support</a> at some point.</p><p>Development was wound down after the release of its first and only expansion, Phantom Liberty, in September 2023. It came after the game-changing Update 2.0, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/All_Cyberpunk_2077_2.0_Updates_and_Changes">completely revamped Cyberpunk 2077 with features such as a new perk system and improved AI</a>, and was followed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-update-21-patch-notes-include-metro-system-romantic-hangouts-and-new-vehicles">another big update in 2.1</a> but only minor changes afterwards.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-review">In our 9/10 review</a>, IGN said: "Cyberpunk 2077 throws you into a beautiful, dense cityscape and offers a staggering amount of flexibility in how you choose to take it from there."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

It will launch on August 6. <span id="more-886683"></span></p><p>“One of our key pillars is making new games the old-fashioned way,” said Digital Eclipse head Mike Mika in a press release. “We love and celebrate games where every pixel is hand-crafted. <em>Volgarr</em> was one of those games we couldn’t put down, no matter how hard it was. Games like this are a rare breed, and we’re happy to play a role in seeing <em>Volgarr II</em> realized.”</p><p>Crazy Viking Studios CEO and creative director Kristofor Durrschmidt added, “<em>Volgarr</em> is known for being easy to learn, hard to master. For some, that might even be an understatement. But that design philosophy guided every aspect of development for <em>Volgarr II</em>. We learned a lot from launching the original, and even with some modern updates, fans are going to love the sequel. <em>Volgarr</em> is still a game where, if you want the ultimate experience, you’ll need to really master what it asks of you.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Digital Eclipse:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>More than a decade after <em>Volgarr the Viking</em>‘s bloodbath of a debut from Crazy Viking Studios, which sold more than one million copies across PC and consoles, the barbarian king’s <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,513 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> continues in an uncompromising new form. Set against the backdrop of new and bigger-than-ever Norse-inspired worlds, <em>Volgarr the Viking II</em> ups the ante on the original’s hardcore 2D side-scrolling action in an expanded odyssey where every playthrough is grislier than the last.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The reveal trailer teases a selection of levels and enemy encounters, underscoring just how many times you’ll die (and die again)—all while progressively learning and mastering movesets, level layouts, and enemy attacks. <em>Volgarr the Viking II</em>‘s satisfyingly punishing torment will forge you into a true warrior, demanding precision, strategy, and an indomitable spirit to conquer the unforgiving world.</p><p>As the great warrior Volgarr, choose your actions wisely when entering battle, as precision is everything. One false move can spell a one-way ticket to Valhalla. Jump, duck, slide, and dodge to avoid deadly enemies while remaining cognizant of the threats posed by your environment.</p><p>While the sequel delivers the same unforgiving 1980s-arcade level of difficulty as the original, Volgarr’s a little older now, his muscles have wizened, and he graciously welcomes some new features that won’t agitate the arthritis: a practice mode, checkpoints, save profiles, and unlimited continues—but at what cost? If you can survive without these modern comforts, you’ll unlock everything the game has to offer. If not… death comes knocking.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_886710"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features Include:</strong></p><ul><li>Stave off death with new power-ups and magic items.</li><li>A roster of ruthless bosses so big and so ugly, they’re just begging to have their heads chopped off.</li><li>An epic orchestral soundtrack to carry you through battle.</li><li>Handy speedrunning tools, including an on-screen timer and no-HUD mode.</li><li>Six distinct endings based on player performance—only the masterfully skilled will unlock a hidden level to battle a secret final boss!</li><li>Modern era upgrades include a practice mode and multiple profile save options.</li><li>Buckets of blood and bone explosions.</li><li>Loincloths.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
