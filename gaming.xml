      </p></div><div><p><em>COBRA TRIANGLE</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Jr. Math</em>, <em>Golf</em>, <em>Mach Rider</em>, <em>The Mystery of Atlantis</em>, <em>SOLAR JETMAN</em>, and <em>Urban Champion</em>&nbsp;are now available as part of the&nbsp;<em><a title="Platforms > Nintendo [20,410 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> Entertainment System – <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,597 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a> Online</em> lineup, Nintendo announced.</p><p>In Japan, this month’s update includes <em>Donkey Kong Jr. Math</em>, <em>Famicom Mukashibanashi: Shin Onigashima</em>, <em>Golf</em>, <em>Gomoku Narabe Renju</em>, <em>Mach Rider</em>, <em>Mahjong</em>, and <em>Urban Champion</em>.</p><p>Here is an overview of each game available in the west, via Nintendo:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong><em>COBRA TRIANGLE</em></strong> – Heard of the Bermuda Triangle? Well, that’s a resort cruise compared to what awaits you in the <em>COBRA TRIANGLE</em>. Put your skill and reflexes to the test at the helm of a Cobra Class Speed Boat in this 1989 vehicle-based <a title="Genres > Action [1,989 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> for the original Nintendo Entertainment System. In this part boat <a title="Genres > Racing [188 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> game, part vehicular combat game, you’ll take on high-speed challenges including cannon-equipped enemy craft, imperiled swimmers, deadly sea monsters, dangerous whirlpools and ticking bombs. Play through 25 stages of aquatic mayhem, where you’ll need to collect Power-Up Items scattered throughout levels to upgrade your speed and firepower if you hope to get out of the Triangle in one piece!</li><li><strong><em>Donkey Kong Jr. Math</em></strong> – First question: Donkey Kong + Donkey Kong Jr. ÷ Math Homework = ? The answer: Numerical fun. Originally released in 1986, <em>Donkey Kong Jr. Math</em> takes the vine-swinging gameplay of the original Donkey Kong Jr. game and adds an extra element of mathematical challenge. Play as Donkey Kong Jr. and rescue Donkey Kong, who’s been imprisoned by Mario. Navigate across vines and platforms to solve math-based puzzles, which requires you to do everything from collecting numbers to grabbing appropriate symbols that add, subtract, multiply and divide them as needed to solve each problem. Along the way, you’ll gather fruit and keys, and make sure you avoid the pesky birds, nasty electric sparks and creepy chompers! Sorry, did we not mention there’d be a test?</li><li><strong><em>Golf</em></strong> – Hit the links and revisit one of the original Nintendo Entertainment System <a title="Genres > Sports [553 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/sports">sports games</a>. This 1990 classic brings you 36 holes of realistic golf action, with hazards that change every time you play (so you’ll need to plan a strategy apart from just “swing away”). Check wind direction, select the right club and adjust your swing as you make your drive. A scorecard keeps track of your strokes for each hole as you face twisting fairways and hungry sand traps. Tee time is right now, so grab your clubs!</li><li><strong><em>Mach Rider</em></strong> – Set either 88 years in the future (from today) or 127 years in the future (from the game’s original release date in 1985), <em>Mach Rider</em> is a vehicular combat racing game where players navigate their heavily-armed Quadrunner across the ruined wastes of Earth in the year 2112. Engage in the Fighting Course and blast your way across 10 different sectors, avoiding obstacles and taking down enemies. Or try your hand at the Endurance Course, where you try to complete sectors in a set time limit, with oil drums and opponents determined to slow you down. You can also tackle the time trial in the Solo Course mode where it’s just you against the clock. Remember, you are Earth’s only hope — you are Mach Rider.</li><li><strong><em>The Mystery of Atlantis</em></strong> – Known as <em>Atlantis no Nazo</em> in Japan, <em>The Mystery of Atlantis</em> is a <a title="Genres > Side-Scrolling [705 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,601 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> where players take on the role of Wyn, an amateur explorer intent on unlocking the secrets of a lost civilization and rescuing his captive master from the forces of the evil Emperor Zavyra. Using sticks of dynamite, Wyn will attempt to survive a myriad of exotic locations such as caves, temples and even clouds. Atlantis is comprised of 100 zones, each one connected by warp doors—but choose wisely! Your success in the island’s maze will depend on which doors you go through and the path you take.</li><li><strong><em>SOLAR JETMAN</em></strong> – You are Jetman on a dangerous quest to collect the lost pieces of the Golden Warpship, a near-mythical vessel capable of interstellar travel. This early-’90s multidirectional <a title="Genres > Shooter [3,813 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> puts you in the cockpit of Jetman’s Jetpod, as you explore 12 menacing alien worlds, each with its own level of gravity! Collect alien goods along the way to earn points you can trade for equipment from the Interstellar Marketing Co. Trading Post. Once you discover a piece of the Warpship, you’ll have to tow it back to your Mothership, fighting against the added drag that impacts your maneuverability (and burns away your fuel—keep an eye on those gauges!). Recovering the pieces will be no easy task, and Solar Jetman is the only hope!</li><li><strong><em>Urban Champion</em></strong> – On these streets, there is only one rule: Punch or be punched. Nintendo’s first 2D fighting game from 1986, <em>Urban Champion</em> is a bare-knuckle throwdown between fighters looking to earn the rank of Champion—and send their opponent plummeting down the nearest manhole in the process. If successful, they will earn confetti showers from local residents and, eventually, enough victory symbols to proclaim themselves the undisputed champ. But watch out for angry neighbors who will attempt to drop flowerpots on your head, and the police will make occasional appearances to temporarily break up the fight, or to make an arrest if the fight clock runs out. Spar against a computer opponent or a friend and prove your worth in becoming the Urban Champion!</li></ul></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/copa-america-ea-sports-fc-pes-tv-broadcast-angle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Copa America--South America's continental football championship, held every few years--is on right now, and because it's a weird tournament (<a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/37615113/conmebol-bizarre-decision-press-full-copa-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I don't have time to get into it</a>), the 2024 edition is actually being held in the United States of America. Which has, of course, led to even more weirdness.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/30/expensive-tickets-empty-seats-and-brutal-heat-copa-americas-fan-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It's been an organisational disaster</a> for fans, of course, that much was to be expected. But players have also been complaining about the pitches, <a href="http://stadiumdb.com/news/2024/07/copa_america_2024_empty_seats_narrow_pitches_high_prices_and_heat_failed_test_ahead_of_world_cup#:~:text=Too%20small%20pitches%20%2D%20problems%20for,forcing%20players%20to%20adapt%20quickly." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying they've been of poor quality and too small</a>. Even people watching the tournament at home have found stuff to hate, chief among them some very bizarre camera angles.</p><figure><figcaption>USA vs Uruguay as the broadcast appeared during the first half</figcaption></figure><p>The big USA v Uruguay match a few days ago featured--for the first half at least--a distant view <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5610192/2024/07/01/usmnt-camera-angle-fox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that had folks at home saying it looked like the game was being played in a "stadium for ants"</a>. This is not how football matches are normally televised, and people were upset! Normally the view is much closer to the pitch, where you can actually see who is who. Like this:</p><figure><figcaption>It doesn't matter which league or which country, nearly every football broadcast camera angle looks like this</figcaption></figure><p>It wasn't the first time a Copa America broadcast had featured the angle, taken from cameras mounted high in the stands in a stadium usually used for NFL games. Viewers hated it so much that during halftime the cameras were moved back to a more traditional perspective, so the second half looked like this:</p><figure><figcaption>USA vs Uruguay as the broadcast appeared during the first half</figcaption></figure><p>While headlines in the sporting world in the wake of this debacle have all focused on how many people hated the view, I would like to say that I loved it. And I loved it because that's exactly how I play <em>FIFA/EA Sports FC</em>. </p><p>That game's default camera angle is pretty close to traditional broadcast stuff--not a surprise given <em>EAFC </em>is more concerned with mimicking how football games look on TV than with how they feel to play--but what the game allows that TV broadcasts don't is the ability to change that view.</p><p>And I normally change it to something pretty similar to that Copa America "ant" setting! Here's the view I normally play using:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 24 &quot;Tactical&quot; Camera Settings 15 height 0 zoom (really non meta?)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hlb7GKqjs0Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It might be a "stadium for ants", but I love it. Sure, you can't always make out who is who, but that's less important to me than being able to actually see what's happening. Football is a fast, fluid sport that at any moment can shift the action 50 yards away, or see a passing move involve eight players all running around open spaces. The higher the camera is, the easier it is to see that action develop and then take place.</p><p>I thought the Copa America broadcasts were just thinking the same thing! After all, it wouldn't be the first time televised world football was influenced by video games; a few years back many penalties (which used to be shown from the regular match perspective) started being shown like this, an almost exact copy of the penalty view seen in both <em>EAFC </em>and <em>PES</em>:</p><figure><figcaption>How Messi takes a penalty in EA Sports FC</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>How Messi takes a penalty in a World Cup final</figcaption></figure><p>While the EAFC penalty view has been a huge success, I guess folks aren't ready for the ant view just yet. I hope broadcasters keep trying it out though, because I think the more you can see of what's happening on the field, the better!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review.918738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>I’ve spent every evening the past week reuniting with a dear old friend. Super Monkey Ball and I were inseparable back in the GameCube days, but we grew apart when the series traded in its perfect blend of devilish challenges and finely-tuned physics for bland level design and imprecise motion controls aimed at a more casual audience – so you can imagine my apathy when Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble’s initial announcement focused so heavily on the uncontrolled chaos of its 16-player online battles. But I’ve never been happier to be wrong, as tucked away inside Banana Rumble is the greatest set of traditional Super Monkey Ball levels the series has seen since the GameCube originals, backed up by tight mechanics that give me the complete control I needed to overcome its demanding late-game obstacles. Monkey Ball is finally back, and now all I want to do is roll.</p><p>Banana Rumble’s impressive set of 200 courses is divided into 20 cartoony worlds containing 10 stages apiece. In classic Monkey Ball fashion, the setup is delightfully simple: You have 60 seconds to roll your monkey from the start to the goal, but the hurdles between those points change radically across the adventure. The opening stages aren’t too challenging, smartly acquainting you with Banana Rumble’s mechanics so you’re ready to go when it does turn up the heat. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>As a certified <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/08/24/super-monkey-ball-2-gamecube-review">Super Monkey Ball 2</a> master, I had no trouble with the first 80 levels or so. But they’re still a joy to roll through, as I had to deal with curves, ramps, rails, switches, and bumps reminiscent of the level design seen in the excellent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/16/super-monkey-ball-3">Super Monkey Ball 1</a> and 2. Plus, speedrunning is a classic element of the originals, and it was a ton of fun to see how rapidly I could blast through levels that don’t demand too much precision, like stages where you can slam dunk into the goal with a perfect launch right from the start if you know what you’re doing. I realized pretty quickly that Banana Rumble was a return to form for the series, and I had the best time rolling through the early levels while bopping to the wonderful GameCube-inspired soundtrack.</p><p>That breezy feeling didn’t last long, though, as Banana Rumble does not hold back in its second half. The 10 EX worlds unlocked after completing the main story delivered on all the Monkey Ball challenge I’ve been begging for the series to bring back. Suddenly, I was dealing with grueling stages that truly tested my monkey mettle, from crazy rotating contraptions to invisible tilting seesaws to the narrowest of walkways you have to carefully tiptoe across, Banana Rumble is constantly introducing new challenges and smart twists on old ones. Some of the final levels took me dozens of attempts, and there’s nothing quite like the feeling when my main monkey AiAi finally breaks through that one elusive goal. In fact, I’ve been so engrossed in completing every stage Banana Rumble has to offer that one night I couldn’t even be bothered to get up to turn the lights on after it got dark outside, so I was sitting in complete darkness rolling my monkey around until well past midnight. Totally worth it.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Logan Ranks Every Super Monkey Ball</h3><p>Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble is the first brand new Monkey Ball game in over a decade, and the series' first chance to be truly good since over two decades ago. </p></div><h2><strong>Chaos, Controlled</strong></h2><p>That fantastic stage design and variety means nothing unless it <em>feels </em>right, and Super Monkey Ball nails it for the first time in decades. While it may look like you are directly moving your orb through each course, Super Monkey Ball is actually about controlling the stage, not the monkey. At its best, the control stick is aligned 1:1 with the angle of the stage, giving you pinpoint-precise command over how the terrain tilts – and in turn, how your monkey rolls through it. </p><p>2021’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-mania-review">Banana Mania</a> (which remade all the levels found in Super Monkey Ball 1, 2, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/09/super-monkey-ball-deluxe">Deluxe</a>) should have been a home run as it returned to the best stages in series history, but the controls were so sluggish and imprecise that it made them overly frustrating at best and borderline unplayable at worst. Exact controls are a necessity for the toughest levels, and Banana Rumble handles so well that whenever I fell off the stage it almost always felt like my fault, which inspired me to improve on the next run. Banana Rumble even offers extensive control options for both the stage and the camera, so I cranked every possible setting to the max and found that gave me the expert level of control I was seeking. The physics aren’t entirely perfect – sometimes I didn’t get the level of bounce I expected when dropping from a high ledge – but this is still easily the best-feeling Super Monkey Ball since the first two.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is easily the best-feeling Super Monkey Ball since the first two.</p></div><p>Banana Rumble has also finally ditched the series poorly-implemented jumping mechanic (if I’m tilting the stage and my monkey is trapped in a ball, why would they be able to jump?) in favor of an exciting new spin dash, which takes a page from Sonic the Hedgehog and lets you charge up and release a quick burst of speed. Whereas the jump never amounted to more than a gimmick in past games, the spin dash is a genius evolution of Monkey Ball’s core mechanics. It’s only mandatory in a handful of levels, but almost every single stage has some sort of shortcut or exploit that’s only possible to pull off thanks to this new ability. </p><p>A properly-aimed spin dash can catapult your poor monkey across the map in the blink of an eye, and it’s a speedrunner’s dream to uncover all the ways to take advantage of this smart addition. Banana Rumble rewards players who understand the mechanics and level design with optional routes hiding in plain sight that require expert skill to reach, and it adds a lot of replay value to an already packed adventure.</p><h2><strong>Banana Split-Screen</strong></h2><p>Multiplayer has been welcomed back to the main game, which was shockingly missing from the last two entries. You can tackle all 200 stages with up to three other players in split-screen local multiplayer or online co-op. Playing with others online is pretty seamless – I played through the entire campaign online with a friend and we never had a disconnect. Banana Rumble also runs at a very smooth 60 FPS when playing alone on Nintendo Switch, and it maintains that level of performance when you add online play into the mix. The frame rate takes a slight hit in split-screen, but not to the point where it feels unplayable.</p><p>Playing with others turns Banana Rumble into a surprisingly strategic cooperative experience. Everyone begins the stage at the same time, and only one player has to complete it in order for the group to move on. This also makes each level’s optional missions easier to complete: Every stage tasks you with collecting a certain number of bananas, completing it in under a certain number of seconds, and finding the hidden golden banana which often requires a high-level technique to snag. Assigning one person to get to the goal as fast as possible while the rest seek out bananas adds a fun layer of planning to the whole experience. I even had fun tackling levels online with random players, as I helped some Monkey Ball rookies clear some easier worlds and worked with others to grab some tricky golden bananas in later stages, using encouraging emotes and phrases to cheer my teammates on. I only wish Banana Rumble also included a more traditional Challenge Mode where you take turns and work through all of the levels individually at your own pace.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One issue with online multiplayer is that it kicks all of you out of a party after you complete a world, so I would have to share a new lobby code with my friend every single time we wanted to keep playing. Additionally, when working through the adventure mode online, Banana Rumble doesn’t show you the story cutscenes, meaning if you want to know what’s going on with AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, GonGon, and their new friend Palette, you’ll have to either play locally or catch up on all the cutscenes in the gallery after the fact. I don’t play Monkey Ball for the story – and the story here is extremely basic and barebones anyways – so I actually preferred not seeing the cutscenes so we could get straight to the stages, but it does feel like a strange omission.</p><p>Banana Rumble’s biggest monkey’s paw wish is its aforementioned battle mode. Longtime Super Monkey Ball fans know how iconic legacy party games like Monkey Target and Monkey Bowling are, but there’s nothing here that held my attention for more than a couple minutes. The five modes all feel extremely shallow and uninspired, with so few maps in rotation that I felt like I’d seen everything they had to offer after less than an hour. There’s generic racing, banana gathering, and bomb passing that feel like cheap knockoffs of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>’s battle mode. I’m guessing others feel the same way, as it took me several minutes to find a match with a full 16 players just a few days after launch. The performance also takes a serious hit in battle mode, reducing the smooth 60 FPS of the adventure mode to a choppy slideshow at times. Local multiplayer comes with its own set of limitations, as you can’t play battle mode online with two people on the same system, and three-to-four player battles aren’t even an option locally. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The five battle modes all feel extremely shallow and uninspired.</p></div><p>But even if you completely ignore Banana Rumble’s undercooked battle mode, there’s still so much to do here. I’ve already completed all 200 stages, but I’m nowhere close to finishing all of the stage missions – some of which I’m still scratching my head at as I try to figure out how I’m supposed to grab dozens of bananas and make it to the goal in time. There are hundreds of cosmetic items to buy with in-game points to style your monkey, too. I’m a simple man, so I bought AiAi’s classic orange T-shirt from the original games and called it good, but it’s cool how many outfits and accessories are available for Banana Rumble’s 12 playable characters (or more, if you get the optional SEGA Pass that adds Sonic the Hedgehog and friends to the mix).
</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble is a brilliant return to form. Monkey Ball has finally found its way home again with a set of 200 fantastic courses that range from delightfully charming to devilishly challenging, backed up by tight mechanics and predictable physics that put me in total control of my monkey’s fate. This isn’t just a cover album of Monkey Ball’s greatest hits, though, as the new spin dash ability is a genius evolution of the franchise’s core ideas, and smartly-implemented online play adds fresh layers of cooperation and strategy. The underwhelming and forgettable battle mode is Banana Rumble’s biggest disappointment, but the sheer amount of optional objectives and replayability found in its adventure mode make it easy to ignore. It doesn’t quite reach the heights of the amazing GameCube originals, but Banana Rumble is easily the best Super Monkey Ball game in over 20 years. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As far as Microsoft software goes, Visio and Project can be considered "niche." You can find cheap or even free alternatives to both of these apps, but if you really enjoy the Microsoft productivity suite, these deals could be right up your alley.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft Visio is a brainstorming and diagramming software used to create charts, graphs, and other data visualizations like architectural layouts. It comes with dozens of templates for flowcharts, org charts, floor plans, and more, and it can import data from other Microsoft programs like Excel, Exchange, and Entra ID to automatically create charts and diagrams.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft Project is a project management app similar to tools like Asana or Trello. It includes pre-built sample projects, tools for visualizing schedule timelines, and even a built-in timesheet submission form, among many other features.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4328864-microsoftvisio.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328864" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4328864-microsoftvisio.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328864"></a><figcaption>Microsoft Visio and Project apps</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4328864-microsoftvisio.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">StackSocial's deals are for the 2021 Professional editions of both apps.

Book of Adria is a bestiary detailing the many demons, beasts, and undead creatures players face in the games. Book of Lorath looks at the numerous magical relics that Sanctuary’s heroes and villains seek to control.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with the reams of lore, each volume includes illustrations and concept art from the games and in-universe correspondences between various characters to add texture to the Diablo series’ grim setting.</p><p dir="ltr">The books are available to purchase individually, though you'll wind up spending more money (roughly $70 right now)--and you won't get the slipcase.

            <p>
ack in March, Diablo 4 became the first Activision Blizzard title to join Xbox Game Pass post-Microsoft's acquisition of the publisher, and it looks like the floodgates are finally starting to open; Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is reportedly set to hit the subscription service this August, with more Activision games coming "very soon".
</p>
<p>
That's according to reliable leaker eXtas1s who, <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/exclusive-new-details-regarding-activision-games-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-emerge.222/">writing on eXputer</a>, claims to have spoken to sources and seen "certain graphic evidence" pointing to Game Pass releases for a number of Activision titles in the not-too-distant future. eXtas1s' most specific claim is that of Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy's August arrival - since <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august">corroborated by Windows Central</a> - but there's reportedly more on the way.
</p>
<p>
eXtas1s says Activision's Tony Hawk 1+2 remake and Spyro Reignited Trilogy are also heading to Game Pass - and while they "cannot guarantee" the titles will arrive alongside Crash Bandicoot, they're both reportedly joining the subscription service "very soon".

<p>
To date, Microsoft has only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-will-launch-into-xbox-game-pass-microsoft-has-reportedly-decided">confirmed one Activision Blizzard title for Game Pass</a> beyond Diablo 4 - this year's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which is set to be a release day addition to the catalogue on 25th October, just over a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's $69bn acquisition of Activision was made official</a>. Last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer warned fans the publisher's titles <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-blames-lengthy-buyout-process-for-delay-in-adding-activision-blizzard-titles-to-game-pass">wouldn't start showing up on Game Pass until 2024</a>, blaming the holdup on "a lot of uncertainty" around the buyout process.
</p>
<p>
But with the wheels seemingly now in motion, it hopefully won't be long before Microsoft and Activision finally give the masses exactly what they've been clamouring for: every Zork title on Game Pass for PC. Until then, there's always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-lineup-for-july-2024-announced">July's Xbox Game Pass additions</a>, including the likes of Journey to the Savage Planet, Tchia, Neon White, and The Case of the Golden Idol.

The dock can also back up save game data or easily extract photos captured by the Game Boy Camera.</p><p>Epilogue, the company behind it, shared a short video of the new feature on X and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/the-gb-operator-turns-your-game-boy-camera-into-the-worst-and-best-webcam-youll-ever-have">told <em>Time Extension</em></a>, “We now have a live feed from the Game Boy Camera, but still need to fine-tune some things and allow for configuration options.”</p><p>It also described the new feature as “the worst and the best webcam you’ll ever have.”</p><p>A previous attempt at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgSWPvqUGIto">turning the Game Boy Camera into a webcam</a> required a stack of hardware, including a Super Nintendo, a Super Game Boy cartridge, a device to convert a composite video signal to HDMI, and a video capture card for a PC. Epilogue’s solution looks much simpler and nearly painless — except for those forced to see their co-workers livestreamed through a relic of digital photography.</p><p>In addition to the Game Boy-focused GB Operator, Epilogue recently shared the first images of its upcoming SN Operator, which offers the same functionality and PC connectivity but for Super Nintendo cartridges. There are currently no details on when the SN Operator will be released, and “coming soon” is the only timeline shared for the GB Operator upgrades.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/2024-gama-horizons-fellowship-offers-grants-to-diverse-creators-and-businesses<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Game Manufacturer's Association (GAMA) has opened applications for its annual diversity drive. Officially called the GAMA Horizons Fellowship, the program will provide grants and support to tabletop publishers and retailers from marginalized groups.</p>
<h2>The 2024 GAMA Horizons Fellowship program</h2>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/07/02/gamas-annual-diversity-drive-opens-offering-1000-grants-convention-support-to-fledgling-board-game-publishers-retailers/">Board Game Wire</a>, the GAMA Horizons Fellowship is an eight-month accelerator program. It will offer $1,000 grants and support to creators and retailers from historically sidelined demographics, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and ability.</p>

<p>The program is open to new or prospective US and Canada-based board game publishers. The companies must be at least 51% owned or operated by people from the above-mentioned demographics.</p>
<p>Successful GAMA Horizons Fellowship program applicants will get more than just money. Those select few will receive mentoring and peer coaching, a one-year complementary GAMA membership, free admission, and booth opps at GAMA Expo and Origins 2025 with travel and lodging included, and access to virtual classes from industry veterans.</p>
<p>For those wishing to get their foot in the door of the tabletop industry, GAMA is one of the biggest organizations in the business. In addition to hosting two major board game conventions, they assist publishers and retailers in all assets of development and marketing. This organization can make <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jon-del-arroz-suspended-from-gama" rel="noopener" target="_blank">or break</a> one's career in the tabletop space.</p>
<p>The report ends with testimonials of earlier GAMA Horizons Fellowship program applicants. Golden Lasso Games' Kimi Hughes stated it "opened up a whole new world of knowledge and connections."</p>
<p>PlayForge's Jesse Stommel provided a similar anecdote. He mentions the difficulty of management during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as his struggles being queer and disabled and how the program let him find invaluable people that were in his corner.</p>

While you could spend thousands on a truly top-of the line TV with blacks as dark as an event horizon, you could also splurge on a 48-inch LG OLED. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-48-class-b4-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv/6584787.p?skuId=6584787&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-48-class-b4-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv/6584787.p?skuId=6584787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Buy is also selling those</a></span> for just $800 (almost 50 percent off the sticker price). </p><h2 id="h205224"><a id=""></a>Best Used Game Sales</h2><p>GameStop is currently running a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamestop.com/search/?pmid=30006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamestop.com/search/?pmid=30006" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buy 2, get 1 free on all used games</a></span>, including its (very limited) retro collection. It’s great way to catch up on bargain bin stuff you might have never gotten to (<em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</em>, <em>Watch Dogs 2</em>, <em>GTA V</em>) as well as more recent stuff that hasn’t dropped in value yet. For example, you could play some of 2024's biggest games so far like <em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em>, <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, and <em>Tekken 8</em> and save roughly $50 in the process.

The Fiberglass Rod costs 1,800G and is unavailable until you reach Fishing Level 2, which will require you to do some fishing. Every fishing rod you unlock after this point will have a bait slot. Bait is also used in Crab Pots, which will only catch something if it has a piece of bait in it, and which you have to refill. Holding bait and interacting with the Crab Pot will place it inside.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4328667-bait.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328667" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4328667-bait.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328667"></a><figcaption>Once you get a fishing pole that has a bait slot, you can equip bait directly from your inventory.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4328667-bait.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The fishing rod itself can have the bait added directly to your inventory by moving it to the fishing rod. Fishing rods can hold a large amount of bait, so you don't have to reload in between fish.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to get bait</h2><p dir="ltr">Fishing bait can be obtained in multiple ways. There is the default bait, along with some specialized versions, which can be crafted using bug meat and other items after leveling up your Fishing skill. Bug Meat is acquired by defeating bug enemies in the mines. You can also craft a Worm Bin, which unlocks at Fishing Level 4, which will periodically produce bait. It can occasionally be found in treasure chests found while fishing and Willy sells it in his shop.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Putting players in the shoes of an engineer tasked with heading alone into a dark basement to restart an ailing generator is a tried-and-true trope in horror video games. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep/" data-ref-id="5000-590948">Still Wakes the Deep</a> has a lot that's very familiar to horror fans, it's what it does with this trope of making you the poor lone sucker who needs to flip all the switches and face all the danger to do it, that sets it apart from a field of horror titles. Other games could learn from what developer The Chinese Room does with what has become a very well-worn premise.</p><p dir="ltr">On paper, Still Wakes the Deep is pretty standard as a horror story, and highly recognizable for anyone who's played games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/amnesia-a-machine-for-pigs/" data-ref-id="5000-134003">Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs</a>, the developer's previous horror game. It takes place on an oil rig in 1975, and before long, spooky stuff starts kicking off. In its gameplay, Still Wakes the Deep riffs on Amnesia's formula of only allowing you to run and hide from its lethal terrors, sneaking around things that can instantly murder you and hoping they can't squeeze into the small spaces that you can.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">You can also tell where things are going the second you meet protagonist Caz, the rig's electrician--although, somewhat hilariously, The Chinese Room starts the game by immediately subverting that premise. The first few minutes of the game see Caz defending his job, but all he can really manage is insisting, "I'm good with the lecky." You can guess pretty early on that the power is going to go out, and someone who's good with the lecky is the obvious choice to go turn it back on, even if Caz is actually underqualified for the gig.</p><p dir="ltr">The lone protagonist facing near-certain death to turn the lights back on has become one of the most well-worn cliches of horror gaming. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-space/" data-ref-id="5000-535206">Dead Space</a> makes your engineering qualifications central to the whole game experience. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alien-isolation/" data-ref-id="5000-232868">Alien: Isolation</a>, you're damn near the only competent person left alive on Sevastopol station when it comes to fixing continually ailing machinery. The Amnesia games are all about wandering alone in dark places, and the latest, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/amnesia-the-bunker/" data-ref-id="5000-577134">Amnesia: The Bunker</a>, makes fueling a generator a constant consideration as you explore the area and avoid the monster hunting for you.</p><p dir="ltr">Even when there aren't fuses to replace or gas tanks to fill, horror games from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard/" data-ref-id="5000-455390">Resident Evil 7</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/soma/" data-ref-id="5000-198647">SOMA</a> all focus on a single idea: Stuff needs doing, and you must do that stuff. Alone.</p><p dir="ltr">Still Wakes the Deep does send you down into the depths of the oil rig to flip switches and fix machines on more than one occasion. You're often moving slowly through flooded corridors, hearing awful things slithering around in the distance, before they pop around the corner and you have to dash madly for a distant hatch, slipping through only at the last possible second. But where it challenges the trope is in the fact that you're not <em>always</em> alone in doing those things. In fact, you spend a lot of time with other people on the rig, who are just as competent and in several cases much more qualified than you are--and they're helping turn the lights back on, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328826-stillwakesthedeepspookyplaces.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328826" data-ratio="0.54166666666667" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328826-stillwakesthedeepspookyplaces.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328826"></a><figcaption>There are plenty of gross and spooky places you explore in Still Wakes the Deep, usually to fix something that has broken.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328826-stillwakesthedeepspookyplaces.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The thing that made Still Wakes the Deep work for me wasn't that it presented another foray into sneaking and hiding and hearing spooky noises in a decaying disaster zone, although those things generally work well and successfully deliver scares and tension. It was the fact that it spent so much time developing other characters, putting you in rooms with them, and sharing the workload between you. While Still Wakes the Deep doesn't <em>functionally</em> change the formula these horror games rely on, it puts so much focus on other people that it fundamentally changes how the game <em>feels</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">What works about Still Wakes the Deep is its emphasis on the fact that you're <em>not</em> alone. There are still other survivors on the rig, and they're working to save it just like you are. Two engineers, Brodie and Findlay, send you on tough missions a few times--you'll restart the rig's generator, drain the rig's pontoons to keep it afloat, and relight its flame stack to keep the whole place from exploding--and it's not that different in practice from the orders you get over the radio in Dead Space or Alien: Isolation. But while you're draining two of the four pontoons, Brodie is draining the other two. When you're relighting the flame stack, he's waiting in the control room to make sure the operation is successful, because he knows how it works. In gameplay terms, you might still be doing these things alone, but Brodie or Findlay's presence in a scene changes its vibe. You're working together, you spend time with them, and thanks to a lot of well-acted, well-written dialogue, you get a sense of who they are. You care about what happens to them.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the fundamental element that elevates Still Wakes the Deep: caring about the other characters. Much as I absolutely love both Dead Space and Alien: Isolation, neither is particularly good at <em>characters</em>. Every time I revisit Alien: Isolation, I find myself wishing for a version that hewed closer to the 1979 movie it's adapting, not just in visuals and gameplay but in character and storytelling. In Alien: Isolation, you're the only person who can fix <em>anything</em> in almost every case, and everyone else is kind of a clown. It's in the title: You're isolated against the alien for <em>hours</em>. At a key moment halfway through, when you return to a previously safe place to find it ransacked and many of your comrades dead, it's <em>really</em> difficult to feel anything about what happened.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328825-stillwakesthedeepfindlay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328825" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328825-stillwakesthedeepfindlay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328825"></a><figcaption>You spend a fair amount of time with Findlay and other characters in Still Wakes the Deep.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328825-stillwakesthedeepfindlay.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Dead Space is a little better about this, particularly with its remake version by Motive Studio, but only barely. The other characters are mostly voices on the radio, or distant people you see in tableau for a second before you go back to engineering and monster-fighting. You never have time to really bond with them, and lots of times, they stand around waiting while you head into danger. In both games, what other characters you do happen across tend to get ripped to shreds in front of you; they're a tool to show you the level of threat you're dealing with more than anything else.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a reason for this, of course. Being alone, with no one to rely on, is scary. Going long stretches wandering through empty dark halls, and then finally hearing something moving in the distance and knowing that sound shouldn't be there, sends a shiver down the spine. Moments like escorting Ashley in Resident Evil 4 aren't scary, and neither is cooperative play in Resident Evil 5, and a lot of it has to do with the broken tension of knowing whatever you're facing, you're not doing so alone.</p><p dir="ltr">But what Alien: Isolation, Dead Space, and countless other games like them are missing is something that Still Wakes the Deep nails, and that's the fear of what might happen to others. When a necromorph slashes apart Isaac Clark, or the alien chases down Amanda Ripley, the frightening tension those games run on is, finally and abruptly, broken. As in many horror games, there's nothing to fear in either other than getting killed--and once that happens, the nature of games instantly demonstrates that it's nothing to fear at all. You just restart from your last checkpoint and try again. Death is a fake concept in most games, and it's the presentation coupled with your suspension of disbelief that makes them scary at all. The fear of death drives these games, but <em>actually dying</em> breaks the spell.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328827-alienisolation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328827" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328827-alienisolation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328827"></a><figcaption>In a lot of horror games, like Alien: Isolation, monsters are scary--right up until the moment they actually catch you.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328827-alienisolation.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In Still Wakes the Deep, spending time with other characters means you're worried about them. When you and Brodie split up to drain the pontoons, you know he's in the same danger you are. When Findlay heads out to fix a fault in the power lines so you can restart the generator, she's in the same area, with the same monster, that you are. When you spend time with other characters, when you see the relationship they have with the Caz--or cultivate some of your own--you fear not just what might be waiting to get you. You fear what might happen to <em>them</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Fundamentally, I don't think the near-constant isolation in Alien: Isolation, Dead Space, or countless other games is necessary, and in fact, I think there are times when all that loneliness actively undercuts them. Isolation isn't the only tool these games can use on players, and yet it tends to be the one they rely on almost exclusively.</p><p dir="ltr">Horror movies, to borrow an example from another medium, function on presenting things that happen with so much distance from the audience that they personally are no danger, but we can still find them frightening. They're scary because of our empathy, because humans are social creatures. Horror games can make the scary things much more immediate, but a lot of them are missing out on that huge piece of the human experience with horror. Still Wakes the Deep shows that being alone isn't always essential to making horror scary in video games. It can be just as unnerving knowing that when the thing isn't chasing you, it's because someone else has caught its attention.</p>
