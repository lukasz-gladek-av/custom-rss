		<p>Clear Endeavour Games has revealed Ultimate Sheep Raccoon, their bike racing party game successor to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ultimate-chicke-horse">Ultimate Chicken Horse</a> set to launch in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ultimate Sheep Raccoon Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4hC8GudgBU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Similar to Ultimate Chicken Horse, you’re all in a race to survive and reach the finish line of a level, replaying it multiple times to decide a winner… except that between each round players are able to lay deadly traps and modify the level, making it harder and harder to survive.&nbsp;Ultimate Sheep Raccoon, however, puts you all on bikes instead of having you platform around – it’s a bit more Trials-like in that regard, and you can earn bonus points for pulling off tricks.</p>
<p>Helping you survive will be power-ups, including jetpacks, parachutes to glide, bouncy mines to off your rivals, and more. Helping to make things utterly awful and hilarious are all of the traps and level parts, whether it’s adding rails, ramps and bouncy pads, or pendulums, spikes and laser-emitting TVs.</p>
<p>There’s returning characters in the form of Chicken, Horse, Sheep and Racoon, as well as a bunch of new barnyard animals… because this game support up to 8 players! There’s local, online and cross-platform multiplayer, so anyone and everyone can hop into the game together.</p>

<p>For now, though, the only confirmed platform is PC, and you can wishlist on Steam.</p>

			<p>Epic Games has <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1866894827930976259" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-ballistic-is-a-5v5-tactical-first-person-competitive-mode-launching-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortnite Ballistic</a> is now available on early access as planned. This is a 5-versus-5 tactical competitive mode made exclusively for first-person view. Here, players are always split into attackers and defenders, and each team is tasked with an opposing goal: to either plant a Rift Point Device at one of two sites on the map or prevent this from happening, respectively.</p>
<p>All matches in Fortnite Ballistic begin with players on each team selecting one of five Flex Gadgets that they alone will be able to purchase and use. Each Flex Gadget is very powerful, according to Epic, enough to potentially turn the tide of a match if used correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Proximity Mine can be placed on the floor, wall, or ceiling to surprise an unsuspecting enemy. They can be picked up and placed again and will explode if shot.</li>
<li>The Bubble Shield allows you to drop a temporary protective bubble that shields you and your team from bullets and grenades alike.</li>
<li>The Recon Grenade gadget will mark any enemies near where it's thrown, even through walls. Throw a Recon Gadget into a location before entering to get an idea of who might be waiting for you.</li>
<li>The regular but always trustworthy Frag Grenade couldn't be missing, of course. It will bounce and explode as you'd expect, dealing damage to nearby enemies. In Fortnite Ballistic, you'll take damage from your own grenades, but the same does not apply to allies.</li>
<li>Last but not least, the Impulse Grenade gadget is a disruptive tool that scatters enemies and allies. It has many creative uses, such as launching teammates into a location from a distance.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Ballistic Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wYdar6yxg7E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Today, Epic Games also announced that Fortnite creators can publish Islands using the First Person Camera Mode device, allowing even more dedicated first-person experiences to be created and shared throughout the game. It certainly looks like Epic is pushing hard to improve first-person content in their title.</p>

The feature could be useful if you want to jump into a game without having to install the whole thing; given how big game file sizes can be nowadays, streaming a game via the cloud might be a faster way to play or save you from hitting a data cap. </p><p>Microsoft has published a list of games that support the feature <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fplay%2Fgallery%2Fbuy-and-stream">on its website</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is updating the Xbox app on Windows today with hundreds of PC games that weren’t previously available and a new home experience. It’s part of a broader effort to make the Xbox app <em>the </em>place to find PC games, regardless of whether they’re part of PC Game Pass or not.</p><p>“Earlier this summer, we began working with partners to bring all PC games with Xbox features into the Xbox app,” <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/12/updates-to-the-xbox-app/">explains Chris Charla</a>, general manager of content curation and programs at Xbox. “We’re super excited to see what Xbox games come to Windows PC from game creators in the future and to welcome nearly 400 titles that previously weren’t discoverable or purchasable in the Xbox app.”</p><div><figcaption><em>The new Xbox app homescreen.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><p>The 400 new games include titles from Japanese studios like Kemco and Kairosoft, alongside games like <em>The Invincible</em>&nbsp;by Double 11. More than 100 of these new titles are also Xbox Play Anywhere, so if you buy the Xbox console version then you can play the Xbox PC version too. “Universal Xbox ownership, as well as universal cloud saves on Xbox, and cross-play between Xbox versions on console and PC (and other platforms, at the developer’s discretion) are awesome features players love,” says Charla.</p><p>What’s not immediately clear from Microsoft’s blog post is exactly what “bring all PC games with Xbox features into the Xbox app,” means. Microsoft has been trying to tempt game developers over to its Windows-based store in recent years, even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent">lowing its cut from 30 percent to just 12 percent</a> to try and shake up PC gaming. </p><p>Despite these efforts, there are plenty of PC games that have cross-play between the Xbox and PC version of the game but aren’t part of the Microsoft Store currently or the Xbox app. Microsoft now appears to be working to bring even more of these games into the Xbox app, and it will be interesting to see whether the company makes the bold move of listing Steam, Epic Games Store, or <a href="http://itch.io/">itch.io</a> games in the Xbox app soon, too. Microsoft says it will have more to share about its Xbox app plans at the game developers conference in March.</p><p>Microsoft is also rolling out a new home UI for the Xbox app on Windows today. The home UI now includes featured content from PC Game Pass and the Microsoft Store, alongside collections of deals and discounts. Microsoft has also added a “jump back in” section that lets you quickly get back into recent games just like you can on an Xbox console.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A two headed dog? Maybe. "In Phogs! you play as a two headed dog called Red and Blue.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-meet-the-medieval-cast-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't need to have played the original Kingdom Come: Deliverance to get up to speed with the sequel, thanks to an extended intro that fills you in on the broader details. But it might help to know a bit about the main cast before you set off into the medieval Bohemian countryside. The story features a rich cast made up of both real historical figures and fictional ones, and the politics of it all can be tricky to untangle. Luckily, we've got you covered. Let's meet the characters of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be warned that these bios contain some spoilers from the first game!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Wenceslaus IV and Sigismund of Hungary: A Clash of Kings</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1378, 25 years before the events of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, the emperor Charles IV, who was widely regarded as a pretty cool guy, died. As is often the case when a really cool king or emperor dies, this led to an inconvenient series of events. His son Wenceslaus became his successor to the throne of Bohemia, and gained a reputation for spending his days doing sod all, not showing much interest in his kingly responsibilities.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In response to this, his younger half-brother, Sigismund of Hungary, decided to make a play for the Bohemian throne and took Wenceslaus prisoner. During the events of the first game, he is seen riding around demanding the loyalty of local nobles and burning down villages he believes are harboring rebels – including Skalitz, the hometown of our protagonist, Henry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In real life, it was a complicated situation with no clear good guys and bad guys, necessarily. I mean, if you ask me, pretty much all medieval nobles were bad guys. But in the context of KCD, Wenceslaus is the good and true king and Sigismund is the plunderous pretender. That's how Henry sees it, anyway. And if the guy on one side of a civil war had burned down my village and killed my parents, I'd probably agree.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As an additional fun fact, the real-life Sigismund founded the chivalric Order of the Dragon. You may have heard of it, since a certain Romanian prince, Vlad Dracul, was nicknamed such for being a member of it. His son, Dracula ("son of the dragon"), would go on to be even more famous.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Henry of Skalitz: The Blacksmith's Son</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The protagonist of both Kingdom Come: Deliverance games is a common lad named Henry who saw his whole life go up in flames and his family murdered. The son of a blacksmith, he was forced to make his way in the world without many useful skills to speak of – the very picture of a level-one RPG character. But steadily, over the course of the first game, he became a capable swordsman, a daring adventurer, and even learned to read and write – which was a rare enough skill in the middle ages, even among the nobles, that it was practically a superpower.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Henry becomes involved with a faction of nobles who oppose Sigismund and want to see Wenceslaus restored to the Bohemian throne, rising from his lowly status to be a trusted and valued retainer. He also spends some time as a monk. It's kind of a long story. But he also has a more specific quest: retrieving the stolen sword he and his father made for their lord, Radzig Kobyla, before the village was attacked.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Istvan Toth: A Big Ol' Jerk</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the jerk who stole said sword. A Hungarian noble and supporter of Sigismund, he was the main antagonist of the first game and managed to wriggle free from the good guys' grasp by exchanging some hostages. While Henry certainly feels a sense of duty to Wenceslaus, his more personal motivation is getting that dang sword back from Toth. And then probably giving it back, pointy end first, if we're being honest. His whereabouts are currently unknown.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Sir Radzig Kobyla: A Friendly Noble</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lord of Skalitz before its destruction, Sir Radzig is part of the pro-Wenceslaus faction, which is why Sigismund saw his seat of power ransacked. Also – last warning for spoilers – he's Henry's real, biological father. Which sort of makes Henry nobility. Or at least, there is a nobleman with a very strong interest in his future and wellbeing. Martin the blacksmith is still definitely Henry's father figure. But Sir Radzig has become a very important man in his life.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Sir Hans Capon: Your Spoiled BFF</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Sir Hans Capon is a young nobleman about Henry's age and a member of Wenceslaus' faction who plays a much larger role in KCD2 than he did in the first game, being Henry's main compatriot. They're not always the best of friends, though. Hans is a bit of a playboy nepo baby who was raised with the proverbial silver spoon in his mouth and tends to act petulant and entitled, often to Henry's frustration. He's also quite easily distracted by women.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the start of KCD2, Henry and Hans have been dispatched on a mission to feel out which of the remaining Bohemian nobles might be willing to stand up against Sigismund and help restore Wenceslaus to the throne. And while he's not entirely apathetic to politics, he mostly looks at this as an opportunity for travel and adventure. To be blunt, he's a bit of a dick. But he seems to have a good heart, even if he doesn't normally let it guide him. Can we fix him? That remains to be seen.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Theresa: The Girl Who Saved Your Sorry Butt</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A fellow refugee from Skalitz who now lives with her uncle, Theresa is a bold woman who has saved Henry's life more than once. She's also the potential main love interest in KCD1, if you choose to pursue her side quests. It's not clear what role, if any, she will play in KCD2. But especially considering she and Henry were likely to have become romantically involved, I would be somewhat surprised if we've already seen the last of her.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Sir Divish: The Guy Who Saved Your Sorry Butt</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Sir Divish is the Lord of Talmberg, where Henry took refuge right after the destruction of Skalitz. The fortress was later seized in an intrigue orchestrated by Toth, and the climax of the first game involves a siege to reclaim it. He is, along with Radzig, one of the main conspirators of the Wenceslaus faction, and a very shrewd leader who has kept his people safe by holding his allegiances close to his chest.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Markvart von Aulitz: Probably The Real Final Bad Guy</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If I'm being honest, I don't give Istvan Toth long to live. The fact that we didn't get to stick it to him at the end of the first game was a huge tease, and he only made it out by the skin of his teeth. Markvart is a bit higher up the food chain, as one of Sigismund's main army commanders and the man who led the attack on Skalitz. He was a somewhat distant enemy in the first game, seeming almost untouchable. But if I had to place my bets on who we'll be crossing swords with at the end of KCD2? I think it's probably this guy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That should give you a pretty good idea of which important pieces are on the board at the start of this new adventure. For more, stay tuned all December long as our exclusive IGN First coverage of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 continues.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the first three days of the drive, over 100 readers have contributed almost $9,500 to either the <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> or <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play</a> as part of the charity drive (Child's Play is now leading in the donation totals by about $1,000).

<p>That doesn't mean you should put your donation off, though. Do yourself and the charities involved a favor and give now while you're thinking about it.</p>

                                        <p>Though Metaphor: ReFantazio is the former Persona team's first foray into high fantasy, it might also be the most grounded and deeply human game they've ever created. By weaving magical elements with universal topics--such as prejudice, poverty, grief, cycles of violence, anxiety, and the role religion and politics can play in both oppressing and empowering the people--Metaphor is able to examine humanity with some distance and through a unique lens. It poses countless questions to its players, all while admitting the answers might not be simple or absolute. And yet, it places special emphasis on one question in particular: Does fiction have the power to shape our world?</p><p dir="ltr">By the time the game comes to a close, the answer is a resounding yes. Metaphor: ReFantazio is a beautiful exploration into how fantasy is a vessel for ideas and humanity even in the darkest of times. It understands the impact that art and the ideas transferred through it have on society, and asks us to both believe in and scrutinize the media we consume.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1096010837"

Game Of The Year 2024</p><div><p>         Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?       </p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/signup/">Sign up</a> or <a

format.     </p><p>Sorry, but you can't access this content!</p></div><p dir="ltr"><span>The game's cast of characters--from bubbly, blonde pop star Junah and the wisened ninja Heismay, to the disgraced-yet-beloved Louis--are all well-designed, well-voiced, and utterly engaging, making them instantly appealing (or detestable) to players. Each offers their own exploration into the various aforementioned themes, weaving stories that are equal parts heart-wrenching and heartwarming. This depth is also afforded to the game's numerous side characters, which comprise the greatest and most fully-realized roster of social links in an Atlus game thus far.</span></p><p dir="ltr">The studio handles all these narratives with nuance and precision, demonstrating a respect for its players' intelligence as well as immense conviction in its own beliefs. In a time when games are all too often criticized for being too political, Atlus takes a firm stand on the side of compassion and makes it clear that there is virtue in addressing social issues, taking collective action, standing up for your ideas, and believing in a better future for both yourself and those around you. Living in fear and giving into hatred is easy, Metaphor reminds us. It is remaining hopeful and caring that takes strength.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite being a lengthy game, Metaphor is phenomenally paced, with an appropriate amount of time dedicated to each area, character, and story arc. These arcs are all particularly memorable, too, as the game is filled with spectacle, off-the-wall situations that ward off monotony, and compelling plot twists. In that sense, the game often reminded me of the late '90s JRPGs I grew up playing--the ones filled with theatrics, humor, and a keen sense of adventure. It's an almost intangible and indescribable quality, but one that Metaphor undoubtedly possesses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4412473-4378508-metaphor_refantazio%E2%80%94storytrailer_xboxseriesx_s%2Cwindowspc1-37screenshot-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412473" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4412473-4378508-metaphor_refantazio%E2%80%94storytrailer_xboxseriesx_s%2Cwindowspc1-37screenshot-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412473"></a><figcaption>Antagonist Louis looks out into a smoke-filled sky.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4412473-4378508-metaphor_refantazio%E2%80%94storytrailer_xboxseriesx_s%2Cwindowspc1-37screenshot-1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">And yet, Metaphor markedly improves old-school, turn-based combat, addressing the most common complaints with the system--namely its slower pace--through smart button mapping, superb party flexibility, and the addition of light action-style combat. This all makes for battles that are strategic yet breezy, and dungeon traversal that doesn't overstay its welcome or begin to feel more like a chore than an adventure. The game's other systems, from its calendar and Royal Virtues to its Archetype tree, perfectly fit within the combat, creating dynamic gameplay that feels interconnected and immensely satisfying.</p><p dir="ltr">Remarkable art direction and music further elevate the experience, as rather than use a single color palette, as Persona typically does, Metaphor leverages several different colors to convey various themes, tones, and amplify its sense of journey. Its music is similarly complex and juxtaposing, as it bounds between angelic choirs to frenzied chanting. Though its stories might be universal, there is an otherworldly quality to its visuals and music, reminding players that this world is dark and fantastical.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of when Metaphor: ReFantazio was released, it would remain an exceptional title. But in the year 2024--a year marred by political unrest, growing inequality, fear, distrust, misinformation, and division--no game feels quite as apt and essential. While not every work of fiction can change the world, or instill within it a goodness that has seemingly been stripped away, Metaphor: ReFantazio is a reminder that art can change us.</p><p dir="ltr"><i>Curious if your favorite game of 2024 made it in our top 10?

However, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fsony-disc-drive-for-playstation-5-digital-edition-consoles-slim%2F402415.html">GameStop</a> is now offering a rare window for GameStop Pro members to pick one up for its original MSRP of $79.99. </p><p>GameStop’s loyalty program <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpro%2F">costs $25 a year</a>, so you can consider that an added premium if you’re not interested in its other benefits.

<p>There won’t be a Battle Royale mode coming to Delta Force any time soon.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hb22q5/delta_force_game_director_here_ask_me_anything/?sort=new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ask Me Anything</a> on Reddit on Tuesday, Delta Force Game Director Shadow Guo was asked about the possibility. Immediately, however, he shot the idea down.</p>



<p>“We&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;have&nbsp;such&nbsp;plans&nbsp;for&nbsp;now&nbsp;as&nbsp;our&nbsp;primary&nbsp;focus&nbsp;is&nbsp;on&nbsp;Operations&nbsp;and&nbsp;Warfare,” Guo said..</p>



<p>Instead of a Battle Royale, Guo pointed to the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-release-single-player-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Black Hawk Down</a> campaign mode. In an answer to another question, Guo talked about the inspiration behind the setting and theme for the campaign and it being different than multiplayer’s setting, saying they wanted to honor past Delta Force Games.</p>



<p>“We are working hard to preserve and expand the Delta Force franchise,” Guo said. “The campaign, which is set in the 90s, is our love letter to classic Delta Force titles. We would also like to create something new for the Delta Force universe, hence the 2035 timeline set in the multiplayer part.”</p>



<p>He added that the development is “coming along nicely” and things are looking good for the Q1 2025 (January) release of the mode.</p>



<p>“Our team will be sharing more details when it’s closer to the campaign’s launch,” he said.</p>

A spark meant to shine and vanish in a blink. But I will travel! I will mark my trail in every firmament. I will live to see the universe.” <em>Faraway</em> is an immersive, both challenging and chill, procedurally generated audiovisual experience about creating constellations.</p><p><em>Faraway</em> is a single-player game, where you control a shooting star who is constantly in the process of vanishing, but keeping itself alive by harvesting energy from the stars, by creating constellations. Players have to tame the smooth, flowing controls of swinging and slingshotting around stars, while weaving an energy string and connecting it to stars.</p><p><em>Faraway</em> has a randomly generated core mode, and 16 puzzle stages.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In the core mode, every game stars from scratch with a new world that procedurally generates itself in realtime based on the player’s performance, allowing experienced players to catapult themselves quickly to higher scores and higher levels of difficulty. Players have complete freedom on how to shape their constellations, but certain moves – like making loops – yield extra energy and points.</p><p>The 16 puzzle stages present new ways to think about the game mechanics and get better at the core mode.</p><p>Created single handedly by Steph Thirion, game designer, creative coder and musician, with all visuals being fully generated from scratch in realtime, <em>Faraway</em> is an elegantly minimal-yet-deep game, wrapped in an audiovisual experience that will have players return to it for a long time.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="FARAWAY | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5LxbmaXQa-E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With the press of a button, players can then directly jump to the Research Centre UI screen.</p><p dir="ltr">What exactly this unannounced feature entails is still under wraps, but it appears that players will be able to unlock models for various Space Marine 2 factions--the Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Tyranids, and Thousand Sons--with a new form of currency. Unlocking the models appears to then grant other cosmetic rewards, like the currently unlockable Thousand Sons emblem. It's also possible players will be able to inspect the models in greater detail, with them serving as a new form of collectable.</p><p dir="ltr">How players will earn this new currency to use in the Research Centre is still unknown, but Saber Interactive's Space Marine 2 roadmap does point towards a "Battle Barge expansion" as part of the game's third season in 2025 alongside another new Operation, a new PvP mode, Prestige ranks, and more. The Research Centre certainly sounds like it could be the Battle Barge expansion in question, but fans will have to wait for Saber to make the feature official to learn more.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to adding new content, Space Marine 2's update 5 also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2-next-big-update-will-ban-mods-in-public-matches-in-the-name-of-server-stability/1100-6527944/" data-ref-id="1100-6527944">banned the use of mods in the game's public matches in the name of server stability</a>.

            <p>Back when I played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/path-of-exile-2-everything-we-know">Path Of Exile 2</a> at Summer Games Fest, I fought a cave-dwelling boss who summoned hordes of grotty subterranean wildlife to swamp me. Fortunately, I was rolling a Witch - perhaps the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/path-of-exile-2-best-class-for-beginners">best beginner POE2 class</a> - so I could summon an army of skeletons in response. A similar horde vs horde encounter is underway at POE 2 developers Grinding Gear Games. The game launched in early access over the weekend, and has already drawn so many players that the developers are emergency-hiring additional staff to cope with the waves of support emails.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We've had a massive amount of players logging into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> since launch, which has been amazing to see!" reads <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3616595">an apologetic Community Team post</a> on the official forums. "Unfortunately, such a huge influx of players also generates an enormous amount of support requests.</p>
<p>"Despite their best efforts, we're currently looking at turn around times that are much longer than expected on new emails, where we'd usually be aiming for responses within the same day, if not the same hour. We are currently hiring new people for support to be able to handle the increased load so that we can decrease the backlog as soon as possible."</p>
<p>The post requests that people not send follow-up emails to check on unanswered messages, so as not to clog the workings even further. They've also run into some technical troubles with the "severely overloaded" ticket processing system, which have caused some emails to be incorrectly processed, creating additional delays. To put this in the context of my opening anecdote: it's like when you summon a skeleton but you read the instructions wrong and now the skeleton has a pelvis for a head, and you have to shame-facedly reassemble your bony minion while your enemies stand around, moaning about the loot drop tables.</p><p>I'm being very frivolous, of course. Tech support staff are among the least-sung champions of game development. They deserve better than to be absent-mindedly compared to the walking dead by some asshole whose idea of "customer service" is "don't actively and gleefully insult the reader's intelligence".</p>
<p>I'm a little aghast that Grinding Gear have had to staff up after launch - Path Of Exile 2 was always going to be popular. It's not clear whether the new hires are temporary or full-time. Going by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/path-of-exile-2-patch-makes-looting-significantly-more-rewarding-with-further-updates-planned-for-dodge-rolls">the first POE 2 patches</a>, there are, at least, no major technical problems to worry about for the moment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It stands to reason that we’ll see more of the latter as additional characters are added in the future seasons. That means Team-Ups are a standout mechanic that will always have some influence on who you want to play as. You’ll benefit greatly from knowing every Team-Up Ability in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.</p><h2 id="h170672"><a id="team"></a>What is a Team-Up Ability?</h2><p>Team-Up Abiltiies are powerful expressions of teamwork and are exclusive skills between two or three heroes. <strong>Team-Up Abilities commonly work with one hero acting as an initiator and provider of special buffs or moves, while the other hero (or two) can receive it if they’re on the same team.</strong> Their benefits are usually pretty one-sided, but there is no downside to using them. Each one is additive and merely gives you more options.</p><p>A great example is Voltaic Union. Activated by Thor, he can provide Storm and/or Captain America with a buff that enhances their attacks. Only one of them has to be on a team with Thor to receive the buffs, but both can receive it if all three characters are fighting together.</p><h2 id="h170673"><a id="every"></a>Every Team-Up Ability in Marvel Rivals</h2><figure id="" data-id="63dc355944a913b6e87bae23de83c28c" data-recommend-id="image://63dc355944a913b6e87bae23de83c28c" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2126" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a selection of Team-Up Abilities in Marvel Rivals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a selection of Team-Up Abilities in Marvel Rivals." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="63dc355944a913b6e87bae23de83c28c" data-recommend-id="image://63dc355944a913b6e87bae23de83c28c" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2126" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a selection of Team-Up Abilities in Marvel Rivals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Below is a breakdown of every Team-Up Ability added with the launch of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. We’re including the ability name and a description of what the ability is. The heroes that can take part will also be mentioned, with those in bold being the initiators who provide the buffs.</p><p>We’re using the Team-Up Ability name from the Team-Ups screen on the main menu. Every hero involved in one of these has a distinct name for their role in the ability. It can get a little confusing, so we’ll just be using the main title.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Ragnarok Rebirth - When <strong>Hela</strong> defeats an enemy with a final hit, she’ll immediately resurrect Loki or Thor if they’re in the respawn phase. If they’re alive, she’ll instead provide them with bonus health.</li><li>Metallic Chaos - <strong>Scarlet Witch</strong> infuses Magneto’s greatsword with her Chaos Energy, granting him access to projectile slashes.</li><li>Voltaic Union - <strong>Thor</strong> uses his Thorforce to power up Storm and/or Captain America. The former gains a lightning barrage attack, while the latter earns a movement bonus and an electric AoE buff to his shield throw.</li><li>Planet X Pals - Both Rocket Raccoon and Jeff the Land Shark can jump onto <strong>Groot</strong>’s shoulder to shoot out attacks, earning a damage reduction bonus while doing so.</li><li>Symbiote Bond - <strong>Venom</strong> channels the Symbiote through Spider-Man and/or Peni Parker, granting them an identical move that has Symbiote spikes explode from their body. </li><li>Gamma Charge - <strong>The Hulk</strong> uses his Gamma Radiation to charge up Doctor Strange and/or Iron Man. This buffs their Maelstrom of Madness and Armor Overdrive attacks respectively.</li><li>Ammo Overload - <strong>Rocket Raccoon</strong> gains a throwable Ammo Overload Device. Both The Punisher and Winter Soldier will receive infinite ammo and a faster firing rate if they’re near the device.</li><li>Dimensional Shortcut - Both Black Panther and Psylocke can gain a rewind ability when <strong>Magik</strong> is on their team. It allows them to return to the position they were in moments before, as well as partially earn any missing health back.</li><li>Lunar Force - With <strong>Cloak and Dagger</strong> on their team, Moon Knight gains the ability to create a small field around himself that he turns invisible in.</li><li>Guardian Revival - <strong>Adam Warlock</strong> grants a similar resurrection ability to Mantis and/or Star-Lord, letting them move around and revive themselves. </li><li>Chilling Charisma - When <strong>Luna Snow</strong> is on their team, both Namor and Jeff the Land Shark gain an activatable ability that will buff their other attacks while active.</li><li>Allied Agents - <strong>Hawkeye</strong> provides a variant of his strongest ability to Black Widow, letting her see afterimages of enemies that she can attack to deal damage.</li><li>Atlas Bond - <strong>Iron Fist</strong> empowers Luna Snow with a unique ability while on her team. It allows her to expel a ring of energy that can heal allies while also damaging and slowing enemies.</li><li>ESU Alumnus - <strong>Spider-Man</strong> provides Squirrel Girl with a Web Bomb ability. She can throw this at enemies to create an AoE blast that deals damage and momentarily binds them.</li><li>Fastball Special - With <strong>Hulk</strong> on the team, both he and Wolverine gain a unique Team-Up ability that allows the former to throw the latter.

<p>The extraction shooter genre has exploded in recent years, and it’s arguably down to the ongoing success of Escape from Tarkov, from Battlestate Games. This spearhead of a game has popularised the extraction shooter gameplay loop, so much so that many developers have tried to get in on the action in the last two or three years.</p>



<p>One such attempt to mirror Tarkov’s success comes in the form of PIONER, a new post-apocalyptic MMO FPS from GFA Games, a Serbian studio.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-stalker-and-metro-oh-my">Tarkov, STALKER, and Metro – Oh, My!</h2>



<p>PIONER recently went live on Steam, which means users can now add the harrowing FPS title to their wishlist in anticipation of the game’s impending release, which is slated for 2025.</p>



<p>Here’s the game’s description from Steam:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>PIONER</em>&nbsp;is an open-world MMO first-person shooter set in a haunting, alternative-reality world where Soviet-era structures lie abandoned on a desolate, post-apocalyptic island. In this immersive environment, the gameplay experience is defined by dynamic PvE and PvP elements, where realism takes priority over traditional health bars or character levels. </p>



<p>With a sprawling map of 50+ square kilometers, not counting hidden dungeons, players can explore a world rich with mystery and danger, encountering story quests and faction missions that influence relationships and loyalty rewards.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wrapped up within PIONER is ‘Shadowlands’, an extraction shooter mode that boasts the core mechanics typical for the genre. Players are invited to enter the supersized map, loot and fight to their heart’s desire, and then attempt to successfully extract from the map.</p>



<p>PIONER has been inspired by other, similar titles. Elements of STALKER, Metro, and Fallout can all be seen in the clips, shots, and trailers that have been released in the last year or so, which unfortunately means that the game’s make-up and overall aesthetic aren’t going to stand apart from the competition.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Bold promises have been made regarding the ultimate delivery of PIONER. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s bio on Steam</a>, GFA Games has promised sci-fi-influenced lore, a ‘rich’ campaign, diverse activities including <strong>casino games and fishing</strong>, and extensive survival mechanics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-says-hero-shooters-need-a-really-strong-hook-to-convince-fans-to-ditch-the-game-theyre-already-playing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Concord "didn’t bring any unique value proposition."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The director of Marvel Rivals has discussed the difficulty of successfully entering the packed hero shooter market, pointing to failures like Concord as evidence of the increasing need to have a strong hook that helps convince players to ditch the game they're already invested in for something new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid eye-wateringly low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely, and shut its developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord was the latest in a string of recent hero shooter flops, which includes Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Post-launch content for that game comes to an end early 2025, just a year after launch, having left a $200 million hole in publisher Warner Bros.’ finances.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase’s Marvel Rivals, however, appears to have avoided a similar fate. It is a free-to-play live service hero shooter in the Overwatch style and benefits from the power of the Marvel brand, but it clearly clicked with the audience, hitting an impressive 10 million players in just three days.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/marvel-rivals-dev-concord-failed-it-didnt-bring-any-unique-value/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VideoGamer.com</a>, Marvel Rivals game director Thaddeus Sasser said Concord “didn’t bring any unique value proposition,” which contributed to its failure. But speaking more generally about the hero shooter market, Sasser said live service games need a hook to convince players of already successful hero shooters to jump ship having already invested their time and money in those games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s a switching cost,” Sasser said. “I’ve already invested in Overwatch, I’ve got 15 skins for Pharah, I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, Sasser said, the market is incredibly difficult to predict, and game developers never know how popular their game will be until it’s actually out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a game developer you’re always worried until the audience has responded,” Sasser continued. “The truth is that I don’t think anybody can accurately predict this or the game industry would be radically different today. There’s a lot of games that come out that people are like, ‘It’s going to do well,’ then it flops or people come out and go, ‘It’s going to flop,’ and it succeeds amazingly. So, I think it’s really hard to tell ahead of time and you’re always worried about that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Marvel Rivals, Sasser suggested its superhero factor is the reason fans are willing to leave their favorite games behind to give it a shot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t know about you, but when I heard the concept of the game I was like, ‘Oh my God I want to go be Storm in a game, I want to go be Doctor Strange in a game. I want to be those heroes in the game, that sounds awesome.’ And of course my mind immediately leapt to all the cool possibilities you could have with that. That’s what I think will pull people in as well too. If we’ve done our jobs well, they’ll love what they play and they’ll want to play some more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For NetEase, it will be hoping not only to keep Marvel Rivals’ player count as high as possible for as long as possible (something that’s proved particularly tricky for live service games of late), but to make enough money from players to meet the company’s internal revenue projections. To that end, Marvel Rivals sells a battle pass and premium skins, but are they convincing players to open their wallets? Early signs suggest they are — Marvel Rivals is the second top-selling game on Steam by revenue, behind only Grinding Gear Games’ action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/path-of-exile-2"><u>Path of Exile 2</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep an eye on the latest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-codes">Marvel Rivals codes</a> for free skins, and vote on the strongest Marvel Rivals characters in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/marvel-rivals/Marvel_Rivals_Characters">community tier list</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<section><p>Are technology products made in China, like video game consoles, going to become more expensive in 2025? Here's what some experts are saying.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">One of US President-elect Donald Trump's biggest talking points this election season has been around the subject of tariffs. Specifically, Trump has discussed tariff rates of 60% or more on products imported from China. Considering China is where video game consoles, accessories, and other video game and technology products are produced (at least in part--but these days, to a lesser degree), many are wondering how these proposed tariffs could impact the consumer.</p><p dir="ltr">In short, people want to know if video game consoles and games are about to get significantly more expensive, as some have predicted. This issue is even more top of mind considering the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> is expected to launch in 2025, with Rockstar's massively anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> also lined up for release next year.</p><p dir="ltr">There are no definitive answers as of yet. Some economists believe 60% tariffs are impossible. And Trump may not go forward with his plans as he's described them after he takes office in January, or at all. We spoke with analysts and collated other quotes and analysis about the potential impact of tariffs on video games to help paint a clearer picture of the situation in these early days.</p><h2 dir="ltr">"There's Going To Be A Lot More Tariffs"</h2><p dir="ltr">What is a tariff? These are taxes placed on goods when they come across national borders. As <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/tariffs-explained-by-economics-professor-trade-expert/" rel="nofollow ">USC Cornsife reminds us</a>, tariffs first came to be in America not long after the Constitution was ratified more than two hundred years ago. Another key thing to know is that in a situation where import tariffs are implemented, like what's being discussed here, the end consumer typically carries the burden because companies importing the goods raise prices to avoid taking the hit, and pass that increased cost along to the consumer.</p><p dir="ltr">Tu Xinquan, who leads the University of International Business and Economics at the China Institute in Beijing, told <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-us-trump-tariffs-exports-yiwu-98701fd34985e232ae61e4f9aa4c6540" rel="nofollow ">The Associated Press</a> that "no one" can face a 60% tariff. Should that happen, companies would "completely halt their trade with the US," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">During Trump's first term as US president, he implemented tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of products from China, and this in turn led to imports tapering off before rebounding again. Part of the plan was to help grow the US manufacturing industry, but experts say this did not happen. President Biden kept Trump's tariffs in place and added more, such as for steel and electric vehicles. Trump's proposed new tariff plan would be more wide-ranging and could potentially impact video games. Some in Washington and elsewhere believe Trump will be more bold and aggressive in his second term.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's going to be a lot more tariffs, I mean, he's pretty clear," Coalition for a Prosperous America CEO Michael Stumo told the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-china-mexico-canada-fentanyl-inflation-cf905e75e863511baef959a80ee2eea2" rel="nofollow ">AP</a>. Former White House official Jen Harris, who worked under Biden, said a key concern with Trump's tariff proposal is that it could give companies an opportunity to "jack up prices."</p><p dir="ltr">Just recently, Trump said on a December 8 airing of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-immigration-tariffs-pardons-abortion-prosecutions-riot-72c08269f0a870d20e29033319201e22" rel="nofollow ">NBC's Meet The Press</a> that his planned new import taxes could end up costing consumers more at the register. "I can't guarantee anything. I can't guarantee tomorrow," he said in an interview when asked if consumers might pay more if his import taxes go into effect.</p><h2 dir="ltr">An Unwelcome Development For Video Games</h2><p dir="ltr">The video game industry has faced stormy seasons of late, with major publishers cutting costs through game cancellations, layoffs, studio closures, and other ramp-downs. New tariffs arriving <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/">as the video game industry looks to rebound in 2025</a> could be problematic, experts warn.</p><p dir="ltr">"The potential roll out of US-based tariffs for games-related imports is an unwelcome development for the industry," Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis told GameSpot. "It is particularly bad timing because of the headwinds the industry continues to face with cost-cutting ongoing in response to slower market growth, increasing R&amp;D budgets and overexpansion during the pandemic."</p><p dir="ltr">Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter told GameSpot that because Microsoft and Sony have US divisions, their game downloads--which represent a growing share of all game sales--would be tariff-free. In Nintendo's case, however, Pachter theorized that Nintendo could work with a US subsidiary. "Nintendo can get around this by having a US subsidiary license the rights to sell games in the US for $1 or so per unit, so they might pay tariffs on the $1, but the rest of their digital sales would be tariff-free," Pachter said.</p><p dir="ltr">For physical games, which have become a smaller piece of the overall sales mix but still a statistically significant element of it, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lbupwrrohs25" rel="nofollow ">Circana's Mat Piscatella said</a> an import tax would prompt an increase in prices to consumers. In turn, Pisctalla said the most-likely scenario would be for publishers to raise digital game prices to be at parity. "Or the alternative would be to abandon physical. Either way, not great," Piscatella said. "Call me old school, but I'm more [of] a free-market guy. Going the isolationist/protectionist route doesn't generally work out all that well for normal people."</p><p dir="ltr">For new game hardware, meanwhile, Pachter said companies like Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft can manufacture their systems in a no-tariff country or even the US. Analyst David Gibson, who covers Nintendo extensively for MST Financial, told <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-tariffs-could-cost-gamers-142000313.html" rel="nofollow ">Yahoo News</a> that Nintendo got ahead of things years ago and is now producing around 50% of all Switch consoles outside of China, in places like Vietnam. That said, Gibson said he believes Switch prices--and presumably the cost of a Switch 2--could go up if Trump's import tax plans go ahead. Gibson estimated that Sony produces around 70% of PlayStation devices in China, with the rest being made in Japan and other regions. Microsoft, meanwhile, has been <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Google-Microsoft-shift-production-from-China-faster-due-to-virus" rel="nofollow ">shifting its manufacturing operations beyond China</a> for years already.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4413866-ps5pro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4413866" data-ratio="0.61241970021413" data-width="934" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4413866-ps5pro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4413866"></a><figcaption>At $700, the PS5 Pro is already expensive.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4413866-ps5pro.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Harding-Rolls said the most direct impact of potential import taxes would be the home console market. Harding-Rolls estimates that the US is the biggest console market worldwide, making up 45% of spending on games all up and 35% of console hardware sales volume. "Even if there is only a tariff applied to console hardware and accessories, this could disrupt the overall global console market as it would undermine US hardware sales, delay consumer adoption of new consoles, and even reduce consumer spending power on games and games services to offset these increases," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">Even without new import taxes in place, Harding-Rolls said he anticipates the Switch 2 to launch in Q2 2025 at a higher price point than the original Switch. Should any new foreign tariffs come to bear, that could be a significant disruptor for Nintendo's plans and might lead to an even higher price point for the highly anticipated new console, Harding-Rolls said.</p><blockquote data-size="small" data-align="left"><p dir="ltr">"The effects would be devastating for game fans. China would not pay for this: the US consumer would." -- Serkan Toto</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">"For early adopters, a higher price at launch is unlikely to deter them [from] buying into the platform, but it could have a dampening effect in 2026 and onwards," he said. "While there has been some talk of more intensive adoption of cloud gaming services in response to potential hardware price increases, that’s not relevant to upcoming Switch/Switch 2 games made specifically for those platforms. That includes Nintendo’s own Switch/Switch 2 games."</p><p dir="ltr">Serkan Toto of Japanese consulting firm Kantan was blunt in his assessment of how new import taxes could affect the end consumer. "The effects would be devastating for game fans," he told <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/proposed-trump-tariffs-video-game-industry/" rel="nofollow ">Digital Trends</a>. "China would not pay for this: the US consumer would."</p><h2 dir="ltr">$100 games?</h2><p dir="ltr">The Consumer Technology Association (CTA) <a href="https://shop.cta.tech/products/how-the-proposed-trump-tariffs-increase-prices-for-consumer-technology-products" rel="nofollow ">published a report in October</a> that said new import taxes on technology products would increase prices across the board, but video game consoles specifically could see up to 40% increases to their sticker cost. With some quick and inexact math, that would make a PS5 cost $800 in the US instead of $500, with the price of games jumping from $70 to $112, Toto said. In reality, it might not work out this way for any number of reasons, though. This is all speculative and uncertain at the moment. That said, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/walmart-other-us-companies-raise-concerns-over-proposed-trump-tariffs-2024-11-19/" rel="nofollow ">Walmart, Best Buy, and other major US retailers have said</a> Trump's import tax proposals would likely lead to significant increases in price for all manner of goods.</p><p dir="ltr">Unquestionably one of the biggest game releases of 2025 is Grand Theft Auto VI, and some video game observers have already theorized that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-prompt-a-shift-to-more-expensive-games/1100-6526121/">Take-Two could charge more than $70 for it</a>. After all, the price of AAA game development has continued to climb in recent years without a significant change to the price of new games--something that former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-talks-about-the-collapse-of-creativity-in-aaa-game-development/1100-6527223/">railed on about over and over in interviews. </a></p><h2 dir="ltr">Will Microsoft, Sony, And Nintendo Fight The Tariffs Like They Did In 2019?</h2><p dir="ltr">Trump's proposed tariffs may not go ahead as planned, or at all, of course. But if they do, it's possible video game products could be granted an exception. Some may recall how the CTA worked with Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo during Trump's first presidency to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-sony-and-nintendo-25-percent-tariff-on-consoles-would-cause-disproportionate-harm" rel="nofollow ">push back against proposed tariffs</a>--and they <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/13/apple-dodges-iphone-tariff-after-trump-confirms-china-trade-agreement.html" rel="nofollow ">succeeded. </a></p><p dir="ltr">"In particular, tariffs on video game consoles would injure consumers, video game developers, retailers and console manufacturers; put thousands of high-value, rewarding US jobs at risk; and stifle innovation in our industry and beyond," the CTA's letter from 2019 said.</p><p dir="ltr">On November 27, the CTA <a href="https://www.cta.tech/Resources/Newsroom/Media-Releases/2024/November/CTA-Statement-on-Proposed-Tariff-Increases" rel="nofollow ">released a statement from CEO Gary Shapiro</a>, saying the trade taxes--if implemented--would be a "major inflation-causing tax on Americans and harmful to the US economy." The CTA estimated that the new tariffs, as proposed, would affect more than $350 billion's worth of US imports on technology products coming in from China, as well as Mexico and Canada. Given these concerns, it stands to reason that the CTA would attempt once again to lobby to either stop the tariffs or carve out exceptions like they did in 2019.</p><div tabindex="0"

blog</a> that he expects Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo to once again band together to make a plea for an exemption, just like they successfully did years ago. Harding-Rolls hopes to see this, too.</p><p dir="ltr">"During Trump's previous administration, Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo got together to successfully argue for an exemption to import tariffs. Let's hope that the gaming sector is spared once again," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has reached out to Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony to find out if these companies plan to band together like they did in 2019 to fight the import taxes. At press time, none have responded.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Tariffs Leading To Changing Consumer Behavior</h2><p dir="ltr">Another element at play with these proposed tariffs is how they could shake up the video game market in terms of how people play games. Van Dreunen argues that, with console prices potentially going up, consumers might seek out "hardware-independent" ways to play their favorite games. "These tariffs could fast-track the industry's shift toward cloud gaming, streaming services, and transmedia distribution, marking a classic transition from content innovation to distribution innovation in the pendulum cycle," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">For its part, Microsoft is already pushing into this area with Game Pass and its own cloud-gaming service, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/">essentially makes any internet-connected screen an Xbox. </a>Microsoft is in the business of selling consoles, but with some predicting that the wider console market is not growing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-playstation-and-nintendo-console-market-isnt-growing-phil-spencer-says/1100-6527787/">Xbox is trying new strategies to reach people where they are.</a> Van Dreunen said he thinks Sony might also look for lower-cost distribution alternatives, citing the surprising popularity of the PlayStation Portal device as an example. There are reports of Sony doing even more in this department with its own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-reportedly-developing-a-ps5-portable-system/1100-6528023/">dedicated PS5 portable gaming device.</a> "Even including the higher tariffs, [the PlayStation Portal] would remain a reasonable substitute compared to upgrading to the next version of the PlayStation," he said.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Lots Of Unknowns</h2><p dir="ltr">Whether or not any of Trump's plans come to fruition as he laid them out or at all is an open question. Even if he does plan to press ahead with his new import taxes as proposed, he could face scrutiny and pushback from legislators and the public. The AP reported that House Democrats have already compiled legislation that seeks to take away any president's ability to introduce new tariffs on their own. This was understood to be a symbolic effort considering the Republicans will hold control of the House and Senate under Trump. Suzan DelBene, a Democrat from Washington, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-china-mexico-canada-fentanyl-inflation-cf905e75e863511baef959a80ee2eea2" rel="nofollow ">said</a> no Republican or Democrat president should have the power to "indiscriminately raise costs on the American people through tariffs." We'll soon find out if Trump does just that.</p>

<p>So, what of the games themselves? Well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-frontiers-review-new-open-zone-direction-still-constrained-by-old-flaws">we called Sonic Frontiers "a hot mess of a reinvention"</a>, however one that "can't commit to its new direction".</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forspoken">Forspoken</a>, meanwhile, we said was "a slow burner", but one that still had its charms. "I had my doubts going into Forspoken, and I came away pleasantly surprised. Despite misgivings about Frey's backstory and the divisive dialogue, Luminous has created one of the more engaging heroes I've seen for some time, even if she shuns that title," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forspoken-review-a-slow-burner-thats-not-without-its-charms">Eurogamer's Forspoken review</a>.</p>

			<p>As the winter season is fully underway, a lot of games are now getting their festive updates, and this includes Dying Light 2: Staying Human. The festive update for this game is called Winter Tales: Gifts from Above and sees Villedor back in the holiday spirit. This festive update comes to the game today, alongside the release of Patch 1.20, with the event being accessible until January 2, 2025. This update shows Villedor becoming a beautiful snow-covered landscape with a tree in the middle. However, the tree is missing decorations, and players need to complete bounties from Baka or loot containers to get the trinkets, ornaments, and decorations needed to dress up the tree for the festive season.</p>
<p>The players who commit to the Winter event in Dying Light 2: Stay Human to get the tree fully decorated will be rewarded with gifts such as the Killer Krampus Outfit and Winter Sweets, which are in-game currency that can be spent at Baka's stall. Baka's stall is out with the old and in with the new, swapping from a Halloween stand to a festive shack, including boomerang-style Skoll, Snowballs, and even The Punisher weapon for those who are looking for new ways to take down the zombies.</p>
<p>The more you increase Baka's reputation, you'll be given a letter that you can then send off to Santa using the post box next to the stall, which will provide you with a festive airdrop full of gifts to enjoy. The rewards will change frequently, meaning that players will have to stay on top of the airdrop challenges to ensure that they get the entire Killer Krampus Gear Set.</p>
<p>During the Winter Tales: Gifts From Above event, players will be introduced to a new enemy. This event usually comes with Uncle Snows and the Naughty Infected and Virals, but now he has a new enemy for players to face off against. This enemy is the Ice Spitter, who will shoot projectiles at the player.</p>
<p>As stated above, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-gets-major-ps5-pro-enhancements-with-ray-tracing-and-or-higher-graphics-settings/">one final update</a> for the year is coming along with the Winter update. This is Patch 1.20, and is dedicated to streamlining the Prologue so that players can experience the intense action much faster. Of course, it also focuses on fixing some of the most reported issues, such as the headless Aiden during a stomp animation.</p>
<p>As a final gift to players of Dying Light 2: Stay Human, players will be able to grab the Above the Law Bundle for free until January 2.</p>
<p>For those who have yet to experience Dying Light 1 or Dying Light 2: Stay Human, they are both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239140/Dying_Light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on discount of up to 80%</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Astro Bot Holiday Update to Bring New Level and More Tomorrow]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-holiday-update-to-bring-new-level-and-more-tomorrow.1058049/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-holiday-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Team Asobi has announced a holiday update for celebrated 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, and it's set to add a brand new level to the game tomorrow.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/11/astro-bot-winter-wonder-update-out-tomorrow/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet says that the "little robotic elves of Team Asobi have been very busy" preparing the new update, which arrives tomorrow at 6pm Pacific (that's 9pm Eastern and around 11pm GMT).</p>

<p>The first major addition coming as part of the update is a level by the name of Winter Wonder, which Doucet describes as a "fun-filled level with shiny presents [and] a good dose of jingle bells". Sounds pretty appropriate for the holiday season!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/team-asobi-astro-bot-holiday-update-new-level.jpg?itok=XeKgwsmJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/team-asobi-astro-bot-holiday-update-new-level.jpg?itok=-wrL7LhX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is getting a holiday update that brings a brand new level and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Team Asobi promises that the new level won't offer a "hair-pulling challenge", since it was designed "with every user in mind", which, again, feels appropriate enough for a holiday-themed level.</p>

<p>As well as the level itself, you can also look forward to some special new bots to find, although Team Asobi says it wants both the bots and the level itself to "remain a little surprise", so it's not giving away many details regarding either element of the update.</p>

<p>If you want to access Winter Wonder, you'll need to have completed&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, although as our very own <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right" rel="nofollow">Andrew Stretch's glowing review</a> will attest, doing so isn't a particularly arduous task. If you haven't already played&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, then this new level might be the perfect excuse to convince you to do so.</p>




<p>Winter Wonder is just the latest piece of post-launch content for&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>. Since it arrived in September, the 3D platformer has been updated with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch" rel="nofollow">new challenge stages</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-astro-bot-speedrun-stage-tomorrow" rel="nofollow">new bots</a>, although we're not sure if those updates will continue into 2025.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-sales-sony-financials" rel="nofollow">1.5 million sales in a nine-week period</a>, however, it'd arguably be in Sony's best interest to continue supporting the game. Will that success lead to a sequel? Only time will tell.</p>

<p><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is available right now <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/astro-bot/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively for PlayStation 5</a>. The holiday update, which adds the Winter Wonder level and new special bots, will be made available for all players tomorrow.</p>
