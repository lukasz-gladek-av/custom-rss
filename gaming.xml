			<p>One of the most anticipated games of 2024, Star Wars Outlaws, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-gameplay-ubisoft-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> prominently during yesterday's Ubisoft Forward event. Fans got an extended new look at protagonist Kay Vess in action.</p>
<p>Today, we've got an exclusive interview straight from Summer Game Fest 2024 with Ubisoft Massive's Navid Khavari (narrative director) and Mathias Karlson (game director alongside Julian Gerighty), who shared some juicy new details about Star Wars Outlaws.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the game is slated to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on August 30. You can read all about the various editions in <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/star-wars-outlaws-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-open-world-game-in-the-far-far-away-galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our roundup article</a>.</p>

<p><strong>When did your team first get the idea for an open world action adventure Star Wars game themed around the Underworld?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Karlson:</strong> Good question. I think what we can say is that we started our conversations with the team at Lucasfilm Games sometime in 2021. I think it's a game that felt so natural. It was in us, like as kids growing up with this trinity, specifically that era we're in between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.</p>
<p>And getting even the notion that we might be making a game in Star Wars, and then finally ending up with Lucasfilm themselves saying, you know what? With a scoundrel game in the underworld, we think you fit in right in between these two movies. It was just a really cool day.</p>
<p><strong>Navid</strong> <strong>Khavari:</strong> I think there's also an expertise within Ubisoft Massive in terms of the open-world gameplay, design, and world-building that you've seen in previous games, so it was just a natural fit. We always talked about the idea of stepping into Star Wars. That's something we've always wanted to do, and we're looking to realize that.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like developing a game of this caliber right under the pandemic for the first year and a half or so?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson:</strong> I mean, it was, of course, new to everyone. I think we quickly adapted. I think any endeavor if you're armed with a really, really clear idea of what you want to achieve, and you have a great team, and in our case also fantastic collaborators in Lucasfilm Games, and we were all, from day one, just pulling in the same direction. We quickly got into a new groove and just kept going.</p>
<p><strong>Now, Kay Vess certainly looks great. However, some Star Wars fans are a bit disappointed as they would have liked an alien protagonist for once. Was that ever a consideration before settling on Kay?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Navid</strong> <strong>Khavari:</strong> No, I don't think so. We knew very early on that we wanted to set ourselves within a scoundrel and truly Kay, and I should say Kay and Nyx, kind of organically came from that. Their dynamic duo, with Kay being a scoundrel from Canto Bight growing up on the streets as a thief and then having this companion, Nyx, who is a brand new species, a brand new creature that is a meal with sort of a mysterious history. It came about really, really organically.</p>
<p><strong>Can fans expect to see characters from other Star Wars, such as games, movies, and TV shows, appearing in Star Wars Outlaws?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Navid Khavari</strong>: Yeah, definitely. I think you'll have to wait a little bit, until August 30 (the launch date), to see them all. But you've seen Jabba, you've seen Kira, which was just an unbelievable thing to be able to have in our game. And we recently announced Lando. He's very fun to play Sabacc with. So, I think there's a lot of fun stuff coming in that regard. Honestly, I think if I got into the Easter eggs, your 15-minute interview would be over, so we shall leave some secrets for the launch.</p>
<p><strong>As a quick follow-up, is the expanded universe off-limits for Star Wars Outlaws?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Navid</strong> <strong>Khavari:</strong> I think I'm not going to answer that one. Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>Can you guys discuss Toshara, the new planet you've created in collaboration with Lucasfilm?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Karlson:</strong> Sure. We were going to make a new planet, right? That's pretty cool. Of course, your mind starts racing, and we ended up with something that's very inspired by the savannas of Africa. We even had a part of the team going down there for a research trip. I think something that we found really inspiring was to couple that with something that's very Star Wars inspired just to have a very distinct vibe.</p>
<p>There's a very clear profile. All of Tatooine is desert, and Toshara is windswept on top of this savannah. And the combination of these almost amber-like mountainous structures and the wind that's just been eroding this place for many, many, many years felt very distinct. It felt like something you've never seen before. Definitely not in Star Wars. And then, of course, it's filled with new lore.</p>
<p><strong>Navid Khavari:</strong> We were really excited about this idea of a planet in the Outer Rim that the underworld sort of finds as a nexus, right? When Kay arrives on Toshara, what was really fun is that her as a rookie having to navigate the Underworld within it is, I think, going to be incredibly satisfying.</p>
<p>There is a whole range of characters that you're going to meet, but also just the feeling of zipping around on your speeder on the Tosharan savannah. Nothing really beats it. Lucasfilm really was very generous. I think they put a lot of trust in us to try and bring something new and interesting to the table. When you get on Toshara, the first stop is usually the cantina. You get to meet the locals and understand the dynamics of the characters there. I think it really fits into the underworld fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>Will players be able to see the aftermath of the Battle of Hoth firsthand?</strong></p>
<p>No comment on that one!</p>
<p><strong>Okay. I had to try! Can you tell me how many planets players can visit in Star Wars Outlaws?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Navid Khavari:</strong> Absolutely, yeah. We have five planets in Star Wars Outlaws. We have Canto Bight, which you might recognize from The Last Jedi. Toshara, which is our brand new planet - or sorry, brand new moon I should say - in the Outer Rim. And then, of course, we have Kijimi, the snow-swept planet that you might recognize from Rise of Skywalker. That is particularly exciting because it's ruled by a new syndicate we're bringing to the table called the Ashita Clan, which is this Melitto species with a hive-like hierarchical structure of control.</p>
<p>Then we have Akiva, which fans of Star Wars will know was featured in the book. It's the first time we're gonna actually be able to see and explore this jungle planet. And then, of course, there's Tatooine, which was just incredibly exciting to bring to life.</p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson:</strong> I think something we're very proud of in this game is being able to offer all of these different locations so seamlessly stitched together in what truly feels like one big slice of the galaxy. Being able to go to your speeder and drive it into your ship, literally take off and hyper-drive wherever you want at your own fingertips and land and then drive out again. I think people will really, really like it.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The open world is sizable. It's definitely truly open world with a contiguous feeling to it. You can blast your speeder for minutes.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How large of an open world should players expect when landing on the planets?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson:</strong> It's sizable. It's different from planet to planet. It hasn't been an exercise for us that's metrics driven in the sense that we're going for size as a primary motivator when thinking about, okay, how do we bring this planet to life? It will vary. It's definitely truly open world with a contiguous feeling to it. You can blast your speeder for minutes. But at the end of the day, it is about being truthful to the source. Or in our case, also some new stuff. And to fit it with things that are interesting. If there's something on the horizon that piques your interest, you can actually drive over there and have a look and you will stumble into some adventure.</p>
<p><strong>In addition to the speeder, will it be possible for Kay to ride animals as well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson: </strong>We'll have to wait and see, but the speeder is her primary travel method—her steel horse, if you will.</p>
<p><strong> I want to kind of shift gears over to the Wanted and reputation systems. If your reputation with a certain faction drops too low, is there still a way to repair that relationship and avoid, you know, being shot on-site by their operatives?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson: </strong>100%. So, really central to our philosophy around the reputation system is that Kay is not a character that is about allying with a cause or allegiance and things like this. It's a very free-spirited person who is seeking ultimate freedom for her life. But for you as a player, this very naturally translates into the fact that you're the one navigating this world.</p>
<p>It's about, you know, rolling with the punches and really playing the underworld. You will have means to get back, and at the end of the day, I think you'll come to find that it's more about what you're after than what they can get out of you. You're gonna grow increasingly into the driver's seat, so to say, and how to interact with it.</p>
<p><strong>Navid</strong> <strong>Khavari:</strong> Yeah, exactly, and I think that's very true to Star Wars as well, you know. I like to say that Han, even by Empire, always believed that he could actually pay off his debt to Jabba. And I think it's the same with Kay, right? If you're useful at the right time, you can turn the tide of opinion of someone like Jabba or Kira.</p>
<p><strong>Makes sense. In one of the three demos I played today I did experience that you can essentially pay off a corrupt empire official and reduce Kay's wanted level. Can she also take contracts directly from empire officials?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias</strong> <strong>Karlson:</strong> Mhm.....Can't share. But I think we can share that contracts are one very player-agency-centric part of the game where you have the opportunity to say, okay, I'm on the low side with this syndicate right now. I want to push it up. Or if you really want to enjoy the fruits of being in an excellent reputation end the scale, taking jobs and contracts for the different syndicates is something you can do.</p>
<p><strong>Looking at the Trailblazer ship, can Kay Vess customize it aesthetically and/or functionally in any way?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Karlson:</strong> So, in general, progressing and evolving and growing is really I think central to both the narrative and the game itself. Upgrading your abilities with Nyx. Him being able to do even more things for you. Your blaster, your speeder, your ship, you saw that Kay was maybe putting on a different jacket when you played in Kijimi.</p>
<p>That is a very player-centric choice, and these different gear pieces and clothing pieces also have gameplay effects on them. So, there's a lot to look forward to when it comes to both visual and gameplay customization.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so does that include customizing the ship as well, then?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Karlson: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Alright. What percentage of the game will be comprised of space exploration&nbsp;or combat?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mathias Karlson: </strong>That's really up to you at the end of the day. When we think of Star Wars Outlaws as an open-world experience, space is just a natural part of the Star Wars world as a planet's surface.</p>
<p>So you are at all times free to take off into space and explore that region, jump wherever you want on and around the planets in our game. Both the story, the main campaign, which is the thrust through this game, and the contracts, etc. will also take you to space if you don't go there just on your own accord.</p>
<p><strong>Navid Khavari:</strong> Yeah, and we've described it as the story is kind of an engine. Kay's journey is an engine of pursuit through the different planets and the regions, but there's nothing stopping you from, you know, taking on the contract in space or taking on the dogfight, so I think as Mathias said, it's really how much time do you want to spend in space.</p>
<p><strong>Can you revisit planets whenever you want?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. At the end of the day, there's a lot of freedom in the hands of you as a player in that you can revisit or play these planets in the order you like.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of game length are you targeting for Star Wars Outlaws?</strong></p>
<p>It's a full-bodied single-player action-adventure experience that is very scalable with how much time you invest into exploring the world that we prepared for you. So, I'd say it at least doubles the duration of playing just the campaign part if you engage with everything else.</p>
<p><strong>How much time can you spend with Sabacc?</strong></p>
<p>As much as you ask for. And I will tell you I've spent hours playing Sabacc just on its own and it was a blast. The team's done an excellent job of creating it.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you two so very much for your time.</strong></p>

The dwarf is a fan favorite for his cheeky banter, the stories he tells, and his devotion to Bianca, his crossbow he’s been carrying with him in every appearance since 2011. He’s got a personal relationship with Solas, the <em>Inquisition</em> party member who’s revealed to be a major antagonist at the end of that game. He wants to stop the elven mage’s world-ending plan and he hopes to do it by talking things out. But as Solas refuses to listen, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812">Varric</a></span> draws his crossbow…only for Solas to destroy it with a spell. Fans are not okay. The moment is around the 16:45 mark:<br></p><p>Scroll down to the comments on YouTube and you’ll find plenty of fans with a renewed drive to stop Solas’ plans, not just because they threaten the lives of everyone who isn’t an elf, but because Bianca’s destruction must be avenged.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Mofo really betrayed me, stole my gear, took my hand, and now he’s killed Bianca?!!” writes @npc6254.</p><p>“Bold of them to put such an important character death in a teaser. RIP Bianca,” @fireandsun4476 commented.</p><p>“Ok now it’s Dragon Age : Revenge for Bianca,” @quemsereu2009 said.</p><p>“*Solas breaks Bianca*<br>Me: this time is very personal (knife emoji)” @pinkpearl1601 wrote.</p></blockquote><p>To the average passerby, that probably sounds like a lot of hoopla for a crossbow. But Bianca, and Varric’s reverence for the weapon, have been a key part of the dwarf’s story over the years. <em>Inquisition </em>reveals the bow’s namesake and it’s a big moment for a character who tends to shroud his own history with a smokescreen of storytelling. He also doesn’t use other bows despite technically being an archer, and the only way to make him more powerful in that role is to find upgrades for Bianca in <em>Inquisition</em>. For <em>Dragon Age </em>fans, this is like if Cloud’s Buster Sword got snapped in half in the next <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> <em>Remake</em> game.</p><p>Will Bianca be salvaged? Is Varric going to be okay without his trusty weapon? What is Solas going to do now that Rook dropped a statue on him?

While leaning very much into the high-fantasy role-playing experience from the developer's history on the Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">series, Dragon Age plays with different fantasy styles while also placing an increasing amount of value into its merry band of evolving party members.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Dragon Age: The Veilguard </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(formerly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dreadwolf</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">), BioWare aims to revitalize the series by returning to a traditional high-fantasy role-playing game. It's a new Dragon Age that continues the series' trend of offering an escalating sense of high-fantasy political and social intrigue, yet still seeks to highlight BioWare's long-standing strengths when it comes to having a cast of compelling characters and deciding their fate. The game has been unveiled after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/bioware-lays-off-50-staff-as-part-of-long-term-reorganization">layoffs at the studio</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and years of callenging—but seemingly not impossible—directional shifts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At Summer Game Fest 2024, we saw an extended demo of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s prologue, with commentary from creative director John Epler explaining BioWare's big focus on companion characters—a quiet return to the studio’s design roots.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="BioWare's high-fantasy comeback">BioWare's high-fantasy comeback</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Set after the events of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: Inquisition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the next game sees the world of Thedas facing a new threat posed by Solas, a former ally now turned villain. Seeking to destroy the barrier between the ethereal Veil and the mortal realm to restore his people, Solas unleashes otherworldly forces. A new hero, referred to as Rook, teams with returning heroes Varric and Harding to form a new party to face these threats – which inevitably unearth a greater foe that seeks to destroy all life in the world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Epler, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in particular, focuses on the themes of choice and consequence, and that a world at its bleakest is still worth saving. Like other games in the series, it features a fully customizable protagonist with different backstories and cultural backgrounds (human, dwarf, elf, and qunari), giving a more comprehensive range of options to make the protagonist feel like a natural part of the world that's been plucked out of obscurity to become a hero.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This follows in BioWare’s tradition of making Dragon Age protagonists more of a blank slate for the player—an ambitious challenge given how much game content has to evolve around the player’s long string of choices – which are reflected in the BioWare standard dialogue wheel.</span></p><p>Image via BioWare/EA.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The strong cast of supporting characters in a BioWare game has been a staple for the developer. Epler stated that the developers were keen to lean into that with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which he says has the most developed companions and related storylines from any BioWare game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I've been on every Dragon Age game previously, and I think the biggest thing that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> brings to the larger series experience is an even heavier and more deliberate focus on the companions," said Epler. "We've been saying that it's the most deliberately crafted companion experience we've ever done – each character is integral for you to save the world, and they each bring something to the table. These characters are important, and each will have their mission to see and learn more about them."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="BioWare’s getting back to hand-crafted game content">BioWare’s getting back to hand-crafted game content</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The extended demo's dramatic and action-focused opening offered a clear view of what kind of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will be, which sticks with the familiar mainstays of an ensemble BioWare RPG. However, the upcoming game also has a more stylized aesthetic and snappier gameplay compared to the more gritty and tactical pace of the original game and its sequels. It's an action-focused RPG, with the combat itself having a similar flow and pace to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Witcher</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> games. However, Dragon Age's familiar tactical pause also makes a return, allowing players to carefully choose skills at your leisure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interestingly, while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has a sharper narrative focus on the companions, combat still sticks solely to the protagonist, a contrast from the game’s earlier entries, which afforded the player more cross-party control. However, the game empowers players by allowing them to send commands to allies, strategically coordinating with the protagonist. This feature, reminiscent of Mass Effect's tactical commands, reminds players that these are separate characters with their own agency.</span></p><p>Image via BioWare/EA.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During one critical moment in the prologue, Rook had to choose which party member to accompany them in a plan to thwart Solas' spell while leaving one party member behind to hold off incoming monsters. It’s a decision that will shape how each party member views Rook in the adventure ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Epler said that as with previous BioWare games, companions will also have a set of unique quests tied to their individual stories, which will branch out throughout the game. How you build your party and what choices players make will define the type of adventure Rook and his party will have, which Epler stated are all bespoke events outside of the critical path.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of the big things we wanted to do with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is to have the entire game feel like a crafted and authored experience," said Epler in a post-presentation follow-up. "While the game does have a lot of content that's not part of the critical path, and the various side-missions, all of that is hand-crafted by the team."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This again alludes to a return to form for BioWare, which experimented with fewer hand-crafted set pieces in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Anthem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mass Effect: Andromeda</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. If it’s successful here, it’s an unfortunate rebuke of the studio’s directional shifts for its previous two games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks more like a stylized grand adventure for the series that bolsters its cast of heroes, though we didn't quite get a look at how many of these choices will come into play when your party begins to explore Thedas during a chaotic period.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It has been interesting to see where BioWare is as a developer currently, and it's no secret that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has had trouble with development as various staff turnovers have extended dev time. That said, the upcoming game has intriguing flourishes and a tone that could be a nice pivot for the series.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With recent successes from other fantasy RPGs like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> showing that building up a great cast and seeing them evolve with one another has a lot of value to a role-playing game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks to be doing the smart thing by focusing on what BioWare has traditionally done best, and that's put its cast of characters in the spotlight.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was interesting to see a far more stylized adventure-like tone for</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Dragon Age, which began its life as a dour, proper noun-laden adventure.

<p data-characters="369" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the reveal of the upcoming summer update, Sakurajima, <em>Palworld </em>is once again in the spotlight. The reveal came at this year’s Summer Game Fest, and<em> Palworld’s </em>community manager, Bucky, detailed his experience at the event on Twitter. While mostly positive, Bucky noted a few encounters painted <em>Palworld </em>as “the boogeyman” for some people. </p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">In his post, Bucky opened with his better experiences at the show, then acknowledged the team is “more than aware of all the Palworld discourse” since its launch earlier this year. According to Bucky, claims that<em> Palworld</em> was made with AI, stolen assets, and is the target of a lawsuit are all false. </p> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">Bucky has always been pretty outspoken when it comes to negativity aimed at <em>Palworld</em>. Back in February, he again posted on <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1757796446739558795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> to touch on the ‘dying’ game discourse, saying that it’s ‘<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworlds-community-manager-says-its-fine-to-take-breaks-amid-negative-player-count-discourse/">okay to take breaks</a>’. This time, he’s aired his feelings over what he says were a minority of Summer Game Fest encounters. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Summer Game Fest comes to a close and the long flight back to Tokyo begins…lots to process but overall it was an incredible weekend. Long post incoming:</p><p>1: Meeting other devs and industry folk was so much fun. Whereas GDC was very much about the business of games, SGF felt more…</p></div>— Bucky | Palworld ✈️ Summer Game Fest (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1800269900545478921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">For most of the post, Bucky has nothing but nice things to say about his experience at the convention, from meeting other devs and fans to meeting some of his own personal heroes. He seems to have had a good time, explaining that it was “great to share stories and advice with others in the industry”’ as they sometimes feel ‘”a bit isolated in Japan.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Pocketpair</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="608" data-injectable="false">Bucky goes on to promise that <em>Palworld </em>will continue to get bigger and bigger, and the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-adds-a-new-island-pals-and-more-in-just-a-few-weeks/">Sakurajima update</a> that’s coming on June 27 is part of that plan. The update will add new Pals, Raids, and Bosses to challenge. We’ll see that accompanied by new areas to explore and expanded building options, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24176237/archon-studios-prismacast-polish-space-magic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="FRhJKf">There’s a new brand of pre-painted tabletop gaming terrain on the market, and no one that I’ve talked to seems to know how it’s being made. Best I can figure, it’s Polish space magic.</p>
<p id="BQXK7i">In February this year Archon Studio (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/25/21147787/wolfenstein-board-game-announcement-miniatures"><em>Wolfenstein The Board Game</em></a>, <em>Masters of the Universe: Battleground</em>) announced <a href="https://archon-studio.com/blog/prismacast-a-revelation-in-rpg-terrain-market">PrismaCast</a>, its new line of pre-painted tabletop terrain. But the pitch — that these bits would come out of the box, on a plastic sprue, but with “detail typically reserved for the industry’s elite painters” — simply sounded too good to be true. Now that I’m holding the first of its retail releases, fresh out of a box from its Polish factory, I’m fairly shook. These <a href="https://archon-studio.com/dungeonsandlasers?product=1">Dwarven Mine pre-painted half-height walls</a> look great, with multiple shades to build up a highlight and a nice, evenly-applied wash to bring out those little details. There’s even an attempt at object source lighting, with lanterns and torches casting colorful shades and shadows along the walls.</p>

<p id="MIDYnm">Simply put, Archon’s terrain looks excellent — not quite as good as I could do <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23643118/how-to-paint-miniatures">here myself at home</a>, but far better than anything I’ve ever seen come fresh out of the box. And I have absolutely no idea how they’ve done it, nor how they managed to make it so inexpensive. The set here costs $89.99 and covers a fair amount of the table. For a proper layout, you’ll probably want at least a couple of them.</p>

<p>Note the marks along the top of the wall where the pieces were cut from the sprues. The plastic color matches the paint color, in an effort to hide those marks during assembly.</p>

<p id="seHp5r">So while we don’t know what kind of equipment they’re using, Archon has provided the broad strokes. According to its initial press release, the terrain is first hand-painted by a professional artist. This box lists Kuba Sawicki as its painter on the Dwarven Mines, and they are even credited on the back of the box. Sawicki’s work was then turned into a digital model using <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/25/5547708/how-the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-devs-are-using-photography-to-mimic">photogrammetry</a>, a technique that’s been in circulation in the world of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/17/11251930/star-wars-battlefront-gdc-photogrammetry-at-at-foot">video gaming</a> for at least a decade now. But then... somehow... they then put it on to the highly irregular surface of the miniature.</p>
<p id="QMh5KD">How remains a mystery. But I tell you what: The finish is strong as hell. Scratching it with a metal drill bit, even with a decent pressure, does next to nothing to it. If you want to repaint or otherwise improve on it, Grochowski says not to bother stripping it. Instead, he says to just paint right over the top.</p>
<p id="xHm3gI">In addition to these Dwarven Mines, Archon also has another set coming out shortly. Designed in partnership with Paizo, the <a href="https://archon-studio.com/shop/products/dungeons-lasers/pathfinder-terrain-abomination-vaults-pre-painted">Pathfinder Terrain: Abomination Vaults Pre-Painted</a>, with all its mindflaying horrors, will begin shipping soon.</p>

Unfortunately, this specific recreation of the level doesn’t really show objectives, so it’s easy to get a little lost. If you’re new to this mission, or don’t remember it too well, here’s the sequence of events. </p><p>In Nikos4476’s recreation of “The Silent Cartographer,” you’ll spawn in a dark room in front of a teleporter at the beginning of the game and after each time you die. You’ll need to step into the teleporter to return to the game. Once you do, you’ll find yourself on a beach with marines and Banished (or, Covenant, as they were known back in 2001) exchanging fire.</p><p>You’ll start the mission by fighting along the beach, pushing forward to the first Forerunner structure you’ll see jutting out of the island’s cliffside. At the end of this battle, you’ll see a Warthog spawn.</p><p>Drive the Warthog (or travel on foot), counterclockwise around the island, moving across the beach until you come to the next Forerunner building, which we’ll refer to as building A.

<p>Star Wars Outlaws was one of the more exciting gameplay trailers we saw during Summer Game Fest, specifically kicking off Ubisoft Forward. It looks like a mixture of Red Dead Redemption 2 and Star Wars, and I’m all here for it! But I have a question, as do many of you. How many planets are in Star Wars Outlaws?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-planets-can-we-explore-in-star-wars-outlaws">How Many Planets Can We Explore in Star Wars Outlaws?</h2>



<p>In all, Star Wars Outlaws features five planets for us to venture to and explore, with quests on each one to flesh out the main and side stories. The available planets include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Akiva</strong>: Akiva is a jungle planet home to numerous droid factories and industrial complexes. Its large city welcomes outlaws.</li>



<li><strong>Cantonica</strong>: A hub world full of wealthy criminals, where gambling is the go-to vice daily for many. There’s even a luxury resort, should you care to sneak in and lift a few items.</li>



<li><strong>Kijimi</strong>: A frozen-over world, which we first saw in The Rise of the Skywalker, that fell to bandit attacks and became a haven for criminals.</li>



<li><strong>Tatooine</strong>: An iconic Star Wars planet from the films—a seemingly endless desert expanse home to criminal organizations, such as the Hutts, but full of opportunity for an outlaw.</li>



<li><strong>Toshara Moon</strong>: The Moon of Toshara, while not technically a planet, is a brand-new location explicitly built for the game. It features settlements, a sprawling city, and plenty of open land to race your speeder bike.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-does-star-wars-outlaws-feature-space-flight">Does Star Wars Outlaws Feature Space Flight?</h2>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws does feature space flight to some extent, though many liken it to Starfield’s mechanics. It appears you can fly around the immediate orbit of a planet or moon, but if you want to travel between two planets, you must use a hyperdrive to immediately zip through space.</p>



<p>If this is disappointing to you, consider the fact that Star Wars Outlaws isn’t a space simulator. It’s an on-the-ground story about an outlaw and her pals, and space flight is simply a means to an end for the group.</p>



<p>That said, here’s hoping it’s a little more fleshed-out and fun!</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/carcassonne-board-game-buying-guide</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/carcassonne-board-game-buying-guide.898608/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/carcassonne-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Carcassonne is a modern classic that stands up against any of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time"><u>best board games</u></a> today. Like Ticket to Ride or Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne has widely become known as one of the gateway board games thanks in part to an approachable ruleset that gives players an introduction to popular mechanics while still offering enough strategy for serious hobbyists. </p><p>Also like other gateway games, Carcassonne features dozens of expansions and spin-offs that allow new players to grow alongside the series. Unfortunately, a wealth of options can sometimes be a double-edged sword for newer tabletop gamers as it often leads to analysis paralysis. That’s why we have compiled this easy-to-follow guide to the entire series. Naturally, the best place to start is with the base game, as all expansions require it to play.</p><h2>The Base Game</h2><h3>Carcassonne</h3><div id="201749"><p><h3>Carcassonne</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $39.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 7+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 30-45 mins</li></ul><p>Carcassonne is a relatively straightforward tile-placement game. Players take turns drawing tiles to help build out the ever-expanding map. During a player’s turn, they can also choose to place a meeple on the board to claim landmarks such as roads or cities. Claiming landmarks scores points and the player with the most points after the map is completed is the winner. Of course, things are never that simple as other players will also want to claim valuable landmarks and potentially keep you from scoring as well.</p><p>Placing tiles soon becomes a strategic operation where players want to expand the map in a way that benefits themselves but not others. Sometimes, however, it cannot be helped. The luck of the draw may not give you the tile you so desperately need, meaning you’ll be forced to weigh your options and make the best of a bad situation. </p><p>As two rounds of Carcassonne never quite play out the same way, the base game offers plenty of replayability. In fact, the base game is likely all newer players will need for quite a while. Still, it’s nice to have some variability for games like Carcassonne that tend to get to the table quite often. Many of the various expansions add features and mechanics that relate to scoring, giving players even more strategic options. It should also be noted that the latest version of Carcassonne includes both the fan-favorite River and Abbot expansions. All river tiles must be played first and the abbot is a special meeple that can be picked up and scored before landmarks are completed.</p><h2>Expansions</h2><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 1: Inns &amp; Cathedrals</h3><div id="201750"><p><h3>Carcassonne Inns &amp; Cathedrals Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Pink Meeples for Sixth Player</li><li>18 New Land Tiles Featuring Inns and Cathedrals</li><li>Six Large Meeples</li><li>Double-sided Scoring Tiles</li></ul><p>Before diving into the inns and cathedrals aspects of the expansion, this add-on is noteworthy in that it includes components for a sixth player. These components are designed to be inserted directly into the original box, giving players even more options for crowded game nights. If you want to see our recommendations for even more titles that play well with large groups, check out our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-6-player-board-games"><u>best six-player board games</u></a>.</p><p>The titular inns and cathedrals are new landmarks that allow for additional scoring when completing roads or cities. These tiles simply shuffle into the original box and are otherwise placed normally. When scoring, cities with cathedrals and roads with inns net more points than those without. Lastly, Inns &amp; Cathedrals adds a big meeple that essentially counts as two regular-sized meeples, leading to even more scoring and serving as a tie-breaker for controlling landmarks.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 2: Traders &amp; Builders</h3><div id="201751"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Traders &amp; Builders Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>24 New Land Tiles</li><li>20 Goods Tokens</li><li>6 Builder Pieces and 6 Pig Pieces</li><li>1 Cloth Bag</li></ul><p>Traders &amp; Builders isn’t a game-changing expansion, but it does offer some new ways to score and place tiles. Arguably the biggest addition is the new tiles that feature symbols for goods such as cloth, wine, and wheat. Players collect goods when claiming landmarks with these icons, and bonus points are awarded to those with the most of a certain resource at the end of the game.</p><p>Additionally, Traders &amp; Builders introduces two new pieces – the builder and the pig. Essentially, builders allow players to place a second tile during their turn if placed on a landmark that already contains a meeple, and pigs score additional points for meeples claiming fields.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 3: The Princess &amp; The Dragon</h3><div id="201752"><p><h3>Carcassonne: The Princess &amp; The Dragon Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>30 New Land Tiles</li><li>1 Dragon Token</li><li>1 Fairy Token</li></ul><p>The Princess &amp; The Dragon introduces the biggest tweak to gameplay thus far, meeple removal. Volcano tiles summon the dragon token that takes out those who get in its way. Additionally, the princess tile can be played to remove knights from cities. The only protection against these tactics is the fairy token. The other new addition is the magic portal tile which allows players to place meeples on previously laid tiles.</p><p>Rather than incorporating new ways to score, The Princess &amp; The Dragon adds new competitive tactics to Carcassonne. It’s still not a fundamentally new game, but it offers one of the bigger deviations from the original title.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 4: The Tower</h3><div id="201753"><p><h3>Carcassonne: The Tower Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $19.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>18 New Land Tiles</li><li>30 Tower Floors</li><li>1 Tile Tower</li></ul><p>The Tower is one of the more divisive expansions as it focuses more on building up rather than expanding outward. Towers essentially act as area control landmarks, but even more than that, these structures can capture opposing meeples on adjacent tiles. The higher the tower goes, the further its reach. Captured meeples can be returned to their original player, but only for the ransom price of three victory points.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 5: Abbey &amp; Mayor</h3><div id="201754"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Abbey &amp; Mayo Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12 New Land Tiles</li><li>6 Abbey Tiles</li><li>Barn, Mayor, and Wagon Pieces for Each Player</li></ul><p>The Abbey &amp; Mayor expansion takes a break from removing meeples and instead gets back to offering players even more ways to score points. The new abbey tiles act as a sort of wild card piece designed to plug holes that might otherwise be difficult to complete. Mayors, on the other hand, serve as tie-breaker pieces for city control when two or more players are vying for the same town. Barns are placed in fields to score points from completed cities and wagons can move to adjacent landmarks after existing ones are completed.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 6: Count, King &amp; Robber</h3><div id="201755"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Count, King &amp; Robber Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2 Large City Tiles</li><li>22 New Land Tiles</li><li>Count, King, and Robber Pieces</li><li>King and Robber Tiles</li></ul><p>Count, King &amp; Robber is yet another expansion that deviates considerably from the base game. Arguably the biggest change is the addition of the large city tiles that allow players to move meeples from the city to complete landmarks and vice versa. Players can even add meeples to the city after completing other players’ landmarks, promoting even more interaction and strategy. Additionally, the king and robber components reward players for developing the longest road and the biggest cities. Because of the added rules and components, Count, King &amp; Robber is not quite as easy to teach as other expansions, but it’s still simple enough to understand after a round or two.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 8: Bridges, Castles &amp; Bazaars</h3><div id="201756"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Bridges, Castles &amp; Bazaars Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12 New Land Tiles</li><li>12 Castle Tiles</li><li>12 Bridge Pieces</li></ul><p>Before we dive into Bridges, Castles &amp; Bazaars, some eagle-eyed mathematicians might have noticed that we skipped Expansion 7. That’s because the dexterity-based add-on is out of print. As we’ll discuss just a bit later, Carcassonne has released dozens of expansions over the years, and many of them have since been discontinued.</p><p>One of the more notable features of this expansion is the bazaar tiles that allow players to host an auction where they can spend earned points on desirable tiles. This is a bit of a hit-or-miss add-on that some fans find fun and others feel slows the game down too much. Additionally, the expansion allows players to build around dead ends using bridges. Castles, on the other hand, can be placed in cities to score even more points. </p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 9: Hills &amp; Sheep</h3><div id="201757"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Hills &amp; Sheep Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>18 New Land Tiles</li><li>18 Flock Tokens</li><li>6 Shephard Piece</li><li>1 Cloth Bag</li></ul><p>The Hills &amp; Sheep expansion adds a sort of test-your-luck mechanic thanks to the shepherd piece and flock tokens. Shepherds are placed in open fields and players then select tokens blindly from a bag. Sheep tokens score points while wolf tokens remove the shepherd piece from the board. Hills, on the other hand, are a new tie-breaking feature. Additionally, vineyards are added for even more scoring potential.</p><h3>Carcassonne Expansion 10: Under the Big Top</h3><div id="201758"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Under the Big Top Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $17.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>20 New Land Tiles</li><li>12 Circus Tiles</li><li>8 Acrobat Tiles</li><li>16 Animal Tokens</li><li>1 Big Top Token</li><li>6 Ringmaster Meeples</li></ul><p>Under the Big Top goes all in on its circus theme. Interestingly, however, the circus tiles are a bit of a gamble. When new circus tiles are played, the big top tile is moved from the previous one and replaced by an animal token with a number value. The number value is then attributed to surrounding meeples. Additionally, the ringmaster meeple scores additional points for every circus feature adjacent to it. Not to mention, meeples can stack on acrobat tiles to net even more points. Rather than other expansions that allow players more scoring options, Under the Big Top more or less changes the focus of Carcassonne altogether. This isn’t necessarily a good or bad thing; rather, it’s a change of pace that can make an old favorite feel like new.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Carcassonne Big Box (2022 Edition)</h3><div id="201759"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Big Box (2022 Edition)</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $89.99</p><p><strong>Components</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Carcassonne Base Game</li><li>Inns &amp; Cathedrals Expansion</li><li>Traders &amp; Builders Expansion</li><li>The Abbot, The River, The Flying Machines, The Ferries, The Messengers, The Gold Mines, Mage &amp; Witch, The Robbers, and The Crop Circles Expansions</li><li>More Than 150 Tiles</li><li>7 Different Types of Meeples</li></ul><p>Every so often, Carcassonne releases a new big box that contains the base game and several expansions. The most recent edition contains the base game, the Inns &amp; Cathedrals expansion, and the Traders &amp; Builders expansion, as well as the abbot, river, robbers, and several other pieces from previous expansions. The big box is a great place to start as it offers quite a bit of content all in one package. Many fans consider the first two expansions some of the best, so having both in one package is certainly a win for the Carcassonne Big Box.</p><h3>Carcassonne 20th Anniversary Edition</h3><div id="201760"><p><h3>Carcassonne 20th Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $49.99</p><p><strong>Components</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>87 Land Tiles</li><li>17 River Tiles</li><li>40 Meeples</li><li>5 Abbotts</li><li>1 Scoreboard</li><li>Character Stickers</li></ul><p>Carcassonne also offers a 20th-anniversary edition that is mostly the same as the base game but adds some upgraded visuals and meeple stickers. Additionally, the anniversary edition also includes exclusive tiles that add even more variability and scoring opportunities.</p><h3>Carcassonne: Amazonas</h3><div id="201761"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Amazonas</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $34.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 35 mins</li></ul><p>Carcassonne: Amazonas is a standalone title incompatible with the original game and its expansions. Amazonas plays similarly to standard Carcassonne, but it introduces boats that venture down the river. However, in a given turn, players must decide if they want to play meeples or advance their boat. Both actions score points, giving players various potential paths to victory.</p><h3>Carcassonne: Gold Rush</h3><div id="201762"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Gold Rush</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $34.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 35 mins</li></ul><p>Like Amazonas, Carcassonne: Gold Rush is a standalone title incompatible with the original game and its expansions. This time, however, the franchise takes a trip to the Old West. Outside of aesthetics, the major difference between Gold Rush and standard Carcassonne is the mining mechanic. Claiming mountains more or less works like any other landmark in Carcassonne, except they return mining tokens. These tokens can award up to five points (or pieces of gold) or as little as zero points. Essentially, it's like mining gold – sometimes you get lucky, and sometimes you don’t. </p><h3>Carcassonne: Hunters &amp; Gatherers</h3><div id="201763"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Hunters &amp; Gatherers</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $39.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 35 mins</li></ul><p>Carcassonne: Hunters &amp; Gatherers is a prehistoric-themed version of Carcassonne. It mostly plays the same as standard Carcassonne, however, players can score additional points for animals located within their landmarks. Additionally, finishing forests (Hunters &amp; Gatherers’ version of cities) awards players special valuable tiles. This occurs even when finishing another player’s forest, promoting even more player interaction. Like other standalone titles, Carcassonne: Hunters &amp; Gatherers is incompatible with the original game or any of its expansions.</p><h3>Carcassonne: Safari</h3><div id="201764"><p><h3>Carcassonne: Safari</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $39.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 7+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 35 mins</li></ul><p>Carcassonne: Safari is yet another standalone version of Carcassonne incompatible with other entries in the series – this time, with an African safari theme. The rules largely remain the same, however, additional points are scored for different animals present on landmarks. Additionally, the newly added safari truck game piece also serves as a new mechanic. These pieces are placed in yet-to-be-played tile areas and can be picked up and moved for additional points when the map eventually expands to that part of the grid. Strategic placement can even lead to blocking other players, or at least, encouraging them to help you. </p><h3>Mists over Carcassonne</h3><div id="201765"><p><h3>Mists Over Carcassonne</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $39.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Players: 2-5</li><li>Play Time: 35 mins</li></ul><p>Mists over Carcassonne is the first cooperative iteration of the series. This version plays similarly to standard Carcassonne, however, players score points together to try and reach the threshold for victory. While that sounds simple enough, players also need to worry about managing the number of ghosts on the board present by finishing up the new mist landmarks. Allowing too many ghosts to run rampant on the board or failing to achieve a certain amount of points in a given period means that players lose. Also, for fans of the traditional Carcassonne experience, there is an additional set of rules to play Mists as a competitive experience.</p><h3>My First Carcassonne</h3><div id="161851"><p><h3>My First Carcassonne</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $34.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 4+</li><li>Players: 2-4</li><li>Play Time: 10-20 mins</li></ul><p>As the name would suggest, My First Carcassonne is a simplified version of Carcassonne that targets a younger demographic. Due to its streamlined ruleset and more colorful artwork, we identified My First Carcassonne as one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds"><u>best board games for five-year-olds</u></a>. This title leads younger gamers nicely into standard Carcassonne, which is easily one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games"><u>best family board games</u></a> available and suited best for ages eight and up.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Carcassonne: Digital Version</h3><p>Like many other popular titles, Carcassonne has also made the leap to digital on several platforms. It is available as Carcassonne on the Nintendo Switch <a href="https://zdcs.link/mV2gN" target="_blank">eShop</a> for $19.99 MSRP. Additionally, it can be found as Carcassonne - Tiles &amp; Tactics on PC and mobile for $9.99 MSRP. Expansions such as Inns &amp; Cathedrals and Builders &amp; Traders can be purchased as DLC. Carcassonne can also be played online at <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board Game Arena</a> with a Premium subscription.

Entries like this, the Old Testament-themed Ark of the Covenant spin-off, and the missing Catapult expansion referenced earlier are generally only available on the secondhand market. While current publisher Z-Man Games has reprinted many iterations, some are simply lost to time, potentially destined to become collector’s items.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>Carcassonne is a versatile game that can be enjoyed simply as its base experience or be iterated upon through its various expansions. Luckily, many of the games listed above can be found for well under MSRP at retailers like Amazon, Target, and Walmart.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shop-titans-celebrates-its-fifth-anniversary-with-a-myriad-of-new-content<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The free-to-play tycoon simulator/adventure RPG Shop Titans is celebrating its fifth anniversary with gifts to players. The game just launched a big new update that's available now — players can earn several rewards by logging in during the anniversary event, and there will be giveaways and sales too.</p><p>Since its launch in 2019, Shop Titans has attracted players with its cozy, relaxing gameplay, charming aesthetic, and endless options for creating and customizing their perfect shop. Available on both PC and mobile devices, the game lets you step into the life of a new shopkeeper. Set in a fantasy world filled with character-driven banter between its Champions and city Workers, you can become a fantasy shop tycoon by crafting epic weapons, managing a store to success, building a team of adventurers to quest for loot, and selling items for huge profits.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/31/5-year-key-art-1717180495800.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Customers will consistently come by your shop, but won’t know what you have to offer if it's not on display. So you need to create weapon racks, armor mannequins, and the like to show off your crafted gear. Customers will buy items off the rack, giving you money that you can use to improve your shop. You can expand your space, add decorations, or hire more craftspeople to give you access to new types of items.</p><p>As you craft more of each item, you’ll unlock blueprints for higher level items that will make you more money. Some of them will require materials you don’t have on hand, so you’ll need to hire Heroes to go out and gather the materials for you. That’s where the RPG elements come in. After you hire Heroes, you’ll equip them before sending them on quests to gather the materials you need. Once their quest is over, they’ll return with the materials you requested in addition to treasure chests with even more loot.</p><p>All of these different systems also have their own levels. As you craft items to sell, the craftspeople will level up. As you sell items, your merchant level will grow. As you send heroes out into the field, their levels will increase. They’ll learn new skills and be able to tackle more difficult quests, spurring constant growth.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/05/shop-frame-1717568364632.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The new Fifth Anniversary update extends that growth even more, adding several new blueprints, merchant level loops, shop expansion options, and more. Players can look forward to the update's biggest addition — a new type of very rare blueprint called artifacts that come in three minor or major levels.</p><p>The six new artifacts are each a different type of equipment — there’s a katana, suit of armor, amulet, cowl, spellbook, and pickaxe. They are difficult to acquire and craft, but they're much stronger than other blueprints of the same tier and give special bonuses that can’t be achieved any other way.</p><p>Those bonuses can make certain artifacts especially useful to specific classes. For instance, the new artifact katana gives a 200% boost to critical damage but limits critical chance to 20%. However, the Samurai automatically gets a critical hit in the first round. So that attack gets the benefit of the damage boost without the drawback of lower chance. Similarly, the amulet gives a boost to evasion and skill HP bonus, but it seals that character’s weapon and makes it useless. Well, that drawback doesn’t affect fist fighters.</p><p>The artifacts aren’t the only new addition. There are now looping merchant levels that allow you to progress past level 100. Once you pass level 100, you’ll get a new level banner and loop back to level 1. You can level up to 100 again, and you can do this up to five times for a total level of 500. You’ll still get gems every time you level up, and each time you enter a new loop, you’ll get added bonuses with every level of that loop.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/31/backyard-example-1717180371697.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Then there are new options for shop customization. You’ve always been able to expand your shop with new sections in a 3x3 grid, but now you can transform any of those sections into yard space. That means you can place outdoor decorations in those spaces, giving you lots of new ways to get creative with the look and layout of your shop.</p><p>There’s still more coming, too. There will be a daily giveaway exclusively on the Webstore starting June 14, where players can claim a free item every day. The giveaway item changes every 24 hours, so if you want to get everything, make sure to log in each day. There will also be a big sale from June 14–17, where players can get all kinds of discounts, as well as a new item called the Seed of Merit, which can increase a Hero or Champion’s level past the level cap, available exclusively during the anniversary sale.</p><p>In addition, players can expect an in-game anniversary login calendar that will give free rewards, and two additional new artifacts will be revealed during the anniversary event as well. In short, now’s the time to jump into Shop Titans and take advantage of all these exciting opportunities. Players rave about the game on Steam, IOS, Google Play, Epic Games Store, and the Microsoft Store, so download the game for free and start your shopkeeping journey.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the video, we see a more grown-up, Max Caulfield, as a photographer for Caledon University.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Life is Strange: Double Exposure – Announce Trailer (ESRB)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TOYz4NCFIXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">Compared to the original <em>Life is Strange</em>, <em>Double Exposure</em> ups the ante in terms of graphics.

However, the <a href="https://deckninegames.com/introducing-life-is-strange-double-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deck Nine Games</a> site states that it is a “standalone experience.” That means you don’t need any knowledge of the original, and they may offer a potential recap of the events that transpired before.</p>
 <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">Even though it’s a standalone game, it’ll likely feature plenty of callbacks to <em>Life is Strange</em>. We already got some hints of this in the trailer when Max mentions that she made a promise never to use her powers again. This, of course, refers back to the original when she harnessed her ability to time shift.</p> <h2 id="h-is-chloe-in-life-is-strange-double-exposure" data-injectable="false">Is Chloe in Life is Strange: Double Exposure?</h2> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">Many <em>LiS </em>fans have wondered about Chloe Price’s whereabouts, as she is not mentioned in the trailer. As of right now, it isn’t clear if Chloe will reappear in <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>. We can hope that she will make her return to the game or get some clarification about her current standings.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Dontnod Entertainment/Deck Nine Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="false">While we don’t know about Chloe’s fate in <em>Double Exposure</em>, she was at least mentioned in <em>LiS 2</em> and <em>True Colors’ Wavelengths</em>. The same thing could be done for her again in this new entry, but we’ll need to wait and see.</p>

Sumo Group, the parent company of Sackboy: A Big Adventure and Texas Chain Saw Massacre developer Sumo Digital, has announced plans to reduce its workforce by up to 15 percent, putting nearly 270 employees across the UK, Canada, Poland, Czech Republic, and India at risk.
</p>
<p>
"Whilst Sumo has been able to manage through many of the recent difficulties the games industry has faced," the company <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2024/sumo-group-update/">wrote</a>, "we have not been immune and reshaping operations across the business to better navigate the upcoming challenges expected in the coming months is a path we must now take to ensure the security of the business going forward."
</p>
<p>
To that end, Sumo has made "the difficult decision to reduce our costs across the business in a number of ways", which "unfortunately will include a reduction in the number of people the business can support". While Sumo says it has considered "every alternate route to limit the impact to our people", it confirms up to 15 percent of employees in the UK, Canada, Poland, Czech Republic, and India (from a workforce of 1,790 according to <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/">its website</a>) will be affected.

While <em>Dragon Age II</em> and <em>Inquisition</em> tried to blend the tactical combat of <em>Origins </em>with real-time action, <em>The Veilguard </em>forgoes any notion of doing that in favor of something that resembles a character action game like <em>God of War</em>. It looks <em>really</em> solid as an action game, at least. But your mileage may vary on if that’s what you’re looking for out of a new <em>Dragon Age </em>game.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-recommend-id="image://4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Veilguard ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Veilguard ability wheel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-recommend-id="image://4e9a953cd47712efe00de19abae8ece7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Veilguard ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While there’s a focus on real-time action this time around, you will still have abilities to use, cooldowns to manage, and a way to pause the action as you sort through which of those you want to use. <em>The Veilguard </em>will have its own equivalent of the <em>Mass Effect </em>combat wheel that lets you stop the fight, pick an ability, aim it at the baddie of your choice, and fire it off. The wheel we saw in the gameplay trailer had nine ability slots, but it appears that you’ll be able to tab over to another wheel similar to previous games.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-recommend-id="image://e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Davrin, and Bellara prepare for a fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook, Davrin, and Bellara prepare for a fight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-recommend-id="image://e5d63ba57d5de2da2aa71ced33a1560b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Davrin, and Bellara prepare for a fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first three <em>Dragon Age </em>games let you have three party members with you at all times.

In keeping with the aforementioned <em>Mass Effect</em>-ification of things, <em>The Veilguard </em>will only let you have two companions by your side at once. This will naturally affect party composition and strategies, but if <em>The Veilguard </em>keeps the series’ beloved party banter, it will change how those conversations play out as it will often be between only two characters.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-recommend-id="image://db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor serving cunt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor serving cunt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-recommend-id="image://db6ca0ffc6d660dc0f9a2d0072d725bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor serving cunt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Given <em>The Veilguard</em>’s focus on Solas, the party-member-turned-antagonist from <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, it’s not a surprise that The Inquisitor, the protagonist from the 2014 RPG, will be returning. Players will be able to customize the appearance of The Inquisitor similar to how they did <em>Dragon Age II </em>protagonist Hawke in the last game. We don’t know yet what their role will be, but it’s at least good to know they’ll be around for the conclusion of the story they started ten years ago, even though I would argue they should have been the protagonist of <em>The Veilguard</em>, but I digress.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-recommend-id="image://31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Emmrich, and Harding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook, Emmrich, and Harding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-recommend-id="image://31265d47d1ba760edecd80ca9a214387" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook, Emmrich, and Harding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While BioWare has yet to publicly show <em>The Veilguard</em>’s character creator, <em>Kotaku</em> saw a glimpse of it at Summer Game Fest, and it has some real depth to it. You can play as four races: Human, Dwarf, Elf, and Qunari, and it will have sliders to change your body type. BioWare confirmed that even if you make your Rook a short king, the team has done work to ensure animations fit any character build. You’ll also be able to pick Rook’s pronouns, as well as their origin based on what faction they come from. This includes the Shadow Dragons, Grey Wardens, Antivan Crows, Lords of Fortune, Mourn Watch, and the Veil Jumpers. Each of these orders has a distinct place in <em>Dragon Age </em>lore and whichever one you pick will affect how some characters interact with you and open up new dialogue options. Like <em>Inquisition</em>, <em>The Veilguard </em>will have four voice options, two with British accents and two with American ones.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-recommend-id="image://5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Dragon Age Keep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Dragon Age Keep." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-recommend-id="image://5dded3fd995f8611f98622f74d0347de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Dragon Age Keep." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>BioWare has become synonymous with importing choices from old games into new ones, but it’s been ten years since the last <em>Dragon Age</em>.

This dialogue system was interesting in the 2011 RPG because it would shape Hawke’s personality, even in scenes where you weren’t directly picking a dialogue option.

<p>With the ongoing Steam Next Fest, which allows players a chance to download and check out various demos for upcoming games, folks find themselves drawn to Once Human. It was the first demo downloaded, and I’m finding it absolutely fantastic. But there’s a question in the air. Is Once Human Early Access?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-once-human-early-access-or-full-release">Is Once Human Early Access or Full Release?</h2>



<p>When Once Human officially releases on <strong>July 9</strong>, it will do so as a full-release title. Unlike most other survival-crafting games on the market today, the upcoming open-world survival shooter will not launch into Early Access. </p>



<p>It’s a fresh take and one we’re wholly open to. The current gameplay is satisfying, the creature designs are phenomenal, and, with a little more polish, it’ll prove itself as a long-term survival game for fans of the genre!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-survive-in-once-human">How to Survive in Once Human</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Starry Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>When you first dive into Once Human, either in the beta during Steam Next Fest or upon launch in early July, you’ll find the prologue rather welcoming. It does a fantastic job of smoothly introducing you to the gameplay mechanics, loot, and overall story beats. But then you’re thrust into the open world alongside a magical crow and told to survive. Here are a few tips:</p>



<ul>
<li>While you won’t die of hunger or thirst immediately upon touching down, it’s a wise move to keep food and water in your inventory for when times get tough. After all, this is a survival game. You require both to operate at peak efficiency.</li>



<li>While playing on a PvE server, don’t be afraid to make a friend or two. You can group up to tackle challenging points of interest, share loot, or even build a small community together in the open world. Even better is you can ask for help!</li>



<li>Your starting crossbow is excellent at dealing with shambling zombies and Watchers, but you’ll require smoothing with more oomph before long. Do your best to seek out a better weapon, ideally a firearm, quickly!</li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>Alongside Once Human, there’s a handful of quality <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-next-fest-june-2024-10-games-you-need-to-check-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demos we recommend from Steam Next Fest</a>!

<p data-characters="282" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve gotten lucky and pulled <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sethos-builds-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sethos</a> in <em>Genshin Impact</em>, you might be wondering how he fits into your team. As an on-field Electro DPS character, Sethos’ kit is balanced around the Quicken and Aggravate reactions. Here are Sethos’ best Quicken teams to maximize his damage!</p> <h2 id="h-sethos-in-quicken-teams" data-injectable="false">Sethos in Quicken teams</h2> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">First, a brief <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/genshin-impact-dendro-reactions-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overview</a> of Quicken and Aggravate reactions. When Electro and Dendro combine in any order, an enemy receives the Quicken status. This looks like a green lightning effect around the enemy. Hitting an enemy in this state with Electro attacks triggers Aggravate, which increases the attack’s damage.</p> <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">Since Sethos relies on Quicken and Aggravate reactions, his best teams will feature Dendro teammates. You can supplement additional Electro or Anemo units, too, for additional damage and buffs.</p>
 <h2 id="h-best-dendro-teammates-for-sethos" data-injectable="false">Best Dendro teammates for Sethos</h2> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Sethos should be paired with <strong>at least one Dendro teammate</strong> in order to maintain the Quicken status on enemies. Off-field Dendro application is particularly important, since Sethos will want to stay on-field <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-sethos-in-genshin-impact-normal-vs-charged-attack-playstyles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">using either Normal or Charged Attacks</a>. The best Dendro teammates for Sethos are:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Nahida</strong> – Provides high off-field Dendro application and damage.</li> <li><strong>Dendro Traveler</strong> – Provides good off-field Dendro application, but less damage than Nahida.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-baizhu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baizhu</a></strong> – Has less Dendro application, but still good enough, and provides healing.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yaoyao-healer-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yaoyao</a></strong> – Budget Baizhu.</li> </ul>

Try a second Electro character who can deal off-field damage. Some examples include:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fischl-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fischl</a></strong> – Provides energy and significant off-field Electro damage.</li> <li><strong>Yae Miko</strong> – Deals off-field Electro damage.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">You can also add an Anemo teammate holding the 4pc Viridescent Venerer artifact set. This set reduces enemies’ Electro RES, causing Sethos to deal more damage. Any Anemo unit can work here, but the best Anemo teammates for Sethos are:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Sucrose</strong> – Grants Elemental Mastery buffs.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kazuha-builds-in-genshin-impact-updated-4-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuha</a></strong> – Increases your team’s Electro DMG.</li> <li><strong>Jean, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xianyun-support-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xianyun</a>, or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sayu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sayu</a></strong> – Provide healing.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">Certain Geo characters also work well with Sethos. There is an opportunity cost to using some of them, though, since Geo characters often do best in full Geo teams, not Quicken teams. Nevertheless, these Geo units can have a place in Sethos’ teams.</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-zhongli-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhongli</a></strong> – Provides a shield and reduces enemy RES to all elements.</li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-albedo-build-in-genshin-impact-updated-4-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Albedo</a> or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-chiori-builds-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chiori</a></strong> – Deal off-field Geo damage at intervals.</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/rebel-moons-directors-cut-is-coming-with-a-new-title/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rebel-moons-directors-cut-is-coming-with-a-new-title<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="119" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Rebel Moon </em>director’s cut is coming to Netflix on August 2, and when it gets here, it will have a new name.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">Actually, it’ll have two new names. Zack Snyder took to social media today to unveil the release date for his extended double-feature as well as the fresh titles for each chapter of “Rebel Moon.”&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="505" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true"><em>Chalice of Blood </em>and <em>Curse of Forgiveness </em>are inevitably going to tell the same story as the PG-13 <em>Rebel Moon </em>movies, but fans are still going to have plenty of new things to see. Snyder told Variety that the new movies feature over an hour of extra content, and some of the new scenes were specifically held back until now. “We shot scenes just for the director’s cut,” Snyder said, adding, “So in that way, it’s really a revelation because it gives that second kick at the can for big fans.”</p>
 <p data-characters="757" data-current-count="757" data-injectable="false">The extra runtime will presumably flesh out the multiple worlds and characters that make up the core of <em>Rebel Moon</em>. The original <em>Child of Fire</em> had to introduce so many characters and concepts that the experience felt rushed, but that almost certainly won’t be the case with the new R-rated version. We’ll see how many people tune back in for these new versions. Both <em>Rebel Moon </em>movies were critical flops, and there might not be many people willing to sit back down for a longer version of the original experience, even if it does depict – as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-snyder-cut-is-on-the-way-later-this-year/1100-6524155/">official description states</a> – “the viciously sexier, bloodier world of <em>Rebel Moon</em>.” If it does well enough, maybe Snyder will get to make the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/latest-sci-fi-news-spielbergs-ufo-movie-for-all-mankind-renewed-and-rebel-moon-part-3/"><em>Rebel Moon 3</em> he’s apparently already plotted out</a>. </p>

            <p>I try to avoid describing video games in mathematical terms, but I can hardly avoid it here. Treasure Planet's flying galleons plus Spirited Away's bath house plus Spiritfarer's gentle building and management mechanics equals Hotel Galactic. Watch the trailer below and tell me I'm wrong.

<p>I'm not being reductive, right? Although it's not like Spiritfarer wasn't already channeling Ghibli.
</p>
<p>You build your hotel and design each room to cater to different kinds of guests, manage your staff by assigning actions and priorities, and seemingly form friendships with alien companions with special abilities and traits they can pass on to new joiners. 
</p>
<p>There's an implied villain at the end of the trailer above, although there's no real mention of potential conflict on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183670/Hotel_Galactic/">Hotel Galactic Steam page</a>. The closest it gets is a reference to a "spooky underground complex", in which you can discover "new materials, creatures and expand the construction space." Otherwise it's pitched as cosy from top to bottom.
</p>
<p>Hotel Galactic has no release date yet, but I'm intrigued. It'll apparently have a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/528325741/hotel-galactic-studio-ghibli-inspired-25d-inn-management">Kickstarter in July</a>, although whether that's to fund its existence, or polish, or something else, I don't know. In the meantime, let me do what YouTube did to me after I watched the trailer, and recommend Jenny Nicholson's latest video <a href="https://youtu.be/T0CpOYZZZW4?si=pG-I1fkZLA0NpIRF">on a different kind of galactic hotel</a>. I've watched all four hours of it twice.</p>

It was an exciting time for sure, but also a very busy time for the game industry. </p><p>With all these new trailers, teasers, announcements, and reveals, it’s likely you missed some of the coolest and biggest trailers from the last few days. If that’s the case, don’t worry, as we have cataloged the 16 best trailers from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472">SGF 2024's wild weekend</a></span>. Here you go!</p></div></div><div><p>The Doom Slayer is back and this time he’s got a big shield, a gun that shoots skull fragments, and a cybernetic super dragon. In other words: <em>Dark Ages</em> looks awesome! We can’t wait to kill demons in <em>Dark Ages</em> when it arrives on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Lego and<em> Horizon: Forbidden West</em> make for a strange combo for sure. However, the announcement trailer for <em>Lego Horizon: Adventures</em> looked wonderful and fun. But perhaps the biggest surprise is that this odd spin-off is launching later this year on PS5, PC,<em> and Nintendo Switch. </em>Now that’s strange!</p></div><div><p>We are always down for a new retro-themed beat ‘em up with couch co-op options. Watching the trailer for<em> Rita’s Rewind </em>made us remember how great <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge </em>from 2022 was, and this new <em>Power Rangers</em> brawler looks to be a lot like that game. That’s a good thing! <em>Rita’s Rewind</em> is set to arrive in late 2024.</p></div><div><p>What happens if you toss <em>John Wick</em>-like combat, <em>GTA V</em> gameplay, and uh...a walking bean into a blender? You get a weird but cool-looking video game called <em>Killer Bean.</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/killer-bean-game-90s-just-cause-max-payne-roguelike-gta-1850757817&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/killer-bean-game-90s-just-cause-max-payne-roguelike-gta-1850757817">We’ve been following this indie game for a bit now</a></span> and the latest trailer once again got us excited to play as a gun-toting bean on a mission to take down a shadowy organization. <em>Killer Bean</em> arrives later this summer on PC. After it leaves early access, it’ll arrive on consoles, too.</p></div><div><p>We all were hoping for a new<em> Gears of War </em>game to be revealed during SGF 2024 and it happened, but it’s not <em>Gears 6</em>. Instead, we got a trailer for something new: <em>Gears of War: E-Day,</em> which is a prequel set about 14 years before the original game and which will focus on Marcus and Dom’s first adventure together. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-e-day-gears-6-ending-storyline-2025-1851528933&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-e-day-gears-6-ending-storyline-2025-1851528933">While I hope we eventually get a<em> Gears 6 </em>(and it sounds like we still might)</a></span>, I’m excited for the OG bros to return. No release date yet.</p></div><div><p>Sometimes it takes a while for a trailer to catch our attention. And then other times you see something like <em>Phoenix Springs</em>—a modern spin on the classic point-and-click genre—and you immediately want to play it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/21&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/21"><em>Phoenix Springs</em></a></span> has a fantastic and instantly captivating lithographic-like art style that just pops off this screen. If this looks cool to you, good news: It’s out soon. <em>Phoenix Springs</em> arrives on September 16, 2024.</p></div><div><p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was not only a really good game, it’s also one of the biggest and most successful titles ever published by Capcom. So it’s not surprising to see the sequel, <em>Wilds</em>, going bigger as Capcom likely has a lot of faith in this upcoming game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-state-of-play-1851510565&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-state-of-play-1851510565">The new <em>Monster Hunter: Wilds</em> trailer looks epic</a></span> and we can’t wait to hunt new and old monsters in 2025 on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p></div><div><p><em>Astro’s Playroom </em>was a free pack-in for the PS5 meant mainly to showcase the new controller and features of the console. However, the cute platformer ended up being one of the best games for the next-gen console and Sony has thankfully realized that Astro Bot deserves a whole video game. The first trailer for this new game looks amazing, featuring <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kratos-aloy-nathan-drake-parappa-playstation-1851512540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kratos-aloy-nathan-drake-parappa-playstation-1851512540">a ton of PlayStation Easter eggs</a></span> for old and younger fans alike.</p></div><div><p><em>UFO50 </em>was announced back in 2017. So it’s hard to believe that it’s finally, for real, almost here. But it is and the latest trailer for this 50-game retro-inspired anthology from the folks behind <em>Spelunky</em> (and a bunch of other devs) has us counting down the days until September 18. Then we can dive in and check out all the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/7">various games included in <em>UFO50</em></a></span> on PC.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a></span> was one of the best games released in 2023. It was spooky, looked great, had a wild story, and featured some of the best cutscenes we’ve seen in a horror game. So you can bet we were all hooting and hollering when we saw the first trailer for “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-dlc-night-springs-canon-1851525597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-dlc-night-springs-canon-1851525597">Night Springs,” a new DLC expansion for <em>Alan Wake 2</em></a></span> featuring three episodes starring three different characters. The best part? You don’t have to wait to play this DLC. It’s out now!</p></div><div><p>This game caught our attention when it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-star-wars-starfield-fable-gameplay-sgf-1850527405#:~:text=South%20of%20Midnight,date%20was%20given.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-star-wars-starfield-fable-gameplay-sgf-1850527405#:~:text=South%20of%20Midnight,date%20was%20given.">was announced last year</a></span> thanks to its unique setting and cool art style. Now that we’ve seen some actual gameplay of <em>South of Midnight</em>, we are even more excited to play this action-adventure game set in the bayou of the American South. I mean, come on, did you see that giant talking catfish? How can we <em>not </em>be excited to play this in 2025 when it arrives on Xbox and PC?</p></div><div><p>None of us were expecting to be blown away by a new<em> Perfect Dark</em> game in 2024. And yet, here we are! The new re-reveal of this game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-xbox-is-getting-a-new-perfect-dark-1845855765&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-xbox-is-getting-a-new-perfect-dark-1845855765">which was first announced in 2020</a></span>, showcases a fast-paced, first-person espionage-focused shooter with some cool parkour and rad gadgets. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864">If the full game is even half as fun as this trailer</a></span>, Xbox might have a hit on its hands when<em> Perfect Dark</em> eventually launches.</p></div><div><p>It’s been about a decade since the last <em>Dragon Age</em> game, <em>Inquisition</em>, so there was a lot of pressure on EA and Bioware’s big reveal of the next main entry in the RPG series. And while some fans may not like some of the changes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-new-name-title-1851523469&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-new-name-title-1851523469">including the worse name</a></span>, the overall reaction to the new RPG and its focus on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812">new and returning characters and their relationships</a></span> has been positive. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is set to launch in fall 2024.</p></div><div><p>Blumhouse, the studio behind a lot of popular horror films including <em>M3gan</em> and <em>Get Out</em>, is getting into the video game business. And its not starting with just one horror game. Instead, Blumhouse arrived at Summer Game Fest with its own mini-showcase featuring <em>six</em> different spooky video games. All of them look different and interesting. </p><p>The people at <em>Kotaku </em>brave enough to play scary games are very excited to check out these Blumhouse titles in the future. The others are hiding behind us and will eventually open their eyes again.</p></div><div><p>It might be hard for some to get excited about a new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game after Ubisoft has made so damn many of them, but this latest entry—set in Japan and starring two main characters—looks like it might be shaking things up just enough to win back some players. </p><p>Something we really appreciated in the new gameplay trailer was how different the two characters played and the large focus on stealth options. You can go prone, hide in the water, and take out lights to create shadows. We don’t have to wait too long to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-trailer-ubisoft-1851530851&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-trailer-ubisoft-1851530851"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span><em> </em>as it arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on November 15.</p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmf3QZUOxF8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmf3QZUOxF8" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/379647/864200/12050?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fassassins-creed-shadows%2F660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/379647/864200/12050?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fassassins-creed-shadows%2F660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft</a></span></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Modern game remakes typically replace the cast voices for a new generation, but Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is bucking that trend by maintaining the original voiceover recordings, including David Hayter as Naked Snake. However, there will be a handful of new lines that were recorded for the remake according to series producer Noriaki Okamura.</p><p>"We're using all the original voice performances, but there are some lines where characters teach you the controls that really don't match anymore," said Okamura through an interpreter while appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDCppzRLwpw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase Deep Dive podcast</a>. "So we actually did get the original actors to re-record just those. Plus, back then, twenty years ago, we actually had to compress the voice acting down a lot to fill all that audio. Today, we aren't as limited. We don't have to compromise as much on formats and compression, so we can actually have those performances in even higher quality."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDCppzRLwpw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HDCppzRLwpw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>During the interview, Okamura touched upon <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-will-let-you-play-the-game-with-its-original-ancient-controls/1100-6524131/" data-ref-id="1100-6524131">the updated and classic controls for Metal Gear Solid Delta</a>, as well as Konami's decision to move forward with this remake before tackling another take on the original Metal Gear Solid. He also explained why Delta is in the title.</p><p>"Delta is a Greek letter, and the original meaning is something like change or difference," noted Okamura. "But it also means to change the quantity of something without changing the composition or character. That's the core concept for the title. Not different, but more. So we chose to represent that in the title."</p><p>Konami hasn't set a launch date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but it is expected to be released later this year on or PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-big-is-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-install-size.898500/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/how-big-is-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-install-size/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-big-is-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-install-size<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="350" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Any time a new <em>Call of Duty</em> entry drops, the one question on everyone’s mind is, “How many gigs will this file need?” The franchise has been known to take up a substantial amount of space, especially with the introduction of <em>CoD </em>HQ. So, if you’re wondering about the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-directors-hope-omnimovement-will-become-a-new-standard-not-just-for-the-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a></em> install size, here’s what you can expect.</p> <h2 id="h-how-many-gigs-is-black-ops-6" data-injectable="false">How many gigs is Black Ops 6?</h2> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">As of now, Activision has yet to provide a definitive answer on the <em>Black Ops 6</em> storage size. However, what we do know is that the speculated 300GB file size is not a confirmed figure for the full release. The <em>Call of Duty</em> Updates page has clarified this, stating that the estimated storage space on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-pre-order-cod-black-ops-6-all-editions-and-bonuses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>BO6’s</em> pre-order</a> site is not an accurate reflection of the actual download size.</p> <figure data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>📢 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps6</a></p><p>Correction: The estimated file size currently displayed on the Black Ops 6 pre-order pages does not represent the download size or disk footprint for Black Ops 6.</p><p>The sizes as shown include the full installations of Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone…</p></div>— Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1800273804389941699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 300GB size is a cumulative figure from the full installation of previous entries, such as </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MW2</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Warzone</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MW3</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. It’s important to note that you can download </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Black Ops 6</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> as a standalone game without the necessity of having the other titles. </span></p> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">Based on the file sizes of previous games, we can try to estimate the <em>Black Ops 6</em> file size. For example, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a> </em>Multiplayer and Campaign Packs are about 58GB. On the other hand, my install size currently sits at a whopping 200GB due to other patches like <em>Warzone</em> and <em>MW2</em>. This suggests that if you want the full <em>Black Ops 6</em> experience, you may need to set aside a significant amount of storage space.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true">We can also look at past <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-call-of-duty-black-ops-game-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops</a> </em>iterations to get another rough install size for the sixth entry. While <em>BO4 </em>requires a minimum space of 42.35 GB, <em>Black Ops Cold War </em>needs at least 312 GB (shown in the PlayStation Store). Although the <em>Cold War </em>download is pretty hefty, you can lower it by removing specific modes.</p>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">By considering these numbers, I suggest having 100GB or even 200GB to play it safe. Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-the-black-ops-6-beta-early-access-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Black Ops 6</em> Beta</a> file size will be much lower than this, as these patches are roughly 27GB. Whatever the case may be, we’ll make sure to update this guide as more information becomes available.</p>
