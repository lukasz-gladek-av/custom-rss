The limited edition will include a copy of the game, an art book, a two-disc soundtrack CD, and an acrylic keychain.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via PQube:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Gal Guardians: Servants of the Dark</em> is the newest title in the <em>Gal Guardians</em> series of gothic-inspired 2D action <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,936 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure games</a>.</p><p><em>Gal Guardians: Servants of the Dark</em> greatly expands the setting from a single castle to the entirety of the Demon Realm, and further evolves the gameplay into a true <a title="Genres > Metroidvania [177 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> adventure. It also stars two new characters with different playstyles, Kirika and <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ha, who players can switch between in order to fully explore the vast areas and take down enemies and bosses.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You must search far and wide for the means to revive Kirika and Masha’s master, the Demon Lord Maxim, and restore him to power. In this upside-down world, you’ll fight alongside demons and against demons, as well as Demon Hunters from the Human Realm. Get ready for an unforgettable adventure!</p><p><strong>Adventure Through the Vast Demon Realm to Revive Your Allies!</strong></p><p>The critically acclaimed action of <em>Gal Guardians: Demon Purge</em> comes to a fully-realized Metroidvania! Countless combos and possibilities await as you explore the Demon Realm with two upgradable characters.</p><p>Search for hidden passages, trap doors, and solve puzzles throughout the Demon Realm to collect the scattered bones of the Demon Lord Maxim. The sub-weapons and abilities you’ve unlocked for the heroines Kirika and Masha will open up new routes and strategies, so you’ll need to try every tool at your disposal!</p><p>In addition, each of Maxim’s vassals you find and revive will help strengthen your home base, the Demon Lord’s castle. As you rebuild, it will provide bonus support features to assist you. As the colorful cast of vassals fills out, you’ll see their personalities shine in fully voiced cut scenes that play throughout the game.</p><p><strong>Swap Between the Sisters in Demonic <a title="Genres > Action [2,357 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> Gameplay!</strong></p><p>Sister maid heroines, Kirika and Masha, bring their own unique gameplay styles. Older sister Kirika attacks from a distance with demonic guns while her younger sister Masha covers close ranges with her whip. They can spend demonic energy to attack with different sub-weapons as well, but it is crucial to switch between the two as the situation changes.</p><p>Should one of the sisters be defeated, you can bring her back to life by returning to her location and using “Sister Rescue” to revive her. Also, two player <a title="Genres > Co-Op [220 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">co-op</a> play is available both local and online*! With each player controlling a sister, your options will open up greatly! (Online co-op to be added in an update post-launch.)</p><p><strong>Mountains of Items to Collect!</strong></p><p>Enemies and treasure chests will earn you consumable items, sub-weapons, and passive enhancements called “Demon Relics” as random drops. You’ll use these items to unlock new special abilities for the sisters and access new areas of the map. Sub-weapons can be combined and crafted to customize their power, making use of items you wouldn’t otherwise need.</p><p><strong>Choose the Play “Style” That’s Right for You!</strong></p><p><em>Gal Guardians: Servants of the Dark</em> inherits the “Style” system of its predecessor, allowing you choose between “Casual,” “Veteran,” and “Legend.” You can switch Styles at any time, and all of the game’s content is available no matter what you choose.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="グリム・ガーディアンズ サーヴァント・オブ・ザ・ダーク - 第一弾紹介映像" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/giEooYbF2SU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Hall Effect sticks typically feel smoother than regular analog sticks, too.</p><p>Unlike 8BitDo's flagship Ultimate Bluetooth Controller, the 2C, and C series in general, doesn't have back buttons. Instead, it comes with an extra pair of remappable shoulder bumpers. These inputs can be remapped on the fly, which is nice, but you don't get the other customization features found in the standard Ultimate, as it's not compatible with 8BitDo's mobile and desktop apps.</p><p>The Ultimate 2C does have built-in rumble, 6-axis motion controls, and a turbo button. It also has a "wake-on-shake" feature, so you can turn it back on with a slight jostle. Amazon's listing doesn't mention battery life, but the Ultimate C offered 16 hours of play between charges.</p><p>While we haven't tested the Ultimate 2C Bluetooth model yet, we have used the Ultimate C Bluetooth and the Ultimate 2C 2.4GHz Wireless. 8BitDo's C series of controllers offer great ergonomics, feel, and overall performance; we'd be surprised if the Ultimate 2C Bluetooth didn't follow that trend.</p><p>The original <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Vibration-Nintendo/dp/B0CLM3T2LT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Vibration-Nintendo/dp/B0CLM3T2LT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">C</a> apepars to be on its way out, but the pink model is available for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Vibration-Nintendo/dp/B0CLM3T2LT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">only $24 (was $30) at Amazon</a>.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console\/dp\/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console\/dp\/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$50 (was $60) | $53 with carrying case</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><strong>8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Deals - Switch, PC, Mac, Mobile, Steam Deck</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller + Carrying Case</a> -- $53 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Charging-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9BDMWWN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller (White)</a> -- $50 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Charging-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9BGJVLL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller (Black)</a> -- $50 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul><p><strong>8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Works with Switch, PC, Mac, Mobile, Steam Deck</li><li>Available in white and black</li><li>Hall Effect analog sticks</li><li>Two remappable back triggers</li><li>Connects wirelessly with Bluetooth or 2.4GHz</li><li>Optional USB-C wired mode</li><li>Up to 22 hours battery life</li><li>Includes matching charging dock</li><li>Support for 8BitDo Ultimate Software customizations:  <ul><li>Remap inputs</li><li>Three custom profiles</li><li>Custom macros</li><li>Analog stick dead zones</li><li>Adjustable stick and trigger sensitivity</li><li>Adjustable rumble intensity</li></ul></li></ul><p>The Ultimate 2C is 8BitDo's budget Switch controller, but the flagship Ultimate Bluetooth Controller is by no means expensive.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/anker-zolo-10000-mah-power-bank-deal-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Even includes a built-in USB cable so you don't have to buy a separate one.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For a limited time, Amazon has brought back one of its best power bank deals from Black Friday. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5b4K5?object_uuid=5f83cdc0-10f0-40db-8529-9a7a7be972dc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anker Zolo 10,000mAh 30W USB Power Bank</a> is back down to only $15.59, a 40% discount from its original $26 price. This is an excellent deal for an Anker-branded 10,000mAh power bank that can fast charge a Nintendo Switch console at its maximum rate. The Zolo is compact, can completely recharge a Switch console more than once, and has a couple of unique nifty features, like a built-in USB cable and a discrete digital display. Plus, it's decked out in a rare pastel blue, pink, and white color schemes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Anker Zolo 10,000mAh USB Power Bank for $15.59</h2><div catalogid="8479891f-e34a-4cd8-951d-5230aeb5aeed" id="209566"><div id="209566" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker Zolo 10,000mAh 30W USB Power Bank</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two reasons why this power bank is a great battery backup for your Nintendo Switch console: capacity and charging rate. A 10,000mAh (37Whr) power bank can charge a Nintendo Switch OLED from completely empty to full about 1.9 times. Provided you fully charge your Switch from the get-go, that nearly triples your total playtime. At the same time, a 10,000mAh power bank still maintains a pretty small footprint; for example, this particular model is about the size of an iPhone and weighs under 8oz. The Anker Zolo power bank also boasts a 30W charging output over USB Type-C. The Nintendo Switch console accepts a maximum charging rate of 18W. That means this power bank will be able to charge your Switch at the same rate as the official Nintendo charger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Zolo has a built-in USB cable, however it's not retractable. Instead, you plug it into itself so that it forms a secure loop that's strong enough to be used like a lanyard. I have this power bank myself and I can tell you the loop is quite sturdy. There's also a separate USB Type-C port that be used for either input or output. Finally, there's a simple digital display that shows you the remaining battery charge as a percentage.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TSA-Approved</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Note that the TSA requires all power banks to be brought in carry-on bags; <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/power-banks" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">power banks are not allowed in check-in</a> regardless of capacity. The Anker power bank's 10,000mAh capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh carry-on limit, so it can be brought onto planes. It's also low-profile enough that no one will take notice in the first place. If a TSA official actually does take the initiative to test the wattage on your power bank, you're well in the clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more options, check out our picks for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-portable-charger">best power banks of 2024</a>.

We already knew <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> was set to receive a couple of "surprises" before the end of the year, thanks to some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-surprises-coming-later-this-year-says-director">previous teasing from its director</a> - and it now appears at least some of those are here, courtesy of a big new update for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-to-attract-record-breaking-numbers-of-players">record-breaking</a> action-RPG.
</p>
<p>
Black Myth's new stuff begins with its Keeper's Shrine challenges, which unlock after completing the game once. These come in two flavours - Return of Rivals and Gauntlet of Legends - both bringing back previously defeated foes for a rematch.
</p>
<p>
Return of Rivals is all about one-on-one fights, with players able to challenge former opponents to a duel across one of three levels of selectable difficulty. Gauntlet of Legends, meanwhile, features a number of returning enemies - some with new moves - battled in succession, with difficulty based around customisable curses. Successfully beating a gauntlet rewards rare treasures, but developer Game Science warns challenges won't be available if their corresponding opponents haven't yet been defeated in the main game.

<p>
Elsewhere in today's update (officially known as 1.0.12.16581, number fans), players can now lay their hands on Journeyer's Charts - featuring landscapes organised "for guidance and marking". Which is to say, maps. Journeyer's Charts are initially unlocked after meeting the Keeper in Black Wind Mountain, and new ones can be purchased for each visited territory at shrines. As Game Science so wonderfully puts it, "Let the chart chart the journeyer's journey."
</p>
<p>
And for players looking to shake up their wardrobe, Black Myth's new update brings four special armour pieces added to celebrate the upcoming Chinese New Year. These can be claimed under "Trailblazer's Gift" at any Keeper's Shrine. 
</p>
<p>
Beyond the big headline additions, Black Myth's 1.0.12.16581 brings a whole host of bug fixes and improvements covering everything from performance and localisation issues to boss tweaks. Oh, and the Black Myth: Wukong Soundtrack Selection has been added to the music library. All this is available on the Epic Games Store right now, with the update slowly rolling out across other platforms - so you might need to wait a little before you can probe its wares. Full patch notes are <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149">available on Game Science's website</a>.
</p><p>
Black Myth: Wukong's latest update arrives just ahead of this year's The Game Awards, where it's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">nominated across several different categories</a>: best action game, best art direction, best game direction, Player's Voice award, and game of the year. And if you're curious to know how it fares, the show kicks off this Friday, 13th December, at 1am in the UK. Or just go to bed and read about it all on Eurogamer when you're sufficiently ready to start the day.
</p>
<p>
Will The Game Awards also bring a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">long-awaited Xbox release date</a> for Black Myth: Wukong (or maybe even a surprise drop in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-out-now-on-xbox">similar fashion to Baldur's Gate 3</a>)? All will be revealed soon.

                <p>Cris Tales developer We Are Dreams has released a gameplay trailer for its next game, Prisma. The game's art direction is heavily inspired by Persona 5 but has plenty of mechanics to help make it stand out.</p><p>Prisma follows a photojournalist named Alma who finds a magical camera that transfers her to another world called Domacon, filled with other Almas from the multiverse. Friend, foe, or NPC, each Alma has a Prism Shard that grants them magical abilities in battle, and rival Almas will try to steal them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lyhho-Vj78" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Lyhho-Vj78" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game's turn-based combat is inspired by Persona 5 as well, but has some key differences. Players are able to use Alma's camera filters to distort reality and apply buffs to the entire party of alternate Almas, such as using a fisheye lens to bypass enemy shields or a shattered lens to turn a single-target attack into a multi-target one.</p><p>Alma will also be able to interact and form bonds with the other versions of herself in the party, which unlocks new combos and side quests. There will be seven different Almas to bond with, although a max of four will be allowed per run.</p><p>Prisma is set to launch for PC. We Are Dreams is best known for the RPG Cris Tales back in 2021. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cris-tales-review/1900-6417700/" data-ref-id="1900-6417700">Cris Tales review</a>, we said, "Though it doesn't quite stick the landing, Cris Tales is an enjoyable turn-based RPG adventure with a lovable story about a found family bending time to save the world."</p>

Surprisingly, Bungie's letting them keep it.</p><p dir="ltr">Players quickly noticed the upgrade was appearing in Destiny 2's in-game shop for free, with some even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1o78LwoKz0">making videos and posts</a> to spread the word about the free loot. Bungie <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1866546497816498432" rel="nofollow ">quickly responded</a> by disabling the upgrade, which had the unfortunate side-effect of also putting all Dawning 2024 Event Card Triumphs and related progression on hold.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1866556391109837143" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Due to disabling the Dawning Event Card, all Event Card Triumphs and progression are on hold until the main issue is resolved.<br>We'll provide updates once we have more information.</p>  — Destiny 2 Team (@Destiny2Team) <a href="https://twitter.com/Destiny2Team/status/1866556391109837143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Naturally, some players grew frustrated that their Dawning progress had been halted, while others were more upset about the fact that their ill-begotten gains might not be sticking around. After all, Bungie had said that once the issue was resolved, "players will need to re-acquire the Dawning Event Card Upgrade for 1,000 Silver."</p><p dir="ltr">But for some reason, it seems Bungie has had a change of heart. Shortly after Bungie announced that Dawning Event Card progression was halted and players would need to repurchase the upgrade, a new announcement was shared, letting players know that the underlying issue causing the bug had been fixed. Additionally, players who got their hands on the upgrade while it was free will be allowed to keep it.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1866595301613769151" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">UPDATE: We have identified the underlying issue impacting the price of the Dawning Event Card Upgrade.<br>At this time, we are planning the following actions:<br>1.

The beloved series is home to hundreds of amazing creatures, with each new generation bringing loads more to discover. Every console released by Nintendo has had dozens of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-games-in-order">Pokémon games released</a> for it, and the Nintendo Switch is no exception.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we approach 2025, now is a great time to explore the Pokémon offerings on Switch and catch up before new games (and perhaps a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">new Nintendo console</a>) are released. Below, we've compiled every Pokémon game that has been released on Nintendo Switch, and will keep an eye on any <a href="#upcoming-titles" data-cy="styled-link">upcoming Pokémon titles</a> that may arise.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Many Pokémon Games Are There on Nintendo Switch?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In total, <strong>12 Pokémon games have been released for the Nintendo Switch</strong>. This includes the mainline games for the 8th and 9th Pokémon generations as well as plenty of spinoffs. For the sake of this list, we've counted mainline entries with two versions as a single release. We also don't include the Pokémon games offered through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-nintendo-switch-online-cost">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, but you can check out that list below.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What Pokemon Game Should You Get in 2024? </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're wondering which game is worth picking up on the Switch in 2024, my recommendation is Pokémon Legends: Arceus. It's not going to give you that OG Pokémon game feeling, but that's what the older generation games are for. Instead, Legends: Arceus introduces more action and RPG elements to the Pokémon series, offering the freshness of open areas to explore, more control over encounters, and plenty of polish for the handheld. </p><div catalogid="50afecce-e265-4f93-be54-71713034bf2d" id="165225"><div id="165225" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch Pokémon Legends: Arceus</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">All Pokémon Games on the Nintendo Switch (in Release Order)</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Pokkén Tournament DX (2017)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/21/pokken-tournament-dx-review">Pokkén Tournament</a> was originally released for the Wii U in 2016.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24318367/valve-refurbished-steam-deck-oled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Steam Deck OLED, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">the best version of Valve’s gaming handheld</a> with additional battery life, a slight increase to performance, and an eye-popping screen, can now be purchased refurbished for $110 less than it costs brand-new. </p><p>Valve has just begun <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsale%2Fsteamdeckrefurbished%2F">selling certified refurbished Steam Deck OLED models</a> starting at $439 in the US, UK, Canada, and EU. That buys you the 512GB model with a glossy screen, while the 1TB anti-glare model can be had for $519 — less than the $549 you’d pay to get even the 512GB model brand-new. (The 1TB model normally costs $649.) </p><p>Like my colleague Jay Peters just told me in Verge Slack, “$439 is a steal for the OLED.” Valve doesn’t currently have stock of refurbished LCD models, though they can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/19/24135233/value-steam-deck-deal-sale">be as cheap as $279</a>.</p><p>Like Valve’s refurbished versions of the original LCD model, which has a slightly smaller and slower screen, Valve says it gives each unit “an extensive examination involving over 100 tests at one of Valve’s facilities,” including a battery health check, and Valve says they’ll “meet or even exceed the performance standards” of brand-new units. They each come with a carrying case, refurbished power supply, and one-year warranty — but they may have “minor cosmetic blemishes.”</p><p>Valve introduced the Steam Deck OLED in November 2023, and a year later, it’s still one of the very best ways to play PC games on the go. No other handheld has surpassed its ease of use, though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the Asus ROG Ally X</a> did finally meet or beat it in battery life while offering better performance. </p><p>While lots of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc">other Windows handhelds</a> are on the way, and maybe even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">some other intriguing hardware from Valve</a>, the company’s been pretty clear it won’t release a new Steam Deck soon — not till newer chips let it offer a big leap in performance without sacrificing battery life. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Sorceress is one of the six classes available to players in the early access build of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a>. While it may not be the strongest class, you can turn the Sorceress into a boss-killing machine with the right skills and playstyle. Below, we've put together all the recommended <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-skill-gems/1100-6528278/" data-ref-id="1100-6528278">Skill</a> and Support Gems, Passives, and Ascendancy you should use with the Sorceress, as well as a brief overview of the class.</p><h2>Sorceress Overview in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>As a Sorceress, you can wield a few different weapons that give you access to a variety of different spells. These spells can be slotted into your binds without having to spend an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-skill-gems/1100-6528278/" data-ref-id="1100-6528278">Uncut Skill Gem</a> on them. Sorceresses can use wands, staffs, and sceptres. Wands and staffs usually give you an elemental spell to use, while the sceptres often grant you the ability to utilize minions on the battlefield. Your choice of staff is actually quite important, as the associated spell with your gear plays a part in the build you make.</p><p>Sorceresses have access to three types of elemental damage: frost, lightning, and fire. You can still use minions and elemental damage spells at the same time, but you'll usually want to synergize your main weapon's spell with your other Skill Gems. However, there are some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-spirit-gems/1100-6528331/" data-ref-id="1100-6528331">Spirit Gems</a> for the Sorceress that utilize forms of minions as well, such as Raging Spirits. This Spirit Gem sends out three fire skulls that deal damage to enemies for you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413250-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.31.55.14.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413250" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413250-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.31.55.14.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413250"></a><figcaption>The available Skill Gems for the Sorceress</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413250-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.31.55.14.png"></figure><p>As you might expect, the Sorceress class is mainly based on the Intelligence attribute. Almost all your gear will require a high Intelligence stat but you'll find Dexterity is also an attribute you want to invest at least a few points into. Raising Dexterity helps with the accuracy of your spells, and you need some points to equip certain pieces of gear.</p><p>Speaking of gear, your Sorceress will likely be decked out in lighter armor with modifiers that boost Intelligence, give you extra mana, and increase whatever type of elemental damage you've chosen to wield. The lighter armor adds to the notion that the Sorceress is a "glass cannon," meaning it has terrific offensive abilities but not-so-great defensive stats. You can always wield gear with higher armor or dump some points into the Strength attribute if you feel you're dying too much, but our build should take care of those concerns.</p><h2>Best Sorceress Skills in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>For the most part, the best Sorceress build utilizes frost damage to deal with enemies and bosses alike. While lightning and fire skills can be used in conjunction with frost damage, you'll mostly be relying on your freezing spells to kill opponents. The skills you use will slot in right next to the preferred staff of choice, which is the <strong>Gelid Staff</strong>. This staff gives you access to the Freezing Shards spell, which goes nicely with all of the other frost skills you'll be using.</p><p>During the early game as a Sorceress, you won't have access to too many frost skills, with the best option being Ice Nova for close-range damage. However, as you progress, particularly into the Level 9 Skill Gems, you'll start to build a solid lineup of frost spells to use.</p><p>One non-frost skill you want to utilize, especially during the early game, is <strong>Ember Fusillade</strong>. This is a stacking, fire spell that can be used to clear tons of enemies at once and deal massive damage to bosses. It doesn't quite fit in the frost Sorceress build, but it's a skill you'll want to use before gaining access to your better frost skills.</p><p>Below, you can see what skills we recommend for the Sorceress:</p><ul><li>Flame Wall</li><li>Ice Nova</li><li>Ember Fusillade</li><li>Frostbolt</li><li>Cold Snap</li><li>Frost Wall</li><li>Flameblast</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413251-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-12.12.36.77.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413251" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413251-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-12.12.36.77.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413251"></a><figcaption>Ice Nova is a powerful early-game skill.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413251-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-12.12.36.77.png"></figure><p>As you can see, there's a solid mix of fire and frost spells here. However, the fire skills mainly come in the early game, where they're a tad stronger than the alternative frost skills you have access to. Flame Wall and Ember Fusillade are terrific for dealing damage en masse while Ice Nova can get you out of jams with enemies that like to get a little too close.</p><p>In the teen levels of your Sorceress, you'll start to unlock better frost skills like Frostbolt, Cold Snap, and Frost Wall. All of these skills will drive you to the end of Act 3 on normal difficulty in Path of Exile 2. Then, during your journey in the Cruel difficulty acts, you'll unlock Flameblast, which is a huge fire skill that can only be used sparingly unless you want to run out of mana quickly.</p><h2>Best Sorceress Support and Spirit Gems</h2><p>With your skills in place, it's time to kit them out with Support Gems to increase their stats and find some Spirit Gems to slot in alongside them.</p><p>Here are some Support Gems we recommend for a few skills, as well as the best Spirit Gems to use:</p><p><strong>Support Gems </strong></p><ul><li>Spell Cascade (Flame/Frost Wall)</li><li>Ignition (Ember Fusillade)</li><li>Scattershot (Frostbolt)</li><li>Glaciation (Frostbolt)</li><li>Magnified Effect (Flame Wall)</li><li>Icicle (Frost Wall)</li><li>Spell Echo (Cast on Freeze)</li></ul><p><strong>Spirit Gems </strong></p><ul><li>Cast on Freeze</li><li>Raging Spirits</li><li>Blink</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413252-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-21.35.34.57.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413252" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413252-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-21.35.34.57.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413252"></a><figcaption>Choosing the Raging Spirits Spirit Gem</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413252-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-21.35.34.57.png"></figure><h2>Best Sorceress Passive Skills</h2><p>There are a few different ways you can go with your Passive Ability skill tree as a Sorceress. You can choose to lean into the "glass cannon" build and go for offensive stats that help you freeze enemies better or give you increased attack power. However, if you find yourself dying more often than you'd like, it's probably wiser to choose defensive buffs that improve evasion rating, armor, and energy shield regeneration.</p><p>Here are some Passive Abilities we suggest for the Sorceress:</p><ul><li>Path of Winter</li><li>Climate Change</li><li>Echoing Frost</li><li>Raw Power</li><li>Open Mind</li><li>Exploit the Elements</li><li>Shattering</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413253-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.15.30.64.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413253" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413253-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.15.30.64.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413253"></a><figcaption>The Passive skill tree for the Sorceress</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413253-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.15.30.64.png"></figure><h2>Best Sorceress Ascendancy</h2><p>Finally, after you've leveled up your Sorceress enough, you'll get to choose an Ascendancy for it in Path of Exile 2. The two options you have are <strong>Chronomancer and Stormweaver</strong>.</p><p>Our choice for an Ascendancy is going to Chronomancer. While Stormweaver is slightly better offensively, we decided it was best to give you extra defensive help so you can stay alive longer during fights. The Chronomancer Ascendancy has access to a buff called "Time Freeze," which allows you to pause time briefly and get away from a sticky situation.</p><p>However, if you're all about offense and dealing damage, then Stormweaver should be your pick. You can utilize abilities such as Heart of the Storm, Arcane Surge, and Elemental Storm, all of which help you deal damage in some way.</p><p>That does it for our Sorceress build in Path of Exile 2. If you're looking to run another class, we recommend the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-best-monk-build-guide/1100-6528322/" data-ref-id="1100-6528322">Monk</a>, which has a spectacular and balanced build.</p>

            <p>
Just a day after piquing fan curiosity with the surprise announcement a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> update was on the way, developer CD Projekt has revealed exactly what it contains - including expanded customisation options and new photo mode features - <em>and</em> released it into the wild.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077's new 2.2 update mightn't be as feature-packed as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-getting-fully-functioning-metro-system-in-next-weeks-21-update">last December's surprisingly substantial 2.1 update</a>, but it still introduces a range of nifty new features, fixes, and quality of life improvements - certainly more than you might ordinarily expect from a game whose development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">officially ended</a> seven months ago.
</p>
<p>
On the customisation front, players can now change paint jobs across a whole range of vehicles using the CrystalCoat technology previously only available on Rayfield cars - with Herrera, Mizutani, Quadra, and Villefort all now compatible. Additionally, Cyberpunk 2077 now has a vehicle colour cloning feature (officially known as TWINTONE), so players can save colour changes made to one vehicle and apply them elsewhere.

<p>
In other car-related news, 10 more "most requested" vehicles have been added for purchase via Autofixer (as detailed in the patch notes below), and players might now see Johnny Silverhand appear in the passenger seat - to comment on or react to their actions - once Act 1 is done.
</p><p>
Customisation options have also been expanded on the player side too, with update 2.2 introducing new eye and nail colours, new face and body tattoos, new eyebrows shapes, face scars, cosmetic face cyberware options, and makeup types for cheek, eyes, and lips. Additionally, the Character Creator randomiser now includes a Plain-to-Punk slider, which does pretty much exactly what it sounds like.
</p>
<p>
And once you've pimped your car or your V out to meet your exacting tastes, you can record them for posterity using the improved Photo Mode features. These include the ability to spawn up to three NPCs for a shot, the ability to spawn and adjust light sources, increased camera range, a new Effect Intensity slider, a change to make the Drone Camera free-roaming, plus a variety of feature toggles. It's also now possible to display your favourite photos in V's apartments by interacting with the picture frames.
</p>
<p>
And that's still not quite everything for Cyberpunk 2077's 2.2 update. It also introduces a whole range of fixes and quality of life improvements, as well as - most intriguingly - "more secrets to discover in Night City." Sounds like it might be time to hit the streets and hunt down some Witcher 4 teases now the game is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-confirms">officially in "full-scale production"</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today's Cyberpunk 2077 update - which was developed in collaboration with Virtuos and is available now for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 - comes ahead of the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-is-bringing-cyberpunk-2077-to-macs-early-next-year">release on Apple computers next year</a>. You can learn more about its new features via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIlOthAEggI">developer video</a> above, or by perusing the patch notes below.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ technology, initially designed for Rayfield vehicles only, has now been adopted by other car manufacturers. You can now change the paint jobs on Herrera, Mizutani, Quadra and Villefort vehicles. Pro tip: Use CrystalCoat™ to fool the cops and lower your NCPD wanted level!</li>
<li>Kiroshi presents TWINTONE™! As CrystalCoat™ continues to in gain popularity, TWINTONE™ takes your paint jobs to the next level. Simply scan a car with your Kiroshi optics, switch to the TWINTONE™ tab, then save the vehicle's color scheme for a small fee. You'll then be able to select the scheme in the TWINTONE™ database under the CrystalCoat™ menu. There, you'll also find generic color schemes for all CrystalCoat™-compatible vehicles as well as unique color schemes exclusive to the vehicle model from which they were copied. Please note that color scheme cloning is not authorized on vehicles that are linked to quests, belong to the NCPD or that are incompatible with CrystalCoat™ tech.</li>
<li>All vehicles compatible with CrystalCoat™ and TWINTONE™ are marked with a spray can icon on Autofixer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ten most requested vehicles from the streets of Night City are now available for purchase on Autofixer:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mizutani Shion MZ1</li>
<li>Mizutani Shion Targa MZT</li>
<li>Thorton Galena GA32t</li>
<li>Thorton Colby CST40</li>
<li>Archer Quartz EC-L r275</li>
<li>Quadra Type-66 640 TS</li>
<li>Quadra Type-66 680 TS</li>
<li>Mahir Supron FS3-T</li>
<li>Villefort Deleon V410-S Coupe (Phantom Liberty only)</li>
<li>Mizutani Hozuki MH2 (Phantom Liberty only)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Following Act 1, Johnny will now sometimes appear in the passenger seat while V is driving to comment on and react to what's happening.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We've overhauled Photo Mode and added multiple community-requested features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Drone Camera is now a free camera instead of an orbital camera centered around V.</li>
<li>Increased camera range.</li>
<li>Full Collision (ON/OFF) - determines whether the camera respects in-game object collisions.</li>
<li>Lock Camera (ON/OFF) - locks the camera to avoid misclicking and ruining the frame.</li>
<li>Precise Camera (ON/OFF) - slows the camera down for easier aiming.</li>
<li>Aspect Ratio (PC-only. Custom-resolution screenshots are not available on consoles. Console systems can only export images in the standard 16:9 format.)</li>
<li>Characters tab: Spawn up to 3 NPCs for your photo, with a list of over 20 characters to choose from. You can adjust their expression, pose and position.</li>
<li>Lighting tab: Spawn and adjust light sources.</li>
<li>Fixed the Depth of Field ghosting issue.</li>
<li>Added an Effect Intensity slider.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SmartFrames™ by Kiroshi allows you to display your Photo Mode shots in-game by interacting with the picture frames in V's apartments. Browse your photo collection in the new Gallery menu tab located alongside Journal, Shards and Tarot. The Gallery pulls .png images from the screenshots folder on your PC or from your console gallery. For more details on SmartFrames™ and the Gallery, see this Support article.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Added more character customization options:
</p>
<ul>
<li>32 eye colors</li>
<li>18 lip makeup types</li>
<li>17 nail colors</li>
<li>10 cheek makeup types</li>
<li>16 eye makeup types</li>
<li>4 face scars</li>
<li>5 eyebrow shapes</li>
<li>4 face tattoos</li>
<li>2 body tattoos</li>
<li>8 cosmetic face cyberware options</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded the Character Creator randomizer to feature a new Plain-to-Punk slider. Whether you're aiming for an understated, casual look or a bold, edgy style for your V, you can now use the slider to strike the perfect balance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Added more secrets to discover in Night City.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Quests &amp; Open World</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rephrased objectives for quests that tell you to wait a specific amount of time to progress. The game is designed in a way that doesn't always allow players to simply skip in-game time to advance the objective, instead requiring them continue playing to trigger the next event.</li>
<li>Cyberpsycho Sighting: Where the Bodies Hit the Floor - Fixed an issue where no shard could be found on the cyberpsycho's body, blocking progress.</li>
<li>Dream On - The Trauma Team AV on the roof will now be properly hidden in stealth mode.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Phantom Liberty-Specific</h2>
<ul>
<li>Balls to the Wall - Fixed an issue where it was impossible to exit the elevator and talk to Yuri because of an invisible wall.</li>
<li>Firestarter - Fixed an issue where fast travel could be blocked if the player saved the game soon after exiting Reed's car.</li>
<li>Gig: Waiting for Dodger - After being freed, Bill and Charles will now be more mindful of their driving and avoid running over Dodger’s goons, preventing any unnecessary combat.</li>
<li>Hi Ho Silver Lining - The VIP section in the Heavy Hearts club will now be accessible to players who couldn't meet with Mr. Hands due to a keycard being required to use the elevator.</li>
<li>I've Seen That Face Before - The garage door preventing players from reaching the meeting point will now be open.</li>
<li>Run This Town - The elevator in the Heavy Hearts club is now back in service, so V can finally meet with Mr. Hands.</li>
<li>Somewhat Damaged - Fixed an issue where the prompt to unplug the cables from the Neural Network system was missing.</li>
<li>The Killing Moon - Fixed the issue of a wall blocking the path when carrying Songbird to the shuttle.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed one of the katana finisher animations so that it properly decapitates enemies.</li>
<li>Iconic Synapse Burnout and Iconic System Collapse quickhacks will now be properly affected by the RAM cost reduction buff.</li>
<li>The icons for Tier 5+ and 5++ Behavioral Imprint-synced Faceplate will now be visible on the HUD while driving.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing the Synaptic Accelerator to stay active indefinitely if the player is detected while not in combat.</li>
<li>The car horn will no longer honk when the player reloads a weapon during vehicle combat while playing with a controller.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the NCPD could stop functioning properly after V engages in a shootout in Pacifica between the Voodoo Boys and Trauma Team.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where TV program sound was muted or too quiet.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where CrystalCoat™did not apply properly after entering a vehicle.</li>
<li>Due to popular demand, we've lowered the Trauma Drama high scores.</li>
<li>Adjusted V’s mouth movement in various scenes, including the endings.</li>
<li>Fixed the issue of voiceover cutoff during the Ebunike station announcement on NCART.</li>
<li>Fixed ray-traced shadows for V in Photo Mode.</li>
</ul>
<h2>PC-Specific</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will now be able to properly rebind W and S to different actions other than their default settings in the Vehicle category.</li>
<li>Optimized threading system to improve performance by up to 33% on Intel Arrow Lake based CPUs.</li>
<li>Added more Razer Chroma effects for some sections in Phantom Liberty and romance scenes.</li>
</ul>

While developers of the games affected are working on addressing issues with new updates, simply allowing players the option to turn the whole thing off would go a long away to ameliorating the frustration in the short-term. <br></p><p>That’s because not all games enhanced for PS5 Pro actually give players the option of reverting to the base performance settings for the games. While Insomniac Games includes that option for <em>Spider-Man 2 </em>and <em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>, other PS5 Pro-enhanced games simply replaced the old options with the new PSSR-only ones. </p><p>The result has been worse performance of games that were actually supposed to look better on the PS5 Pro. While they run at improved framerates, blockbusters like <em>Star Wars Outlaws can </em>suffer from tearing, shimmering, and other weird effects. It’s still unclear if this is a problem with the machine learning tech underpinning PSSR, or simply with how outside developers adapt their games for it. </p><p>In the meantime, Ubisoft’s hotfix for <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora </em>should probably be the default for all PS5 Pro-enhanced games going forward. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s less than a week old, but it’s clear even now that the decisions NetEase makes in the coming months will determine if it stays a chaotic, unbalanced blast or if it joins the ranks of its hero shooter contemporaries as a polished, esports-ready sweatfest that only appeals to a fraction of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its huge fanbase</a></span>. I’ve spent years poring over Blizzard’s <em>Overwatch </em>patch notes, watching content creators nitpick every tiny tweak to damage output and suffering <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081">the loss of some of the most interesting shooter kits</a></span> I’ve ever used because someone cried foul at abilities they believed “unfair.” I don’t know what <em>Marvel Rivals </em>will be in a year, so I recommend you play it now before the team behind it has a chance to sand down the things that make it fun.</p><figure id="" data-id="13b028d6ee5b040806b29ba366626296" data-recommend-id="image://13b028d6ee5b040806b29ba366626296" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two opposing teams of Marvel heroes and villains clash over a carriage carried by two goats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two opposing teams of Marvel heroes and villains clash over a carriage carried by two goats." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="13b028d6ee5b040806b29ba366626296" data-recommend-id="image://13b028d6ee5b040806b29ba366626296" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two opposing teams of Marvel heroes and villains clash over a carriage carried by two goats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’ve ever played <em>Overwatch</em>, you know exactly what you’re getting into. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>has three roles: the tanky Vanguard, the damage-dealing Duelist, and the supportive Strategist, all of which work together like the extremities on one body toward the common goal of standing in one place together uncontested long enough to win a game. I won’t mince words. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is so derivative of <em>Overwatch </em>that it would be embarrassing if the game wasn’t also a ton of fun to play. It has the same objective structures and more than half the members of its hero roster have a direct parallel in Blizzard’s shooter (if not several). My friends and I have been playing the game for dozens of hours and still fall back on <em>Overwatch</em>’s vernacular when describing escort objectives as “payloads” or calling Star-Lord’s Reaper-esque “Blaster Barrage” ability a “Reaper Ult” because both moves involve dual-wielding gunners swinging their guns around and firing bullets at anyone in their vicinity. To call <em>Marvel Rivals </em>derivative would be an understatement, and if the notion of one big corporation looking at another big corporation’s homework and barely trying to make it look like they didn’t copy it doesn’t sit well with you, you need not apply. If you’re willing to overlook that, however, you’re in luck, as what <em>Marvel Rivals</em> lacks in meaningful iteration, it makes up for in feeling like it hasn’t lost sight of being enjoyable to the average person.</p><p>Like their clear inspirations in <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Duelists outnumber the other roles, but nearly every hero is capable of making big plays through versatile kits. There’s an unevenness to the hero design in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> that is compelling, even if it makes the game itself indecipherable at a glance sometimes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/#:~:text=Marvel%20Rivals%20Fans%20Are%20Ready%20To%20Curbstomp%20Jeff%20The%20Land%20Shark&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/#:~:text=Marvel%20Rivals%20Fans%20Are%20Ready%20To%20Curbstomp%20Jeff%20The%20Land%20Shark">Jeff the Land Shark is an early favorite (to hate)</a></span>, as the little guy has high healing output but can also literally eat an entire enemy team with little opportunity for them to counter. Iron Fist is such a menace that the usually land-locked hero can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1865832432429129957&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1865832432429129957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pester an Iron Man flying away at full speed</a></span>. Cloak and Dagger are a duo Strategist that you can swap between on the fly, with the former specializing in sabotage, such as blinding enemies so they can’t see their targets, whereas the latter is a more supportive healer. These heroes all have such expansive kits that it’s sometimes hard to keep track of what’s happening on screen, much less even remember what every character can do. Most <em>Marvel Rivals </em>fights start with 12 people walking into a space and end with a constellation of color and damage as cheeky voice lines echo across the battlefield. Most heroes in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>feel like they were built for a PvE cooperative game with the levels of unbalanced destruction they’re capable of.</p><figure id="" data-id="93ab14713204f7bfd65d3d921723549d" data-recommend-id="image://93ab14713204f7bfd65d3d921723549d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Star-Lord using his ultimate ability to kill two enemy teammates." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Star-Lord using his ultimate ability to kill two enemy teammates." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="93ab14713204f7bfd65d3d921723549d" data-recommend-id="image://93ab14713204f7bfd65d3d921723549d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Star-Lord using his ultimate ability to kill two enemy teammates." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But in the midst of all the chaos, you’ll still find some heroes who feel more focused in their role. Star-Lord, my main, is an extremely mobile dual-pistol user whose main job is to hit and run. It feels <em>incredible</em> to zip around a battlefield of Marvel heroes as the Chris Pratt chucklefuck and then devastate the enemy team with your ultimate, freely flying around the map while your guns automatically lock on to your foes. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>knows the strength of a good pop-off, and there are so many opportunities to do so. Sometimes it can be as simple as finding a good setup, like leaving a Peni Parker bomb right at the enemy’s spawn door or putting a Doctor Strange portal right in front of them that leads to a chasm off the side of the map. But it wouldn’t be a team-based shooter if you weren’t able to come up with great plays alongside your team, and one thing that separates <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is its use of team-up abilities to incentivize specific team compositions that grant codified perks.</p><p>Team-up abilities include active and passive buffs for specific team compositions. For example, Rocket Raccoon can ride on Groot’s back, sacrificing free movement for increased damage reduction, and Groot gets a pocket healer. Having Scarlet Witch and Magneto on one team gives the latter a metallic greatsword to swing around when enemies get too close. Hulk can throw Wolverine across the battlefield so he can close distance quickly. Not every team-up ability is made equal, but it’s still an interesting spin on the hero shooter format, albeit one that incentivizes specific team compositions. In a more meta-focused competitive game, some would likely argue that this makes certain heroes and compositions inherently advantageous. But I don’t think I really care about those conversations right now, and I hope NetEase doesn’t either.</p><figure id="" data-id="beb6e37321f1ad64e2639d74a14c2989" data-recommend-id="image://beb6e37321f1ad64e2639d74a14c2989" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Marvel Rivals' hero screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Marvel Rivals' hero screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="beb6e37321f1ad64e2639d74a14c2989" data-recommend-id="image://beb6e37321f1ad64e2639d74a14c2989" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Marvel Rivals' hero screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Just days in, I’m already seeing so many people complain that such-and-such hero needs to be nerfed, or that certain abilities need to be patched out of the game. It feels like players and NetEase are both at a point where they need to decide what they want <em>Marvel Rivals </em>to be, and whether or not they want to see the game fall down the same traps as <em>Overwatch </em>has. There’s a version of events in which NetEase hangs on the every word of balance-hungry players looking for their next competitive grind and <em>Marvel Rivals </em>loses a lot of the whimsy and mayhem that it currently possesses. Right now, most characters feel powerful, and that’s because <em>Marvel Rivals </em>doesn’t feel like it’s chasing some unreachable ideal of a perfectly balanced hero shooter in which every character is competitively equal to one another. Such balance is a nice idea, but the pursuit of it has drained some other games of what made them special.</p><p>In a superhero game, you want to feel superpowered, right? <em>Marvel Rivals </em>understands that, and even if there are some notable characters that could use some tweaks (Captain America, you’re a super soldier, why do you hit like you haven’t taken the serum yet?), if it starts catering to those who already think the game is “broken” and needs to be fixed, it’ll likely lose the very qualities that are drawing so many fans toward the game. Not every game has to become the next big esports sensation, and I hope that <em>Marvel Rivals </em>doesn’t sand away all its rough edges chasing the same things other games have lost players aiming for. No, don’t give me any of this “it might work for us” nonsense. Just stay the course. Stay a silly, superpowered blast to play with friends and people will come and they will stay. Don’t start a <em>Marvel Rivals </em>esports division. Don’t give toxic players a reason to treat casual players like they’re ruining their lives by not helping set up some viral pop-off clip. Recognize why people are playing your game now instead of chasing something that never works.</p><p>I feel like I’m coming at <em>Marvel Rivals </em>hard for something that NetEase hasn’t shown much interest in doing yet. It’s just that I’ve spent years watching my friends’ interest in <em>Overwatch </em>crater, and there’s something magical about having a hero shooter that we’re all grouping up together to play for hours on end. Eventually, yes, people will move on to other things. But right now, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>has the potential to learn from its inspiration’s mistakes, rather than repeat them. For now, it’s an extremely fun One of Those. Let’s keep it that way, yeah?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As you might expect, swords and knives will be a big part of the arsenal for Shadows' two main characters, Naoe and Yasuke. However, neither character will be solely reliant on their primary weapons to dish out death.</p><p>Ubisoft has shared <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lengthy overview of combat</a> in Assassin's Creed Shadows, which also reveals the tools that the lead characters will use in battle. According to Ubisoft, players' choice of weapons and characters "dramatically alters combat" in this game. The first character, Naoe, is a shinobi/ninja, and she'll have a katana, a ball-and-chain weapon known as a kusarigama, and a tanto dagger that allows her to make quick strikes and double assassinations.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaUaOUUQ8JM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CaUaOUUQ8JM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The samurai Yasuke has a larger arsenal to work with, including a long katana, a naginata [a staff with a blade attached to the end], a kanabo (a spiked war club), a yumi bow, and a teppo flint rifle. Unlike Naoe, Yasuke can also switch between weapons mid-combo for some devastating attacks.</p><p>Yasuke's weapons and strength make him well-suited for head-on combat, while Naoe's speed and stealth make her ideal for more subtle assassinations or missions. Each character has their own light or heavy attacks, in addition to the ability to charge their offensive moves which the game calls posture attacks. Defense is also a key component of the combat, as certain techniques by Naoe and Yasuke can wear down an enemy's guard and leave them vulnerable to a counterstrike.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfHbUiwF958" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dfHbUiwF958" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ubisoft also listed some of the most common enemies in the game:</p><ul><li>Outlaws</li><li>Ashigaru soldiers</li><li>Ronin</li><li>Samurai</li><li>Samurai Daisho</li><li>Guardians</li></ul><p>Each of those enemies has their own strengths and weaknesses, and some are going to be easier to defeat than others.

<p>Counter-Strike is a foundational part of the still fledgling esports scene, and throughout its various iterations, it has always attracted viewers wanting to bet. With hundreds of matches taking place across the world at different events each month, there’s no shortage of competition for viewers to bet on.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-you-bet-on-counter-strike">Can You Bet on Counter-Strike?</h2>



<p>Yes, viewers can bet on professional Counter-Strike matches. The Counter-Strike betting market has been around for a long time now, meaning there are a plethora of sites to use that offer different ways of betting. At this moment, it’s one of the largest aspects of the current state of esports betting.</p>



<p>Viewers can gamble on Counter-Strike match winners, map winners, exact map scores, over and under-round totals, individual player performances, as well as other markets. Depending on the site, players can bet using real money, cryptocurrency, or CS2 skins in their Steam inventory.</p>



<p>Traditional sportsbooks that are accessible on mobile apps like PrizePicks and Underdog have started offering Counter-Strike wagers as well.</p>



<p>Before wagering on a Counter-Strike match, it’s important to learn about responsible gambling practices. There are some golden rules to consider: </p>



<ul>
<li>Never use gambling to replace your primary source of income</li>



<li>Never bet more than you are comfortable losing. Gambling, no matter how sure you are of a bet or result in mind, is still a risk at the end of the day.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you are comfortable gambling and placing bets on Counter-Strike matches, then do your research into what site you want to use. Not all sites are available in every country, so players might be limited to sites they’re legally allowed to wager on. If betting on a specific player or team, shop around different Counter-Strike betting sites to find the best odds that give out the most winnings.</p>

		<p>Have you ever played Factorio and thought, “Hmmm… this could be so much more anime and cosy”? Well, if you have, then Little Rocket Lab is here for you, coming to PC, Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Rocket Lab - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sxL-Dro4pU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Little Rocket Lab takes the production line management sim and sends that conveyor belt in a different direction. You play as Morgan, an incredibly capable engineer who intends to build a rocket ship on the outskirts of her hometown. She’ll have to do so from scratch, starting off with small contraptions and working up to create sprawling automated production lines.</p>
<p>Thankfully most of the town seems to be quite supportive of this, in part because Morgan is more than happy to help people with their problems along the way. I’m just hoping there’s some kind of narrative undercurrent about keeping the whole rocket production under wraps and secret from the federal authorities and military, who would no doubt have something to say about this project.</p>
<p>It’s not all production lines, though, as you’ll also need to mine resources yourself, explore the region’s coasts, railyards, quarries and underground, and solve the problems of each of the town’s areas – the different areas feature electrical elements, water, cranes, furnaces, will nee automated robotics and crafting to overcome, and more.</p>

<p>Little Rocket Lab is in development by Kyle Schmitz, formerly of Ubisoft Winnipeg, who’s been working on the game for the last few years and now has the backing of indie publishing label No More Robots – somewhat ironic, given all the robots in the game…</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-combat-overview-for-assassins-creed-shadows-released-breaks-down-enemies-weapon-types/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-combat-overview-for-assassins-creed-shadows-released-breaks-down-enemies-weapon-types/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just like the<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-releases-assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-gameplay-overview/"> last overview</a> Ubisoft released, it has now released a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/pt-br/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf/assassins-creed-shadows-combat-gameplay-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combat overview</a> for Assassin's Creed Shadows, which goes into detail about the different types of attack and defense you'll be able to use, as well as the enemies you'll encounter, and the different weapons you'll be able to use depending on which protagonist you play as. The full details of the combat overview have been posted on the official website of the game, where you'll be able to see tiny clips of the combat in action, showcasing both player and enemy attacks.</p>
<p>There are three main attack types that you will be able to utilize, regardless of whether you play as Yasuke or Naoe. As said on the website, "Remember that choosing to fight as Naoe or Yasuke - as well as your choice of weapon can alter these building blocks." While both characters will have access to Light, Heavy, and Posture attacks, it will vary for both characters depending on the weapon you choose to use. In the videos shown, the combat bears a resemblance to that of Ghost of Tsushima, where you will be able to put your enemy in a vulnerable state under certain conditions, such as a perfect dodge.</p>
<p>In Assassin's Creed Shadows, the ways to defend yourself have expanded, allowing you to Dodge, Parry, Deflect, or Block attacks. Yasuke has a slightly different Parry mechanic to Naoe, which will enable him to counterattack the enemy if he successfully parries the enemy. Naoe's deflect mechanic requires similar timing to that of the Parry, but the deflect changes the axis of combat, meaning that the enemy's flanks are exposed, but also puts Naoe in a vulnerable position if there are other enemies nearby.</p>
<p>"In essence, our core fight mechanics are the same for Yasuke and Naoe. But as a Samurai and Shinobi, respectively, they each have their own weapon types and abilities that make them feel very different from one another," says Charles Benoit, Game Director for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>Naoe is more of an agile fighter who is quick on her feet and can assassinate enemies easily. However, when she comes up against more than one enemy, she is at a disadvantage, as she has significantly less armor and combat resources than Yasuke. In comparison, Yasuke is a strong warrior who can cut through his enemies with his combos. He will do significantly better against multiple enemies compared to Naoe.</p>
<p>The post also lists some of the attacks that you will have to be mindful of in Assassin's Creed Shadows, giving you advice on studying their attack patterns and tactics so that you can deal with combat, depending on what enemy you're up against.</p>
<p>As stated above, there are some little feature clips showcased in the post that show you some of the enemy attacks in action, as well as attacks from both Yasuke and Naoe.</p>
