			<p>Ready or Not developer VOID Interactive has fired its long-time Community Manager, nicknamed 'Kaminsky', over their comments on Charlie Kirk's murder.</p>



<p>When asked about adding Charlie Kirk to the official Ready or Not Discord channel's filtered words, Kaminsky replied:</p>



<p><em>I just did Charlie. Funny you mention that because me and my roommate are literally just talking about him getting shot. All I have to say is: Nothing of value was lost.</em></p>



<p>Following an outpour of outraged comments at the response, VOID Interactive <a href="https://x.com/VOIDInteractive/status/1969054077737668689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> this message to the community:</p>



<p><em>We are aware of comments made by our community manager about a recent tragic event. These statements do not reflect our values or represent our company. We have ended our relationship with this individual and reminded our team of the responsibility we all share when communicating on public platforms. Our focus remains on fostering a respectful and professional community around Ready or Not.</em></p>



<p>This isn't the first controversy VOID Interactive has faced. In 2021, the studio announced a partnership with Team17 to publish the game, but the deal was called off only a few months later. Speculation ran rampant that it was due to a school shooting level that the developers had teased via Reddit, but VOID Interactive always denied that there was any kind of link.</p>



<p>On June 16, 2022, Ready or Not was suddenly delisted from Steam due to a takedown request for trademark infringement related to a nightclub level. This was likely due to the in-game name of the nightclub, Pryzm, being the same as an actual chain of nightclubs in the United Kingdom. The game returned to Valve's store two days later.</p>



<p>More recently, the first-person tactical shooter game Ready or Not was featured in the news for its successful console launch. In less than eight weeks, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpassed-3-million-units-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> over three million units on consoles. Between PC and consoles, the total amount of copies sold is thirteen million units.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/waiting-to-buy-a-game-console-will-cost-you.1304586/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Established wisdom used to be that buying a game console at launch was a bad idea. It was the worst-possible version of the experience: launch consoles cost more and had fewer games, and often these consoles got not only cheaper but better over time, through revisions that made them smaller or added features. For the current generation, though, those who bought at launch look like geniuses — video game consoles just keep getting more expensive. And it couldn’t come at a worse time for the industry.</p><div><p>The most recent example comes from Microsoft, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">which just raised the price of its current Xbox lineup</a> so that the more expensive model now costs $150 more than it did at launch. Last week’s price bumps saw the Xbox Series X reach $649.99, while its smaller sibling is now $399.99. Part of what makes these hikes sting so much is that they aren’t the first; both Xbox consoles had their prices increased <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659430/microsoft-xbox-console-controller-game-price-increases-worldwide">this May</a>, and in 2023 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768400/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-increase">the Series X got a bump in many countries outside the US</a>. To put that in perspective, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428714/xbox-series-x-price-release-date-preorder-all-access">when it launched in 2020, the Series X cost $499</a>. That now seems like a steal.</p></div><div><p>Microsoft isn’t the only one, of course. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">Sony jacked up the price of all PS5 models by $50 in August</a>, and in the same month <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">Nintendo raised the price of the original Switch</a> — yes, the one that came out in 2017 — by $40. Accessories have also gotten more expensive, and we’re now in a time of $80 games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p></div><p>The main reason for these increases isn’t a secret, even if companies like to obfuscate it behind phrases like “changes in the macroeconomic environment” or “market conditions.” The reason is tariffs, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/607947/donald-trump-tariffs-china-mexico-canada-explainer">which are of course impacting basically everything</a>, not just video games. But video game consoles feel particularly sensitive to these increases.</p><p>For one, it goes against the natural order as we’ve come to expect it. Historically consoles steadily get less expensive over time. In 2016 both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12748176/sony-ps4-slim-announced-price-specs-release-date">Sony</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348212/microsoft-xbox-one-s-review">Microsoft</a> released smaller and cheaper versions of their consoles, and a few years later Nintendo did something similar with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date">the handheld-only Switch Lite</a>.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Even before tariffs began wreaking havoc, this cycle was in jeopardy, likely due to a combination of increased competition and steadily rising development costs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">When Sony introduced a slimmer PS5 in 2023</a>, it wasn’t a new inexpensive model; it simply replaced the launch model and sold at the same price. This means that the calculus has changed, and the best time to buy a new game console now seems to be “as soon as you can,” because these things are no longer getting cheaper.</p><p>That sucks for everyone who missed out on those launch-day prices. The bigger issue, though, is that this is a very bad time for consoles to become even more inaccessible than they already are. The entire game console paradigm has been shifting for years, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/column/781303/microsoft-sony-playstation-xbox-future-of-gaming-console">the supposed “console wars” waning</a>: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661814/xbox-best-selling-games-ps5-oblivion-minecraft">Xbox games are bestsellers on PlayStation</a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770311/playstation-game-helldivers-2-best-selling-game-on-xbox">and vice versa</a>), everyone is releasing former exclusives on PC, and subscriptions like Game Pass are further muddying the waters.</p><p>There’s less and less of a reason to buy one box over the other, and options like the Steam Deck mean that maybe you choose neither. Add to this an entire generation of players raised on multiplatform experiences like <em>Minecraft</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, and Roblox, and the idea of buying $80 games for your $700 console feels increasingly antiquated.</p><p>I’m not saying that consoles are dead, or that tariffs are the final nail in the proverbial coffin. But these price hikes are likely to speed up a process that was already in motion, where traditional consoles are increasingly becoming a niche, luxury good and not the dominant way to play video games. It’s going to be harder than ever for these platforms to increase their scale without the injection of fresh players that comes with a mid-cycle refresh and price cut.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/782532/game-console-price-hikes-xbox-ps5-switch#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/782532/game-console-price-hikes-xbox-ps5-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Techland's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> launched last week and is, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-the-beast-review">sources say</a>, "a good Dying Light game, and a fine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open-world</a> zombie game in general, full of crunchy combat and simple but satisfying number-go-up loops". Being a new videogame, it also has some bugs. The most dramatic of these appear to be problems with its day/night cycle and weather system. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
On the one hand, you've got rain falling inside buildings. I quite like this one, myself. I grew up with 3D first-person games that had slightly magic precipitation. I used to enjoy wobbling back and forth in entrances, trying to coax the weather into following me in-doors. I actually feel slightly dissatisfied when I play one of those fancy modern shooters in which water bounces off corrugated metal roofing as it should.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Techland say they've identified some problems with the day-night cycle, inasmuch as it sometimes stops cycling. This seems more urgent, because Dying Light: The Beast is a very different game in the dark. You'll have to worry about Volatile zombos who are both resilient and inconveniently athletic, capable of chasing you all over the scenery while making frightful gargling noises in your ear. A few Redditors <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dyinglight/comments/1nmpd80/hotfix_121_update_indoor_rain_daynight_cycle/">report</a> encountering Volatiles in blazing sunlight. Others say they can't seem to progress their worlds beyond mid-morning, which doesn't seem quite as harrowing.
</p>
<p>
Techland are working on a PC hotfix for these things, but say they need to take their time testing the patch, because these particular issues aren't that frequent and they don't want to screw up anything else. "We already have a fix prepared, but because this bug only appears in rare situations, it takes a lot of extra testing," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3008130/view/543368994111883033?l=english">a post on Steam from yesterday</a>. "We'll continue these tests over the weekend and most of Monday, and if no new occurrences of this issue appear, we'll release the hotfix to players right away on PC. This is our goal.
</p><p>
"If, however, we still spot any occurrences of the bug, we might need to go back, adjust the fix, and then re-test it again," the developers caution. "Thank you for your patience. We know these issues are frustrating to those who experience them, and we're doing everything we can to deliver a stable solution as soon as possible."
</p>
<p>
As is tradition, Techland's promises have met with an avalanche of comments telling them that they're prioritising the wrong fixes. Some people are mad about the frame rate, others complain about getting stuck in falling animations and quests not progressing. It doesn't seem like there are any catastrophic problems with the current PC build, but I'm keen to hear your thoughts, as ever. As for myself, I've played about three hours of Dying Light: The Beast, including 30 minutes of preview time, and I think that's probably enough for me. I like scampering over roofs but I just can't be arsed re-killing zombies any more.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-months-without-a-discount-asus%E2%80%99s-15-6%E2%80%9D-portable-monitor-drops-again-ahead-of-prime-big-deal-days.1304574/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Having a work-from-home job doesn’t necessarily mean you need to always be working&nbsp;<em>from home</em>. You feasibly have the power to work from anywhere in the world so long has you have stable Wi-Fi. The thing that used to get in the way of me getting out more often with my laptop is that I don’t like working off just my laptop screen. At my desk, I have spoiled myself with three large monitors and can see everything I’m working on at once. On my laptop, I’m caught flipping through endless tabs and apps, losing track of what I’m looking at constantly. But now, I have gotten myself a portable monitor. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4222/">You can too as this one from ASUS just dropped on Amazon from $209 to just $169. That 19% discount will save you a solid $40.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4222/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Get Out More</h2>
<p>For the worker that wants to get out and about more, ASUS’ portable monitor is perfect at it’s 15.6-inch display size. If you decide to head over to your local coffee shop or maybe get some work done in your hotel room while traveling, you can simulate your desktop experience, being able to view more of what you want to have access to at once. You can have the spreadsheet your building out on one display while you have your email or Slack opened up on the second as not to miss any pings coming your way. Or instead you can mute any incoming notifications and use your second monitor to watch the latest episode of&nbsp;<em>Peacemaker</em> while putting slides together for your next presentation on the first one.</p>
<p>The ASUS monitor has a built-in kickstand, making it easy to prop up. It can be setup in either landscape or portrait mode. I’m a big champion of the vertical display. Having your email or slack set up vertically just makes more sense than landscape. You can see more of your messages at once and be able to read more of those longwinded emails before you need to scroll down again.</p>



<p>The monitor supports a hybrid-signal, meaning the USB-C allows for the transmission of both video and power. This is wonderful because it means you’ll have less cables running across your workspace. It just needs the one USB-C cable connected from your laptop and that’s enough to turn on the portable ASUS monitor and send the video feed to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4222/">If you want to use the ASUS monitor as a more permanent secondary monitor,</a> you’ll be happy to learn it is tripod hold compatible, letting you mount the display.</p>

              <p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> was one of 2022’s break-out indie successes, a crudely animated 2D auto-shooter in which you moved your&nbsp;<em>Castlevania-</em>inspired character around screens filled with kerbillions of enemies, gaining new automatically triggered attacks and defenses by picking up the diamond-shaped gems dropped by fallen enemies. The more you played, the more characters you unlocked and the more skills would became available as you leveled up. Now meet <em>Megabonk</em>, a 2025 indie success, a crudely animated 3D auto-shooter in which you move your character around screens filled with kerbillions of enemies, gaining new automatically triggered attacks and defenses by picking up the diamond-shaped gems dropped by fallen enemies. The more you play, the more characters you unlock and the more skills become available as you level up.</p> <p>The absolutely blatant way in which <em>Megabonk</em> takes inspiration from <em>Vampire Survivors </em>doesn’t seem to be doing it any harm. Then again, the most played games in the world <a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824">are <em>Roblox-</em>made knock-offs</a>, so no big surprises there. Oh, and quite importantly,&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em> is a ton of fun to play. I mean, a 3D&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em> sounds like it would be, right? Also, to be scrupulously fair, this game from first-time developer vedinad does have some of its own original ideas…if you look hard enough.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000627600" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627600"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627600">© vedinad</figcaption></figure> <p>In <em>Megabonk</em>, you move your chosen character (at the start you can choose between a nimble fox with a starting fireball and a clunky armored knight with a swingy sword) around the PS2-like 3D space, with enemies pinging into existence all around you. Much like in <em>VS</em>, you then learn how to move around in a way that’s appropriate for your attacks while trying to shepherd the crowd of enemies chasing you such that you can loop around and pick up the gems dropped by those you’ve killed. Gather enough of these and you’ll level up, and be able to pick from three randomly selected upgrades; a mix of new attacks, improvements for current ones, and various “tomes” that improve your defensive skills.</p>

 <p>Scattered around the land are vases to break for extra coins and gems, treasure chests that can be opened by spending coins and which then grant you a randomly selected bonus item), and stone pillars that, when stood near for long enough, will improve something like health regen, knockback efficacy, spawning times for elite enemies, that sort of thing. It’s about trying to maintain your health bar for as long as you can, before losing everything and returning to the main screen. Here, if you’ve managed to gather enough silver coins or reached certain milestones (killed 1,000 skeletons, say), you can unlock new characters, weapons and tomes.</p>

 <p>Which, yes, pretty much entirely describes&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>. But here you can jump! And glide!</p> <p>For all I mock, I’m having a good time with it. It’s difficult enough from the start that it makes you want to keep finding those incremental improvements—that’s a mistake a lot of <em>Vampire Survivors</em> clones make (and let’s not forget, there have been&nbsp;<em>so many</em> of them over the last three years), where things are too easy near the start, so you get too far into your early runs before difficulty ramps up, making it feel laborious to go through it over and over. But here, as in&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>, I’m finding there’s a sense of strategy in seeking the things that let me improve each run.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627602" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627602"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627602">© vedinad</figcaption></figure> <p>In fact, if anything it’s just how, er, “faithfully”&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em> sticks to the&nbsp;<em>VS</em> formula that is the secret of its success. So many knock-offs sensibly attempt to add their own twists, but too many of those break the formula. It’s perhaps not exactly high praise to point out how <em>Megabonk</em>‘s lack of originality helps it succeed, but it remains true.</p>

 <p>Despite costing twice as much as&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em> (which is still an extraordinary $5),&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em> is proving that success in player numbers. While it’s not exactly troubling the tops of the charts, 20,000 concurrent players for a first-time dev’s crude-looking indie game is no small feat, and it only released at the end of last week. The game’s already hitting that number today, and the U.S. has barely woken up, so it seems this game is still growing. It’s also boosted by glowing Steam reviews, with the game bathing in 91 percent positive ratings, affording it the highly coveted “Overwhelmingly Positive” label. It’s that combination of a winning formula (albeit somebody else’s) and a massive amount of luck that lets Steam games occasionally see this sort of buzz. And what a treat for the developer, whomever they may be—according to their BlueSky, the game had sold over 100,000 copies by the end of the weekend.</p>   <p>That’s life-changing money, and you love to see it.</p> <p>And yes, of course there have been other 3D <em>VS</em> reimaginings, not least last year’s FPS incarnation <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2206270/Vampire_Hunters/"><em>Vampire Hunters</em></a>, but it’s so interesting when something catches the zeitgeist in this way. It’s even more satisfying when the resulting game is a bunch of fun to play, too. Even if poncle might feel like he’s owed a couple of bucks as a result.</p>

<figure><a title="Silksong Cute" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6a449938508fd/silksong-cute.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Over a week after beating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, I’ve decided that we’re all focusing on the wrong things. Hornet’s fast-paced movement and range of options are breathtaking, sure, and the game can be maddening. But instead of succumbing to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/team-cherry-explains-hollow-knight-silksongs-steep-difficulty">the difficulty discourse</a>, instead of falling into a pit of spikes for a 13th time after a pogo-platforming section, let’s all take a deep breath and give in to the truth about Silksong.</p>
<p>This game is so gosh-darned <em>cute</em>.</p>
<p>Now, cute isn’t exactly alien to Team Cherry; The Knight in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> is adorable, a little guy in a big ol’ world, mute with big eyes and small proportions. The Grubs and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGPI76PVjnw">their babbles</a> entice you to rescue each and every one of them. And don’t tell me you’ve resisted the fuzziness of the <a href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Tiktik">Tiktiks</a> or <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Hiveling">Hivelings</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957isphxy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PPa7JzGiQE" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Tonal dissonance is part of the magic of both Hollow Knight and Silksong; both Hallownest and Pharloom are full of the weird and wonderful, the dark and the beautiful, the horrifying and adorable. But Silksong takes all of this to a new level, even the cuteness.</p>
<p>It took less than a day for the world to fall in love with the singing pilgrim Sherma, who happily taps his chime against his stick. It’s irresistibly catchy, and there’s no way you won’t be singing along with him by the time you unlock the door he stands in front of, hoping his cheerful tune will light the way.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong Cute" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/63fd4cdd54d4d/silksong-cute.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sherma reminds me of Myla from Hollow Knight, a singing miner who, despite everything, continues to do what she does best, with a spring in her step. Sherma is a little beacon of joy amidst the cruelty of Pharloom, there every step of the way, napping by benches, singing their song, and helping those in need.</p>
<p>Hornet needs a friend like that in Pharloom, because she's different from The Knight in many ways; she’s cool, she’s stoic, and she’s both elegant and direct in her speech. But, she’s also a massive goofball who floats like an umbrella with her limbs dangling and her eyes vapid and empty. Every ounce of Hornet’s demeanour evaporated when I saw this for the first time.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong Cute" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/480c3c1cf3163/silksong-cute.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, and did you know Hornet loves fluffy things? We’re so alike in that way. She never explicitly says anything about it, but as you begin to fill up the Hunter’s Journal and complete entries for each foe, Hornet’s appreciation for the softer side of life comes through.</p>
<p>Take the first bug you defeat in Pharloom, the Mossgrub. Hornet says, “If not for the spikes, I would think it an appealing bug.” I can’t disagree with you, Hornet; it’s pretty darn cute with that mossy green exterior. She’s even more complimentary about the larger version (“So close to a perfect furred form…”) and the flying ones (“This bug is soft and clumsy”).</p>
<p>The enemies around Bellhart receive similar treatment – donning bells on their backs and haunted eyes, Hornet can barely resist the temptation of these fluffy foes: “Huge and soft, a fantastic combination ruined by their haunted aggression,” she says of the Winged Furm.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong cute" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bc89bb52ec7ed/silksong-cute.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>These guys are cute too, but also pretty <em>annoying</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hornet has similar feelings about Fleas, and honestly, so do I. Fleas in the real world <em>suck</em> – literally. I’ve had pet dogs before and tall grass + fluffy dogs are <em>not</em> a great combination, especially because bugs seem to enjoy the taste of...me. *shudder*</p>
<p>Silksong’s Fleas, though? Absolutely perfect. They’re part of a travelling caravan and, like the Grubs in Hollow Knight, you need to rescue them for some nice rewards. But I’m not here for the rewards; I’m here for the fuzzy little Fleas that yap and bark and howl like puppies.</p>

<p>I love the Grub noises in Hollow Knight, but I think I love the Fleas’ going <em>“awoooo!”</em> even more. Every time you free them, they flap around, eyes covered by their mounds of fluff, do a little howl and then zoom off to the caravan. They’re no less cute when gathered together, either, sometimes sleeping on the bench, other times taking a bath in the nearby lake.</p>
<p>The most delightful part of collecting the Fleas, though, comes when Mooshka, the caravan’s leader, decides to move the caravan.</p>
<p>This happens a few times throughout Silksong, but every time Mooshka asks if you want to get in the caravan, <em>do it</em>. You’ll get a little cutscene with Hornet stuffed inside the transport with a whole bunch of other Fleas. Surely she’s living in bliss amidst all the fluffiness?</p>

<p>But I’ve saved the best till last, at least in my eyes: Silksong’s equivalent of The Last Stag, the Bell Beast. I’ve affectionately named her Isabelle, because, well…. I’m sure you can tell why.</p>
<p>As the game’s first boss, the Bell Beast isn’t hard, but the reward she gives you is invaluable: Access to the game’s Bellways and a form of fast travel. Oh, and a creature that essentially becomes Hornet’s ride-or-die, her best buddy, and the equivalent of an oversized dog.</p>
<p>She naps at Bellway stations as you explore Pharloom; she growls softly when you ring the bells hanging above her. She stops her many feet when she’s eager and excited. If you play the Needolin next to her, she starts to sing next to her. Isabelle is just a giant dog in my eyes. When Team Cherry was asked to patch in the option to pet the Bell Beast, they revealed it was already in the game: <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1964016769237909832">“Attack to pet”</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong Cute" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6b649f3a4c37/silksong-cute.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And she does like it! She growls and purrs when Hornet uses the Needle on her, and presumably it’s the only way she can feel anything because her shell is so hard. This also totally recontextualises the boss battle against her – you’re not subduing the Bell Beast with violence, you’re actually petting her over and over again until she calms down.</p>
<p>I’m not even touching on late-game stuff here, because even when things are at their most dire, Silksong still has moments of adorableness, parts of the game where you can unwind and admire the craft of the world and the characters. If these delightful aspects weren’t in the game, Silksong would be pretty overwhelmingly dour. You need these moments of fun.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong Cute" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bfa1b252f2dee/silksong-cute.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So I urge you, if you’re struggling against a boss, or you’re fed up with pogo-jumping across a pit of death, pay the Bell Beast a visit. Go and find some of those yapping fleas. Just run around and spend time absorbing the locations with a less oppressive atmosphere.</p>
<p>The precious characters, interactions, and animations of Silksong are far more important than the challenges put in front of you. Is there anything truly better than coming home after a crappy day at work to your pet saying hello? I don’t think so, and so, when I’m up against the wall, fighting a boss, I know that Isabelle, the Fleas, Sherma, and so many other things are waiting on the other side to brighten my day.</p>

Were there any real-life inspirations in designing the cult?</strong></p><p><strong>Kazutaka Kodaka, Creator, Planner, and Scenario Writer:</strong> “Originally, I wanted an indie game idea, tackling an edgy theme that wouldn’t be possible with a big budget, so I chose to focus on cults and dismemberment murder.</p><p>“Later, I came up with a trick that really fit that theme, but to pull it off the game’s scale ended up becoming too large, so I put it on hold for a while.</p><p>“When I got to know <a title="Companies > DMM Games [91 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/exnoa/dmm-games">DMM GAMES</a>, I showed them a plot that incorporated this idea. Despite the extreme theme, they agreed to work on it together, and that’s how this title came to life.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong><em>SHUTEN ORDER</em>‘s religion forbids violence, yet the story revolves around murder. How did you balance that without breaking the cult’s rules?</strong></p><p><strong>Kodaka:</strong> “As a cult, they have their own unique values ​​and rules. That’s why they wish for the end of the world. Everything ties back to a single, overarching mystery, the dismemberment murder of their leader. I constructed the story and setting specifically to lead to that conclusion. <a title="Series > Persona [91 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>lly, I think it’s one of my best works, so I hope you’ll see for yourself.”</p><p><strong>Each Minister’s route uses a different genre. How did you keep them feeling like one game, versus a collection of several smaller games?</strong></p><p><strong>Takumi Nakazawa, Director and Scenario Writer:</strong> “There are two key points.</p><p>“The first is to stick to the main theme. In every route, we made sure to organically weave the story into the scenario of each route, so as not to lose sight of the core of the story, which is the murder of the cult leader, and the protagonist’s goal of finding the killer.</p><p>“The second is to maintain a consistent tone. When developing the game systems for each genre, we were careful not to stray from the setting of <em>SHUTEN ORDER</em>.”</p><p><strong>When designing the Ministers, did you start with their character archetypes and then match genres to fit them, or did you first decide on the genres and build the characters around that? Can you talk a bit about that process?</strong></p><p><strong>Nakazawa:</strong> “I heard from Kodaka that both were decided on almost simultaneously, but the genre came slightly ahead. For example, it was broadly decided that one of the routes would be a mystery adventure. Since that seemed like a good place for a detective character to play an active role, we constructed the image for Kishiru Inugami around Sherlock Holmes. The scenario’s plot was then built around that idea. After that, the details of the character were solidified as the scenario was written.</p><p>“On the other hand, for the Ministry of Science route, there were times when the genre was reconsidered after the character had already been decided. It’s not like we decided completely on one element and then solidified the other.”</p><p><strong>The routes range from <a title="Genres > Horror [713 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> to romance. How did you approach creating the soundtrack so that it fits all these different genres?</strong></p><p><strong>Masafumi Takada, Composer and Sound Director:</strong> “To evoke the culture of Shuten Order, I first created several thematic motifs shared across the entire game, and then arranged them to match each route, thereby shaping the soundtrack’s sense of world.</p><p>“In other words, if the motifs are like ‘words,’ the arrangements can be seen as the ‘rhythm and harmony’ of each genre’s language.</p><p>“By doing so, the soundtrack transforms with each route, yet throughout the game the world of <em>SHUTEN ORDER</em> lingers like a scent, remaining with players as a lasting part of their experience.”</p><p><strong>The protagonist Rei only has four days to live. Why four? How did you decide on that time limit for the story? And how did that limit change your approach to pacing?</strong></p><p><strong>Kodaka:</strong> “The four-day rule is something shared across all of the routes. I decided on it by looking at the balance within each route.</p><p>“Depending on the route, it turned out to be quite a tough restriction, but I think we somehow managed to pull it off.”</p><p><strong>You’ve previously said <em>SHUTEN ORDER</em> is influenced by every <a title="Genres > Visual Novel [605 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a> you’ve loved. Can you share a couple of direct examples?</strong></p><p><strong>Kodaka:</strong> “<em>Cross Tantei Monogatari</em>, <em>Machi</em>, <em>Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom</em>, <em>Cross Channel</em>, <em><a title="Games > Clock Tower: Rewind [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clock-tower-rewind">Clock Tower</a></em>, <em>428: Shibuya Scramble</em>,<br><em>The Portopia Serial Murder Case</em>, <em>Zero Escape</em>, <em>Ever 17</em>, <em>Ace Attorney</em>, <em>Higurashi When They Cry</em>, and <em>The Song of Saya</em>.”</p><p><strong>Most of Mr. Kodaka’s past works revolve around investigating murders. What keeps drawing you back to that theme, and what feels new about it this time?</strong></p><p><strong>Kodaka:</strong> “I’ve always loved mysteries, and I think it’s one of my strengths as a creator.</p><p>“Right now, whether you look at Japan or overseas, there really aren’t many game developers focusing primarily on mysteries, so I want to keep exploring that space. Of course, I enjoy working on other genres too.”</p><p><strong>The story is about pursuing the truth, but also making sacrifices. Can you talk more about the nature of these sacrifices, and how they affect the player?</strong></p><p><strong>Kodaka:</strong> “I can’t go into detail without spoilers, but the truth doesn’t always lead to a happy outcome. It can also reveal hardships.”</p><p><strong>How do you hope this game stands out from other mystery or <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,573 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure games</a>? What do you hope sticks with the player after the story is complete?</strong></p><p><strong>Nakazawa:</strong> “There are two points that stand out.</p><p>“The first is that it’s a mystery that unfolds within the context of religion, a world where values differ from common sense. There are original tricks that are not found (and would not work) in other works.</p><p>“The second point is that the secrets hidden in the story can be revealed in any order. These secrets are spread across five routes. Players can choose to play through the routes in any order, so the order in which the secrets are revealed will be different for each player. This creates an experience that is unique for each player.</p><p>“After finishing the story, players will experience a distinct feeling that comes from this work, and at the same time, realize that it was a special experience that only they could have. That’s the way I see it.”</p><p><strong><em>SHUTEN ORDER</em> is currently only available for for Switch and PC. Is there any possibility we’ll see the game on PlayStation or Xbox in the future?</strong></p><p><strong>Kodaka:</strong> “DMM Games owns the property, so ultimately it’s up to them.”</p><p><strong>Thank you for your time, everyone!</strong></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/shuten-order-interview-with-kazutaka-kodaka-takumi-nakazawa-and-masafumi-takada-cults-mysteries-and-multiple-genres]]></content:encoded>

Sneaking up behind your enemy, this mechanic lets you grab them and use their bodies to soak up bullets as you shoot your way through. It's already pretty brutal, but in Black Ops 7, it can become explosive as you tack a grenade onto your body shield's back for a fiery finish.</p>

<p>"Once you have your adversary locked into a Body Shield, you can jam a grenade onto them and shove them forward," the developers wrote in the post. "They’ll stagger for a few seconds before the grenade detonates and other enemies can be caught in the explosion."</p><p>Raven and Treyarch note that it's a "well-timed grenade," implying that a quick-time button press may be required for these fireworks. You can practice this until your fingers go blue in the Multiplayer Training menu. That way, you can always help your foes go out with a bang.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 comes out on November 14 for PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <p>A lawsuit over the rights to the Sonic the Hedgehog song Live and Learn has been dismissed, but the songwriter claims the song "remains in 'limbo'".</p>
<p>Last year, Crush 40 musician and songwriter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-songwriter-sues-sega-over-ownership-of-iconic-live-and-learn-theme">Johnny Gioeli sued Sega of America over ownership of the Sonic Adventure 2 theme song</a>, ahead of its feature throughout the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> film.</p>
<p>At the time, Gioeli claimed Sega had the rights to the lyrics, but not the "master recording musical composition". However, "unbeknownst" to the songwriter, the company had "exploited and licensed" the song in "at least 25 video games, television shows, live performances/events and films".</p>

<p>In a new statement, Gioeli stated the case against Sega was dismissed "based on time, not on ownership" and so the song remains in "limbo".</p>
<p>The reason for the statement? Sonic's forthcoming appearance in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> - we reported last week on leaks suggesting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-and-shadow-coming-to-fortnite-leaks-suggest-but-not-how-youd-expect">Sonic and Shadow are headed to the battle royale</a>.</p>
<p>"Just two weeks ago, I was contacted by Epic Games to potentially use Live and Learn," stated Gioeli, "and the amazing part is Sega had them call ME for the rights to use the song. So there you have it. The most epic song remains in the 'abyss of ownership'."</p>
<p>Gioeli added: "The song is mine. I wrote it with Jun [Senoue], I sing it, I created the melody, I recorded my vocals in my studio, and they do not own it."</p> <div>

<p>News of the lawsuit emerged last year ahead of both Sonic x Shadow Generations and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film</a>, both of which make use of the song in their soundtracks.</p>
<p>Gioeli's latest comments precede not just the Fortnite collaboration, but the release this week of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds.</p>
<p>A leak last week, showed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-leak-reveals-more-iconic-characters-coming-to-its-roster-which-retro-fans-will-love">more unannounced DLC is on the way to the racing game</a>.</p>

<p>And, as with any collaboration, there are tons of new outfits and accessories to purchase and decor bundles to furnish your space. Though we're <em>pretty</em> partial to that Daft Punk Pyramid Build, which apparently lights up in-sync with music.</p>


<p>We don't know how long the Daft Punk Experience will be going on in Fortnite (Epic has only said "for a while"), so if you want to get down to the dance floor and go around the world, then you can do just that starting from this Saturday.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-blizzard-president-says-xbox-console-price-hikes-are-%E2%80%9Cnot-tariff-issues-they-are-profit-issues%E2%80%9D.1304469/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This past Friday afternoon, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">quietly announced</a> that it would be raising the price for its Xbox Series X/S consoles in the United States, with the Series X getting a $50 increase, the 2TB Series X getting a $70 increase, and the Series S getting a $20 increase starting October 3. It's the second price jump for the Xbox console line this year, meaning that when we finally get to Oct.3, in the US alone, the Series S will have gone up $100, the Series X $150, and the 2TB Series X variant will have jumped up $200 in price.</p>



<p>Many have been quick to point to the current US administration's new tariffs as the real reason behind these price jumps, or as Microsoft puts it, "<em>changes in the macroeconomic environment</em>." According to former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, however, that's only part of the story.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1969178567490597232">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Ybarra plainly states, "<em>Console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues</em>. <em>And the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues. And the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse.</p>— Mike Ybarra 😇 (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1969178567490597232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>He further clarifies that he's pointing out that the tariffs only account for one price increase. This second jump in price "<em>is simply a different problem and they are going to make consumers continue to pay for those problems</em>," while tariffs remain "<em>an excuse to continue raising prices</em>."</p>



<p>The tariffs introduced this year are undoubtedly part of the price increases on hardware from <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-us-price-changes-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox. But Ybarra isn't exactly wrong to point out that Microsoft raising its prices a second time, and the struggles it faces when competing with PlayStation and Nintendo go deeper and started well before this year's tariffs came into the equation.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/streamer-cancer-malware-steam-game-scam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cancer-stricken-streamer-scammed-for-30k-by-malware-riddled-steam-game.1304466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A streamer battling stage 4 cancer has been scammed to the tune of around $30,000 by a Steam game that concealed cryptodrain malware, and while the game has been removed, it remained online for around three weeks with the malware infecting its code.</p>

<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/streamer-rastaland-raising-money-for-his-stage-4-cancer-treatment-gets-30k-stolen-from-steam-game-containing-malware-while-streaming.1303938/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Atheerios</a>, streamer rastaland, who is suffering from a stage 4 sarcoma (which means the cancer has metastasized to other parts of his body), was tricked into downloading a Steam demo by the name of&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters</em>, which&nbsp;contained a cryptodrainer.</p>

<p>If you're not sure what a cryptodrainer is, it's essentially a malicious piece of software that drains cryptocurrency from users' wallets (hence the name). As rastaland himself <a href="https://x.com/rastalandtv/status/1969629808788181258" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a>, the malware drained him for "over $32,000" in creator fees earned through crypto platform pump.fun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blockblasters-streamer-scam-game.jpg?itok=fon6Iud6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blockblasters-streamer-scam-game.jpg?itok=Ydho9znT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Steam game&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters&nbsp;</em>(which has since been removed) tricked streamer rastaland out of $30,000.</figcaption></figure><p>You can see rastaland realizing what's happened in <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1969786282831130872" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this clip</a> posted by X user vx-underground. Honestly, I'd recommend against watching it because it's completely heartbreaking, but if you'd like to get all your ducks in a row, it's there for you to watch.</p>

<p>As reported by cyber defense blog <a href="https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2025/09/38265-steam-blockblasters-game-downloads-malware" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">G Data</a>,&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters&nbsp;</em>seemingly didn't contain any malicious code until August 30th, when the cryptodrainer in question was added to the game. G Data's report also contains a great rundown of how exactly the drainer works and what you can watch out for to avoid being scammed yourself.</p>

<p>G Data points out that this isn't the first instance of malware being injected into Steam games; other examples include free-to-play survival sims&nbsp;<em>PirateFi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Chemia</em>, both of which were compromised by malicious updates.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chemia-scam-cryptodrainer-steam.jpg?itok=brvatRhM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chemia-scam-cryptodrainer-steam.jpg?itok=0Lr34Rj7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chemia&nbsp;</em>is another example of a Steam game injected with malware.</figcaption></figure><p>All three of the games I've mentioned in this article have now been removed from Steam, but according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3872350/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, two people are still playing&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters&nbsp;</em>on Steam right now. If that's you and you're reading this, I'd strongly recommend backing out of the game and deleting it.</p>

<p>As for rastaland, he's apparently been <a href="https://x.com/rastalandTV/status/1969993892889027069" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inundated</a> with support and kind words from his community, and it looks like crypto enthusiast Alex Becker <a href="https://x.com/ZssBecker/status/1969774353211695441" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sent</a> the streamer enough money to cover the loss, which is a lovely gesture.</p>

<p>This feels to me like a pretty sobering reminder to be extremely careful when getting involved with anything Web3-related, whatever <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/might-and-magic-fates-blockchain-mobile" rel="nofollow">certain major publishers</a>&nbsp;may <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/immensely-popular-classic-sega-franchise-will-become-nft-game" rel="nofollow">tell you</a>.

It is written that when the Sumerian king Gilgamesh first beheld the gleaming ramparts of Uruk‐Haven, many centuries ago, he said unto his architects: "be sure to save up gaps for those long straight ones, and try your best to start a multiplier". But then Gilgamesh realised that, by means of temporal fluctuations too nonsensical to explain, he was actually looking at the submissions page for <a href="https://bsky.app/hashtag/FallingBlockJam">Falling Block Jam 2025</a>, the latest Itch.io "make a thing with a theme" festival, which ran from last week till today. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Falling block games! Such a simple concept, capable of so many perversions. I have played a handful of<a href="https://itch.io/jam/falling-block-jam/entries"> the jam's 239 entries</a> and found them to be enjoyable, if often rudimentary. As is the style round these parts, I will now try to briefly communicate their enjoyableness to you using words. This is honestly going to be quite difficult, because I keep seeing another entry I want to try.
</p>
<p>
A pretty one to start: <a href="https://fayer.itch.io/bloquecitos">Bloquecitos</a> is a Tetrislike with real-time physics, and blocks that merge to create different-shaped blocks when you match their patterns. It's a crafty rejig of the developer's previous <a href="https://fayer.itch.io/pancitomerge">Pancitomerge</a>. I'm fond of the mosaic tile patterns, and I like engineering cascades by merging two blocks so that others tumble together.

<p>
<a href="https://apotheum.itch.io/this-side-up">This Side Up</a>, meanwhile, trades the "falling" component of the "falling block" genre for a gradually retreating 3D camera. You've got a shipping crate and you're trying to fill it with vintage household objects such as cacti, cathode-ray televisions, Nintendo Gamecubes, and lizard tanks.</p><p>I strongly relate to this one inasmuch as I had a bunch of stuff in lock-up during a flat move last year. There's a dark art to filling shipping crates so as to optimise both storage space and retrievability. I do not claim to have mastered this art. After all, I managed to divide up all my paired belongings between separate crates. I had left socks and saucepans in one box, right socks and saucepan lids in another. Get ye behind me, This Side Up! You are bringing back traumatic memories.

<p>
<a href="https://datagoblin.itch.io/bone-scrambler">Professor Gambler's Bone Scrambler</a> is a falling block game born of the fateful realisation that a thrown die is a kind of falling block. Each turn, it rolls out a line of dice. You then slide the line horizontally to match the blocks below and create combos, or spend points to reroll the set. How do you earn points? From combos. It's got nice chiptune aesthetics, as you might expect from a game that has also been submitted to <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-13">GBJAM 13</a>.
</p>
<p>
A Pico-8 one next. In <a href="https://werxzy.itch.io/recycled-blocks">Recycled Blocks</a>, you control a little laser drone that has to sculpt blocks as they fall to complete work orders and remove them from the board. I found the control scheme a bit confusing, but I love the concept. Ditto the self-explanatory <a href="https://sunrysky.itch.io/circuit-makers">Circuit Makers</a>.</p><p><a href="https://walaber-ent.itch.io/jelly-well">Jelly Well</a>, meanwhile, gets two thumbs up for its subliminal hatred of LocoRocos and for its soundscape of human mouth noises. More of this kind of thing, please. Call of Duty games would sell twice as much if all the gun effects consisted of voice actors yelling "bang". I would hire Sir Anthony Hopkins to voice an AK47, myself.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
Simply scrolling the Falling Block Jam submission feed makes me feel as though I'm losing badly at Tetris, so I'll resist the urge to write up any more. OK, one more, but only because it doesn't require a computer: <a href="https://npckc.itch.io/doctorvsvirus">Doctor Vs Virus</a> is a table-top falling block game you can play with a standard deck of cards.</p>
<p>If you see any others you like, please rotate and slide them dextrously into the comments below. Why not see if you can form a line with people recommending the same game - I'll try to add some block-clearing score attack functionality to our moderation software.

              <p>Nobody should have to decide which one of their devices gets the fast charger while the other ones get the slow version, or none at all. You carry your smartphone and earbuds and wear your smartwatch at the same time, so you should be able to fast-charge them the same way.</p>
<p>That’s what Anker’s MagGo 3-in-1 charging station does for your Apple devices, including the brand-new iPhone 17, Apple Watch 11, SE 3, and Ultra, and AirPods 4 and Pro 3. They all get 15W charging power, and your desk or nightstand get a clean, organized look with just one cable for 3 devices. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4221/">Speaking of cleaning up, that’s what you’ll be doing with this limited-time Amazon sale that cuts the price of the MagGo 3-in-1 charging station by 30%, down to just $63.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4221/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Apple Certified</h2>
<p>The Anker MagGo 3-in-1 charging station is one of the rare chargers that’s officially certified by Apple as a fast charger for the Apple Watch. It’s powerful and fast enough to bring an Apple Watch Series 10 from 0 to a full charge in just an hour and 13 minutes — over 2 hours less than other wireless chargers. (It’s not compatible with Samsung or other non-Apple smartwatches.)</p>
<p>That amazing speed also applies to your MagSafe-compatible iPhone — watch your iPhone 16 Pro Max go from totally dead to 20% in just 20 minutes, a task which takes a 7.5W wireless charger over twice as long. And the Qi pad at the rear of the stand is a perfect fit for your AirPods wireless charging case, with a non-slip surface to prevent you (or your cat) from knocking them off in the middle of the night.</p>



<h2>Nightstand Upgrade</h2>
<p>The MagGo is a charging&nbsp;<em>stand</em>, so let’s not lose sight of that feature. Your iPhone charges with equal speed in portrait or landscape position, and the powerful MagSafe grip holds the phone in place and allows you to tilt it back vertically by as much as 45 degrees. That’s perfect if you want to watch a video or take a FaceTime call at your desk hands-free while your phone charges, and on your nightstand, your iPhone can be placed in StandBy mode and act as your bedside clock, all while receiving an optimal charge.</p>
<p>Anker’s rep for top-of-the-line charging device is well established, especially for the Apple ecosystem. This one’s not going to damage that rep one bit — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4221/">the MagGo 3-in-1 fast charger earned an Amazon’s Choice tag, and this 30% limited-time deal makes it a $63 steal</a> that will keep your devices charged and your desk or nightstand organized.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/roblox-charlie-kirk-recreations</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-major-events-like-charlie-kirk%E2%80%99s-death-end-up-on-roblox.1304448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It took mere hours after Charlie Kirk’s death at Utah Valley University before recreations of the scene—in which suspect Tyler Robinson allegedly shot Kirk from a nearby rooftop—started appearing on <em>Roblox</em>. Rendered in <em>Roblox</em>’s crude, low fidelity style, people quickly created experiences (what Roblox calls the different games and locations on its platform) that lets users participate in or watch the killing play out. The following day, Roblox said it had removed <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-roblox-game-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 100 experiences</a> that referenced the event.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s very likely these experiences drew <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-annual-economic-impact-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just a tiny fraction of <em>Roblox</em>’s 111.8 million average daily users</a>. (One clip shared on X of an experience called "assassinate charlie kirk” <a href="https://x.com/crusty83106/status/1966289140473016497/video/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported 12 active players</a> at the time the video was recorded.) But the recreations of Kirk’s death found a wider audience when clips started circulating on TikTok and X, where they’ve received thousands of views, reposts, and likes. <a href="https://x.com/jackunheard/status/1966255591036432886/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Several posts on social media suggest</a> that some users were selling <em>Roblox</em> avatar skins designed to look like the T-shirt Kirk was wearing during the event, often with blood around the neckline. (Aftermath observed at least one of these avatars still available in Roblox at the time of writing.)</p><p>On Sept. 12, <a href="https://x.com/DavidBaszucki/status/1966550631327658374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox CEO David Baszucki responded</a> to a post regarding the <em>Roblox</em> experiences from Florida representative and a former staffer for Kirk’s organization Turning Point USA Anna Paulina Luna—<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-house-boebert-luna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who, while on the House floor, blamed Democrats for Kirk’s killing</a>. Baszucki said he was “saddened by the passing of Charlie Kirk" and continued, “Our Community Standards prohibit content and behavior that re-enacts specific real world violent or sensitive events or promotes terrorism or hatred against individuals or groups, and we do not allow any image or video sharing in chat.”</p><p>Though the juxtaposition of a graphic shooting and the childish nature of <em>Roblox</em> can be jarring, that the event quickly showed up in these spaces is not. It doesn’t matter the event: <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-roblox-minecraft-steam-trump-assassination-attempt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As Aftermath’s Nathan Grayson put it last year</a>, “this clockwork cycle plays out following almost any event of significance; the modern internet has been engineered for it.”</p><p>When a shooter attempted to assassinate Donald Trump during his presidential campaign last year, recreations of the event popped up in <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and yes, <em>Roblox</em>. There have been players who <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-school-shootings-columbine-ass-adl-report-kids-1851777207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recreate school shootings</a>. People roleplay crossing the Mexican border, playing as both migrants and border control. There has been <a href="https://youtu.be/vjEjU9uFUhk?feature=shared&amp;t=398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an experience in which players encounter an assassinated JFK</a> and must complete an obstacle course to find the killer. Often, recreations spread further than the players who have actively participated even after being taken offline, thanks to social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and X.</p><p>Dr. Rachel Kowert, <a href="https://www.takethis.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ExtremismInGames_APrimer_FINAL-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a psychologist who studies extremism in games</a>, told Aftermath that some of these in-game scenarios—she pointed specifically to recreations of Columbine and playing as a Nazi in World War 2 games in <em>Roblox</em>—could be explained as propaganda designed to radicalize people. She said there may be some of that when making and spreading <em>Roblox</em> experiences recreating Kirk’s death. Recreations of these sorts of events may also be a way for young people to “recreate and process” an experience; lots of people were "inadvertently exposed” to videos of the actual shooting with clips shared widely on social media, she said. “I would hypothesize that’s a minority of people, but it is a possibility.”</p><p>Of course, that doesn’t mean <em>Roblox</em> should be used as the place to process traumatic events. “If you need to roleplay process, go to therapy,” Kowert said. “These places are town squares. Not everyone wants to roleplay process that, like not everybody wants to see it on their TikTok feed.”</p><p>The reality of internet culture, though, is that it’s very hard to ascribe actual intention to memes—and these <em>Roblox</em> experiences are often memes. It’s the same culture that bewildered mainstream media in interpreting the engravings on the bullets used by suspected shooter Tyler Robinson; what was originally described as “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/charlie-kirk-shot/card/ammunition-in-kirk-shooting-engraved-with-transgender-antifascist-ideology-sources-pdymd1sXXMSlVRhpvR4b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transgender and anti-fascist ideology</a>” ended up being references to video games and internet culture. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/16/us/text-message-tyler-robinson-roomate-vis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robinson allegedly said so himself in text messages sent</a> after the killing: “remember how I was engraving bullets? The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme, if I see ‘notices bulges uwu’ on fox new[s] I might have a stroke.”</p><p>Memes are essentially a social currency online. Recreating violent events through memes can give a rush of attention and the thrill of being edgy. They often go viral on social media platforms like TikTok, which leads to an influx of clicks and views. This attention can translate into gain; sometimes it’s actual currency, as in the case of the Kirk assassination, where people were selling cosmetic items referencing the event.</p><p>“It’s impossible to know who’s doing it for the lulls and the clicks and who’s doing it because they’re radicalizing or actively trying to cognitively change the way you view and see the world,” Kowert said. “That’s why you can have none of it, because you can’t tell which is which.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-charlie-kirk-killer-steam-discord"><h3>What A Shock, The Government Is Scapegoating Video Games Again</h3></a><p>"That nihilism isn’t really reflected or addressed in either political party"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/arma-trans-platoon"><h3>Arma Can Be A Boys Club, But This Trans Women-Only Platoon Aims To Change That</h3></a><p>'It’s a community that is made for the trans community...

Now called "Wall Jumps," the ability to hop off of walls is coming to the new Call of Duty game as part of updates to the Omnimovement system.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-deep-dive" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">long blog post</a> revealing details about Black Ops 7's multiplayer mode, developers Treyarch and Raven Software detailed how players will be able to jump off walls. Most notably, Black Ops 7 will restrict when and how you can use this traversal option. Wall Jumps will only be available on certain surfaces that are marked with special icons, and each Wall Jump will reduce the player's momentum. Three Wall Jumps can be chained together without needing to return to flat ground.</p>

<p>Running on walls has appeared in occasionally in past Call of Duty games, <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Wall_Running" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">most notably Black Ops 3</a>. In that game, players wore exoskeletons that allowed them to run, boost, and jump across walls, although its implementation was met with a mixed reception.</p><p>Wall Jumps are just one of numerous changes coming to multiplayer that were shown off in the blog post. Black Ops 7 will also feature a significant modification to the way that Tactical Sprint works, and players can now use Body Shield to booby-trap enemies. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-trailer-shows-off-all-18-maps-coming-at-launch/1100-6534905/" data-ref-id="1100-6534905">Finally, all the maps and modes coming at launch have been revealed</a>.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 4, but you can check it out before that via a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">multiplayer beta that kicks off in early October.</a> For more, check out our overview of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">everything to expect from Black Ops 7</a>.</p>

                <p>A new Pokemon pop-up shop will be coming to the London Natural History Museum in early 2026, and fans of all things pocket monsters can expect exclusive items to be sold here. Can fans also expect to compete for these items with scalpers who view opportunities like this as an opportunity to make some quick cash? If previous Pokemon events are any indicator, <em>probably</em>.</p><p>The Pokemon Company will be celebrating the history of the 30-year-old franchise with this event. "There is such a wonderful alignment between Pokémon and the Natural History Museum--we're obviously both big fans of the natural world and its evolution and diversity," director of commercial and visitor experience for the museum Adam Farrar said (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-risks-another-scalping-fiasco-with-exclusive-pop-up-shop-at-londons-natural-history-museum" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>). "We hope this collaboration will spark joy and curiosity in the creatures around us, both in the world of Pokémon and Earth."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokemon Legends Z-A - The Biggest Pokemon Shake Up In Decades!</p>
      </div>
<p>While scalping is a fear, the museum is attempting to prevent this by requiring visitors to claim <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/events/pokemon-pop-up-shop.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free tickets that'll be offered online starting October 1</a>. The pop-up shop is scheduled to run from January 26 through March 22, and it'll offer clothing, accessories, and more merchandise for sale. The item that'll likely be sought after the most will be an exclusive plush toy of Pikachu hugging the museum.</p><p>This is the first time that an official Pokemon shop has been held inside of a British museum, but it's not the first museum to host Pikachu and pals. Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-company-apologizes-after-van-gogh-collab-merch-sells-out-instantly/1100-6518080/">The Pokemon Company recently collaborated with the Van Gogh Museum</a> in Amsterdam, Netherlands. A special-edition Pokemon card of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-pokemon-van-gogh-museum-promo-cards-are-now-van-gone-over-safety-concerns/1100-6518432/">Pikachu wearing a gray felt hat</a>--similar to one of Vincent Van Gogh's self-portraits--was offered to visitors alongside Pokemon art prints and T-shirts, but the card sold out quickly both in-person and online.</p><p>At the Van Gogh Museum, attendees reported that adults descended on the event to purchase as much merchandise as possible without even visiting Pokemon exhibit, and online, numerous scalpers bragged about their hauls. This wasn't the first time that a Pokemon collaboration attracted the attention of scalpers, as back in 2021, flippers descended on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mcdonalds-pokemon-happy-meal-promotion-begins-is-immediately-ruined-by-adults/1100-6487354/">McDonald's Happy Meal promotion that offered several Pokemon goodies</a> for fans to collect.</p>
