            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blizzcon-returns-september-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has announced the return of its BlizzCon gaming show, but there's a catch: the show isn't coming back until September 2026, which means it will have skipped two years in a row for the first time in its history.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24178650/blizzcon-returns-in-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Blizzard reveals that the convention will be returning to Anaheim, CA on September 12th and 13th next year. Naturally, tickets aren't on sale yet, but you can already sign up for updates via the <a href="https://blizzcon.com/en-us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>

<p>Blizzard doesn't reveal what will be appearing at 2026's BlizzCon, but the studio does say the event is "one of [its] favorite traditions" and that it's planning to build the next BlizzCon "with a deep commitment to [its] players".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-blizzcon-2026-announcement.jpg?itok=aNU0eqj9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-blizzcon-2026-announcement.jpg?itok=Wlhf4HpD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blizzard has announced BlizzCon's return...for next year.</figcaption></figure><p>While no specifics are revealed, Blizzard does say you can expect the return of "BlizzCon staples like Opening Ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, hands-on gameplay, and more".</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say we'll probably get a reveal for the next&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>expansion that will constitute the second chapter of creative lead Chris Metzen's&nbsp;<em>Worldsoul Saga&nbsp;</em>trilogy, after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-war-within-reveals-tons-of-details-on-delves-warband-hero-talents" rel="nofollow">2024's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-warcraft-war-within-reveals-tons-of-details-on-delves-warband-hero-talents" rel="nofollow">The War Within</a>&nbsp;</em>kicked things off in that regard.</p>

<p>Assuming it hasn't already been revealed, we may also get some more information about the next&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>expansion, which Blizzard has already confirmed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-diablo-4-expansion-2026-blizzard" rel="nofollow">won't be coming until 2026</a>, making BlizzCon the perfect place to reveal it.</p>

<p>Of course, I can't predict what else Blizzard will announce during the event, but I think those two guesses are safe bets. You can see the announcement trailer for BlizzCon 2026, which isn't particularly long or informative, here.</p>




<p>Given that tickets aren't yet on sale for BlizzCon 2026, we don't know much they'll cost, but you can probably expect to pay a few hundred dollars for the privilege of attending. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/katamari-damacy-rolling-live-apple-arcade</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-new-katamari-damacy-game-in-almost-eight-years-announced-for-apple-arcade.1131321/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/katamari-damacy-rolling-live-apple-arcade<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple and Bandai Namco have announced that the first&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy&nbsp;</em>game in almost eight years is heading to Apple Arcade next month, along with five other new titles.</p>

<p><em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>is, as Apple puts it in its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apple-arcade-launches-new-katamari-and-space-invaders-games-in-april/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, "the&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>franchise's first original game in nearly eight years", following the release of remasters&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy Reroll&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>We Love Katamari Reroll+ Royal Reverie</em>. It's launching on April 3rd.</p>

<p>Just like other&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>games,&nbsp;<em>Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>will see you taking control of the Prince as he completes a series of Katamari-based tasks given to him by the quirky King of All Cosmos. Apple says the series' core gameplay idea of "roll, stick, and grow" is intact in&nbsp;<em>Rolling Live</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apple-arcade-katamari-damacy-rolling-live-phone.jpg?itok=uaOigroC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apple-arcade-katamari-damacy-rolling-live-phone.jpg?itok=vzc61j4e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>is the series' first original game in nearly eight years, and it's coming to Apple Arcade.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that while Apple and Bandai Namco haven't confirmed this,&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live&nbsp;</em>is unlikely to boast the involvement of original&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>creator Keita Takahashi.</p>

<p>Having left Bandai Namco in 2010, Takahashi hasn't worked on a&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>game since 2005's&nbsp;<em>We Love Katamari</em>. Instead, he's hard at work on the rather&nbsp;<em>Katamari</em>-esque adventure game&nbsp;<em>To a T</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator" rel="nofollow">launching in May</a>.</p>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live</em>, Apple also announced five other games making their way to the Apple Arcade service. The first of these is Taito's&nbsp;<em>Space Invaders Infinity Gene Evolve</em>, an honest-to-goodness new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Space Invaders&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>It's joined by <i>Puffies</i>, a game by&nbsp;<em>Lumen&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Stitch&nbsp;</em>developer Lykke Studios, as well as the Atari remaster&nbsp;<em>RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic+</em>, which Apple says has been "enhanced for iPhone and iPad".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rollercoaster-tycoon-classic-apple-arcade.jpg?itok=7t9Rf0cY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rollercoaster-tycoon-classic-apple-arcade.jpg?itok=vdzcJ77u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic+&nbsp;</em>is also on its way to Apple Arcade.</figcaption></figure><p>Rounding out the new Apple Arcade collection are Marmalade Game Studio's&nbsp;<em>The Game of Life 2+&nbsp;</em>and STEM educational game&nbsp;<em>Sesame Street Mecha Builders+</em>, which, contrary to its name, probably isn't about Big Bird wrecking puppets with a giant mech.</p>

<p>All of these games join the Apple Arcade service, which is available on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, on April 3rd.&nbsp;</p>

Presumably, in this story, the crown-wearing elephant is supposed to be the mascot for the store, but given she doesn’t speak (as the characters of <em>A Way Out </em>characters do) it’s hard to know for sure. The only way the players can interact with Cutie is if one of the game’s two heroes, Zoe, uses her gravity whip to pull pieces from her body, yoinking off say her leg or ear, and throwing them around.</p><p>If you’ve never played <em>It Takes Two</em>, this probably seems like a pretty innocuous scene. You can pick up and throw plenty of things in this portion of the game, so why would an elephant mascot be any different? However, if you’re a fan of <em>It Takes Two</em>, you know this is a reference to one of the most surprisingly horrific moments in a mostly family-friendly game.</p><p>In <em>It Takes Two</em>, an estranged married couple’s daughter casts a magic spell, transforming her mother and father into toys. The pair, the game’s two protagonists, are convinced that if they can make their daughter cry the spell will be broken. To do this, they make the decision to destroy one of her favorite toys, an elephant queen named Cutie. The game revels in how uncomfortable this scene is to play. Cutie’s adorable voice gives her an air of innocence: she’s nothing but sweet to her killers before she realizes what they’re planning to do, and then her pleas for her life are painful to listen to. She’s torn apart in the scrap, including losing the ear and leg you can yank off in <em>Split Fiction</em>, and it all ends with you cruelly dropping her off the side of a bookshelf.</p><p>The scene is infamous for its drastic tone shift, shockingly requiring you to straight-up torture this child’s toy, listening to it beg for its life throughout. So you can imagine how seeing Cutie again in <em>Split Fiction </em>might be retraumatizing to longtime players of Hazelight’s co-op games.</p><p>Thanks, Hazelight for the collective trauma, I guess? At least the rest of <em>Split Fiction </em>is great to make up for it.

Up to five times a day, any player that presses the “Thanks” button after a battle or a Wonder Pick will grant the recipient a shiny new Shop Ticket to use. Collect enough Shop Tickets, and you can exchange them for valuable Trainer Cards (Professor Oak is the GOAT), Accessories, and perhaps most importantly, stacks of Hourglasses every month.

Months into the mobile game’s existence, this community-driven initiative is still going as strong as ever based on my testing. If you’d like to give and receive thanks while spending the least effort possible, say hello to your newest lifehack (lifehack is still a thing people say, right?).</p><h2 id="h74288"><a id=""></a><strong>How the Thanks channel works in Pokemon TCG Pocket</strong></h2><p>Truthfully, this couldn’t be easier to participate in. All you have to do is…</p><p><strong>1:</strong> Go to the “Battle” menu.</p><p><strong>2: </strong>Select “Versus.”</p><p><strong>3:</strong> Select “Private Match.”</p><p><strong>4: </strong>Enter the password “<strong>THANKS</strong>”. As far as I can tell, this isn’t case sensitive. “Thanks” or “thanks” should also work.</p><p><strong>5:</strong> Press “Battle!” You should be matched with an opponent after a short wait. You may need to sit in the queue for longer if you’re playing at off-hours (like late at night), though in my testing I’ve quickly found opponents at any time of day.</p><p><strong>6:</strong> <strong>Once the battle has started, concede immediately</strong>. It doesn’t matter if you or your opponent does this, but both of you will (hopefully) be on the same page.</p><p><strong>7:</strong> Click through the results, and <strong>make sure to press “Thanks!” for the battle once you see the prompt</strong>. Your opponent should do the same.</p><p>That’s the process in its entirety! Just repeat until you get all the Shop Tickets you need, and make sure you use any stocked up booster packs or Wonder Picks so you can complete your daily missions. Because this channel specifically exists to quickly trade thanks, you should have more luck here than if you just conceded a bunch of random matches. Congrats on gaming your daily grind!</p><p>Do note, however, that this is a community-driven trick that is subject to change depending on how the game is updated in the future. In other words, your mileage with the thanks channel may vary. On a similar note, it bears repeating that <strong>you should make sure you press “Thanks!” whenever you finish a match in this channel</strong>. No, you’re not going to get sent to jail if you forget to press the button once or twice, but repeatedly taking advantage of the community is, to quote my Kindergarten teacher, not a nice way to play with others. Also, stop putting Lego in your mouth.</p><h2 id="h74289"><a id=""></a><strong>But won’t this ruin competitive battling?</strong></h2><p>Well, this trick has been around for several months now, and Random Matches are still abundantly easy to find, so no. Also, Ranked Battles will come to the game by the end of March, so competitive players almost certainly have nothing to worry about here.</p><hr><p>In fact, if you fancy yourself a competitive player, I still suggest fitting in Random Matches when you can, just to see what cards are dominating the landscape. After all, practice makes perfect, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515">even if your Darkrai deck is still picking up wins left and right</a></span>. But if you’re about ready to go to sleep and don’t want to stare at your phone for another 45 minutes, then just enter into a Thanks battle and call it a day.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The ultimate celebration of our games and the community that unites us is returning to the Anaheim Convention Center Saturday, September 12, and Sunday, September 13, in 2026.</p><p>One of our favorite traditions, BlizzCon brings us together over our shared passion for Blizzard’s universes, but at its heart, BlizzCon has always been about so much more. It’s about you, the communities you are a part of, and gives us the chance to connect, build friendships, and create unforgettable memories together.</p><p>We’ve come a long way since our first event in 2005. Over the past nearly 20 years since its inception, BlizzCon has inspired us to innovate, push the boundaries of creativity, and deliver once-in-a-lifetime moments. It’s important that we put on an event worthy of our community. For 2026, alongside BlizzCon staples like Opening Ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, hands-on gameplay, and more, we aim to meaningfully elevate this iconic celebration and create an unforgettable experience for all who take part in it. We are building this event just like we build our games: with a deep commitment to our players, with respect for your connections to our universes, and as a celebration of the strength of the bonds formed through shared adventure.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>BlizzCon will be back for 2026, Blizzard has announced, in the process confirming the convention will not happen this year. The developer's (usually) annual fan expo will return to the Anaheim Convention Center in September 2026 after having taken two years off.</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas the vast majority of BlizzCons have happened in November, BlizzCon 2026 will instead happen two months earlier on September 12-13. In a press release announcing the date, Blizzard did not give more details or an explanation as to why the event is happening several months earlier than usual, nor why a 2025 event isn't happening.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've come a long way since our first event in 2005," Blizzard said in a press release. "Over the past nearly 20 years since its inception, BlizzCon has inspired us to innovate, push the boundaries of creativity, and deliver once-in-a-lifetime moments. It's important that we put on an event worthy of our community."</p><p dir="ltr">Many BlizzCon staples, like the announcement-heavy opening ceremony, in-depth panels about what's next for Blizzard's games, competitive tournaments, and more will be a part of the 2026 expo, Blizzard confirmed, additionally stating it aims to "elevate this iconic celebration and create an unforgettable experience for all who take part in it."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not announced when tickets will go on sale but said to sign up on the official BlizzCon website to receive updates.</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2024-canceled-but-blizzard-has-big-warcraft-plans-in-store/1100-6522953/" data-ref-id="1100-6522953">Blizzard said it decided to not hold a BlizzCon 2024 "after careful consideration."</a> It went on to say it was a decision it didn't make lightly as "BlizzCon remains a very special event for all of us, and we know many of you look forward to it." Blizzard at the time said it was "excited as ever" to bring back BlizzCon in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">While there was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2023-tickets-start-at-300-first-show-details-revealed/1100-6515587/" data-ref-id="1100-6515587">BlizzCon 2023</a>, there wasn't one in 2022, with Blizzard instead opting for a digital-only presentation. Assuming BlizzCon 2026 does happen as planned, that will mean there will have only been two in-person BlizzCon events in the preceding five years.</p><p dir="ltr">In lieu of making major announcements at BlizzCon, Blizzard in 2024 instead revealed what's next for the Warcraft franchise during a 30th anniversary livestream (including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">player housing in World of Warcraft</a>) and announced new details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Diablo 4's first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, as part of Summer Game Fest</a> and Gamescom 2024.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover-coming-in-april.1131252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has announced&nbsp;a&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>crossover, bringing the main character of the iconic anime and manga into the world of the asymmetrical horror game.</p>

<p>The crossover arrives on April 2nd and will bring protagonist Ken Kaneki into&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>, although unlike the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-release-date" rel="nofollow">main characters</a> from other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover" rel="nofollow">beloved IPs</a>, Kaneki won't be joining as a survivor but as a killer.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, Kaneki is&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s first anime crossover in terms of playable characters, although Behaviour did team up with acclaimed horror writer Junji Ito for a cosmetic collection <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/junji-ito-collection-brings-his-chilling-creations/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in January</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover-gameplay.jpg?itok=pi3S6-hw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover-gameplay.jpg?itok=Eu4pomiB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The worlds of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>are crossing over.</figcaption></figure><p>As you might expect if you've read or watched&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Ghoul</em>, Kaneki will be using his Kagune tentacles to propel him around&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s maps and to both intimidate and attack survivors.</p>

<p>With each successful attack, Kaneki will enter Enraged Mode, which will amplify his "strength, brutality, and movements", according to Behaviour Interactive. It sounds like you'll need to stay on the offensive if you're playing as Kaneki.</p>

<p>The developer is also promising a set of perks "designed to apply pressure", as well as "gloriously graphic" effects when survivors succumb to Kaneki's Mori.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a set of "iconic looks and characters" from&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>as part of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s accompanying DLC collection, with various characters and outfits from&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>making an appearance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover-kaneki-face.jpg?itok=xWCwGVDJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tokyo-ghoul-crossover-kaneki-face.jpg?itok=rtOaaap0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ken Kaneki looks pretty intimidating in&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>joins a raft of other properties to get a&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>crossover, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, Remedy's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-alan-wake-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Alan Wake</em></a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-chucky" rel="nofollow"><em>Child's Play&nbsp;</em>movies</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, more crossovers are planned for the future, with a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Five Nights at Freddy's&nbsp;</em>collaboration</a> due for sometime this summer. It's worth noting, too, that crossovers are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-chapter-leaving" rel="nofollow">sometimes removed</a> from&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s roster, so if there's one you've got your eye on, make sure to snap it up quickly.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Tokyo Ghoul&nbsp;</em>crossover arrives on April 2nd, but you can check it out right now if you play on&nbsp;the game's public test server.</p>

            <p>
I'm not all that big on ranking games, truth be told - why would I want to catalogue a piece of art that way? But seeing as you have me at gunpoint (just pretend for me), I'll admit I'd probably put <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/celeste">Celeste</a> in my top five. The platforming is tighter than any Mario entry, the art and soundtrack are stellar, and the story really hits home for me too.</p>
<p>You can imagine how excited I was when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/earthblade">Earthblade</a>, the follow-up from developer Extremely OK Games, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-devs-announce-gorgeous-new-platformer-earthblade">announced</a>, and how upset I was when it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-devs-cancel-lush-platformer-earthblade-to-focus-on-smaller-scale-projects">cancelled a couple months back</a>. Still, we've been treated to a small taste of what the game might have been like in the form of a <a href="https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/earthblade-across-the-bounds-of-fate">mini-album with a select set of tracks from composer Lena Raine</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Right off the bat you'll hear Raine's signature, synthy sound. Some tracks from the album are reminiscent of Celeste's score, while others feel completely fresh and unique. It definitely feels like it's going for a fantasy role-playing vibe - I’d love to know how this would have paired with the cancelled game’s action-platforming.
</p>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
Raine explains over on the album's Bandcamp page that Earthblade "Across the Bounds of Fate" is more concept album than soundtrack. "The music I wrote for the game is highly dynamic, in the tradition of what I wrote for Celeste," she wrote. "I took it many steps beyond, in ways that temporally-constrained pieces of music can’t really do justice. But I did my best to arrange them into the emotional arc of their progression, much like I would for any soundtrack release."
</p>
<p>
Apparently Raine took a lot of inspiration from older animation and film, like the "huge Yamaha synths" of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> composer Vangelis, as well as the "weird textures and combination of old synths &amp; live strings of Joe Hisaishi’s score for Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," and the "haunting saxophone and percussive textures of Yoko Kanno’s work on Cowboy Bebop &amp; Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex." I think that Kanno influence can really be heard in particular on the sixth track, Poison in the Roots.
</p>
<p>
It's always quite gutting when a game gets cancelled, but I'm thankful to be able to hear a little bit of Earthblade's soundscape, especially given that 50% of the album's sales will be donated to <a href="https://translifeline.org/about/">Trans Lifeline</a>. Get on it!

But what if Aloy was also controlled by an AI program and could patiently chat with you during her adventures, answering all of your inane questions like “where can I find salmon bones to upgrade my pouches?” That’s the type of thing Sony appears to be experimenting with in a recently leaked GPT demo that teases one of the more horrifying possibilities for gaming’s future. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Instead of being an avatar for an authored story by other people, Aloy simply becomes another vessel keeping players engaged through endlessly convincing but completely empty conversations. </p><p>In that version of gaming’s future, the ultimately compelling version of the character is one aimed exclusively at boosting PlayStation player metrics like daily active users and session length. It might not be the type of game that wins awards but it could be the one, like algorithmic feeds on Instagram and TikTok, that keeps people endlessly logged on. You know, a kernel of the entire thing that went haywire and ruined the planet in the <em>Horizon</em> games, and which Aloy has spent hundreds of hours fighting to fix. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-repo-platforms%E2%80%94can-you-play-repo-on-ps5-xbox-or-nintendo.1131231/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>REPO has exploded onto the scene with its combination of fear-inducing enemies and uncomfortable environments. Its synergy with slapstick comedy and multiplayer chaos is the tip of the iceberg. PC players are enjoying it, but PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch owners are wondering about extra REPO platforms and if it’s on consoles too.</p>



<p>Many breakout hits are traditionally indie titles on PC through Steam. I think of recent hits such as Lethal Company and Content Warning. REPO is following in their footsteps with its brand of valuable-collecting shenanigans. It doesn’t matter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-players-can-play-repo-multiplayer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how many players you play with in REPO</a>, a good (but cursed) time is assured.</p>



<p>Its Steam player numbers have been extraordinary since launch, but can it also be enjoyed on consoles?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-repo-on-ps5">Is REPO on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More money needed. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>REPO is not currently available on PlayStation 5 or even PlayStation 4.</strong></p>



<p>Developer semiwork’s only previous project was Voidigo—a colorful roguelite. As such, the company is still very much in the process of building its brand. A <a href="https://repogame.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> PS5 port is presumably dependent on the horror game’s long-term success. The more people buy it, the more people play it on Steam, the chances of a PlayStation port increase.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-repo-on-xbox">Is REPO on Xbox?</h2>



<p><strong>Xbox also doesn’t have a REPO port lined up for the same reasons as other popular consoles.</strong></p>



<p>Yep, Microsoft owners face the same problem as PlayStation owners. REPO is very much an indie game, and Steam is a great proving ground for the title. Costs increase once you start factoring in more platforms and ports—let alone to mammoth brands such as PlayStation and Xbox.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-repo-on-nintendo-switch">Is REPO on Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch also misses out on a REPO console release.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve seen what I’ve had to say about REPO on PlayStation and Xbox already, the penny has dropped for Nintendo Switch owners too. The Switch is a very receptive platform for indie games, so a REPO release might not be unthinkable.</p>



<p>If the status of REPO’s platforms changes on PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch, we’ll update this guide and let you know.</p>



<hr>



<p>REPO is the epitome of an overnight sensation that continues to grow. The sky is the limit as it stands, and people are loving REPO as it stands. let us know what you think, and share any funny stories you’ve had with it.</p>



<p>Keep up with the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-repo-down-server-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO server status</a> changes as the player figures potentially meddle with the connection.</p>

Sony was heavily involved in the development of the first game--and assisted Kojima Productions in completing the reveal trailer through its PlayStation Studios Visual Arts group--but given the company's recent approach to porting more of its console-exclusives to PC in the years since Death Stranding launched, it's highly likely that Death Stranding 2 will make its way to that platform eventually.</p><h2 id="Death_Stranding_2_Story">Death Stranding 2 Story</h2><p dir="ltr">Kojima is keeping the Death Stranding 2 story under wraps for now, but he has revealed a few details about the game since its official debut, while the first trailer has also hinted at a new calamity on the horizon as the unstoppable Death Stranding continues. The story for Death Stranding 2 that Kojima originally had in mind was thrown out after the COVID-19 pandemic hit, with Kojima remarking that he restarted from square one. "I had the story written before the pandemic. But after experiencing the pandemic, I just rewrote the whole story from scratch," Kojima said at the Game Awards.</p><p dir="ltr">"Should we have connected" is the main crux of the story, as following Sam's journey to help establish the United Cities of America, the world has changed. Deliveries are now automated, a dangerous new cult seems to have emerged, and Higgs Monoghan has somehow managed to escape the Beach after he was stranded on it toward the end of the first game. Throw in a hulking samurai outfitted in red armor, kaiju-sized tar-monsters, and new locales, and Death Stranding 2 looks like it'll be greatly expanding on the ideas of the first game.</p><p dir="ltr">"In Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, embark on an inspiring mission of human connection beyond the UCA," the official plot synopsis from Kojima Productions reads. "Sam--with companions by his side--sets out on a new journey to save humanity from extinction. Join them as they traverse a world beset by otherworldly enemies, obstacles, and a haunting question: should we have connected?"</p><p dir="ltr">If you sift through the reveal trailer, there's a whole bunch of fascinating threads to explore, ranging from the state of the world after more connections had been made, the return of Fragile, who is in a much healthier state now, and possibly a multiverse of variants to deal with.

This time, Reedus will be joined by a few new faces as<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elle-fanning-thinks-death-stranding-2-looks-pretty-amazing-but-is-going-to-get-so-much-better/1100-6511370/"> Elle Fanning</a> and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-next-game-features-deadpool-2-actress/1100-6508796/"> Shioli Kutsuna</a> are in the cast. Reedus once again plays Sam Porter Bridges, and he's joined by Lea Seydoux (Fragile) and Troy Baker (Higgs Monaghan), two characters from the first Death Stranding.</p><p dir="ltr">Other new actors include Mad Max director George Miller as Tarman, the captain of the DHV Magellan and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2s-latest-footage-debuts-new-characters-and-a-talking-doll/1100-6526788/"> Fatih Akin as Dollman</a>, one of the more interesting additions to the series. True to his name, Dollman is a living puppet who'll join Sam on his journey, and who isn't afraid to pick a fight with people like Higgs. Speaking of Higgs, the self-proclaimed particle in all things is sporting a wild new look, resembling a cyberpunk version of the Crow. There's also Neil, another new character who is the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-introduces-its-own-solid-snake-sort-of/1100-6529990/"> spitting image of Solid Snake from the Metal Gear Solid series</a> when he dons a bandana, as seen in the release date trailer.

dir="ltr" id="Death_Stranding_2_gameplay">Death Stranding 2 gameplay</h2><p dir="ltr">The first Death Stranding was essentially a puzzle game, as players had to guide Sam to his destination and figure out the best route and equipment to help him deliver his cargo in one piece. Sure, the game also had action and stealth as you were forced into fights with package-stealing Mules and the ghostly BTs haunting parts of the map, but the real core of the game was focused on the journey and the destination ahead of you. Adding an extra wrinkle to the gameplay was timefall, a weather phenomenon involving deadly rain that could steal the time of anything it landed on before becoming harmless water, and staying outside too long during one of these showers could ruin a cargo run.</p><p dir="ltr">For Death Stranding 2, it looks like that mix of genres has been expanded on. Couriering cargo, for example, looks even more dangerous thanks to other weather phenomena like bushfires, lightning storms, and avalanches. To make things easier, it looks like Sam will have access to a new fleet of vehicles that can traverse this deadly ground, as well as exoskeletons and floating carriers.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat also looks like it has been beefed up, especially with all of the new enemies that you'll encounter. Human foes seem to be smarter this time. we've glimpsed horrifying hand-monsters in the wild, and we're going to need a much bigger gun to take on the skyscraper-sized tar-monsters.</p><p dir="ltr">Asynchronous multiplayer will also return in the sequel via the Social Strand system, which helped foster a feeling of connection in Death Stranding. Essentially, this allowed players to have an impact on the world, leaving behind useful tools, gadgets, and vehicles for other players to find in their expeditions once certain areas had been connected to the Chyral Network. We're not certain if or how this system has been expanded, but if it's anything like the one seen in the first game, it'll be a welcome feature as players lend a hand to each other in a dangerous world.</p><h2 id="Death_Stranding_2_soundtrack">Death Stranding 2 soundtrack</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSN1rPPKK9s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BSN1rPPKK9s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Death Stranding's soundtrack is a highlight of that game, as chill beats to relax to at the end of the world made for a meditative experience. We know that Woodkid composed the song "The Wilder" which was heard in the SXSW trailer and that you can listen to in the video above. This isn't the first time that the French music video director has worked with Kojima, as he previously teamed up with the director to create the song "Goliath" for the Death Stranding: Director's Cut trailer. Beyond that,<a href="https://youtu.be/krSy6fI0SBU?t=2038" rel="nofollow "> Woodkid also has several other tracks</a> that'll be in Death Stranding 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Scottish music trio Chvrches also contributed some of the best tracks to the game, and while they haven't been formally contacted to create some new material for the sequel, the band says that it'll be ready in a hot second if Kojima approaches them again.</p><p>"There's nothing formal yet. We’ve talked [and] we've hinted heavily at each other that we would both like to collaborate again," Chvrches synth player Martin Doherty<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chvrches-talks-death-stranding-2-is-ready-to-return-if-kojima-calls/1100-6512094/">said in March</a>. "There's sort of a dance going on right now. I don't want to be rejected by all out saying, 'Can we be on the game please?' and [Kojima] says no. But I don’t know. We're continuing to build a really special relationship with Hideo. And I think we get him and I think he gets us. If the call comes in to do more then of course, we'll be there in a second."</p>

                <p>The first Battlefield Labs test took place recently for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, and while participants were prohibited from sharing footage publicly, that's exactly what happened.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-playtest-gameplay-shows-whats-next-for-the-franchise/1100-6529982/" data-ref-id="1100-6529982"> Lots of gameplay footage and new information emerged</a>. Battlefield lead producer David Sirland has now reacted to this, saying he is "not OK" with leaks.</p><p>"I am not OK with leaks; they are dealt with accordingly as well," Sirland said on <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1899346999545086390" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> when asked for his thoughts.</p><p>A new Battlefield feature, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-6-gameplay-footage-reveals-two-big-changes/1100-6529992/" data-ref-id="1100-6529992">the ability to drag a downed teammate to safety</a>, was among the many things that leaked out of the early tests. Sirland said this will be a "key feature in the revive loop," going on to say he's expecting to see "some interesting use" in the next test.</p><p>Sirland was also asked if EA might considering dropping the requirement for participants to sign a non-disclosure agreement for future tests. He didn't confirm anything but <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1899415906104512741" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">laid out the developer's position</a>:</p><p>"We have loads of feedback from the very active testers selected. In good amounts and in the right areas for us to be able to use it. There is a rationale to the approach we are taking, and it's working well so far. There will be more tests and we'll open up to more over time."</p><p>It's not too late to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> to possibly get into a future test.

            <p>
Blizzard's big convention BlizzCon is skipping 2025, but will return in full strength next year.
</p>
<p>
Fans had hoped BlizzCon would return for 2025 - the event's 20th anniversary - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzcon-is-cancelled-again-after-last-years-first-in-person-event-since-2019">after it also didn't run in 2024</a>. Indeed, the fact there won't be a 2025 convention too means BlizzCon will miss two years on the trot - the first time it has done so since its founding in 2005.
</p>
<p>
Still, plans are afoot for BlizzCon to return properly in 2026, with dates set for Saturday 12th and Sunday 13th September at the Anaheim Convention Center in California.
</p>
<p>
"BlizzCon has been a cornerstone of Blizzard's history since 2005, allowing us to connect with our community and our players directly," the company wrote in a statement today. "For 2026, alongside BlizzCon staples like Opening
Ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, hands-on gameplay, and more, we aim to meaningfully elevate this iconic celebration and create an unforgettable experience.
</p>
<p>
"We are building this event just like we build our games: with a deep commitment to our players, with respect for our players' connections to our universes, and as a celebration of the strength of the bonds formed through shared adventure."
</p>
<p>
No mention was made of why the event was skipping 2025, though we've asked Blizzard about any other plans for this year.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wanderstop-is-a-management-sim-about-burnout.1131198/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wanderstop-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s this <a href="https://zcla.org/articles-joshuswashyourbowl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zen koan</a> I’ve always liked: a monk, new to a monastery, asks Joshu what he should do, and Joshu asks if he’s eaten breakfast. When he says he has, Joshu replies, “Then wash your bowl.” <em><a href="https://www.wanderstopgame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wanderstop</a></em>, the latest game by <em>The Stanley Parable</em> and <em>The Beginner’s Guide</em> creator Davey Wreden and <em>Gone Home</em>'s Karla Zimonja, sees the healing potential in these instructions.</p><p>Wreden has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/healing-is-messy-and-it-is-bitter-the-stanley-parables-creator-has-used-his-newest-game-as-an-outlet-to-explore-his-own-burnout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said the game is about his own struggles with burnout</a>, and this is apparent from the jump: <em>Wanderstop</em> follows Alta, an up-til-now undefeated warrior who suddenly finds herself losing matches and unable to lift her sword. When she collapses in the woods, she’s rescued by Boro, a jovial man who runs the Wanderstop tea shop. Boro invites Alta to stay and make tea while she figures out what’s going on with her.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="WANDERSTOP | PC, PS5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hsyvk0ArBb4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Working at the tea shop has all the trappings of the management sims and “cozy” games <em>Wanderstop </em>clearly draws from. You harvest tea from bushes around the shop and grow fruits for flavor by planting different colored seeds in different configurations, or planting adjacent plants to change their properties. You make tea using a huge contraption that requires climbing ladders, pumping bellows, and flipping switches. There are also plenty of chores to do around the tea shop, from cutting weeds and sweeping debris to decorating the place with trinkets and photographs.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Wanderstop </em>wants to subvert the way these tasks usually play out in games, and in the day-to-day it does. Alta reflects at one point that “Even relaxing feels like a job,” which is the very idea the game is grappling with. So rather than the busy flood of demanding customers management games usually feature, people drift in and out of the tea shop, and sometimes they don’t want anything at all. Nothing bad happens if you make them the wrong order, and there’s even a “Book of Answers” that straight up tells you how to fulfill their requests. You don’t have to do any of your chores. You can’t level up the tea shop; the cup-washing machine takes <em>forever</em> to wash cups, and there’s nothing you can do to speed it up, nor do you need to, because there’s plenty of cups and never a rush. You can reject tea orders or tasks Boro gives you without consequences. (I did one <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">camera quest</a> just to see what would happen, and then gratefully rejected every subsequent one.) There are stretches of downtime when nothing needs doing, when you’re free to do whatever you like until the plot moves forward. I filled that time reading the game’s very funny books, or trying new plant configurations and then drinking the teas I made from them to trigger Alta reflecting on her past. As a game concerned with ideas about overwork and what labor is for, <em>Wanderstop</em> removes the pressure of work from the management sim genre; this drew my attention to my drive for tasks and progress in these kinds of games, and the plot itself asked me to think about how that same drive applies to my life.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the nature of Wreden’s games, I expected this subversion to deepen over time, but–a bit unfortunately–we’re still talking about a video game here, and a 10+ hour game of waiting around for things to happen would probably grow more frustrating than restful. Eventually, things get busier, customer requests get more elaborate, and certain characters become key to moving the story forward, even though this never rises too far from the game’s baseline slow pace. Instead, <em>Wanderstop</em> shifts its questions to its narrative, as Alta examines her past and what motivates her and who she’s hurt in her drive for success as a warrior. The game never gives a definitive answer; it just gives Alta and the player a lot of questions, and ultimately it’s up to your experience playing the game and your own interpretation of its ending to imagine what progress Alta’s made at the end. I appreciated this decision, as any answers the game gives might ultimately feel too neat to be resonant.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Ivy Road</figcaption></figure><p>I got code for <em>Wanderstop</em> all the way back at the end of January, which is practically unheard-of leeway for a comparatively short video game, but I still found myself pushing through it for its review embargo. This is not the way it wants to be played, and I wondered if the long lead time was meant to highlight that. And I wondered what it said about me that I turned the whole thing into, well, what I always turn work into: a source of stress and an excuse to turn down other invitations, a reason to run through all my favorite stories and resentments (<em>I must be doing something important if my day is so busy; I sure am working harder than other people!</em>) the way Alta ran combat training drills before she burned out.</p><p>If you’ve hung around Aftermath for a while you know I have a, let’s call it, distinct relationship to work. Running my own business has brought that into stark relief; one morning after having the kind of “rock bottom” revelation we usually reserve for <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-play-games-sober-1839509936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drinking</a>, I even found myself on a website for the AA-modelled “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68575101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Workaholics Anonymous</a>,” a model I’m not sure I mesh with but whose <a href="https://workaholics-anonymous.org/literature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">literature</a> I found chillingly resonant. I bought a bunch of workbooks that, in the nature of a lot of recovery literature, felt hard to work with without subscribing to the model itself, but which gave me a lot to think about. I’ve yet to be able to find a way to talk about work that <em>works</em> for me; people around me talk about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/536249/wanderstop-review-ivy-road-annapurna-tea-shop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not dreaming about labor</a>, but I don’t think I agree with that. I do, to an extent, dream of labor; I joke that I have a bit of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/magazine/shakers-utopia.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shaker</a> streak in me, where the times I felt most myself were when I had a <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57673/to-be-of-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">useful</a> role to fulfill, whether that was <a href="https://aftermath.site/tofu-scramble-hell-yeah" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restaurant work</a> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/goodbye-and-tktk-1847173953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managing a website</a> or living in places that required literal <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/engkqh/before_enlightenment_chop_wood_carry_water_after/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wood to be chopped and water to be carried</a> every day. Years of <a href="https://aftermath.site/kennedy-center-nea-trans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doing things outside of traditional work channels</a> has taught me to decouple my idea of labor from concepts of capitalism, and I sometimes get frustrated with the ways they can get framed as if they are inseparable, feeling like something I appreciate about myself can only be conceived of as a character flaw or a downstream effect of The Man. But I also know that all this has a compulsive side, that there’s something I’m running from with this approach (at one point Alta expresses the fear that something bad will happen if she isn’t constantly working, and <em>whoo boy</em>), and that, especially these days, it’s doing me a lot more harm than good.</p><p>I appreciated that Alta rebelled against this too, criticizing Boro’s approach, and I appreciated that there’s never a moment when the game tells her she’s wrong or how she should think instead. But it also glides over some of the complexities; visitors to the shop include lost businessmen and an old woman ruthlessly obsessed with sales, and the game paints these characters in caricature in a way that sort of elides thornier questions. The Wanderstop cafe does not appear to need or run on money; when money is present in the game, it’s in the form of joke currency you can’t obtain. It’s a self-contained fantasy tea shop in a magical forest–not dissimilar, maybe, to a video game–but that lets it decouple work from survival in a way that lets the game explore its ideas but also makes it a little hard to pull those lessons over to the real world. Anyone who’s worked in kitchens knows it’s not terribly relaxing; anyone who’s run a business knows you have to make some kind of peace with the idea of sales and money and marketing. “A bunch of people who hate money own a business now” is a joke I sometimes hear told around worker-owned outlets, but it’s often a real stumbling block, and personally I’ve found it hard (but not <a href="https://bookkeeping.coop/events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impossible</a>) to find spaces to meaningfully wrangle with that relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For me and my relationship to work, <em>Wanderstop</em> sometimes felt a little simplistic in the way it stripped things down to focus on its core questions–not having to trim the weeds serves the idea of restfulness the game explores, but what do you do with these lessons when there are so many real and consequential weeds you’re responsible for trimming? But I can also see how my instinct to critique the game in this way is an effect of the very thing the game is wrestling with, that it echoes Alta’s tendency to shrug off all the twee advice Boro gives her because she–and I–want an excuse to keep doing what we’re doing, even when we can both see it’s not working. And here, again, is where it’s good that <em>Wanderstop</em> asks some questions and floats some ideas without being dogmatic. I’m <em>thinking</em> about it all, doing what the game wants you to; I can bring my rebellion against it to it and not feel like I didn’t “get” it, which feels like a testament to a core nuance that runs under some of its simplicity.</p><p>Maybe<em> Wanderstop</em>’s biggest Wreden-esque subversion is in not providing answers, in not giving you a self-care checklist or a post-credits scene where Alta deletes Slack from her phone and doesn’t answer emails after 5pm. How to actually work in a healthy way–what “work” is, what “healthy” is–is a hugely individual question, too big and varied to be answered by a video game. <em>Wanderstop</em> just wants you to notice your feelings and ponder your conceptions, and to give you something to do with your hands while you do.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/pirate-yakuza-hawaii-impressions-review-majima"><h3>Yakuza Can’t Have One Without The Other</h3></a><p>They did it, they finally made a bad Yakuza game</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-monster-hunter-wilds-streamlined"><h3>The New Monster Hunter Is The Most Streamlined Yet, But That’s Not Such A Bad Thing</h3></a><p>"I’ve played so many Monster Hunter games, and I don’t have time for the bullshit involved in Monster Hunter games"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Grand yet furtive robot action-adventure Steel Seed will launch on April 10th, developers <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/storm-in-teacup">Storm in a Teacup</a> and publishers ESDigital Games have announced. Not heard of Steel Seed before? You would've if I'd ever written up that demo build I played at last year's Game Developer Conference. I don't know why it's taken me this long to mention the game, given that it contains one of my favourite things in fiction: a machine the size of a world.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In Steel Seed you play Zoe, a nimble and upgradeable robot, and her flying drone acquaintance Koby. You're exploring a vast cybernetic undercity created by overclocked WALL-Es to preserve the last human survivors of a global apocalypse.</p>
<p>The overarching story is about "exploring the fine line between human and machine, trust and control, resilience and despair", but in the moment, Steel Seed is more about exploring the fine line between crouch-walk back-stabbing and open combat with electroswords and Koby's ranged attacks. Needless to say, you'll also be doing a lot of platforming: leaping to handholds, wall-running, sliding down ramps, all the classics.</p>

<p>I wasn't mesmerised by the jumpy-sneaky-slashy elements of the GDC 2024 build I played. It felt like a sturdy but essentially makeshift cobbling-together of parts from other action-adventures. I can't knock the environments, however, which consist of layer upon layer of unsleeping industrial machinery - gushing cyclopean smelters, sunset-sized reactor cores and turbiney wotsits made up of individually rotating and grippable sections.</p>
<p>The extra frisson of architectural intrigue is that Steel Seed takes a lot of inspiration from Tsutomu Nihei's Blame!, among other megacity mangas. I haven't read Blame!, so my nearest parallels are other video games - last year's superbly unaccommodating spelunking sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a>, and Ninja Theory's ageing Serkis 'em up <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west">Enslaved: Odyssey To The West</a>.</p>
<p>If you like the sounds of all this, but you're umming and erring over my indifference to the combat and stealth, the good news is that Steel Seed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/458430/Steel_Seed/">has a demo on Steam</a>. It includes the game's intro and gives you a taste of the robot-bashing and/or bamboozling ahead.

</p><p>Storm in a Teacup have form for moody sci-fi - their previous games include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/close-to-the-sun">Close To The Sun</a>, which Alice Bee (RPS in peace) found a little too Bioshlock in places but was otherwise quite pleased with. "Close To The Sun exists in a potential sweet spot for me, a mix of horror and leisurely exploration, and I enjoyed a lot of it," she <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/close-to-the-sun-review">wrote in our review</a>. "It excels at toying with you, particularly in the first half of the game, and paces itself so that you're constantly tense even when you have nothing to fear."</p>

                <p>Monster Hunter series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto has credited the story of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> as being one of the primary factors behind the Capcom game's breakout success.</p><p>Tsujimoto, who was recently promoted to become Capcom's Chief Product Officer, stated this in an interview with <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF05BK60V00C25A3000000/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nikkei</a>, a Japanese publication. <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/monster-hunter-wilds-story-driven-approach-contributed-to-its-success-says-series-producer/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a> then reported his comments, which explained that Tsujimoto believed players enjoyed how Monster Hunter Wilds emphasized its story more than previous Monster Hunter games and how its immersiveness was heightened as the game was fully voiced. He also credited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-update-will-add-a-lot-in-april/1100-6529750/" data-ref-id="1100-6529750">cross-play</a> with drawing many people to the game and getting them to stick around.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_wNFT4j6qI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a_wNFT4j6qI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched on February 28 and sold 8 million copies during its first three days on the market.

"The story does provide some context to each hunt and monster but doesn't otherwise add anything meaningful," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/" data-ref-id="1900-6418338">GameSpot's Monster Hunter Wilds review</a> states. "Though Monster Hunter has never suffered for its barebones stories, Wilds' narrative focus draws arguably too much attention to a weak tale when a less-is-more approach would suffice."</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds is available now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.
