              <p>Sonos represents the high-end tier of wireless audio, and the <strong>Move 2 portable speaker punches well above its weight in terms of sound quality</strong>, considering it’s a <strong>battery-powered mobile unit</strong>. The dual-tweeter architecture combined with the precision-tuned woofer creates a true stereo soundstage that outclasses many dedicated bookshelf speakers that cost hundreds more when the Move 2 is stationary.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5896/">$399, down from $499, this wireless powerhouse has reached a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday. The combination of audiophile-grade sound, 24-hour battery life, and portability makes this speaker phenomenal for anyone that won’t compromise audio quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5896/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Acoustic Architecture That Redefines Portable Audio</h2>
<p>The <strong>new dual tweeter setup supplants the original Move’s single tweeter</strong> configuration for a proper stereo soundstage that separates left and right channels for appropriate spatial audio presentation. What this means in terms of architecture is that vocals sit centered and defined while instruments occupy clear positions across the sound field rather than blending together in mono.</p>
<p>Delivering low frequencies with authority and control, the precision-tuned woofer provides deep bass that is physical in nature without a hint of muddiness or distortion, even at loudest volumes. The dynamic range of live recordings captures the emotional charge and energy of performances without compression, like cheaper portable speakers would do.</p>



<p>The automatic <em>Trueplay</em> feature continuously analyzes the acoustic environment of the Move 2 and <strong>adjusts output in real-time to optimize sound</strong> for wherever you place the speaker. Set it on a wood table, and the system compensates for surface reflections. Move it near a wall, and Trueplay adjusts for boundary reinforcement that can boost bass unnaturally.</p>
<p><strong>Battery performance reaches as high as 24 hours</strong> on a single charge, which represents double the runtime of the original Move despite the more powerful acoustic components. That’s long enough for an entire weekend camping, a full day at the beach, or a multi-day event without having to hunt for outlets. Efficiency improvements come courtesy of refined power management that coordinates amplification, processing, and battery draw.</p>



<p>In contrast, <strong>the IP56 rating gives serious protection against real-world conditions</strong>, not just friendly marketing splash resistance. Rain, dirt, dust, and spills will not destroy internal components or affect operation. The rating means complete dust protection and resistance to strong water jets from all directions, which, in other words, means that during beach trips, pool parties, and backyard gatherings where accidents inevitably happen, survival is assured.</p>
<p>The wireless charging base provides elegant docking which charges the speaker by simply setting it down. The upgraded design now includes a detachable power cable and a more compact adapter for easier packing during travel. The base stays at home for daily charging while USB-PD compatibility offers charging on the go with any USB Power Delivery power supply.</p>
<p>If audiophile-grade sound that travels with you anywhere is what you’re after, this record-low price offers premium portable audio without the usually associated Sonos premium.</p>

        <p>I mean if that's their MO</p>

    </div>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tower-of-fantasy">Tower of Fantasy</a>? It was one of those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>-ish gacha games, with its particular twist, so to speak, being that it's sort of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a>. I say sort of, because it's described as a shared open world, meaning you can see other players, and there are some MMO elements, but its monetisations are much more gacha like. Or, well, they are until tomorrow, November 25th, as in quite a big move developer Hotta Studio is stripping Tower of Fantasy of all of its gacha elements.
</p>
<p>
That is in one new server, anyway, <a href="https://tof.perfectworld.com/eneu/news/notice/20251121/259439.shtml">the Warp server</a>. Once there, you'll no longer need to pull for weapons and matrices (bits of gear), you can get all of that for free like by simply playing different events and "daily gameplay." With this there'll be a bit more of a traditional trade system, alongside a new in-game currency called dark crystals, where you can buy and, well, trade for resources and the like.
</p>
<p>
There'll also be a new season system! Not like the weather, like game seasons. These'll come with different progression styles and play modes, there's rewards to be earned like outfits, typical season stuff, though I'm not entirely sure if this will be a thing you pay for or not. On top of that, to make it much more like an MMO, there's some new social stuff, such as a new place called the Crew Base, a space you can just sort of hang out in with other players.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, specifics are weirdly scant, which is perhaps a misstep given how the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2064650/Tower_of_Fantasy/#app_reviews_hash">isn't exactly universally beloved right now</a>. Still, I do wonder if the old ways of gacha are on the way out. Games like Duet Night Abyss have decided to forgo them, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ananta-looks-expensive-like-a-mix-of-gta-spider-man-and-yakuza-and-a-bit-overwhelming">upcoming mashup between Spider-Man and GTA</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ananta">Ananta</a>, also <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/despite-all-appearances-upcoming-f2p-open-world-rpg-ananta-isnt-a-gacha-game-only-charging-for-cosmetics-and-furniture/">isn't going the gacha route</a>. Here's hoping more games follow that path.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/identity-protection-service-drops-70-off-for-black-friday-privacy-now-costs-almost-nothing-2000646900</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/identity-protection-service-drops-70-off-for-black-friday-privacy-now-costs-almost-nothing.1363444/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday deals are everywhere right now and most of them are pretty forgettable. Another discount on headphones you don’t need, a slightly cheaper subscription to a streaming service you already have-you know the drill. But here’s one that actually caught my attention: NordProtect, the <strong>most popular&nbsp;identity theft protection service</strong>, is running a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/">promotion that drops the price to $4.49 per month, down from the usual $14.99</a>. That’s a 70% discount, and unlike most Black Friday offers, this one addresses a problem that’s getting worse by the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<p>Here’s the thing about identity theft: it’s one of those problems that feels abstract until it happens to you. You hear about data breaches in the news, shrug, change a password or two, and move on with your life. But the numbers tell a different story: <strong>Every 22 seconds, someone in the United States falls victim to identity theft</strong>. Not every hour, not every few minutes-every 22 seconds. The FTC reported that over 1.1 million people filed identity theft cases in 2024, and last year alone, fraud cost consumers more than $12.5 billion, which is a 25% jump from the year before.</p>
<h2>Same Owner as NordVPN</h2>
<p>NordProtect comes from Nord Security, the same company making <em>NordVPN</em> and <em>NordPass</em> which means they are definitely not new in the security game. What they’ve done here is to create a service that handles all the tedious, anxiety-inducing work of keeping your identity safe-so you don’t have to be thinking about it every waking moment of your life.</p>
<p>It <strong>monitors credit reports from all three major bureaus</strong>, watches bank accounts for weird transactions and even actively scans the dark web for your personal information. That last one is of particular note since the dark web is basically the marketplace where stolen data gets traded around and if your info pops up, you want to know about it immediately. You can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/nordvpn/nordprotect">check out Gizmodo’s review of the service</a> for more details on how it performs in real-world usage.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2000646904" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646904"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646904">© NordProtect</figcaption></figure>
<p>The monitoring is only the beginning: What makes NordProtect practical is the fact that it doesn’t just tell you something bad happened –<strong> it tells you what to do about it</strong>. When your data shows up in some breach or suspicious activity gets flagged, you get an alert with concrete, actionable steps to take. No vague warnings that leave you Googling <em>“what to do if my email was in a data breach”</em> in the middle of the night.</p>
<h2>Up To $1 Million In Coverage</h2>
<p>Let’s say monitoring fails and you actually become a victim of identity theft. This is where things start to get costly and time-consuming for most people: hours on the phone with banks, credit card companies, credit bureaus, possibly law enforcement. You may want a lawyer. You may miss out on wages while taking time off work to sort it all out. <strong>NordProtect includes up to $1 million in coverage</strong> for eligible recovery costs-which means attorney fees, lost wages, and other expenses that come with cleaning up the mess. There’s also fraud insurance:<strong> as much as $50,000 for online threats or blackmail situations</strong>, and as much as $10,000 if someone actually steals money from your bank or credit card through an online scam.</p>
<p>But what really sets this apart from those credit monitoring services that send you reports is that you get an assigned case manager-not a phone tree, not a chatbot, but a real, live person based in the United States available any time of day or night. And if identity theft does strike, this person becomes your advocate. They’ll do the paperwork, communicate with financial institutions and credit agencies, make sure deadlines aren’t missed, and generally cut through the red tape on your behalf.</p>
<p>The truth is that most of us are walking around with a dozen potential vulnerabilities. We shop online, we use public WiFi, we have accounts on websites that may or may not have great security practices. Each one of those is a potential entry point for someone looking to steal your information. You can’t eliminate the risk entirely-that would require living off the grid-but you can set up a system that catches problems early and helps you fix them quickly.</p>
<p>At $4.49 per month with this Black Friday deal, NordProtect costs less than a single lunch. The service includes a <strong>30-day money-back guarantee</strong> if you decide it’s not for you, so there’s room to test it out. Given that the average identity theft victim spends months recovering and often thousands of dollars in the process, having this kind of safety net feels less like a luxury and more like basic maintenance.</p>

<p>Last Letter is a wordplay-based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-blade-x-zombies-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that shares the same environmental design as the prominent shooter title Rivals. The gameplay depends entirely on your knowledge of words and the overall English lexicon. While this can be a strong way to win, you’ll also need Styles. Styles are in-game features that provide users with special abilities that can be used mid-game or strategically, especially when you’re losing. Redeem the active Last Letter codes to fill your treasury with free Spins. Use these Spins to obtain the best Styles and get a red-hot winning streak.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assetto-corsa-rally-is-here-to-keep-me-humble.1363438/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>From<a href="https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5/"> <em><u>Europa Universalis V</u></em></a> to<a href="https://aftermath.site/tavern-keeper-review-impressions-pc-game/"> <em><u>Tavern Keeper</u></em></a>, I've spent much of 2025 playing games whose difficulty options were so comprehensive that I could tailor them <em>precisely </em>to my preferred style and level of ability.</p><p>That kind of accommodation is normally welcome. But also: sometimes you just need to get your ass kicked. To remind you of your place, to remind you that no matter how much of a cakewalk you can try to make things, your life is not easy, and that sometimes the only way to make yourself better, and to make you feel better about the resulting self-improvement, is to overcome challenges.</p><p>For many of you reading this, that might be why you play a <a href="https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hard-difficulty/"><em><u>Souls</u></em></a> game, or something like <a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-problems-runback-criticism/"><em><u>Silksong</u></em></a>. For me, someone who can't stand either of those, it's why I spent last week playing <em>Assetto Corsa Rally</em>, a very serious car game instead.</p><p>Like the original <em>Assetto Corsa</em>, a track-racing game released over a decade ago, <em>Assetto Corsa Rally</em> is not fucking around. This is not <em>Art of Rally</em>, it's not <em>Sega Rally</em>, it's not <em>Colin McRae</em>, it's not even <em>Dirt</em>. This is a video game whose sole aim is to simulate the experience of driving a fast racing car on a loose dirt track as realistically as possible, and if that's brutally difficult to do in real life, then it's going to be brutally difficult to do here.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iKsSRLyb83o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Assetto Corsa Rally - Official Early Access Launch Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>To give you an idea how serious it is, I, a fairly avid racing game fan, booted the game up last week, picked a free practice session, selected a classic Lancia and tore off from the start line. I crashed into a tree on the first corner. And the second. Then I made it through a few corners before spinning off down a hill. Before I'd got even halfway through the course--in practice mode--half my car was missing and I was getting warnings saying I'd respawned too often.</p><p>OK, I figured, there's learning the ropes and there's getting your ass kicked, so maybe I'll just go into the options and turn on some driver assists, maybe disable some of the more punishing physics. Upon which I discovered, to my horror, that all the assists already <em>were</em> on. I was already in the baby training wheels mode, and I couldn't even play <em>that</em>.</p><p>Which for a second made me want to uninstall the game immediately in disgust, but after two more seconds made me smile like a sicko and decide to get to work. So I went back to the main menu, chose a more forgiving (read: modern) car, jumped back into practice mode and took things a bit more seriously. I stopped trying to drive at top speed the entire time, because learning the car's handling and the track layout was more important. I eased into corners instead of flying into them to gauge just how far I could sling this car at speed, and I started feathering the accelerator on straights instead of flooring it, because I (correctly) figured it was more important to make it through a stretch of road staying on the track than blasting 80% of the way down it before going sideways into a wall.</p><p>All of which sounds a bit boring, but you've gotta remember that a) this game looks fucking <em>incredible </em>on my <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-buy-prebuilt-pcs-now-and-have-finally-found-peace/"><u>new PC</u></a>, regardless of the speed or my success and b) because <em>Assetto Corsa Rally</em> is such a serious simulation, recreating the thrills and perils of driving a fast car so meticulously, that it's almost as fun to crash and burn as it is to clock a good time, because all the driving in this game is fun, whether it's being done well or not.</p><figure><figcaption><span>I wanted to check in with some experts--since I only dabble in racing games, I don't LIVE them--and...turns out the enthusiasts are very into this as well</span></figcaption></figure><p>I said above I'm not into <em>Souls </em>or <em>Silksong</em>, so why skip a challenge there and not here? I think it's because driving a car isn't some abstract concept to me. It's something I do every day, which I enjoy doing, and so unlike some unfamiliar idea or control scheme where what I'm doing to a controller (pressing a button) looks nothing like what I'm doing in the game (swinging a sword), in <em>ACR </em>I'm doing exactly what I already know how to do and do all the time. I just need to do it a bit faster, and on worse roads, and in fancier cars, and so the prospect of dragging my current skill level (driving to work without crashing) to the point where I'm winning races is one I'm <em>very </em>into.</p><p>So I appreciate the skill check, <em>Assetto Corsa Rally</em>. I've been getting soft playing all these cushy management games lately. It's time to let something kick my ass and get me into shape. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Walt Disney Imagineering—the research and development arm of the Disney parks—will debut a new robot in its Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong parks. </span><i><span>Frozen</span></i><span> fans will certainly be excited to see Olaf the snowman stumbling around the World of Frozen area of Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland early next year, but those of us who have always found the icy sidekick unnerving will not be pleased.</span></p> <p><span>Disney’s dedicated an entire episode to Olaf and its history of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoPN02bmzrE"><span>robots on its Walt Disney Imagineering YouTube channel</span></a><span>. Olaf was created inside Disney Research’s Zurich, and is decidedly smaller than the </span><a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/entertainment/hollywood-studios/character-meet-olaf-frozen/"><span>Olaf’s human-sized character</span></a><span> that goes to Disney meet and greets. He appears to be just under hip height. It seems like he’ll be wandering Disney aimlessly, cursing parkgoers with his unhinged laugh.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Our latest Olaf is a fantastic example of representing an animated character as authentically as possible in the physical world—a challenging task because animated characters most often move in non-physical ways,” Kyle Laughlin, senior vice president of Walt Disney Imagineering Research &amp; Development, </span><a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/olaf-robotic-character/"><span>said in a news release</span></a><span>. “For example, to make Olaf’s snowball feet move along his body, we paired state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning with an artistic interface and advances in mechanical design.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Because Olaf is an animated character—and not inherently a robot, like Star Wars droids—Disney had to make “fundamental additions to our reinforcement learning framework to boost the believability of the character by enabling motion at the limit of hardware,” Laughlin said. So, for instance, Olaf’s body is softer, like snow, and you can pull off his nose.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Disney engineers in the video said they used reinforcement learning techniques to teach robots like Olaf and other droids how to act like their characters by ‘watching” artist-made animations. They’ve been through a bunch of iterations throughout the years, starting with a small, humanoid robot that’s shown in the YouTube channel being tripped by a stick. The BDX droids are featured heavily in the episode, too, showcasing how Disney made them more autonomous. They’ve got “eyes” and “ears” to compute what’s going on in the world using AI. So, for instance, if a person kneels down in front of a droid, it’ll move its head to look at the person directly. If they stand up, the droid looks up. It also shows the engineers “choreographing” a performance between three droids that gets recorded to be “played back” as a performance at the parks. And they do that by controlling the droids with what looks like Steam Decks. It’s described as “building blocks for the autonomous show.”</span></p> <p><span>Olaf is the next progression of Disney’s robots, but Disney isn’t clear how Olaf will work—whether it’ll need to be partly controlled by a human or not. The “self” in “self-walking robot” seems to imply that it’ll do a lot of the work itself, though.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you want to earn an easy $2,500, you’d better step up and identify who it was that protested Valve’s ‘censorship’ of Gamdom’s branding at the StarLadder Budapest Major. Hours ago, footage surfaced online of protestors wielding ‘f*** Valve’ signs and demanding that the company reinstate Imperial’s new logo sticker, which featured Gamdom branding.</p>



<p>The group wore t-shirts that identified them as Gamdom representatives, but the casino’s founder came out on social media to suggest it was an act of sabotage by a competitor, and promised $2,500 for information leading to the identification of the wrongdoers.</p>



<h2 id="h-and-it-s-only-the-first-stage">And It’s Only The First Stage</h2>



<p>Images and videos surfaced online showing six protestors at the StarLadder Budapest Major, a $1.25 million Counter-Strike 2 tournament. These protestors wore shirts that spelled ‘Modmag’, which is Gamdom backwards, and they were there to ‘protest’ the recent change by Valve that removed a gambling reference from Imperial Esports’ sticker.</p>



<p>As if it wasn’t bad enough that the event had already been hit with audio issues and the incorrect lining up of highlight clips by the stream’s editors.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip from a channel on social media:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>😒 Another ""riot"" accident on CS Major grounds — this time the casino behind the Imperial team hired protestors with "FUCK VALVE" signs.  </p><p>Valve recently reverted the Imperial logo to the old one, as their current logo is a casino one.   </p><p>The video is blurred for ethical… <a href="https://t.co/pctUq85vwy">pic.twitter.com/pctUq85vwy</a></p></div>— CS2 NEWS (@CS2News_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/CS2News_EN/status/1992940298142363935?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In a shocking response, the founder of Gamdom, <strong>Felix Römer</strong>, commented under the post declaring the protest an act of sabotage by a competing casino.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/GamdomHowly/status/1992952514124411390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">He wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is NOT Gamdom or Imperial “protesting” This is an effort to sabotage us more by a competitor Paying a $2.5k bounty per person that is identified here holding up the signs, we are going to take legal action, this bs doesn’t belong to the majors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, fans of the Counter-Strike scene were quick to pick apart <strong>Römer</strong>, suggesting that it’s <strong>his company </strong>that doesn’t belong in the competitive gaming scene.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Riftbound, the League of Legends physical trading card game, has had its Origins set go live worldwide. Now, Riot Games is looking towards its second set, Spiritforged; and <em>Game Informer</em> was offered the opportunity to reveal one of its upcoming Champion cards.</p><p>Surprisingly, our chosen card wound up being one familiar to both myself and fellow Video Editor Alex Van Aken. Jax is, in League of Legends, a potential menace in the top lane. As the last weaponmaster of Icathia, he wields a lamp as his chosen implement, leaping around the battlefield and smacking foes left and right. His Champion card Jax, Unrelenting reflects his particular proclivity for weaponry.</p><p>Jax, Unrelenting is Jax's Body (aka Orange) Champion Unit, standing at 3 Might for 4 and one Body Rune. The real eye-catching text is in the bonus text, however. Jax's Weaponmaster ability allows you to Equip an existing piece of Equipment on the field to Jax for one Rune less, even if it's already attached. This makes upcoming Equipment pieces like the Long Sword a free Equip-on-entry for Jax, The Unrelenting.</p><p>The second slice of text says that when you attach an Equipment to Jax, Unrelenting, you may pay 1 to draw 1. Card draw can be a very powerful advantage in card games. This version of Jax means you're drawing deeper into your deck, finding more options, and making use of those odd bits of floating, untapped Rune power.</p><p>Jax's associated Legend, <a href="https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/card-gallery/#card-gallery--sfd-193-221">Grandmaster at Arms</a>, makes it easy to attach and detach Equipment as well. It seems like Jax is the Legend to go after if you want to lean into Spiritforged's introduction of Equipment. Get some early pieces on the board, fight and tussle, and then play Jax, Unrelenting to vacuum up some equipment for card draw and a giant push. I don't think anyone will want a piece of the champ after that.</p><p>The next Riftbound set Spiritforged is currently set for February 2026 in English, and December 2025 for China. Go check out the other cards being announced and revealed during this preview season <a href="https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/announcements/spiritforged-preview-season/">over here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/11/24/exclusive-riftbound-spiritforged-card-reveal-jax-unrelenting]]></content:encoded>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/what-my-video-game-family-is-bringing-to-thanksgiving-1845758556">Thanksgiving</a> is later this week in the United States. Loads of people are going to be traveling across the country to visit family members, some of whom they like, while eating food and cursing the fact that they have to do this all over again in like three weeks for Christmas. But who cares about all that? We are here to discuss the star of Thanksgiving: The food.</p> <p>What makes a perfect <a href="https://kotaku.com/public-school-thanksgiving-feast-the-kotaku-review-1820327714">Thanksgiving plate</a>? It’s a question that will likely get a lot of different answers, and all of them will be wrong unless they happen to match your perfect platter of tasty treats.</p> <p>For me, I have to have turkey at Thanksgiving. It’s the only time of the year when I’m willing to put the effort into prepping, cooking, and then carving up a giant turkey. And no, turkey isn’t dry or flavorless; you’ve just likely had some poorly cooked turkey. I’ve had turkey that was succulent and packed with flavor. The key is to brine, shield the white meat, and don’t overcook that thing or shove stuffing in it.</p>

 <p>Beyond a few big slices of turkey on my plate, I also have to have fluffy, garlic-y mashed potatoes, sweet corn, steamed but still crunchy broccoli (no cheese!), some stuffing that wasn’t cooked in a turkey, and a few Hawaiian sweet rolls. No gravy needed. Salad optional. It’s Thanksgiving. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bobs-burgers-thanksgiving-episodes-list-ranked-best-1851709655">I’m here to load up on carbs and collapse in front of a TV</a>.</p> <p>But that’s <em>my</em> perfect plate. What are you serving or hoping to be served on Thanksgiving? Let us know in the comments below! We’ll then be back later this week with a follow-up post sharing some of your answers.</p>

            <p>
Look, I have my fair share of problems with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a>, but to give credit where credit is due, after announcing their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">foray into publishing</a> earlier this year, they've lined up a suite of games. Dead Take, a psychological horror complete with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Neil Newbon and Final Fantasy 16's Ben Starr, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-take-is-an-fmv-horror-with-midsomer-murders-ben-starr-and-casualtys-neil-newbon">launched earlier this year</a>, Truckful just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-evil-ghost-lorry-in-truckfuls-demo-nearly-ate-me-and-the-lady-who-did-a-headstand-in-my-bed">looks like a delight</a>, and now there's Vision Quench, a game for freaks like me who like it when fantasy gets a bit techy.
</p>
<p>
How do I begin to explain Vision Quench? In genre terms, it describes itself as an "online co-op dark fantasy looter shooter," but I never think genres are a great selling point. The about section is a bit more tantalising. You find yourself in a place called the Green Tower, which you must climb to get the Sweepstakes Code. Along the way, you'll need to collect various cursed commodities to perform "the ritual," or alternatively consume them to gain certain abilities.
</p>
<p>
The whole setting is suitably fantastical, and modern at the same time. The setting is appropriately dungeon, but there are computers where "dark mining used for dark rituals" take place, toilets, soda pop cans, ventilation systems, vending machines, all of this amongst hand-monsters and evil rats and other mysteries.
</p>
<p>
Aesthetically, the game reminds me of renders from fantasy games you might find in magazines from the '90s, there's a colourful fuzz to it that's hard to pinpoint elsewhere. Your character can wear a bucket for a helmet while wearing a camo top, high-vis trousers, and what I think are Crocs, all while another friend has donned a knights' helm with a pistol in hand. It is fantasy by way of four friends mucking about in a digital realm they may or may not have hacked, and it is greatly appealing to me.
</p>
<p>
That is four friends to be precise, this is one of those kinds of games that I still don't know what to refer to as, but if I reference <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> or Peak you know what I mean.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there's no release date attached to Vision Quench just yet, but it should be releasing sometime in 2026. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3488690/Vision_Quench/">wishlist it on Steam</a> now.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-we-know-about-playboi-carti-fortnite-skin.1363390/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nothing is off the table for Fortnite anymore, so when it’s rumored that a Playboi Carti Fortnite skin could be added to the in-game store, it’s believable. Here’s the latest on the Playboi Carti Fortnite Skin leak, if it’s true, and more.</p>



<p><em>Another </em>small-fry name has been outed for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-chapter-6-finale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>: A small-time rapper with nearly 50 million followers on Spotify, number one albums, and a bunch of other successes. Obvious banter aside, Playboi Carti has established themself as one of the most prominent and mainstream rap artists on the planet.</p>



<p>What could be bigger than Playboi Carti? Why, a collaboration between Fortnite and Playboi Carti. Let’s see if it’s true.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-playboi-carti-coming-to-fortnite">Is Playboi Carti Coming To Fortnite?</h2>

<p><strong>Multiple leaks indicated that Playboi Carti was indeed on the way to Fortnite with at least one skin as part of a unique crossover, and then the rapper themself seemed to confirm the collab on Instagram.</strong></p>



<p>Usual leaker Shiina was one of many to suggest a Playboi Carti skin was coming at the very least. The official Playboi Carti Instagram posted a very interesting image to the rapper’s story to bolster the claim.</p>



<p>It’s a very simple and obvious clue: <strong>A giant Fortnite logo</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unless this is either a giant coincidence or evil trolling, it’s safe to assume that Playboi Carti is coming to the live-service shooter in one form or another.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-playboi-carti-content-will-be-included-in-fortnite">Which Playboi Carti Content Will Be Included In Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>The Playboi Carti content isn’t official, but leaks indicate that the game is receiving at least one Playboi Carti skin, and perhaps even a special in-game event to go with it.</strong></p>



<p>Happy Power thinks a skin is a guarantee, and says the content: “Will feature the ‘Evil Jordan’ outfit as well. </p>



<p>The attire in question relates to Playboi Carti’s song Evil Jordan, where the singer has a Batman/demon-esuqe head garment, with a red bandana and other eye-catching qualities.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Kurrco has gone one better and claimed an ‘In-game event’ is also planned.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Until anything is official, take any information with a pinch of salt. But it would be another in the never-ending conveyor belt of crossovers and special skins if it happens.</p>



<p>Where would a Playboi Carti bundle or special items rank on your wanted list? Is Epic and Fortnite’s pulling power officially unlimited?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Activision and Treyarch have <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-zombies-season-01#Multiplayer-Content">revealed the Season 1 roadmap</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which includes a slew of new content for players to dig into as the game gets going and tries to find its footing. It's "<em>the biggest Season 1 ever</em>," according to Activision, with multiple new weapons, several new maps for multiplayer and zombie game modes, and more.</p>



<p>While the focus is obviously on the new additions to the multiplayer and the zombies mode, there's also new content for its PvE Endgame mode, if you're still looking for something to do <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/">after completing the game's campaign</a>. There are four new Endgame events, eight new Exotic Skills to earn, and a new holiday-themed event coming down the pipeline.</p>



<p>Regarding the additions to multiplayer, three brand new maps are available right at the start of Season 1: Fate, Utopia, and Odysseus, and a fourth remastered version of Standoff to kick off the season. Mid-season, the new Yakei map joins the lineup along with the remastered Meltdown. Lastly, Fringe joins the map lineup before the end of the season.</p>



<p>Activision and Treyarch also released a new trailer showcasing what's coming in the season, which you can check out below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Season 01 Launch Trailer | Call of Duty: Black Ops 7" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5cb1bPaSV6I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>There are also new game modes getting added in this season, including favourites like Prop Hunt and Gun Game. One in the Chamber, Sharpshooter, and Sticks &amp; Stones are also joining in Season 1, with a holiday-themed limited-time Takeover mode getting introduced towards the end of the year. There's also seven new weapons joining the fray for players to grind.</p>



<p>Zombies players can look forward to a new Astra Malorum map and the continuation of the storyline, a new survival map called Exit 115, new traps, and a bevy of returning upgrades and loot from previous Zombies modes. </p>

<p>Black Ops 7 has been out for a little more than a week at the time of this writing, and while it was able to chart towards the top-end of reported sales charts so far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/">it's still majorly behind the year's other major shooter, Battlefield 6</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, it's too early to really count Call of Duty out, and we could still end 2025 with it being the best-selling game of the year if it's able to pick up the pace. We'll see where things land in January when we have the final full-year results for 2025. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games hosted their Riftbound PAX Unplugged panel this past weekend. Taking full advantage of the venue of one of the largest tabletop conventions in the business, the studio laid out a roadmap for their bestselling <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Riftbound</em> PAX Unplugged Panel Announcements</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/announcements/recap-of-our-pax-unplugged-panel/" rel="nofollow">recap post</a> on Riot Games' website, the studio recounts everything announced at the Riftbound PAX Unplugged panel.&nbsp; The post opens by reiterating new Champions and mechanics coming in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/riot-games-releases-riftbound-spiritforged-preview-confirming-new-mechanics-for" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Riftbound: Spiritforged</em></a> set. This includes familiar faces like Draven, Rumble, and Fiora and new mechanics like Gold and Repeat.</p>

This includes new mechanics like Quick-Draw, which lets you play equipment as a reaction and attach it to a unit you control, and Weaponmaster, which lets you equip iconic characters with their signature weapons at a discount.</p>

<p>For collectors out there, the <em>Riftbound</em> PAX Unplugged panel confirms the Spiritforged set will include 30 Overnumbered cards with 12 signature variants. In addition, local game store events will include special Nexus Night promo cards. This was in response to the game's initial release running out of Nexus Night cards too quickly. Hopefully, it doesn't happen again for this new set.</p>

<p>The panel briefly switched to discussing the competitive scene of <em>Riftbound</em>. It did confirm the first Regional Qualifiers will be taking place in 2025 in Houston, and in 2026 in Bologna Italy and Las Vegas, USA, respectively. The panel's roadmap also confirms Qualifier events will also be happening in Europe, Australia, and PAX East.</p>

No other information was provided, except for some promotional artwork. <em>Unleashed</em> does put the steampunk boxer, and Arcane star, Vi, center stage. As for what surprises are contained within the set, that remains to be seen.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-everything-to-know-about-valves-new-system/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-machine%E2%80%94everything-to-know-about-valve%E2%80%99s-new-system.1363357/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After months of rumor and speculation, Valve revealed its new Steam Machine console in November 2025, to the surprise of many. The announcement wasn’t advertised and, aside from some insiders, wasn’t expected. But then it happened, a new Steam Machine revealed nearly 10 years to the day of the release of Valve’s first attempt at the living room console space.</p>



<p>Valve’s newest piece of hardware—aside from the Steam Controller and Steam Frame VR Headset—is aiming to bring PC gaming to the living</p>



<p>Ahead of its release in 2026, there’s plenty to learn about the Steam Machine. That’s why Insider Gaming has put together a one-stop shop of information with everything you need to know about the Steam Machine. This page will be updated regularly as any news breaks, so bookmark it and check back often for the latest.</p>







<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-everything-we-know-about-the-steam-machine">Everything We Know About The Steam Machine</h2>



<p>The Steam Machine was <strong>announced on November 12, 2025</strong>, as part of a major announcement of the latest Valve hardware. In addition to the affectionately named “Gabecube”, Valve revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-announces-the-steam-frame-vr-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Frame VR Headset</a> and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-controller-2-announced-by-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second Steam Controller</a>. </p>



<h3>Steam Machine Release Date</h3>



<p>When the console was announced in November, Valve said that the Steam Machine would release in early 2026. As of writing, Valve still hasn’t confirmed an official release date. If you want to narrow down a window, it’s expected to launch by April 2026.</p>



<p>More details on a release date are expected to come after the start of the new year. That’s also when you’ll be able to find out where you can buy a Steam Machine for yourself. </p>



<h3>How Much Will The Steam Machine Cost?</h3>



<p>Like the release date, Valve has yet to reveal the price of the Steam Machine. What’s happened since the announcement, though, has been plenty of speculation. </p>



<p>Many fans believed that it would be priced like a traditional video game console. However, Valve has confirmed that it will, instead, be priced as PC because, as you’ll see later on, it is a fully functional computer. </p>



<p>When it releases, there will be two Steam Machine models to choose from: 512GB and 2TB. There will also be an option to buy a bundle that includes the Steam Controller. </p>



<p>That means a variety of prices will be available. There will be one price for the 512GB version of the Steam Machine and a different, more expensive price, for the 2TB. There will also be separate prices for the bundles with the new Steam Controller.</p>







<h3>What Are The Steam Machine Specs?</h3>



<p>When the Steam Machine was announced, the first thing everyone wanted to know was how powerful will it be. Based on the confirmed specs, it is being targeted to compare to most entry level gaming PCs.</p>



<p>Valve says that the system can support 4K 60FPS gaming when using AMD FSR. If you are just looking for 1080P gaming, you should have no problem reaching those numbers on higher settings.</p>



<p>The Steam Machine will feature an Arch-based SteamOS 3 but can support other operating systems if desired. It includes 16GB DDR5 RAM, an internal power supply, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. Where some might be disappointed is the fact that it’s video outputs are DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0. The older technology could limit quality in the coming years as opposed to just including HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.0 or 2.1.</p>



<p>You can check out full details on what’s inside the Steam Machine below.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Spec</th><th>Details</th></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Semi-custom AMD Zen 4 6C / 12T<br>Up to 4.8 GHz, 30 W TDP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>Semi-custom AMD RDNA3 28 CUs<br>2.45 GHz max sustained clock, 110 W TDP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>16 GB DDR5 + 8 GB GDDR6 VRAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Power</strong></td><td>Internal power supply (AC 110-240 V)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>Two models:<br>• 512 GB NVMe SSD<br>• 2 TB NVMe SSD<br>Both include a high-speed microSD card slot</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Wi-Fi</strong></td><td>2×2 Wi-Fi 6E</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bluetooth</strong></td><td>Bluetooth 5.3 with dedicated antenna</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Steam Controller</strong></td><td>Integrated 2.4 GHz Steam Controller wireless adapter</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Displays</strong></td><td>DisplayPort 1.4: Up to 4 K @ 240 Hz or 8 K @ 60 Hz / HDR, FreeSync, daisy-chain support<br>HDMI 2.0: Up to 4 K @ 120 Hz / HDR, FreeSync, CEC support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>USB Ports</strong></td><td>Front: 2 × USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports<br>Back: 2 × USB-A 2.0 (high speed) + 1 × USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Networking</strong></td><td>Gigabit Ethernet</td></tr><tr><td><strong>LED Strip</strong></td><td>17 individually addressable RGB LEDs (for status and custom lighting)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size &amp; Weight</strong></td><td>Size: 152 mm tall (148 mm without feet) × 162.4 mm deep × 156 mm wide<br>Weight: 2.6 kg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Operating System</strong></td><td>SteamOS 3 (Arch-based)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Desktop Environment</strong></td><td>KDE Plasma</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3>Steam Machine General Features</h3>



<p>The Steam Machine is a uniquely designed system that looks like nothing Valve has ever released. As mentioned, it’s a PC in a box that’s designed to make it easier to quickly play your PC games on your TV.</p>



<p>Size wise, it’s just under 6″ tall, about 6.3″ deep, and just over 6″ wide. Its small size should allow it to fit discretely in more entertainment centers. There is a large fan on the back aimed at keeping the internal power supply and other components cool at all times, and that’s kind of what the box is designed around.</p>



<p>On the back there are two USB-A 2.0 ports and a USB-C 3.2 Gen 3 port to go along with video outputs, ethernet, and power connector. The front of the box includes two USB-A 3.2 ports, a microSD slot, power button, and indicator LED. There are also two features on the front to give the Steam Machine a unique look.</p>



<p>First, the system allows swappable faceplates similar to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-selling-xbox-360-games-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox 360</a>. The plate is magnetic for easy removal, and there’s sure to be a number of third-party designs available when the system releases. For those who want to make their own, Valve is planning on making 3D files available as well. </p>



<p>Under the faceplate is a customizable LED strip that will let you change colors and animations for things like download progress, console updates, errors, and more. </p>

The lineup of 24 main tracks and 15 Crossworld tracks is the best designed selection we've ever gotten in any Sonic racing game, and there is a generationally great soundtrack to accompany them.

That’s a killer deal on a game about which the very same Jada Griffin, in her <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-superstars-review">review</a>, said, “Most Sonic games put the pedal to the metal, having you travel at blindingly fast speeds while avoiding hazards on your way to the goal. Unlike its predecessors, however, Sonic Superstars trades that traditional breakneck pace for new abilities, more exploration, multiple mini-games, and slightly more challenging bosses. Most of that stylistic shift works well for the majority of Superstars’ roughly 15-hour multi-campaign story.”</p></div><p id="sonic-x-shadow-generations"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sonic X Shadow Generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</h2></p><div catalogid="c03dea71-f833-49ee-b6ce-536ef4f193be" id="231686"><div id="231686" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic X Shadow Generations (Switch 2, Switch, PS5, XSX)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to those, you can pick up the excellent 2024 game Sonic X Shadow Generations for the new all-time low price of $24.99 at <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6kZg?object_uuid=6c202e83-fe55-40f3-a997-cfcf194f667b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>. That’s for all consoles, including Switch 2. This game is comprised of two parts. One is a remake of the 2011 game Sonic Generations, and the other is a brand-new Shadow-centered addition.

<p>Reported on by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-maintenance-schedule-november-23-2025/">Nintendo Everything</a>, the Nintendo 3DS's available network services will be down between <strong>3pm PST to 4:30pm PST today, 24th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, that might sound a little confusing given that online servers for the 3DS and Wii U <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/its-over-nintendo-shuts-down-online-servers-for-3ds-and-wii-u">shut down over a year ago</a>. But many people still play their 3DS's, and you can redownload games off of the eShop on the system.</p><div><figure data-videoid="rsFcYrj6oHY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytrsFcYrj6oHY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f132mposnh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>So any maintenance that takes place today is likely just to iron out a few kinks Nintendo discovered. For when this takes place in your timezone, here's a handy list (expect it to run about 1hr 30mins)</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 3pm PST / 4pm MST / 5pm CST / 6pm EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 11pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 12am (Tue) CET / 1am (Tue) EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 8am (Tue) JST / 7am (Tue) AWST / 10am (Tue) AEDT</li></ul>

<figure data-uuid="d933541ab6046"><a title="Nintendo 3DS Maintenance" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d933541ab6046/nintendo-3ds-maintenance.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/netinfo/en_US/index.html">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Will that stop people worrying? Probably not, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3dspiracy/comments/1p55v9v/3ds_maintenance_tomorrow_should_we_worry/">evidenced on Reddit</a>. Nintendo isn't going to just pull the plug without saying anything. Plus, the Big N performed maintenance on Nintendo Network ID as recently as October. The company is always doing <em>something</em> with older software.</p>
<p>Essentially, this is business as usual. You probably just won't be able to download 3DS games for a couple of hours.</p>

            <p>
TimeSplitters is one of those weird series that I look back on quite fondly despite never having owned a single one of the games as a wistful youth. I think I've got one kicking around somewhere these days, but back then the only way I would play it was at a friend's house, us messing about, not doing a very good job at co-op in the main story, me failing to beat my friend in multiplayer because I was crap at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooting</a> games. And now, here we are, with a fanmade rework that's been 13 years in the making finally released, offering unto me a chance to relish in some nostalgia, but New.
</p>
<p>
If you've not heard about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters-rewind">TimeSplitters: Rewind</a> before, it's a fan project that's sort of a remake, sort of a best of compilation of the various games' maps, modes, challenges, and story bits. As the website puts it, it's "not a traditional remake in that there aren't 3 separate executables, it is one game that, as closely as possible, captures the spirit of the 3 games in one. So, unlike a traditional HD collection or remake, it is its own title."
</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzWSrgQ3eMI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
Admittedly I do think the project has that look about it that many remakes do, like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crash-bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a> remakes for example, where in an effort to look modern, they lose a bit of atmosphere. At the same time, I like how crunchy the gameplay looks. Punchy shooting, punchy punches, a lot of goofiness about it that you'd expect from such a series. Plus it does deserve some commendation for actually existing as a thing you can just have for free. And the team did apologise for the wait too on the game's website; "Sorry it's taken us so long. We've only been making the largest free content video game ever."
</p><p>
It should be noted that this is just an early access release, so don't expect it to be feature complete just yet. There's a bunch of maps and arcade modes, a whole load of weapons and challenges, and you can play the entirety of the first game in co-op as it stands. It looks real neat honestly! And if you're interested, you can <a href="https://www.timesplittersrewind.com/">head to its website</a> to download the early access release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s that time of the year again, right before Thanksgiving, when stores and online retailers treat Black Friday as a weeks-long event and not a single day of the year. Strange, but hey, it leads to a lot of great deals, so I’m not complaining.</p> <p>Sony is getting in on the early action with a massive digital PSN store Black Friday sale consisting of a mix of first and third-party PlayStation 5 games, ranging from newer releases, like this year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852"><em>Death Stranding 2,</em></a> to older hits like <em>The Last of Us </em>and <em>Spider-Man.</em> <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/99d2af65-6386-4f11-a1f9-94d1e9c84063/1">This big Black Friday PSN sale goes from now until December 1.</a> So buy some games for yourselves and enjoy them. You deserve it. 2025 was a mess.</p>

 <p>I’ve also highlighted some great deals on non-exclusive PS5 games. <em>Battlefield 6</em> currently has its hooks in me so deep that I might have to uninstall it to actually play other stuff. <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> is great, but not a huge open-world zombie game that is easily worth $48. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is probably my favorite game in the franchise since <em>Origins</em>, and at under $50, it’s a steal. For folks looking for some creepy scares over holiday break, <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>and <em>Silent Hill f</em> might just be what you’re looking for, and both are fantastic.

              <p>At its best, <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-phyre-patience-2000643607"><i>Bloodlines 2</i> can be a good time</a>, especially when you just focus on the compelling story and writing. It can even be a fun vampire power fantasy from time to time. It has its charm in places, sure, but it almost never earns its name or identity as the sequel to the 2004 cult-hit <i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</i>. Turns out, its developer agrees: It never should’ve been named <i>Bloodlines 2</i>.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-phyre-patience-2000643607"><i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</i> Was So Close To Being Something Special</a></p> <p>Dan Pinchbeck, co-founder of The Chinese Room and writer of <i>Bloodlines 2</i>’s story, recently spoke about the early days of taking over <i>Bloodlines 2</i> with Cat Burton on <i>The Goth Boss Podcast</i> (<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/interview-chinese-room-paradox">h/t <i>PCGamesN</i></a>), saying that while he was eager to create a game set in <i>Vampire: The Masquerade</i>, he didn’t just want to drag previous developer Hardsuit Lab’s work across the finish line. And he most certainly didn’t want to call it <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. He told Burton:</p>

 <blockquote><p>We would sit there and go and have these planning sessions on ‘how do we get [Paradox] to not call it <i>Bloodlines 2</i>?’ That feels like the most important thing that we can do here, is come at this and say ‘this isn’t <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, you can’t make it <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. There’s not enough time and there’s not enough money.’</p></blockquote> <p>Pinchbeck would leave The Chinese Room in 2023, shortly after the team took on the <i>Bloodlines 2</i> project.</p>  <h2>Would a name change have made that much of a difference?</h2> <p>“No one would be happy,” Pinchbeck said about trying to deliver a more direct sequel, something truer to the original <i>Bloodlines</i>’ RPG spirit. “We sort of approached it from [the] point of view of ‘what <i>can</i> we do with the time and the money that’s available?’” he said, “we can’t make <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, we can’t make <i>Skyrim</i>, but we can make <i>Dishonored</i>.”</p>

 <p>It’s hard not to play <i>Bloodlines 2</i> and feel the <i>Dishonored </i>inspiration. Though you do explore an open world, it’s tiny; and while scripted dialogue scenes in the final product are often excellent, <i>Bloodlines 2</i> hardly has the kinds of character interactions and sidequests that made the original notable. That leaves behind a first-person game where you wield supernatural powers, often steathily, against your opponents. Sound familiar?</p>

 <p>I’m not sure if a different name would’ve made for a significantly better reception for <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. In fact, it might not’ve been talked about nearly as much if it wasn’t called <i>Bloodlines 2</i>. Games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-swansong-impressions-rpg-tabletop-bl-1848939458"><i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong</i></a> and <i>Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Heart of the Forest</i> are far better games set in the World of Darkness, the broader mythos of <i>VtM</i> which it shares with other games like <i>Werewolf</i>. Though at least those games weren’t burdened with the expectation that led up to <i>Bloodlines 2</i>’s eventual release.</p> <p>Much like <i>Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Earthblood</i>, a differently-named <i>Bloodlines 2</i> would’ve otherwise been just a mediocre action game that at best appeals to a niche audience of TTRPG fanatics. That’s presently what it is anyway, regardless of the name it bears.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The newest update for Ghost of Yotei, Version 1.100, as well as patch notes, are available now. With it, New Game Plus has been added, alongside new cosmetics and various bug fixes.</p>







<p>Released in October, Ghost of Yotei serves as a spiritual sequel to 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima. Following mercenary Atsu, she travels across Edo to exact revenge on those who killed her family. The PlayStation 5 exclusive is one of 2025’s best-reviewed titles alongside Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. While it isn’t nominated for Game of the Year at The Game Awards, it did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snag some huge nominations</a> like Best Music and Best Performance. Earlier this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-new-game-plus-date-revealed-adds-new-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sucker Punch teased Patch 1.100</a>, which would add many new elements. Now, we have a detailed look thanks to the patch notes.</p>



<p>The 1.100 update for Ghost of Yotei isn’t too long, patch notes-wise. However, it finally adds a highly requested mode: New Game Plus. Now, if you completed the game and want more, you can return to the beginning of the story with all your previously unlocked upgrades. Furthermore, new outfits, Photo Mode additions, and fixes to gameplay and UI/UX have been included.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser may have included an advanced AI as a plot in his new novel, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath/dp/B0FCYSK8VD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A Better Paradise: Volume One - An Aftermath</a>, but he's not as impressed with the current state of the technology. During a recent appearance, Houser didn't completely downplay AI, but he noted that the technology isn't everything some of its proponents have made it out to be.</p><p>While making a guest appearance on Channel 4's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taaJ8EIebQ8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunday Brunch</a>, Houser acknowledged that his upcoming video game based on A Better Paradise may have some AI. But he also warned that the technology behind AI can't live up to its biggest promises yet.</p><p>"We are dabbling in using AI, but the truth is a lot of it's not as useful as some of the companies would have you believe yet," said Houser. "It's not going to solve all of the problems, you know. We have a whole field of areas we need technology for and AI is great at some of the tasks and can't do the other tasks yet."</p><p>Houser was subsequently asked about the future of gaming now that AI technology is part of it, and he suggested it will land somewhere between art and commerce. </p><p>"[Gaming] can either go somewhere really interesting or somewhere that gets overly focused on making money," said Houser. "I think there's always that danger with any commercial art form that they get distracted by money. But I think there's still a big ceiling creatively to make these kind of living narrative experiences, and I think that was what we were always trying to do."</p><p>When asked if he thought the pursuit of money or creativity would win in the end, Houser clarified that both will win.</p><p>"I think there will be two parts," said Houser. "I've already seen that in spaces in the games industry where they both kind of win."</p><p>Earlier this month, Ubisoft was called out for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-promises-to-replace-ai-art-found-in-anno-117-pax-romana/1100-6536293/" data-ref-id="1100-6536293">including AI-created art</a> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anno-117-pax-romana/" data-ref-id="5000-632093">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>.

The company subsequently acknowledged that some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-developers-used-ai-tools-but-creative-process-is-led-by-humans-activision-says/1100-6536232/" data-ref-id="1100-6536232">AI was used in the creation of Black Ops 7</a> Meanwhile, Arc Raiders has come under fire for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">using AI voiceover readings</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a%E2%80%99s-go-to-competitive-team-has-made-multiplayer-boring.1363285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’ve only spent a few nights in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> multiplayer mode, and while I’m not usually a competitive player, I had a pretty fun time during those early days post-launch, before everyone had figured out what the meta was going to be. It’s chaotic, makes the most out of the game’s real-time battle system, and hitting several enemies with one giant Surf tsunami is always satisfying. Even using my non-optimized team of favorites was a blast. But it was only like this for a few nights. Now, you can’t boot up the game without folks running the same three Pokémon and essentially turning competitive battles into a game of rock-paper-scissors.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s not uncommon for a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>meta to form that prioritizes a handful of monsters, but </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s multiplayer format has incentivized players to find what are essentially three of the strongest, most versatile Pokémon in the game’s roster and swap between them ad nauseam. This time, Metagross, Xerneas, and Garchomp have become the go-to team.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s multiplayer mode pits four players against each other, each with a team of three monsters, competing to rack up the most knock-outs in a limited time. These three Pokémon are not only powerful on their own, but they also have some of the most robust defensive capabilities in the game. Their Steel/Psychic, Fairy, and Dragon/Ground typings make them resistant to several incoming elements, and they each have versatile movesets. Basically, these three Pokémon cover most situations between them, and they are also excellent counters to one another. Metagross’ steel attacks can take down Xerneas, whose fairy-type moves are effective against Garchomp, who can knock Metagross over with a well-positioned Earthquake.</span></p>

 <p><span>These three Pokémon are so dominant in competitive play now that everyone else is just trying to get a few good hits in before some variation of this team pops up on the battlefield. When I started writing this up, I hopped into one match to see what teams I would come across, and while I didn’t face this exact composition, all three of my opponents had at least two of them on their team. I’m not the only person who’s noticed this, either.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646989" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646989"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646989">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“I know Metas are inevitable, but </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> online battles went from actually quite fun at release to the most monotonous and miserable thing ever over such a short time,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1oqppm0/i_know_metas_are_inevitable_but_legends_za_online/"><span>Reddit user TheFierceDiety writes</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>“Adding in the legendaries this early in ranked was a crazy move,” D00MPhd wrote in response. “Xerneas being playable in ranked homogenized the format in the worst way. If they waited until there were more legendary options to choose from, like in older games, we would still see a degree of diversity among team building.”</span></p>

 <p><span>This kind of homogeneous teambuilding is the reason official </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>competitive play has tiers that sort different monsters into different groups. Right now, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has no such designation that lets you battle against teams of comparable power. If the game implements something like that, players who want to use different teams might have somewhere to play without having to deal with the impenetrable wall that is Metagross, Xerneas, and Garchomp.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe things will change when the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span> launches on December 10 and adds several new monsters to the roster, but for the moment, this is what players are dealing with when they hop onto ranked battles. It’s made worse by the fact that you </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><span>have to play ranked battles to unlock certain Mega Stones</span></a><span>, so even people who don’t want to deal with these teams have to in order to get every Mega Evolution. It’s bad enough that there’s a growing cheater problem infecting the mode; now we have to deal with the same few monsters every battle. At least Game Freak made it easier to get high enough rank for those rewards by essentially making it impossible to lose rank. Now you can just go get beaten up for a few rounds and still get what you want. You’ll be fine.</span></p>

Ex-Sucker Punch artist Drew Harrison <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478">was one of them</a>. In her first interview since her joke about the murder prompted an online harassment campaign targeting the<em> Ghost Of Yotei</em> studio, she says Sony never asked her to remove the offending post or apologize for it before deciding to fire her.</p> <p><a href="https://aftermath.site/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-fired/">Speaking to <em>Aftermath</em></a>, the 10-year veteran of the PlayStation first-party team outlined what she experienced on the inside the studio and the campaign online to get her tossed out of it. “I just thought, ‘I’m their entertainment for the day,’” Harrison said. “I assumed it was going to go how it always has: Nobody cares about what they say because they literally only harass for the fun of it.”</p>

 <p>“I hope the shooter’s name is Mario so that Luigi knows his bro got his back,” she posted on Bluesky the day Kirk was shot. Online reactionaries like Mark “Grummz” Kern and others looking to exact revenge for anyone appearing to make light of the assassination began directing their followers to boycott<em> Yotei</em> and demand Harrison’s termination.</p>

 <p><em>Aftermath</em> reports that Sucker Punch became bombarded with so many anonymous calls that some employees were even instructed to unplug their desk phones. “I made the worst people on the internet mad,” Harrison wrote in the office chat the next day. “As an apology, there are banana muffins in the kitchen.”</p>

 <p>But later that day, a member of Sucker Punch’s leadership reportedly published the following message in the company’s chat:</p> <blockquote><p>Due to a social media post by one of our team members, many corners of our studio and Sony organization are having to manage a developing situation. We may have to pause a trailer release…there will be some significant amount of work created now to ensure we keep the spotlight on the fantastic game we’ve all created. Please be mindful of how you represent yourself online…</p></blockquote> <p>Harrison told <em>Aftermath</em> she was contacted later that day for an unscheduled call with a Sony HR rep (not a studio manager) who told her she was being immediately fired for allegedly “inciting violence” with her social media joke.</p>

 <p>“Full disclosure, the joke was not in the best taste,” Harrison said. “But at no point did anyone ask me to delete it. At no point did anyone ask me to apologize—and for the record, I would have. I would have worked with PR to write an apology. It feels like nobody investigated the harassment me and my coworkers were receiving.”</p>

 <p>Sony has never directly commented on the reason for the firing. “I think we’re aligned as a studio that celebrating or making light of someone’s murder is a deal-breaker for us, and we condemn that, kind of in no uncertain terms,” studio co-founder Brian Fleming later <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sucker-punch-brian-fleming-interview-playstation-ghost-of-yotei">told <em>Game File</em></a>. “That’s sort of our studio, and that’s kind of where we are.”</p> <p>Harrison said no one from Sucker Punch’s leadership, including Fleming, reached out to her before Sony fired her. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, meanwhile, has gone on to sell millions of copies despite the boycott targeting Harrison and reactionary attacks against lead actor Erika Ishii (whose performance <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">was nominated for a TGA</a>).</p>

<p>Finding a good gift for the gamer in your life when you’re working with a tight budget can feel tougher than it probably should. After all, prices keep going up and money feels tighter for many. But not every present needs to cost you a fortune. That’s why Insider Gaming has put together a list of genuinely fun, useful gifts that still feel thoughtful and worth unwrapping. The best part, these gaming gifts are all on the cheap side at less than $25. </p>



<p>Whether you’re shopping for a friend, a family member, or just treating yourself, these picks prove you don’t need to overspend to give something great. When it comes to gifting, sometimes the smaller items end up being the ones people appreciate the most. A clever phone stand, a handy charging dock, or even a retro-themed game or controller can upgrade someone’s setup without hitting your wallet hard. And for those who love gaming culture as much as playing the games, books, card games, and novelty items can be just as meaningful as any big-ticket tech.</p>



<p>Below, you’ll find a mix gifts that stay under that $25 ceiling, making it easier to stick to a budget while still giving something they’ll actually use. Let’s take a look at the best cheap gaming gifts for 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Press Reset by Jason Schrier</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>From Jason Schreier himself:</p>



<p><strong>“The business of videogames is both a prestige industry and an opaque one. Based on dozens of first-hand interviews that cover the development of landmark games—Bioshock Infinite, Epic Mickey, Dead Space, and more—on to the shocking closures of the studios that made them,&nbsp;Press Reset&nbsp;tells the stories of how real people are affected by game studio shutdowns, and how they recover, move on, or escape the industry entirely.”</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>8Bitdo M30 Bluetooth Controller</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want a cheap way to play classic Sega Games, or any game for that matter? This M30 Bluetooth Controller is designed to mimic the classic six-button Sega Genesis controller. It works on your Nintendo Switch or Switch 2, Windows PCs, and even mobile devices.</p>

The 8Bitdo Bluetooth Retro Receiver allows you to use your Xbox, PS4, PS5, Wii U Pro and Switch Pro controllers wirelessly with the PS1 or PS2. Imagine just sitting on your couch that’s more than 10 feet from your TV?</p>











<hr>



<p><strong>UNO: The Legend of Zelda Card Game&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>UNO? Great game. The Legend of Zelda? Great franchise. So, why not combine them with a special version of UNO that features the artwork of The Legend of Zelda.

<hr>



<p><strong>JSAUX Docking Station</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Ally X, Steam Deck, Legion Go, and other handheld gaming PCs are all great devices, but sometimes you don’t want to play on the small screen. This docking station—which is actively in use by Senior Editor Mike Straw—allows you to not only hook your handheld to a larger display with HDMI 2.1, but also connect two USB-A devices, an ethernet cable, and a 100W USB-C charging port for your handheld to stay powered during use.</p>
