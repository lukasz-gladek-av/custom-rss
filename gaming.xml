			<p>EA heard all our complaints about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">FC 25</a>. I and many others lamented that last year’s game was far too similar to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/25/ea-sports-fc-24-review/">FC 24</a> and was lacking major changes, and it certainly feels like EA took note of this. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a>, then, comes with some changes that do make it play differently to the previous FC games, though a lot of familiarity (and poor defending) remains.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Official Launch Trailer | The Club is Yours" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2Q4xrASt94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The big change in FC 26 is the addition of Authentic and Competitive gameplay styles, split between the single player and multiplayer sides of the game. Authentic mode is designed to recreate the proper action on the pitch, getting closer to what you would see in a real life match, making things a bit slower and more focused on tactical play rather than sprinting to goal and shooting. That’s the competitive mode and is for online play so matches move quickly and players can go end-to-end while chasting scoring opportunities.</p>


<p>If you are going to play the single player modes, I’d recommend at least playing on World Class difficulty for a real world and authentic feel. Teams act a bit more like their real life counterparts adhering to their tactical shapes and instructions. At Professional difficulty and below, it is too &nbsp;easy to break through opposition defences and have scorelines getting near double digits, which does get boring after a while. It is a continuing issue through the franchise where defending play is just non-existent outside of the higher difficulties, and it is something that I would hope would be looked at. Beating Fulham 9-0 and then Brentford 8-1 a week later as Chelsea on Professional difficulty should just not be happening.</p>


<p>Manager Career and Player Career will remain the two go-to options for single player. Like the previous entry you can choose a real manager or player to play as or create your own – shoutout to Mehdi Leris of Pisa who was the real life player I chose after picking a team at random team. While there is not much difference as a player, EA has tried to refresh the managerial side with unexpected events that can impact the team and individual players. These can range from the coach getting to the ground late so your players don’t have much time to warm up, impacting their sharpness, and can go to the extreme of players getting career ending injuries leading them to retire. You never know when an unexpected event will happen – it’s kind of in the name – which does make career mode a bit more unpredictable.</p>
<p>The youth team is once again an integral part of career, where you can play as them in tournaments and create development plans. There is quite a bit of depth to objectives and player development, but do not expect something on par with Football Manager. You can also pick Live points to start the seasons with, with real life results from the season so far added in already.</p>

<p>Outside of Career is Ultimate Team, Squad Battles, Rush, Clubs and regular online matches for those who want to face off against the world. It is in these online matches where you will be playing with the faster paced Competitive setting. There have been some changes to Ultimate team with the addition of Live events, allowing players to face off against each in varied match settings. There is also the new tournament and gauntlet feature, with tournaments running at different points of the season instead of every week. In Gauntlet, you play a run of five matches but in each successive match you need to swap your players around, essentially giving them every player in your club a run out. It is probably best to save those gold players for the latter stages.</p>

<p>Another new thing is the ability to now evolve goalkeepers, which was oddly missing from FC 25. Your online enjoyment obviously depends on the rest of the player base, but in Ultimate Team there are already squads consisting of the best players where people have invested to get them, though there are challenges that will only allow you to use certain ranked players to get people to play with more varied squads.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		EA Sports FC 26 is a better game than FC 25 and can give you a good game of football, especially when Authentic mode in single player comes together properly. However, for that to happen you need to play on World Class difficulty, as anything below that exposes poor defending by the AI. There has been evolution here, but FC 26 is still only a step towards getting the balance right, and not the final stop.	</p></div>

<p>Or... a re-remaster?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nightdive Studios has announced yet another remaster for release later this year on <strong>4th December 2025</strong> (which, as a reminder, clashes with both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>).</p>
<p>Confirmed for "PC and consoles", <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blood_refreshed_supply">Blood: Refreshed Supply</a> is an updated version of the studio's 2019 remaster, <strong>Blood: Fresh Supply</strong>, which itself was a remaster of, uh, <strong>Blood</strong>. The original game launched in 1997 and was developed by the now-defunct Monolith Productions.</p>
<p>This new version benefits from a bunch of added extras, including add-ons Plasma Pak and Cryptic Passage, new Marrow and Death Wish missions, behind-the-scenes content revealing key development details, and more.</p>
<p>But of course, just having this on the Switch is pretty cool in itself, though we're still keen to see native Switch 2 ports of Nightdive games so we can get performance parity with PS5 and Xbox. Alas, the wait continues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- The legendary blood-soaked shooter</strong> comes to consoles for the very first time!</p>
<p><strong>- Up to 4K 120FPS visuals</strong> on PlayStation 4|5, and Xbox One and Series X|S</p>
<p><strong>- Fully customizable</strong> keyboard and controller gamepad support</p>
<p><strong>- Extended modding support</strong>, including support for existing mods</p>
<p><strong>- Local split-screen and cross-platform online multiplayer</strong> support for up to eight players — co-op, PvP Bloodbath”, and classic 4v4 team-based “Capture The Flag” modes</p>
<p><strong>- CD and MIDI</strong> music support</p>
<p><strong>- Includes existing add-ons</strong> Plasma Pak and Cryptic Passage</p>
<p><strong>- New mission scenarios</strong>, Marrow and Death Wish, pump new blood into… <em>Blood</em>! Marrow will be available at launch, while Death Wish will release as a free post-launch update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds and its immediate predecessors Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise will drop Windows 10 support next month, CAPCOM confirmed today.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/544495527868236777?l=english">new message on Steam</a> today, the Japanese publisher confirmed that starting October 14, 2025, CAPCOM will no longer guarantee the three games will run on Windows 10. While all three games will continue to be playable on Windows 10 systems, future system or game updates may make the games incompatible with the operating system. Additionally, support will only be provided based on information from before Windows 10 support was discontinued.</p>



<p>While this is unlikely to be an issue for Monster Hunter Rise and Monster Hunter World, as both games have stopped receiving new patches for some time, the end of Window 10 support for Monster Hunter Wilds, which coincides with Microsoft ending support for their older operating system, could be a problem, as the game is actively getting patched with fixes and updates, and its performance is still in dire need of improvement, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">it hasn't improved a lot since launch.</a></p>



<p>Speaking about new Monster Hunter Wilds updates, the latest entry in the series is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/544495527868236233?l=english">getting a new Title Update today</a>, which introduces collaboration content with Final Fantasy XIV, including Omega Planetes as an additional monster, the Dark Knight Hunter armor and Pictomancy spells, Arch-tempered Nu Udra, which will be the target of a new event quest, and more.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During last week's Tokyo Game Show 2025, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/resident-evil-requiem-director-reveals-who-mysterious-hooded-character-is/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gamer interviewed Resident Evil Requiem producer Masata Kumazawa</a>, who opened up about CAPCOM's issues with rumors and leaks for this game. Kumazawa-san admitted that fans get frustrated with the developers because of rumors or theories that the studio never really promised, and that, in turn, is frustrating for them.</p>



<p><em>Sometimes I talk to people and they act as if various speculation and rumours are just already a confirmed thing, and then they start talking on that basis. I would like everyone to remember, let's calm down a bit - what we've shown you so far is everything we can say. People get frustrated with us, because even though we didn’t promise things, the rumours and theories were such that they were widely believed.</em></p>



<p>Many of the rumors (mainly sparked by long-time CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem) are about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-remake-re-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged presence of Leon Kennedy in the game</a>, which CAPCOM has never really confirmed to this day. But there's also another hot topic: the hooded man seen in previous Resident Evil Requiem trailers, which fans are absolutely convinced is a returning character. However, Kumazawa confirmed that this was not the case.</p>



<p><em>Everyone is convinced that the hooded figure has to be a reveal of a returning cast member, and there is speculation that it ‘must be this person or must be that person’. But we don't always want to just lean on surprise comebacks like these. The hooded person is a new character, we will confirm that much. In this case, it's a newly created character for this storyline, so it's a bit of a previously undisclosed detail, but hopefully it contextualises how we’re approaching the game's story.</em></p>



<p>It won't be that long before players can verify for themselves what's true and what's not<span>&nbsp;since Resident Evil Requiem is slated to launch on February 27, 2026, on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2 (which,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-better-anticipated-switch-2-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>based on off-scree</span>n footage from TGS</a>, is looking pretty good). On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is confirmed to support path tracing and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> for optimal visuals and performance.</p>

            <p>As has been the case with all of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s sizeable updates this far, Team Cherry have put out some tweaks as a Steam beta shot to the upcoming patch three's chaser. As of now, opting into playtesting this "interim update" offers some extra controller support and fixes, but the devs say more'll be added before the full patch goes live to everyone.</p>
<p>In case you need a refesher, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-patch-makes-some-early-bosses-slightly-easier-out-now-in-steam-and-gog-beta">first patch made a couple of its early bosses a bit easier</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksongs-latest-public-update-fixes-its-worst-boss-but-not-as-much-as-youre-likely-hoping">its second patch</a> didn't do any balancing, but did bring handy fixes to problems like the Savage Beastfly boss cheekily hiding below some lava.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to this weekend just gone, and a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/596286923597002888/">fresh Steam post</a> from devs Team Cherry. "While work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>'s third patch continues, an interim update is now live on the public-beta branch," they wrote. "This includes a few fixes that players may want to access, including some additional controller support and improvements."</p>
<p>In terms of controllers, the studio have added in support for PlayStation's dualsense edge stick-and-button doodads, generally improved how well controllers work on Mac, and made sure the game'll now automatically pause if your controller disconnects. That last one's good news if you happen, for reasons definitely not related to a boss narrowly besting you, to lob your bit of game-playing plastic across a room. Or out of a window.</p><p>Team Cherry have also enacted some "smaller" controller tweaks they don't deem worth dedicating in excess of one bullet point to, but have confirmed that more of those will be coming in the future. As for the rest of the tweaks currently in this beta update, they're as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed remaining instance of certain players getting stuck cursed while in the late game.</li>
<li>Fixed Curveclaw not reacting to Hunter down-stab.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies sometimes appearing from odd locations after scene transition.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instances of being able to air dash and double jump when not intended.</li>
<li>Fixed several out of bounds situations.</li>
<li>Fixed Pharlid Divers sometimes sliding on roofs after ambushing in certain scenes.</li>
<li>Fixed Eva Hunter Crest upgrades unintentionally clearing tool equips.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instances of Harpoon sometimes granting 2 Silk instead of 1.</li>
<li>Various smaller fixes and tweaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>While that's it for now, Team Cherry did add that folks can "expect further additions prior to this one going live". So, if there's a fix or tweak you're desperate for and don't see here, there's still very much a chance it could make it into patch 3's public release.
</p>
<p>Until then, maybe check if there's a mod for it, nestled among the ones which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stupid-sexy-hollow-knight-silksong-mods-for-hornet-horndogs-have-begun-to-hit-the-nexus-im-sorry-to-say">make Hornet curvy</a> or ensure she'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-miss-how-much-hornet-used-to-scream-and-shout-theres-a-hollow-knight-silksong-mod-youll-shaw-ly-want-to-pick-up">yell things at you</a>.</p>

            <p>Over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in development, according to the country's Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA) that runs the Tokyo Games Show.</p>
<p>The claim is based on responses from 54 Japanese game companies in a preview of the 2025 CESA Video Game Industry Report (as reported by <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF251PU0V20C25A9000000/?n_cid=SNSTW005">The Nikkei</a>). The survey sample is taken from CESA's <a href="https://www.cesa.or.jp/about/member-list/index-en.html">member companies</a>, which include the likes of Capcom, Konami, FromSoftware, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> and Sega, as well as smaller indie studios.</p>
<p>The report preview stated 51 percent of companies are using AI, with the most common use being generating visual assets and character images, as well as story and text generation, followed by programming support. Further, 32 percent of companies are using AI to develop their own game engines.</p>
<p>The report will be released in full in early December, so specifically cited uses of AI remain under wraps.</p>
<p>However, some Japanese companies have been open about their use of AI.</p>
<p>Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-says-ceo">Square Enix CEO Takashi Kiryu stated the company would be "aggressive in applying AI"</a>, with developers admitting they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">"dabbled" with AI</a> for the ill-fated shooter Foamstars.</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/over-50-of-japanese-game-companies-use-ai-in-development-according-to-tokyo-game-show-organizer/">Automaton </a>reported in 2023 on Professor Layton studio <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20231213-24326/">Level-5</a> using AI tool Stable Diffusion, while earlier this year <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/capcom-is-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-help-generate-the-hundreds-of-thousands-of-ideas-needed-for-game-development/">Capcom</a> was experimenting with generative AI too. <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999104/20250808042/">Sega</a> also has an in-house AI team.</p>
<p>Nintendo, notably absent from the CESA member list, has taken a stance against AI. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-would-rather-go-in-a-different-direction-than-follow-ai-trend-says-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto stated the company would "rather go in a different direction"</a> as part of its pursuit of originality.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Tokyo Game Show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-was-everywhere-at-gamescom-2025">AI was a common theme at Gamescom</a>, seen by some indie studios as an invaluable tool.</p>

            <p>Gearbox revealed its first DLC vault hunter for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> during the Tokyo Game Show over the weekend. C4SH will be coming to the game in Q1 2026 alongside the game's first story pack.</p>
<p>C4SH was revealed via a short cinematic teaser at the Borderlands 4 Tokyo Game Show panel, and is a former casino dealer robot who'll use a degree of chance across all three of their skill trees. A full ability breakdown is set to take place in the near future, though there's no date just yet.</p>
<p>The new character will arrive alongside a story pack called Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned. This pack will bring new main missions to complete, new gear, a new region on the map, a load of new cosmetics, and of course C4SH to tie it all together.</p>

<p>While the future of Borderlands 4 was shown off proudly in Japan, the game is still tackling technical hurdles in the present. While a recent patch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-crashing-on-pc-theres-a-new-patch-for-that">has gone a ways in tackling performance issues</a>, it has brought with it additional problems with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-patch-adds-fov-sliders-somehow-both-improves-and-worsens-stability-at-the-same-time">Gearbox telling some on PC to clear their shader cache</a> if things aren't stable within 15-minutes of play time.</p><p>In addition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-switch-2-version-has-been-delayed-with-no-new-release-date-in-sight">Borderlands 4's Switch 2 version was delayed to an unspecified date</a> for "additional development and polish time". Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford advised <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/randy-pitchford-advises-borderlands-4-players-to-get-a-refund-if-theyre-not-happy-with-it-as-social-media-tirade-defending-pc-performance-continues">those on X unhappy with Borderlands 4 performance issues to refund the game</a> in the days following its release.</p>
<p>Still, those able to get the game running well are having a good time with the sci-fi shooter. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-review">Eurogamer's Borderlands 4 review states</a>: "Borderlands 4 brings a more sensible script and a true open world to its pseudo-cel-shaded gun-show. But these moderate improvements are undermined by frustrating exploration and combat that takes too long to properly shine."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the PC Gaming Show - Tokyo Direct, KING Art and Deep Silver debuted a gorgeous in-engine trailer for the upcoming real-time strategy game Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV and shared some details about the game's inspiration. Originally announced at Gamescom 2025 and slated for a 2026 launch on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272360/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War_IV/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>), the game will, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3u6jlJUEVI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Creative Director Jan Theysen</a>, follow in the footsteps of the first game in the franchise.</p>



<p><em>The first big decision, of course, was what we were aiming for. Do we try to do a Dawn of War 1 or 2 or a mix of both? We like both of them. But in the end, we said no, let's really go with Dawn of War 1; that's our guiding star. We talked to a lot of people: 'What do you remember from Dawn of War 1? What made it Dawn of War 1 for you?' And everybody was excited about sync kills. That was just something that everybody remembered, and so we said, okay, we definitely want sync kills in the game, but could we maybe even make it more spectacular or something that 20 years later is super cool? And so we came up with a new system.</em></p>



<p><em>I think when you do a new version or reinterpretation of a classic game, the challenge is always that you're not trying to recreate the old game, but you try to recreate the feeling that people had when they played the old game, right? What you basically want to do is you look at the old game, you ask yourself, okay, how did this work and how did this make us feel and how can we do this 20 years later?</em></p>



<p>Jan Theysen then discussed the developers' choices when it comes to the factions that will be featured in Dawn of War IV:</p>



<p><em>There are so many cool factions and so many cool stories you could choose from. We ended up picking the factions we picked because we felt if we do like a new version or an evolution of Dawn of War, you need the Blood Ravens and you need the Orks. That is just a given.</em></p>



<p><em>We thought about adding the Nekrons to Dawn of War IV because we felt that, you know, Nekrons were kind of promised for Dawn of War 3 and never came. So, it felt like a nice touch to finally give them to the players. There may be a faction that never had a big role in the Dawn of War games and there are not that many. The Adeptus Mechanicus is definitely a big and important faction in the 40K universe and they were never part of the Dawn of War franchise, so we felt that's a good opportunity to have something new for everyone.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>As a reminder, the first three games were made by Relic Entertainment, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went independent from SEGA in March 2024</a> and is now working on a self-published turn-based strategy game called Earth vs Mars, <a href="https://wccftech.com/relic-announces-turn-based-strategy-game-earth-vs-mars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as announced in February 2025</a>.</p>



<p>As for KING Art, the German studio's last game was the real-time strategy game Iron Harvest, which launched in 2020. Our own Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/iron-harvest-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gave it an 8 out of 10 score</a> back then.</p>

Not only does it benefit from an even bigger jump in visual quality, but it also expands on the overall story with new cutscenes, dialogue, and side-stories. Kiryu will also be able to use a new weapon-based combat style based on Okinawan martial arts, and fans can even take part in a life-simulator minigame at his orphanage, Morning Glory, through various outdoor activities.</p><p>Other additions include a new team battle mode where Kiryu's motorcycle gang takes on rival outfits, and most importantly, there'll be new Karaoke songs to sing along to. But perhaps the biggest draw here is Dark ties, an all-new prequel to Yakuza Kiwami 3 that reveals more details about Yoshitaka Mine, one of Kiryu's greatest foes and the primary antagonist of this remake. RGG says this is a gritty crime story set in Kamurocho, where Mine rises to power. The prequel also adds a new mission-based mode called Kanda Damage Control and a survival mode set in an underground fight club.</p></div>                      </div><div title="Yakuza Kiwami 1 &amp; 2 preorder for PS5 and Xbox Series X" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4458" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="Yakuza Kiwami 1 &amp; 2 preorder for PS5 and Xbox Series X" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG45S74,B0FSGMPG6G&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG45S74,B0FSGMPG6G&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG45S74,B0FSGMPG6G&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Yakuza Kiwami 1 &amp; 2 for PS5 / Xbox Series X</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG45S74,B0FSGMPG6G&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG45S74,B0FSGMPG6G&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG45S74,B0FSGMPG6G&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$60 | Releases December 8</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you're looking to catch up on mainline Yakuza entries, you're in luck as both Yakuza Kiwami 1 and 2 are being bundled together into a single physical edition for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yakuza-Kiwami-1-2-PlayStation-5/dp/B0FSG45S74?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yakuza-Kiwami-1-2-Xbox-X/dp/B0FSGMPG6G?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a> for $60.

One of the big changes here was that the combat system was overhauled entirely to be closer to Yakuza 0, giving Kiryu four unique fighting styles to choose from--Brawler, Beast, Rush, and Dragon--during his adventure. While Yakuza 0 featured a powerful antagonist in the form of Mr. Shakedown--an absolute brute who could be randomly encountered in the game world and would rob you blind if he beat you in a fight--Yakuza Kiwami featured the "Majima Everywhere" challenge instead.</p><p>This saw Kiryu's rival, Goro Majima, randomly pop up during gameplay to challenge him to a street fight or minigames like darts and bowling. Defeating him would unlock new abilities in Kiryu's Dragon style.</p><p>On a technical level, the resolution, framerate, textures, and loading times were greatly improved when compared to the original game, more substories were added, and the remake had a Japanese dub that was far superior to the English audio track. Another noteworthy improvement was to the overall story, as additional cutscenes fleshed out Yakuza's antagonist, Nishiki, went on, providing crucial insight to his betrayal of Kiryu. The cherry on top was an expansion of Heat Actions that Kiryu could perform, giving him even more over-the-top finishers to use during combat.</p><p>Released in 2017, Yakuza Kiwami 2 saw ex-Yakuza Kiryu embroiled in a massive gang war in the Japanese underworld, following the assassination of the Tojo clan's Fifth Chairman, Yukio Terada, by the rival Omi Alliance. At the center of this conflict was Ryuji Goda, the Dragon of Kansai who was hellbent on defeating Kiryu and cementing his legend as the <em>only </em>dragon of the Yakuza. The remake also added a new scenario centered around Goro Majima, revealing just what the loose cannon gangster had been up to since he left the Tojo clan to form his own construction company.</p><p>For this sequel, gameplay was also revamped significantly to be more in line with Yakuza 0 and Kiwami, and the visual upgrade also made a big difference to the bone-crunching action.</p></div>                      </div><div title="6534988 -- Yakuza 0: Director's Cut for PS5 and Xbox Series X" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4459" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6534988 -- Yakuza 0: Director's Cut for PS5 and Xbox Series X" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG6FKTM,B0FSGQXX58,B0F65ZBSXY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG6FKTM,B0FSGQXX58,B0F65ZBSXY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG6FKTM,B0FSGQXX58,B0F65ZBSXY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG6FKTM,B0FSGQXX58,B0F65ZBSXY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG6FKTM,B0FSGQXX58,B0F65ZBSXY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSG6FKTM,B0FSGQXX58,B0F65ZBSXY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$50 | Releases December 8</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Chronologically, Yakuza 0 is the first game in the franchise and it stars both Kiryu Kazuma and Goro Majima.

What this collection also adds is a completely redone English localization, visual and audio changes to several characters, content that was originally cut from the Western releases have been added back in, and certain problematic content has also been removed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574545-yakuza-0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574545" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574545-yakuza-0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574545"></a><figcaption>Yakuza 0</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574545-yakuza-0.jpg"></figure><p>The other big recommendation here is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Judgment-PS5-playstation-5/dp/B08WDLP8L9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Judgment</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Judgment-PlayStation-5/dp/B094F4RX8H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lost Judgment</a>. While these games are mechanically similar to the Yakuza titles and also feature an episodic storyline structure, they focus on a new character and add investigative elements to the franchise formula. The Judgment games also deal with heavier subject matter, focusing even more on institutionalized corruption, Japan's controversial legal system, medical malpractice, murder, and high school suicides, while weaving together a tight narrative.</p><p>In the modern era, the Yakuza games have evolved into the Like a Dragon series. These games follow a new protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, on his adventures and so far two titles have been released--<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yakuza-Like-Dragon-Steelbook-playstation-4/dp/B0889CMW4S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-Dragon-Infinite-Wealth-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CJHD3JZ8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>.

		<p>Developer Project Cloud Games has released a brand new extended gameplay trailer for its upcoming semi open world action RPG The Relic: First Guardian. This trailer shows one of the missions that the Guardian, the main character of the game, will undertake with this one taking place in a burning village which is being ransacked and put to the sword.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Relic: First Guardian - Extended Gameplay Trailer (Coming Early 2026)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dasDB7PohU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Relic: First Guardian’s extended gameplay trailer shows how the combat plays, with it being very fast paced with this guardian armed with twin daggers. However, they are just one of five weapon options with each having their own skills. Players do not level up in the game but equipping runes, items, and crafting tools to help is what will determine success in each mission. The burning village features just one of 70 bosses that players will face, with the stories and bosses inspired by Korean folklore. Each of the bosses has their own full background so you can find out why they do what they do. In this particular scenario, the boss is Branka the Blood Stained Shield who is leading the massacre of the village.</p>
<p>The Relic: First Guardian is set in the world of Arsiltus which was sucked up by the void following the great relic’s destruction. The goal is to find the pieces of the broken relic across the Arsiltus while dealing with the dangers that now plague it since falling into the void. The hope is that finding the relic pieces will save Arsiltus and close the void. The Relic: First Guardian is expected to launch in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, during the PC Gaming Show - Tokyo Direct livestream, Canadian indie developer Nine Dots Studio shared new details and a new trailer for Outward 2. First and foremost, the release window for the action RPG sequel is now officially set for Summer 2026; wishlisting is now available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2849490/Outward_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Guillaume Boucher-Vidal, CEO and Creative Director at Nine Dots Studio (<a href="https://wccftech.com/outward-2-qa-director-says-sequel-is-a-few-years-away-will-be-just-as-cruel-obscure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whom we previously interviewed at GDC 2024</a>), shared a statement to outline what fans can expect from the sequel to the 2019 game that recently surpassed three million units sold to date:</p>



<p><em>With Outward 2, we finally have the means to deliver the vision we had for the game — a believable and grounded adventurer experience. We kept the same ingredients, stayed true to our vision, and improved on what was not up to what we wanted - our combat system, immersion, and character creator. When we started working on Outward in 2015 with our Kickstarter, we wanted to create the ultimate simulation of an adventurer's life. With a small team of 11 dedicated people, we surpassed expectations and delivered something greater studios could not have achieved. With Outward 1 we learned a lot from our players, we improved from their feedback and gave them what they wanted with our DLCs. We stayed true to our vision that they loved while elevating the experience of living a true adventurer's life. Much better graphics, better immersion, and better combat.</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="OUTWARD 2 - Official Release Window Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKSH4d-iN-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In Outward 2, players will once again be just an average adventurer instead of a legendary hero. They'll however get to shape their modest and meager beginnings through three distinct starting scenarios and eleven backgrounds, including devout worshipper of Elatt trying to strike it rich as a miner or a vagrant deadbeat in Simeon's Bastion, to name a couple. When knocked out, the player's journey continues and they must live with the consequences. They could be robbed and left to rot, saved by a kind passerby, wake up in town badly injured, or worse.</p>



<p>According to the developers, the game also features a full-year seasonal cycle that will transform the world of Aurai during a playthrough. Merchants and other NPCs relocate, frozen rivers become traversable in winter, and more. The four distinct regions will feature their own biomes, seasons, and specific gameplay. </p>



<p>The new Exercise system reinforces the player's tactical choices, such as the weight and material of armor and weapons used. Passive skills will spark and grow based on how they play. Players should seek out special trainers scattered around Aurai who can teach them survival techniques for a fee.</p>



<p>As hinted earlier, Outward 2 features challenging combat, where every weapon has its own distinct moveset. It is further enhanced with a larger variety of tools, weapon combinations, and animations that provide players with more fluidity and control. Magic is also going to be pretty involved, as it requires players to cast spells through rituals; for example, one could send a fire stone into the air to create a ring that empowers skills with deadly flames. </p>



<p>Inventory management will be critical, as some discoveries won't be worth the precious space. Moreover, during a fight in Outward 2, players may even need to drop their backpack to attack and evade more effectively. However, the sequel adds a mule that can help carry goods.</p>



<p>To get through the harsh journey, asking a friend to help in two-player local split-screen or online co-op action is always a good idea, especially if planning to cover each other's weaknesses.</p>

A release date was not announced, but the first public playtest is currently live from now until October 1. <span id="more-996704"></span></p><p>“I’ve seen members of the Wired team transform from quiet and measured souls, into mouth frothing and evil laughing demons while playtesting <em>Task Time</em>,” said Wired Productions managing director Leo Zullo in a press release. “That is enough for me to know ReadGraves have delivered a wonderfully chaotic party game.”</p><p>ReadGraves founder Sam Read-Graves added, “We made <em>Task Time</em> to see what happens when you throw a gameshow, a physics engine and all your friends into a blender. <em>Task Time</em> is competitive, chaotic and completely unpredictable, where no two rounds are ever the same. It’s an excuse to laugh at each other, celebrate small victories, glorious failures and delight in ruining your friends’ plans. The rules change every minute and the game doesn’t care about fairness; it cares about giving you stories to shout about afterwards and we’re really happy Wired Productions have joined us on our journey of chaos. To be honest, we wanted to make <em>WarioWare</em> but Nintendo already did that, so we made some friendslop instead.”</p><div id="carousel_996988"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Wired Productions:</p><blockquote><p><em>Task Time</em> challenges up to eight players to compete across six frantic gameshow-inspired rounds where sabotage is encouraged, friendships are tested, and laughter is guaranteed.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Developed by some of the creative talent who worked on hit <a title="Genres > Party [107 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">party games</a> <em><a title="Games > Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout">Fall Guys</a></em> and <em>Gang Beasts</em>, <em>Task Time</em> is a physics-driven party game where randomly generated tasks and player-versus-player gameplay erupt into unpredictable chaos.</p><p><em>Task Time</em> is built for unpredictable fun. Across six chaotic rounds, Tasklings can complete over 500,000 random task variations. One moment you might be solving puzzles, the next you’re blasting your mates with paintballs or scrambling across a collapsing map as the floor turns to lava. Whether you win or lose, every match is a story: ridiculous comebacks, glorious failures, and moments of sabotage you’ll be laughing about long after the round ends.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer and a set of gameplay videos below.

When we started working on <em><a title="Games > Outward [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/outward">Outward</a></em> in 2015 with our Kickstarter, we wanted to create the ultimate <a title="Genres > Simulation [843 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> of an adventurer’s life. With a small team of 11 dedicated people, we surpassed expectations and delivered something greater studios could not have achieved. With <em>Outward</em> 1 we learned a lot from our players, we improved from their feedback and gave them what they wanted with our downloadable content. We stayed true to our vision that they loved while elevating the experience of living a true adventurer’s life. Much better graphics, better immersion and better combat.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Nine Dots Studio:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The original <em>Outward</em>, which eclipsed three million players earlier this month, challenged conventional <a title="Genres > Open-World [741 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> <a title="Genres > RPG [17,679 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> by trading the typical power fantasy for an adventure that demands preparation, persistence, and tactical execution. <em>Outward 2</em> takes the formula that gathered a dedicated community and injects it with new and enhanced features fueled by the same intention and effort the developers ask of its players as they embark.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>An Average Joe On A Remarkable Journey</strong> – You’re not a hero of legend. Shape your modest and meager beginnings through three distinct starting scenarios and eleven backgrounds, which will determine where to start in this brutal world. Whether you’re a devout worshipper of Elatt trying to strike it rich as a miner or a vagrant deadbeat in Simeon’s Bastion, the world of Aurai will not be kind… not even in defeat. If you’re knocked out, your journey continues, and you must live with the consequences. You could be robbed and left to rot, be saved by a kind passerby, wake up in town badly injured, or… worse.</li><li><strong>A Living, Evolving World</strong> – A full-year seasonal cycle transforms the world of Aurai. Merchants and other NPCs relocate, frozen rivers become traversable in winter, and more. Comprising of four distinct areas, regions will feature their own biomes, seasons, and specific gameplay. From the blizzards of the Gilded Mountains to the acid rains in the Gathes of Catharsis, players will find a renewed challenge every time they travel.</li><li><strong>Growth Through <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>tery</strong> – Every factor in <em>Outward 2</em> molds your playstyle. Your tactical choices as a player, from the weight and material of your armor to particular weapons you use, are reinforced by the new <a title="Genres > Exercise [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/exercise">Exercise</a> system, where passive skills will spark and grow based on how you play. Seek out special trainers scattered around Aurai, who will teach you how to survive the most brutal encounters for a fee.</li><li><strong>Ritual Spellcasting and Tactical Combat</strong> – Wielding magic in <em>Outward 2</em> is no mere button press. Cast spells through rituals, like sending a fire stone into the air to create a ring around you that allows you to empower your skills with deadly flames. Challenging combat, where every weapon has its own distinct moveset, is further enhanced in the sequel with a larger variety of tools and weapon combinations, along with animations that bring more fluidity and control to players. Major combat improvements were cultivated based on extensive player feedback from the original.</li><li><strong>Intentional Inventory <a title="Genres > Management [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a></strong> -Your backpack is your lifeline, and every space within is worth its weight in gold. Pack provisions, potions, weapons, and camping gear for an expedition, but manage it carefully as you gather more along the way. Some discoveries won’t be worth the precious space. In a fight, you may want to drop your backpack to attack and evade more deftly. The sequel adds a mule you may earn to carry your wares throughout your journey, but its vulnerability may influence your path as well. Weigh each decision carefully.</li><li><strong>Two-Player Split Screen and Online Cooperative</strong> – Aurai is a grueling place, but you mustn’t go alone. Plan and prepare alongside a friend, covering each other’s weaknesses and marrying your strengths. Teamwork expands the opportunities and options for tackling the many challenges you will face in <em>Outward 2</em>.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Window Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="OUTWARD 2 - Official Release Window Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKSH4d-iN-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/outward-2-launches-in-summer-2026]]></content:encoded>
