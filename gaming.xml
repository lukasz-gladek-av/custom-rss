<p>Starting with Snake Eater, Konami's remake for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S has reached number 1, with the PS5 enjoying a whopping 93% of the platform split. Gears of War: Reloaded, meanwhile, is only listed for the PS5 because, well, it didn't receive a physical release on Xbox. What a weird world we're living in...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is still performing well at number 2, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has fallen down to number 6. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Outrageously Long Game Title</a> also made its Switch 2 debut this week and sits at number 7, with the new version enjoying 85% of the platform split when compared to Switch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4vljgtn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

			<p>The first look at a never-before-seen Battlefield 6 map has been provided today by a new leaked video.</p>



<p>The video, which has been shared by the same user who provided the first look at the game's Battle Royale map yesterday, showcases the Blackwell Field or Blackwell Farm map, a mostly flat map featuring a unique atmosphere. Sadly, the player doesn't do a very good job showcasing the map in full due to their playstyle and high FOV settings, but those eagerly anticipating the game's release next month will surely appreciate taking a look at a map that will supposedly be part of the game's very first season.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although it took EA and the many development teams working on the game to unveil it, the long wait hasn't damped the excitement surrounding Battlefield 6, as proven by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">incredible numbers</a> pulled by the open beta held last month. Some data gleaned from the testing phases also revealed how many PC users taking part in the test ran the beta client on minimum specs and lower, highlighting the need to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-effort-minimum-specs/">optimize for weaker systems</a> to allow as many users as possible to enjoy the game as intended. With this being one of the focuses of the developers, it was not surprising to hear the game won't support ray tracing and likely never will, to focus on performance, which is definitely the right choice for a competitive shooter.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 10.</p>

              <p>Hideo Kojima is celebrating ten years of his Kojima Productions company with a lengthy livestream and live show later this month. Beyond the Strand will take place on September 23 at the TOHO Cinemas Roppongi Hills in Toyko, and be livestreamed out to the gorgeous masses, where the developer promises “glimpses into future projects.”</p> <p>It’s a somewhat premature celebration, given Kojima Productions wasn’t officially founded until December 16, 2015, but it seems likely the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em> creator is itching to speak about what his studio is working on now&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em> is out. So far, Kojima Productions has given us two&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em> games, but we know that <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-productions-death-stranding-2-od-physint-1851661289/3">a horror game called&nbsp;<em>OD</em></a> is already in the works, starring the extraordinary Sophia Lillis (<em>I Am Not Okay With This</em>,&nbsp;<em>It</em>) and Hunter Schafer (<em>Euphoria</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cuckoo</em>), as well as&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em> spiritual successor,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/physint-kojima-metal-gear-ps6-release-date-od-1851781247"><em>Physint</em></a>.</p>  <p>However,&nbsp;<em>Physint</em> is thought to be at least five years away, and there hasn’t been anything to see of <em>OD</em> since the above announcement video. The latter experienced an eight month delay due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, but is now back in development. So could we be getting updates on these, perhaps even something in-game? Well, given Kojima’s preference for flair and mystery, footage seems unlikely. But given this is scheduled to be two-and-a-half hours long, there’s got to be&nbsp;<em>something</em>.</p>

 <p>There’s also word that Kojima is <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-a24-1851099101">making a movie based on&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em></a>, so perhaps there’s news to be revealed on that? Maybe even shots of Norman Reedus falling over on a hill? The developer has also hinted at other&nbsp;<em>DS</em> adaptations, although been incredibly vague about what they could be. There’s also <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-productions-death-stranding-2-od-physint-1851661289/7">been word about other TV or film projects</a> ahead of <em>Physint</em>, but again, Kojima does like to announce things a lot more than release them.</p> <p>The only details about Beyond the Strand we have right now, beyond the “glimpses,” are that there will be “special guest appearances.” Geoff? Oh god, imagine if he&nbsp;<em>didn’t</em> invite Geoff. That’d be such a move.</p> <p>If you live anywhere near Tokyo, <a href="https://l-tike.com/cinema/mevent/?mid=763198">tickets for the event went on sale today</a>, September 2, via a lottery system. The livestream details will apparently be announced closer to the event. In the meantime, my absolute favorite detail is in the small print: “<span lang="EN-GB">We cannot be held responsible for any disputes between attendees.”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sales of Monster Hunter Wilds have been impacted by the high price of the PlayStation 5, and not by any issue the game may have, according to CAPCOM's president Haruhiro Tsujimoto.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ps5s-steep-price-a-barrier-for-potential-monster-hunter-wilds-players-capcom-president-says/">Automaton</a>, Tsujimoto-san talked with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en">Nikkei Gaming</a> about the sales of the latest entry in one of the most popular gaming franchises ever, which were quite strong at launch, but fell off quickly in the following months, saying that the high price of the PlayStation 5, which the publisher considers the main platform for the game, has impacted its performance on the market. Taking into consideration the price of the system, accessories and the PlayStation Plus subscription required to play online, plus the price of the game, getting to play Monster Hunter Wilds can be costly, especially for young players with no income, so it would make more sense for some of them to get previous entries in the series featuring a lot more content like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/">Monster Hunter World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/">Monster Hunter Rise</a> which can be purchased for far less. As such, the biggest challenge for the publisher will be to make the game as accessible as possible to new players, and it is planning a strategy to take advantage of future discounts to improve sales starting in these final months of the year.</p>



<p>In the same interview, the CAPCOM's president also commented on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, saying that the system's success was better than the publisher expected, highlighting its lower price compared to Sony's system. The succcess of the new Nintendo console reaffirmed how cost-conscious users are all over the world, Tsujimoto-san commented.</p>



<p>It's a shame Monster Hunter Wilds is not proving to be as successful as past entries in the series, as the game is a more than worthy entry in the series, even with its issues, such as the low challenge level which the development team has been addressing with new <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">free updates and content</a>. You can learn more about the game now out on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The annual home of hockey returns with NHL 26. One of EA’s many sports licenses is back for another outing on the rink, and if you want to know when NHL 26 releases, we have its launch date and start time details in one handy hub.</p>



<p>EA’s other sports titles are where the headlines usually go: EA FC, Madden, and College Football. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-release-date-platforms-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NHL 26</a> is evidence that the company also boasts the NHL license, and many people still loyally buy it each year. A reworked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-features-include-be-a-pro-and-gameplay-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Be A Pro</a> mode, a revamped ICE-Q 2.0 engine, and X-Factors are integral cogs in the new setup.</p>



<p>If you need a virtual ice hockey fix, then NHL 26 is the one. Let’s check out its release date and when you can start playing it.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-nhl-26-coming-out">When is NHL 26 Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ready for a match. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NHL 26 hits the ice on September 12 across both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles.</strong></p>



<p>The game does have early access if you want to play earlier. If you’re waiting for launch, though, you’ve only got a few more days to wait. The NHL franchise is a lot more restrictive where platforms are concerned. Whereas EA FC 26, for example, will release on all PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC platforms, NHL 26 is only on current-gen PS and Xbox hardware.</p>



<p>It’s unclear if this is a cost-cutting measure. Regardless, September 12 is when NHL 26 hits digital and physical shelves, and its launch times vary depending on your region.</p>



<h2 id="h-nhl-26-start-times">NHL 26 Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>According to the official PlayStation Store, NHL 26 will go live from 9 AM PDT on September 12—with other time zones to follow soon after.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-PPSA26785_00-NHL26STANDARD000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NHL 26’s PS Store</a> listing suggests a 9AM PDT start time. This could be subject to change, but if it’s not, you know when to prepare for the game’s arrival.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I’ve provided additional time zones below to cover America’s large reach, plus a couple of key zones for worldwide readers. Check out NHL 26’s release times here.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">NHL 26 Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Daylight Time (PDT)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM—September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Daylight Time (CDT)</td><td data-align="center">11:00 AM—September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)</td><td data-align="center">12:00 PM—September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">5:00 PM—September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT)</td><td data-align="center">2:00 AM—September 13</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Gearbox has revealed what players can expect from the Borderlands 4 endgame when it launches on 12th September for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC – and then 3rd October for Switch 2 – as well as what’s coming down the pipe through the post-launch roadmap.</p>
<p>Once players have wrapped up the main story of Borderlands 4 and, presumably, freed the planet Kairos from its dictatorial leadership, the endgame will have continued activities and progression through weekly challenge missions, character Specialisations, and the returning Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode.</p>


<p>Here’s how Gearbox describes this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode</strong> – Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode has been reimagined for its return. This post-game difficulty option will challenge players through five unlockable levels that increase in difficulty. Additionally, applying lessons learned from past franchise entries, this mode no longer requires players to replay the campaign to gain new ranks. Instead, players will move up ranks through curated mission challenges that put their chosen build to the test, growing more difficult through progression and removing the need to re-farm the same gear.</li>
<li><strong>Firmware</strong> – Each rank of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode includes exclusive Firmware, which are set bonuses for gear that players will first experience throughout the campaign. The more firmware a player acquires results in a higher stat bonus. These powerful Firmware bonuses can be transferred once to another item, at which time the original item is destroyed and the Firmware bonus cannot be re-transferred.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly Wildcards</strong> – Multiple incentives will be provided to allow players to continue their search for the best loot: Weekly Wildcards offer rotating missions with a guaranteed Legendary reward. In the Weekly Big Encore Boss, Moxxi’s Big Encore selects one boss for the week that can be unlocked with Eridium for a larger iteration with increased drop rates. Maurice’s Black Market Machine sends players across Kairos in search of its spoils, with varied loot for every player’s game. Each of these activities is available for online matchmaking by intent, encouraging players to group up with friends, or find new ones whose interests align.*</li>
</ul>

<p>The roadmap for the “first few months” of the game extends through Q1 2026, promising both free and paid content, the latter of which are broken out into story packs and bounty packs.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Story Packs</strong> – The first of two announced “Story Packs” features the return of the indomitable fan-favorite Ellie in “Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned.” Featuring a cosmic <a title="Genres > Horror [701 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> theme with a bloodier, darker tone, this “Story Pack” includes an all-new region of Kairos to explore, multiple engaging main and side missions, all new legendary gear, and the introduction of the first post-launch playable Vault Hunter. In addition, this pack brings four new Vault Hunter Skins, two new Vehicle Skins, three ECHO-4 Drone Skins, as well as attachments, and one ECHO-4 Frame.</li>
<li><strong>Bounty Packs</strong> – With the launch of the first “Bounty Pack,” players will experience narrative-based missions that expand the <em><a title="Series > Borderlands [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> universe. These missions will reveal more about the new characters players encounter on Kairos, starting with Rush, the gregarious leader of the <a title="Games > Outbound [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/outbound">Outbound</a>ers. Each Bounty Pack includes new Main Missions, a new boss, new Legendary Gear, one Player Skin, one ECHO-4 Drone Skin, one new Vehicle, and a Vault Card, allowing players to unlock 24 Cosmetics and four pieces of rerollable Gear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Free for all players, seasonal mini-events will include the Halloween-y Horrors of Kairos in October, offering new Legendary Weapons, new Cosmetics, and a new Weather Variant. Further to this, Invincible Bosses return in new high-level boss arenas built to make the most of Borderlands 4’s enhanced traversal, with a new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode launching alongside each one, and there’s new Legendaries that will serve as the rewards for beating them.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/22/borderlands-4-preview-gamescom-2025/">Borderlands 4 Preview – Guns, grapples and big boss battles</a></h2>
<p>We went hands on with Borderlands 4 at Gamescom 2025, saying, “what I did see from this all-too-brief hands on opportunity was the potential that all of these additions off. Having enjoyed the earlier games in the Borderlands series, but skipping out on the last game, Borderlands 4 looks promising after, and is likely to pull me back into the looter shooter fold when it launches on 12th September.”</p>

            <p>The lead designer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> has announced that he's making something like Left 4 Dead again - a four-player co-op shooter that "expands on the co-op-formula in ways I've wanted to explore for a long time".
</p>
<p>Whatever they end up calling it, the game is in development at Bad Robot Games, a studio founded by the film and TV outfit behind Lost, Cloverfield and Westworld. So the project has both expertise and funding to spare, in theory. There is little else to tell, right now, but you can sign up for a playtest if all this has you combing the rooftops for Smokers and scrabbling around for your shotgun.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Former Turtle Rock creative director Mike Booth announced the project in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/l4d2/comments/1n3jvu3/from_the_creator_of_l4d/">a Reddit post this week</a>. "If you enjoyed the teamwork, tension, and replayability of my past games, you'll probably find this one interesting," he wrote. 
</p>
<p>Left 4 Dead aside, Booth has credits on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-condition-zero">Counter-Strike: Condition Zero</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>. He worked for Valve after they acquired Turtle Rock in 2008, then left in 2012 to join Blizzard and work on something unannounced. Then he went to Facebook to work on multiplayer virtual reality mcGuffins for the Oculus Rift. Most recently, he joined the board of directors for Resolution, creators of tabletop RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo">Demeo</a>. Here's hoping the new Left 4 Deadlike isn't some kind of VR exclusive, or otherwise tainted by exposure to Mark Zuckerberg's skullfucking metaverse meanderings.
</p><p>"We're still in the early stages of development, but we're opening up playtests to a limited number of players," Booth added in the Reddit post. "If you're interested in joining us on this next adventure and helping shape the game early on, we'd love to have you involved." You can sign up for a playtest <a href="https://www.badrobotgames.com/invite">here</a>.
</p>
<p>I'm always keen to play anything Left 4 Deadlike, but I have been burned before. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/back-4-blood">Back 4 Blood</a> was not the unofficial Left 4 Dead 3 its title format implied, partly because it tried to make Left 4 Dead's spontaneously 'AI-directed', playable B-movie gambit work within a clunky latter-day progression system.</p>
<p>Alice Bee (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/back-4-blood-is-peak-00s-action-cheese-and-i-am-here-for-it">had fun with Back 4 Blood</a>, admittedly, calling it "peak early-00s cheese". And there have been other, recent quatrofoil co-operational bangalongs that pull off something like the old L4D vibe, such as Fatshark's various first-person Warhammer games, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gtfo">GTFO</a> from 10 Chambers, and dwarven asteroid miner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">Deep Rock Galactic</a>.
</p>
<p>(Side note to Rock Paper Shotgun's automatic keyword linking system: why do you link some game titles, and not others? Why do you vex and torment me so? I will never unravel your heathen wiles and mocking parlor tricks.)</p>
<p>As for the possibility of an actual Left 4 Dead 3 - those magic words <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/left-4-dead-3-is-a-non-priority-according-to-counter-strike-2-files">appear in relatively recent Valve documentation</a>, but I've seen little evidence that such a project is in active development. Right now, the Steam company appear focussed on perennial chart topper Counter-Strike 2 and the upcoming MOBA shooter Deadlock. As for Booth's old joint Turtle Rock, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/back-4-blood-2-appears-to-be-a-thing-which-is-a-shame-because-id-rather-play-a-new-evolve">appear to be making Back 4 Blood 2</a>, which displeases me inasmuch as I'd rather they make a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evolve">Evolve</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The high price of PlayStation 5 gaming is affecting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> sales, Capcom has said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds got off to an incredible sales start when it launched in February. After releasing to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-breezes-past-10-million-sold-capcom-explains-why-its-done-so-incredibly-well"><u>Capcom record-setting 10.1 million copies sold</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-surpasses-8-million-units-sold-in-3-days-and-is-the-fastest-capcom-game-to-do-so"><u>8 million of which were in just three days</u></a>, Wilds shot up to become the best-selling game in the U.S. year-to-date according to Circana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, for the quarter ending June 30, Monster Hunter Wilds sold 477,000 copies, only just above the 389,000 copies sold of four-year-old game Monster Hunter Rise. Wilds was the 9th best-selling game of the quarter for Capcom, while Rise was the 10th.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Capcom's consolidated financial results, the company said: "Regarding catalog titles, although sales were soft for Monster Hunter Wilds, the latest title in the series released in February this year, Monster Hunter Rise, a previous title in the same series, continued to see sales growth."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ps5s-steep-price-a-barrier-for-potential-monster-hunter-wilds-players-capcom-president-says/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto told <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikkei Gaming</a> that the cost of entry to play Monster Hunter Wilds on a PS5 is “rather steep.” Indeed, Capcom thought the PS5 was going to be the primary sales platform for Monster Hunter Wilds at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Automaton:</p><blockquote>In an interview with Nikkei Gaming, Tsujimoto revealed that Capcom considered the PlayStation 5 as Monster Hunter Wilds’ main platform when estimating the game’s initial sales figures. But accounting for the console, accessories, and monthly subscriptions like PlayStation Plus, the total cost for a PS5 amounts to about 100,000 JPY (roughly $677 USD). Add in Monster Hunter Wilds’ $70 USD price tag, and some people would rather pay for older, more complete entries, such as Monster Hunter World (which sells for as low as $9.89 USD) and Monster Hunter Rise ($9.99 USD), than buy a new console for a game with, currently, less content. Considering many gamers are young and don’t have a source of income, Tsujimoto admits the cost of entry to play Monster Hunter Wilds on a PS5 is rather steep.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The cost of PS5 gaming was made worse last month when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-5-price-rises-for-us">Sony announced $50 price rises for the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, and PlayStation 5 Pro</a>. The base PS5 with a disc drive went up by $50 to $549.99, while the PS5 Digital Edition cost $50 more, at $499.99. The PS5 Pro, meanwhile, rose $50 to $749.99. The price hike went into effect in the U.S. on August 21.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment," Isabelle Tomatis, Sony Interactive Entertainment's Vice President, Global Marketing said in a statement. "As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no mention of Xbox console pricing in Tsujimoto’s comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what’s the answer? Discounts, it seems, as well as more content via patches. Perhaps a launch on the record-breaking Nintendo Switch 2 will help, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, actual players of Monster Hunter Wilds might have their own theories as to why the game hasn’t shown the same level of sales consistency as prior Monster Hunter games. After <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review"><u>reviewing well initially</u></a>, Wilds’ endgame content was considered sorely lacking compared to past games. It's also suffering from severe performance issues on PC specifically that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-takes-aim-at-performance-woes-but-opinions-vary-on-whether-it-worked"><u>have yet to be fully resolved</u></a>. Despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-is-heating-up-for-summer-with-its-next-season-event-heres-whats-new"><u>new content and seasons</u></a>, fans remain unsatisfied with the state of the game, to the point where some players are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-backlash-highlights-how-death-threats-against-devs-are-becoming-a-major-issue-in-japan"><u>taking things too far</u></a> and apparently harassing and threatening individual Capcom team members over it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Monster Hunter Wilds has a ‘mixed’ user review rating for all reviews, but a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating for recent reviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

For too long, we’ve let the Terminids wreak havoc on our colonies, our cities, our homes. The Terminids have pushed into our territory for long enough.</blockquote><blockquote>Now, with new recruits trained and ready, it’s time to push into unknown territory. Into the Unjust.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The headline addition here is Hive Worlds, which are randomly-generated giant cave systems packed with horrible Terminids. These Hive Worlds offer a new tactical challenge, Arrowhead said, complete with “disgusting” flora and fauna and “advanced” Terminid life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Holes in the cave roof will allow stratagems to be called down, and destructible walls within the caves let players navigate. “Bring a flashlight!” Arrowhead recommended. New enemies include the wonderfully named Rupture Spewer, the Rupture Warrior, the Rupture Charger, and the Dragonroach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there’s a balance pass and fixes for crashes. Into the Unjust follows the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review-update-now-on-xbox-series-xs">Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X and S</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-newcomers-are-thanking-veteran-helldivers-2-players-for-helping-them-out-and-player-numbers-are-seeing-a-massive-boost-as-a-result">the wholesome community action that came along with it</a>.

                <p>Xbox Series X|S users had to wait an entire year for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-monkey-business/1900-6418269/" data-ref-id="1900-6418269">Black Myth: Wukong</a> to make the leap from PlayStation 5 and PC. Unfortunately, it went through some major compromises and a big visual downgrade according to a comparison by <a href="https://youtu.be/0-10490qd8s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-10490qd8s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0-10490qd8s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Digital Foundry notes that the Xbox Series X port of Black Myth: Wukong can run at a higher resolution (1296p) than PS5 (1080p), which gives it a slight advantage in clarity and detail as well as its ability to deliver 60fps. However, that comes at the expense of the lumen lighting system in performance mode. The intriguing and visually arresting lighting of the PC and PS5 versions are noticeably missing on Xbox Series X. There are also more frequent drops and full-screen tearing on Xbox Series X.</p><p>Xbox Series S has even bigger struggles running Black Myth: Wukong, and can only do so with downgraded visuals and the absence of the lumen lighting system. It was previously rumored that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-developer-says-xbox-port-delay-is-due-to-the-series-s/1100-6528607/" data-ref-id="1100-6528607">technical issues with the Xbox Series S</a> were behind the delay of the game's port, which publisher Game Science denied. The Game Science team has acknowledged that <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=194" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bringing the game to the Xbox consoles was unexpectedly difficult</a>.</p><p>Last month, Game Science announced that Black Myth: Wukong will receive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-black-myth-game-zhong-kui-announced-with-teaser-trailer/1100-6534105/" data-ref-id="1100-6534105">a sequel called Black Myth: Zhong Kui</a>. The development team added that the game is still very early in the process, but it has shared that players "won't be playing a monkey role this time." The studio is also "exploring and experimenting with the concrete differences between Wukong and Zhong Kui."</p>

<p>Details are still pretty slim, but the company could reveal that the demo will be an "offline single-player experience only", so don't expect to be speeding around the track with your pals again before launch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067sotxrg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>And that launch is really rather close. CrossWorlds is set to arrive on Switch 1 on <strong>25th September</strong>, with the Switch 2 version following at a later date in 2025. We have to assume that the demo will arrive at least a week before launch to give people adequate time to try before they buy, so keep an eye out for more details in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, CrossWorlds is already racking up an impressive roster of crossover racers, with even more to come. Across the game's DLC and future upgrades, the likes of SpongeBob SquarePants, Pac-Man, Persona 5's Joker and more will be joining Sonic and co. on the track — just don't expect them to be all that chatty...</p>

<p>Graham Greene lit up screens throughout a glittering 45-year career. The acclaimed actor did it all and has sadly passed away at the age of 73. Many gamers will fondly recognize and remember him for his incredible portrayal of Rains Fall in Rockstar Games’ Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>



<p>My first memory of Graham Greene was his role as Detective Joe Lambert in Die Hard with a Vengeance. He plays a valiant cop who ultimately tries his best to save kids he believes are in mortal danger. This is one of countless roles Graham accrued over his 40-plus-year career before his untimely passing on September 1.</p>



<p>Despite a resume anyone would snatch up in a heartbeat, Graham only had one video game role—Rains Fall in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-could-launch-on-switch-2-this-year-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2-voice-actor-graham-greene-passes-away-aged-73">Red Dead Redemption 2 Voice Actor Graham Greene Passes Away Aged 73</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It will make future RDR2 playthroughs harder. Credit to YouTube channel: <br>I’ll Give You Insight</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’ve played <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RDR2</a>, you know how important Rains Fall is to the story. He does his best to rein in his son—Eagle Flies—and advocates peace wherever possible.</p>



<p>Graham absolutely nails the role perfectly. It’s a wonder that this was his lone video game opportunity when you think about it. Technically, it wasn’t the only gaming project the actor was attached to.</p>



<p>In 2023, Graham played Marlon in HBO’s epic adaptation of Naughty Dog’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-receives-fewer-emmy-nominations-than-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a> for one episode. He was also in 2008’s Turok: Son of Stone—but that reference is a bit more out there.</p>



<p>The actor graced TV shows, movies, and one of the greatest video games of all time, and it’s his role as Rains Fall that further cemented his legacy in the memories of millions of gamers.</p>



<p>Do you have a favorite Graham Greene role over the decades? Let me know, and also let us know if this is giving you the edge to go back and play Red Dead Redemption 2 for the tenth time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The horror shooter vibes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-spectrum">Project Spectrum</a> are absolutely on point as you trudge through dank, foggy, muddy woods on the approach to a decrepit manor. Strange anomalies float in midair in the courtyard, distorting and colouring the air around them, when something fast flashes across the rooftop. Yeah, probably time to set a shovel on fire, just in case.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Spectrum | Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o4cso5zprZk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The world has been transformed by the appearance of Embers in a region that has subsequently been quarantined in what is known as the Ember Zone. Those who exist in this region can become transformed by Emberflux, altering their bodies and minds, but you have to gather a group of Agents and then send them in to try and neutralise the threat regardless. On the surface level, this game looks like a horror-infused extraction shooter, but Vice Game Director Rich Fu explains a different path that Project Spectrum is taking:</p>


<p>“We are different from the traditional extraction shooter, we are more like a CRPG [for progression]. One thing that we might think about is that, for instance, the characters or agents that you’re recruiting [and play as] in the game, if that character dies, they might just die! We wanted to be different from the traditional extraction shooter, like Tarkov, in terms of when you are searching for materials in the game and stuff like that.”</p>


<p>Project Spectrum is not a game that you’ll play alone, though, heading in as a squad, exploring this manor and trying to defeat the supernatural monsters you’ll find within. The atmosphere that Project Spectrum conjures up here is there with the very best, with creepy off-angle lighting such that you’ll need your flashlight or lighter, music randomly playing on a gramophone, and rooms where you can practically smell the musty rotting wood from the ruined decor. You might be playing together, but that doesn’t make it feel any less creepy, especially if you choose to split up.</p>
<p>The gameplay demo we saw took us to one of three points of interest in a wider world –&nbsp;alongside the manor, a fishery and a hospital were also options –&nbsp;but the full game will have a larger map to explore. Players will be turning up rather well equipped with modern guns, tactical gear and equipment to spot and track the anomalies –&nbsp;a camera that can highlight their location through walls and scenery –&nbsp;and there’s an emphasis to approaching quietly through the gameplay we’ve seen so far. This goes right down to trying to avoid crunching across broken glass, and hastily improvising a silencer with the crafting system, though I’m not sure what use a drinks can stuffed with cloth would actually be in reality. When it’s time to go loud, crafting molotov cocktails and the aforementioned fire shovel are also options.</p>

<p>And going loud can become a very quick necessity. I’ve buried the lede somewhat, as this isn’t even just a co-op horror game, but rather has PvPvE layered in as well. Other teams of players can be hunting the same anomaly, or looking to wait and attack you while you’re distracted or wounded, and this is another big reason for the cautious and quieter approach, as well as placing trip wires and other traps to prevent getting caught from behind while investigating.</p>
<p>Human combat will have a familiar tactical battle feel of many contemporary online shooters, but fighting the Emberborne monsters will rip you straight back to the horror shooter tone. As seen in the trailer, the towering, cloaked creature, seemingly made up of many masks can quickly shift around the environment, forcing you to spin and figure out where they are again, following the refracted light trails they leave while moving so quickly. Worse than that, as you deal damage, they can crumble down into basically a giant pile of masks with spider legs that splits and skitters around – a damage opportunity for your team, but also horrifying to the arachnophobic. Finally, we see the flaming spade set alight to swing at this enemy, which definitely does not like fire one bit.</p>

<p>All through this, your character’s sanity is being tested and drained, simply by existing in this tortured, twisted region. First by the depressing effect of trudging through the rainy woods to reach the manor, then by the dark and creepy environment, and then by facing the Emberborne themselves. Low sanity can lead to very obvious negatives, hallucinating shadowy enemies that can obscure and confound your view of the game.</p>
<p>But it’s not always bad, as Rich tells us, “Let’s talk about the disadvantages first. For the sanity level and its effect, there is a term in the game that we call Emberflux, and this means that human beings are being affected by the Ember. For the debuff, you can have a lot of illusions, but once you reach a certain level you might even see the perspective from other entities…. but I cannot tell you more than that for now!</p>
<p>“Then for the advantages, we have different characters with different abilities for how they are living with the sanity level, especially when it is low. For instance, some characters might get some new abilities, or their abilities might be stronger when the sanity level is low. And for another perspective, there’s the map exploration. You will only get to see some things when your sanity level is low, which could be a shortcut, certain rooms, certain areas, views or visuals which will help you to explore.</p>
<p>“But the key idea here for us is that we want to let the players choose whether they want to maintain a high level of sanity or low. They can take some risks to experience a different style of gameplay, or they can just make it safe.”</p>
<p>With the anomaly and an opposing team defeated, you’d think that’s job done, but there’s a further layer to this PvPvE game: the Executioner. This is another Ember-infused monster, a blob with smokey tendrils that it walks on in an alien fashion, but instead of being another Emberborne, this is another player that’s on the hunt. It’s an injection of the kinds of asynchronous multiplayer horror from the likes of Dead by Daylight, or perhaps more accurately Evolve.</p>

<p>Switching to the Executioner’s view, and their power is immediately clear to see with great traversal possibilities, climbing up to rooftops, blinking to new locations, and trying to use hit and run tactics. Of course, you can still be defeated, but it’s a fun twist to have yet another wildcard like this in the game. The curious element that’s yet to truly be revealed is how you become an Executioner. Is this a distinct character that you queue up to play as? Is it a sanity-driven transformation that you can aim to unlock mid-game? Surely you won’t have any allegiances to former teammates in that case…</p>
<p>This won’t be the only style of player monster that is in the game, though. Rich told us, “For the current Executioner, it’s only one of its forms. it also has other formats, and of course, we will have other Executioners added in the future, because we really consider this asymmetric gameplay a very important part of the game, so it has to be globally anticipated, so that is why we put a lot of effort on this.”</p>
<p>Project Spectrum is a fascinating blend of genres and ideas that has echoes of Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown and more, but by injecting sanity effects and abilities, giving players the chance to be the monster for asymmetrical battles, it’s creating something new and distinctive.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's been a little while since we got another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> tease that makes folks wonder whether CD Projekt are about to u-turn on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">adding more stuff to it</a> yet again. Here one is, though, and it invites us 2025 dwellers to help out a president who isn't elected in-universe until 2065.</p>
<p>Is it evidence that the NUSA have invented time travel tech that also allows Cyberpunk characters to migrate into our own reality? Is it just a way to spice up some promo for something like a livestream or minor reveal? I mean, almost definitely the latter, but the former's a lot more fun to consider.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, the tease. NUSA president Rosalind Myers, the one from Cyberpunk's Phantom Liberty expansion, needs "brave netrunners" to help her nation overcome a "mounting cybersecurity threat". The plea's dated September 4th, 2025, which is in the future, but not quite far enough into the future to match up with Myers' in-game presidential term. That kicks off in 2065, which is why she's still in power by the time V meets her in 2077.</p>
<p>What's president Roz doing teasing things dated about 40 years before she takes office, that're also happening in a different universe? Are Arasaka about to take over the official Witcher socials to post their own messages to us, inciting a seven hundredth corporate Twitter war? Are Kang Tao about to reveal they're behind the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">mysterious Project Hadar</a>? As I say, probably not. If this is anything, the netrunner "recruitment test" aspect seems to hint at an ARG of some sort being in the offing.</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Naturally, some fans have immediately gone off the deep end with extra expansion theories. If that's you, it's maybe worth bearing in mind that CD Projekt senior community manager Amelia Korzycka has responded to one user on the tweeter asking what the tease is with <a href="https://x.com/Lilayaah/status/1962521644041121965">the following message</a>: "All I can say is it's not the DLC and it's not the patch."
 </p>
<p>"'The' DLC? Instead of 'a' DLC?Y ou're gonna dive people crazy, you know that right? Me included," another user replied to Korzycka. "Is there an expansion DLC in the works?" The community manager, I assume after a deep sigh, has simply <a href="https://x.com/Lilayaah/status/1962759935608938808">responded to this query</a> with a "No."</p>
<p>Given that, I'd very much temper your expectations. It'd be foolish to totally rule out CD Projekt adding yet more stuff to Cyberpunk given the past few years, though. Here's hoping they at least explain Myers' ability to move through time and space.</p>
<p>Has it required her to fork over a bit of her brain space to Neo from The Matrix doing his best dickhead rock singer impression? Will Cyberpunk 2 be about stopping Roz and/or Idris Elba's Solomon Reed from going back in time to kill one of V's ancestors while dressed in leather and speaking like the most Austrian cyborg you've ever met? We need answers.</p>

<p>The Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test was the game’s first proper hands-on opportunity. Don’t cry because it’s over, smile that it happened. Or if that doesn’t work, you can always enjoy the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds demo speeding your way.</p>



<p>This isn’t Sonic’s first foray into kart racers. Team Sonic Racing performed very well, and clearly well enough to warrant a full sequel. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworld-release-date-trailer-features-minecraft-persona-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> is that very sequel, and it’s just had its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Network Test</a>. These types of tests are common and an easy way to ascertain a multiplayer title’s online connectivity and stability.</p>



<p>The beta has finished, meaning if you didn’t get a chance to log in, you’ve missed this window. But as one door closes, another opens.</p>

<p>We’ve learned that Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is debuting a new single-player demo in “mid-September,” thanks to the Sonic The Hedgehog <a href="https://x.com/sonic_hedgehog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X page</a>.</p>



<p>“The Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test has officially ended! Thank you everyone for participating! And in case you missed it… A single-player demo will be released in mid-September! We hope you keep coming back for more races!” said the page in a September 2 message.</p>



<p>September is a busy month in the gaming calendar. The likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-26-announces-12-new-icons-including-francesco-totti-andres-iniesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC 26</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a> are some of the monstrous names propping up the month. If you can find time, a Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds demo will be wedged into the middle of this.</p>

            <p>
Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto has claimed the "PS5 barrier" for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is "unexpectedly large", which has limited the game's success on Sony's console.
</p>
<p>
Tsujimoto was interviewed by <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en">Nikkei</a> back in May, though just recently published (and translated on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-president-regarding-building-upon-wilds-initial-sales-we-found-that-the-ps5-barrier-is-unexpectedly-large-ps5-the-main-platform-for-mhw.1285902/">ResetEra</a>), where he discussed the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-rises-beyond-another-impressive-milestone-in-first-month">initial 10m sales in its first month of release</a>. 
</p>
<p>
He stated PS5 was considered the main platform for the game, however the steep price of both the console and the game itself - especially in comparison to previous entries in the series now available on sale - had an impact on sales. In particular, younger generations are often unable to afford such high prices.

<p>
Capcom therefore aims to boost sales of the game with limited time sales - it had a 20 percent reduction at the end of June, for instance.
</p>
<p>
More interestingly, Tsujimoto commented on the popularity of Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, stating despite the price the "response was better than we had expected".
</p>
<p>
There's no indication here that Monster Hunter Wilds will appear on Switch 2 anytime soon. However, the series has a long history with handheld consoles from both Nintendo and Sony, with previous entry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> releasing on Switch before other platforms.
</p>
<p>
However, with the multitude of performance issues across both home consoles and PC with Monster Hunter Wilds, a Switch 2 version seems ambitious at this point.
</p>
<p>
It's particularly interesting PS5 was considered the primary platform, considering the vast majority of sales for Monster Hunter Wilds have actually been on PC. It perhaps explains why the PC version of the game, with its much-criticised performance issues, is yet to be properly optimised - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-players-wait-almost-a-year-for-better-performance-capcom-is-in-danger-of-losing-its-most-important-audience">PC players will be waiting almost a year for a comprehensive fix</a>.
</p><p>
Ahead of the game's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-producer-acknowledges-importance-of-pc-platform-and-crossplay">producer Ryozo Tsujimoto noted there are "more players than ever playing on PC, including in Japan"</a> so Capcom sees "room for the series to capture new players who haven't tried it before if that's their chosen platform". At the least, Capcom was aware of the game's potential PC popularity.

            <p>On the 30th anniversary of the Rayman series, brand producer Loic Gounon spoke about the history of the series, and provided a little teaser of what's to come.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694">video posted on the official Rayman X account</a>, which had been dormant for years prior to today, Gounon stated: "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working on the future of Rayman. Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>To mark the 30th anniversary of Rayman, Gounon also announced Ubisoft will be sharing behind-the-scenes anecdotes, interviews, concept art and more to make it a momentous occasion for the series, and give back to fans who've remained true to Rayman even now.</p>

<p>Composer for the Rayman series Christophe Heral then appeared in the video, thanking fans for lovely messages, saying he loves them very much, and playing a sweet performance to cap the whole thing off.</p>
<p>Rayman is one of Ubisoft's defining IPs, even if it's been left a bit by the wayside in recent years. It's nice to know some movement is happening on a new game, even if we won't be seeing it any time soon.</p>

<p>Naturally, the update mostly concerns backers who supported the project back in the 19th century, with Team Cherry providing advice on how to ensure the correct delivery of game keys and, more specifically, what Switch 2 owners will need to do to unlock the game's full potential on Nintendo's new console.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067sotxrg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>In a nutshell, Switch backers will be receiving their codes via email. Those on Switch 2 will then need to download the game itself <em>and</em> an additional free upgrade pack to unlock the enhanced features (i.e. higher frame rates, etc).</p>
<p>Otherwise, backers who have yet to complete their surveys will need to do so soon in order to receive the relevant download key. If you're one of these and you happen to miss the cut-off point tomorrow, then you can still receive your game by reaching out to the team directly. All details can be found on the Kickstarter page linked.</p>
<p>For everyone else, Hollow Knight: Silksong <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/hollow-knight-silksongs-price-has-been-officially-announced">has been priced</a> at <strong>$19.99 / €19.99 / ¥2300</strong> and will launch on <strong>Thursday, 4th September 2025</strong>. Specific release times, as detailed by Team Cherry, will be <strong>7am PT / 10am ET / 3pm BST / 4pm CEST / 11PM JST</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>POE2 player numbers have been dwindling in recent weeks. This happens to many games after their initial launch and hype. But players have flooded back to Path of Exile 2 to make player count numbers blow up—thanks to the ‘Third Edict’ update and free weekend incentive.</p>



<p>Arguably, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-all-boss-powers-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo 4</a>‘s biggest competitor is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-2-best-class-build-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a>. The ARPG launched to great success in December 2024. Over half a million of you flooded the Path of Exile 2 servers to see what the fuss was all about. Peak numbers were still close to the 200K mark by January 2025, and things have tailed off a bit—save for the April 2025 update.</p>



<p> However, a free weekend opportunity combined with a huge new content update has revitalized the ARPG sequel once more.</p>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-third-edict-update-amp-free-weekend-boosts-numbers">Path of Exile 2 Third Edict Update &amp; Free Weekend Boosts Numbers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roaring back into life. Image credit: Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Path of Exile 2 was free-to-play for everyone from August 29 to September 1. Whether you own the game or don’t, everyone was entitled to download the game and try it out.</p>



<p>This was to get as many eyes and hours on the game’s Third Edict content update as possible.</p>



<p>According to the POE 2 <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3826469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>: “You will get access to all the content currently available in Path of Exile 2, including the newly released Third Edict Content Update. There are no limits to character leveling, and all progress made during this period will be saved to your account. When the Free Weekend ends, you can continue playing by purchasing an Early Access key or by waiting until Path of Exile 2 becomes free to play at full release.”</p>



<p>For reference, Steam Charts says Path of Exile 2 achieved around 8,000 players on average in July 2025, with a peak of around 14,000. Whereas August 2025 saw an average of about 25,000 users, but a peak of over 352,000! The average would’ve been low throughout the whole month, up until the free weekend right at the end of the month.</p>



<p>Did you get a chance to play Path of Exile 2 during the free weekend? Are you going to continue to play it? It seems to be a bold strategy that paid off for Grinding Gear Games. If you agree or disagree, let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reputable social media has found traces of the first Marvel Rivals PS4 update. It’s long been suspected that a PS4 version of the superhero shooter would happen eventually, thank the Star Lord, it seems to be coming.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-does-c9-mean-in-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> has been a huge hit for NetEase Games. It’s surprising, really, as Marvel fans are insatiable for the hero shooter and anything Marvel-related in general. It takes the best of Overwatch and sprinkles in its own flair and features to make an excellent free-to-play shooter.</p>



<p>Many people still haven’t made the step up to current-gen hardware, and if you’re a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-marvel-rivals-on-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS4</a> user, it might be good news for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-on-ps4-update-discovered">Marvel Rivals On PS4 Update Discovered</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A confusing message. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>, this has been uncovered: “Marvel Rivals Update 01.01 Released. (PS4 Version).”</p>



<p>This would suggest the first update and patch notes for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-version-might-become-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals’ debut on PS4</a>. This is the most recent update on the port, and the X page posted on August 13 with another message indicating the port was happening: “Marvel Rivals – PS4.”</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals on PlayStation 4 feels like reality more than a dream, and if you are a last-gen owner, you finally get to see what the fuss is all about. Also, I’d hazard a guess that if Marvel Rivals is coming to older PlayStation hardware, then Xbox One owners might also be in luck! I’m worried about the game’s performance, but let’s hope it holds up!</p>



<p>Stay tuned for updates and details.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-rayman-game-ubisoft-milan-montpellier/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-rayman-game-in-development-at-ubisoft-milan-and-montpellier.1286091/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of the celebrations for the 30th anniversary of Rayman, Ubisoft has confirmed that Ubisoft Milan, which was previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/rayman-aaa-game-in-the-works-at-ubisoft-milan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> to be working on a new installment of the franchise, is partnering with Ubisoft Montpellier on this project.</p>



<p>Loic Gounon, Brand Producer for the IP, <a href="https://x.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595264390218129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a video message</a>:</p>



<p><em>A bit about myself: I joined Ubisoft twenty years ago, and I've been on the franchise since 2006 on projects such as Rayman Raving Rabbids, Rayman Origins, and Rayman Legends. Rayman was born at Ubisoft Montpellier back in 1995, and for the past thirty years, he has gone on many adventures thanks to studios across the world</em> <em>like Ubisoft Paris, Ubisoft Milan, or Ubisoft Annecy. Starting now and across our community channels, we are taking a moment to celebrate this incredible history by looking back. We will be sharing behind the scenes, anecdotes, developer interviews, concept art, and more throughout the months to come. Rayman couldn't have become such a legend without all of you, the fans. You have helped to keep his legacy going, and we're incredibly thankful for that. As we said in the past, a very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working together on the future of Rayman. Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured, Rayman is in good hands.</em></p>



<p>Fans of the peculiar limbless creature must arm themselves with a lot of patience, as triple-A game development can take a very long time these days. The only tidbit we have on the project is <a href="https://wccftech.com/rayman-remake-prince-of-persia-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from a rumor</a> that circulated last October, when Insider Gaming said this would be a remake of a prior title. Tom Henderson is usually extremely well informed when it comes to Ubisoft, so it's likely that the info is correct and a remake, rather than a new game, is on the way.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Which Call of Duty is Free?—Play COD For Free, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/which-call-of-duty-is-free/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/which-call-of-duty-is-free-%E2%80%94play-cod-for-free-explained.1286088/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty has existed for more than two decades, and in that time, dozens of games have been released to flesh out the franchise. It’s arguably the most popular first-person shooter series of all time, and today, we’re helping people get a taste of it by answering an all-important question: ‘Which Call of Duty is free?’</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll outline which Call of Duty games are free and which ones you need to pay for.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-free-call-of-duty-games">Are There Free Call of Duty Games?</h2>



<p>Few franchises sell quite so many copies as Call of Duty does. It’s a titan of the gaming industry, and every year, even amidst bad press, the annual Call of Duty release tops the charts. In 2022, Modern Warfare II was released, and within ten days, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-2-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had topped $1 billion in sales</a>.</p>



<p>However, as it’s a premium franchise, Call of Duty can be expensive, and typically, every new title will boast a top-tier pricing point as well as a paid battle pass and other in-game bundles and items that also cost real money. It can get very pricey, very quickly, and for some players, the need to find a free Call of Duty game arises. </p>



<p>With that in mind, which Call of Duty is free?</p>



<h2 id="h-good-news-you-can-play-call-of-duty-for-free">Good News: You <em>Can </em>Play Call of Duty For Free</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image Credit: Activision</figcaption></figure>







<p>There are two ways that you can play Call of Duty for free, and they’re both dramatically popular. </p>



<p>Firstly, there’s the Warzone ecosystem. This battle-royale-backed platform features one of the most popular titles to ever emerge into the genre, boasting hundreds of millions of players and an ever-changing landscape. It debuted in 2020, and in the years that it has been active, it has seen all-new maps, modes, events, and the growth of a massive community.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Warzone (in every capacity) is free to play across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms – it’s also a crossplay title, which has served to unite cross-platform players. There’s a possibility that Warzone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-mwii-ported-to-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will also be available on Nintendo devices</a>.</p>



<p>If Warzone isn’t your kind of thing, then you can get started with the <em>other </em>free Call of Duty game – COD Mobile. This is a handheld-exclusive game that has existed since 2019, and it’s a monumental title that, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1112479/call-of-duty-mobile-downloads-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to Statista</a>, secures around four million new downloads every single month.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Mobile incorporates content from several successful COD games, featuring a wide range of game modes, a battle royale mode, and plenty of customisation options. It’s free-to-play, but there are many microtransactions under the surface that fuel the development of the game itself.</p>



<p>That answers the titular question, ‘which Call of Duty is free’. There’s a battle royale platform that also includes an extraction shooter sub-mode and a mobile platform that is ever-expanding. That’s not a bad selection, considering it’ll cost you absolutely nothing to get involved with either of them!</p>

						<h5>Corsair Void Wireless v2</h5><p><span>April 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Type</h5><p><span>Wireless gaming headset</span>

							<h5>Price</h5><p><span>$119.99 (currently discounted to $89.99)</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Corsair’s Void line has been among my favorites for some time now —solid gaming audio, cool looks, and a price that doesn’t make my wallet cry. The Corsair Void Wireless v2, priced at $119.99, steps up from the old Void RGB Elite Wireless with a featherlight design, a mic that’s ready for prime time, and battery life that just keeps going. It’s got some quirks, especially for console players, but for PC gamers, this thing’s a steal. Let’s dive in and see what it’s packing.</p>



<p><strong>Design and features</strong></p>



<p>The Void Wireless v2 rocks that bold, angular Void style—like something out of a sci-fi flick. Available in Carbon or White, it’s got RGB strips on the earcups you can tweak via Corsair’s iCUE software. It’s not subtle, but I’m here for it. At just 303g, this headset is crazy light, making it a dream for long sessions. The microfiber mesh earpads and memory foam headband feel soft and breathable, and the adjustable headband keeps it snug without squeezing your head.</p>

<p>Controls live on the left earcup: a power button (which also swaps between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth), a programmable button, and a volume rocker you can tap for custom tricks in iCUE. The non-detachable mic is super flexible, with enough adjustment options. Flip-to-mute is a nice touch, and the build feels solid, though the plastic-heavy frame doesn’t scream “luxury” like Corsair’s high-end stuff.</p>



<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>



<p><span>Comfort</span><br>At 303g, the Void Wireless v2 is like wearing nothing at all. I’ve rocked it through marathons, and my ears stayed cool thanks to the breathable mesh and plush foam. Glasses-wearers like me will love the light clamping force, though the earcups can feel a bit small, sometimes brushing my ears. It’s not perfect, but it’s comfortable enough for the price.</p>



<p><span>Connectivity</span><br>This headset’s got flexibility for days: low-latency 2.4GHz wireless via a USB-A dongle (50ft range, no dropouts) and Bluetooth for phones, Switch, or other devices. Flipping between modes is as easy as tapping the power button. It works on PC, PS4, PS5, and Mac, but Xbox gamers are out of luck with this one. Additionally, there's no wired option, so be sure to stay on top of the juice left in the battery. Still, Bluetooth makes this a solid pick for bouncing between PC and mobile.</p>

<p><span>Sound Quality</span><br>The 50mm neodymium drivers (20Hz–20kHz) deliver punchy, clear audio that’s great for gaming. Bass thumps in DOOM, and mids keep footsteps and callouts crisp in Rainbow Six Siege. Dolby Atmos on PC adds some immersive flair, but it’s not gonna blow your mind. For gaming and movies, it’s spot-on, but music fans might notice the highs lack a bit of sparkle compared to pricier headsets like the Virtuoso XT. It’s not the best audio out there, but for $120, it gets the job done. Console players, heads-up: you’re locked into the default sound without iCUE.</p>



<p><span>Microphone</span><br>The mic is a straight-up star. It’s omnidirectional, Discord-certified, and picks up your voice clean and clear (-40dB sensitivity). The flexible boom lets you tweak its position to perfection, and flip-to-mute is a lifesaver for quick silences. With the foam windscreen and NVIDIA Broadcast support on PC, it’s great for team comms or casual streaming. It won’t replace a dedicated USB mic, but it’s one of the best I’ve tested at this price.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><span>Battery Life</span><br>Corsair claims 70 hours on 2.4GHz and 130 hours on Bluetooth, and I’m not arguing. I got around 65 hours with RGB off, and a 15-minute charge gave me ~6 hours of juice. Compared to the old Void’s 16 hours, this is next-level. Even with RGB cranked, it lasts longer than most competitors. The USB-C cable makes charging quick and painless.</p>



<p><span>iCUE Software</span><br>iCUE is where PC gamers get the good stuff: RGB tweaking, a 10-band EQ, Dolby Atmos, and button remapping. It’s slick but can be a bit laggy, and console players get none of this magic, which is disappointing. Also, the EQ preset cycling just says “1,” “2,” and so on—no names like “FPS” or “Movie.” It’s a small gripe, but it bugs me when I’m swapping settings blind.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The Corsair Void Wireless v2 is a banger at $119.99. It’s quite comfortable, the mic’s a beast, and the battery life is basically immortal. Sound’s great for gaming, with Dolby Atmos adding some spice, though music snobs might want more. Bluetooth makes it super versatile, but the lack of wired connectivity and iCUE’s PC-only perks mean console gamers miss out on the full package. Compared to the Sony Wireless Gold 7.1 ($85) or Turtle Beach Stealth 600 ($100), it’s got a better mic and battery life, but PS5 players might want more on-headset control. If you’re a PC gamer living in iCUE, this headset’s a no-brainer. Console folks, you might wanna shop around unless you’re cool with basic audio. Either way, the Void Wireless v2 is a solid step up from its predecessor and an excellent pick for the price.</p>
