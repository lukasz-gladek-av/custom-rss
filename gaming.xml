<p>Despite recent downfalls, like that of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tests-avoid-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a>, the free-to-play hero shooter genre continues performing relatively well for a select few titles. It’s hard for a newcomer to make a dent, but it appears Theorycraft Games’ Supervive, launched on November 20, outperforms much of its competition. But it leaves many questions open for fans on the sidelines. For instance, who are the Supervive hunters?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-supervive">What is Supervive?</h2>



<p>Supervive is a free-to-play hero shooter with battle royale and MOBA elements from developer Theorycraft Games. It’s a fast-paced, PvP-oriented experience that favors frantic gameplay in which players will dash and glide while unleashing attack combos to deal damage and complete objectives. Every hero in the game, known as a Hunter, is flexible and allows various abilities and equipment to alter playstyles and change up the match.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-hunters-in-supervive">What Are Hunters in Supervive?</h2>



<p>Hunters in Supervive are this game’s version of heroes. They’re playable characters, each of which fall into five categories:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Fighter</strong></li>



<li><strong>Initiator</strong></li>



<li><strong>Frontliner</strong></li>



<li><strong>Protector</strong></li>



<li><strong>Controller</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Unlike your typical hero shooter, Supervive heavily leans into its MOBA roots to combine elements of the compelling lane-based gameplay in its PvP-focused free-to-play hero shooter.</p>







<h2 id="h-who-are-all-of-the-supervive-hunters-available">Who Are All of the Supervive Hunters Available?</h2>



<p>There are a total of sixteen playable characters in Supervive currently, including:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Brall</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bishop</strong></li>



<li><strong>Celeste</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elluna</strong></li>



<li><strong>Felix</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ghost</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hudson</strong></li>



<li><strong>Jin</strong></li>



<li><strong>Joule</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kingpin</strong></li>



<li><strong>Myth</strong></li>



<li><strong>Oath</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shiv</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shrike</strong></li>



<li><strong>Void</strong></li>



<li><strong>Zeph</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>CD Projekt Red has confirmed that Cyberpunk 2077 is getting another new show adaptation on Netflix.</p>



<p>“I’m also very happy to announce that we’re working on another animation project set in the Cyberpunk universe, which will be released on Netflix,” CD Projekt Red Chief Financial Officer Piotr Nielubowicz said during the <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s earnings call</a> on Tuesday.</p>







<p>There was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-releases-trailers-for-cyberpunk-devil-may-cry-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teaser for a new project</a> from Netflix released in September. However, nothing had been officially announced by CD Projekt Red before the call on November 26. </p>



<p>No other details for the upcoming project were announced by the studio. That information is expected to come in the coming weeks and months. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, a spin-off of the series, is currently available to watch on Netflix. That series was produced by Studio Trigger.</p>



<p>In addition to the outside projects of the series, CD Projekt Red is continuing work on the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. Known as Project Orion, the game currently has 64 people —  just under 10% of the company — working on it. The game is expected to come after the release of the next game in The Witcher series, Project Polaris.</p>

<p>Are you on the hunt for all the legendary artifacts in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>? The Zone is a dangerous place full of wonder and money-making opportunities, and the artifacts you’ll encounter prove to be some of the most lucrative. But they’re also liable to end your run. Here’s a look at the eight legendary artifacts worth the risk!</p>



<h2 id="h-there-are-eight-legendary-artifacts-in-stalker-2">There Are Eight Legendary Artifacts in STALKER 2</h2>



<p>There are eight legendary artifacts in STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl: Compass, Hypercube, Weird Ball, Weird Flower, Liquid Rock, Weird Nut, Heart of Chornobyl, and Thunderberry. We have the descriptions and effects of all these artifacts, so you have the luxury of picking and choosing what you’ll look for!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Compass</strong>: A legendary artifact that can be found in gravitational anomalies. It is believed that whoever discovers and holds the Compass will gain the ability to navigate the Zone safely. Maximum Radiation, Maximum Physical Protection.</li>



<li><strong>Hypercube</strong>: A legendary artifact that can be found in thermal anomalies. The full potential of this artifact has not yet been discovered, but it emits ultra-long radio waves and could be used in space navigation. Maximum Thermal Protection, Maximum Radiation, and Maximum Bleeding Protection.</li>



<li><strong>Weird Ball</strong>: A child’s oddly heavy ball, this legendary “altered item” is often mentioned in hushed tones. If you equip it, it is said to reduce bullet damage in combat while standing still. Unique Effect—Reduces bullet damage when standing still.</li>



<li><strong>Weird Flower</strong>: A unique-looking flower, this legendary “altered item” is often not directly mentioned. If you sleep with this flower on your belt, its fragrance can mask your scent for a limited time. Unique Effect—Sleeping with the flower will cause its fragrance to mask your scent, though the effect diminishes over time.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Liquid Rock</strong>: A legendary artifact that can be found in acid anomalies. The Liquid Rock exhibits properties that allow for migraine management. It must be carried on one’s person to ensure that it works. Maximum Radio Protection, Maximum Chemical Protection.</li>



<li><strong>Weird Nut</strong>: A nut that is eerily cold to the touch, this legendary “altered item” is rumored to promote rapid blood coagulation when on your person, though the wounds take longer to heal. Unique Effect—Promotes rapid blood coagulation when attached to your belt, but the wounds will take longer to heal.</li>



<li><strong>Heart of Chornobyl</strong>: A mythical artifact that functions as a psi-radiation amplifier. The degree of amplification depends on the source’s capabilities and characteristics. Its properties are not fully understood, but it is thought to encapsulate the original structure of the Zone’s matter. Unique Effect—Used in Kalmanov ending.</li>



<li><strong>Thunderberry</strong>: A legendary artifact found in electro anomalies. When heated gradually to 78 degrees Celsius, it produces vibrant collective hallucinations that present a utopia. Maximum Radiation, Maximum Endurance.</li>

After it ended, the central continent was declared a neutral zone. A massive sinkhole called The Scar opened on that continent, and from its depths comes a mysterious substance known as Black Blood that spawns corrupted beings. It’s unknown how this sinkhole came to be, where the Black Blood is coming from, or what waits in the deepest regions of The Scar. That’s where you come in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll join a cast of characters in The Scar, traveling deeper and deeper beneath the surface while facing all manner of enemies that have been corrupted by the Black Blood. You’ll have several different controllable characters to choose from, each with their own strengths and abilities. There’s real-time action combat with a bit of a twist: You and your enemies move between tiles on a grid in which you can only navigate in the four cardinal directions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When an enemy is about to attack, an exclamation mark will appear above their head and the ground will be highlighted showing where their attack will land. Different enemies have different attack patterns — some strike directly in front of them, some hit a long line, and others target a larger area of the grid. You’ll face several enemies at a time, forcing you to stay on your toes and react quickly to dodge attacks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While moving, you can roll to make yourself invincible, but each roll consumes stamina. And since you can’t move diagonally, you’ll need to be strategic about which direction you move and how often you roll. You don’t want to end up trapped between attacks you can’t avoid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat isn’t all about avoiding damage, though. You need to be able to dish it out too, but how you do that changes depending on what character you pick. Before each run, you’ll choose a character and their starting trait. In classic RPG fashion, killing enemies gains experience, which makes you level up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you level up, you’ll unlock choices for skill upgrades that are unique to the trait you picked at the start of the run. These will define the playstyle of that run, so even if you play the same character, runs can play differently depending on the starting trait and upgrades you pick. Your levels and progression selections are exclusive to that run, so when you die, they’ll all reset.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not everything will reset, though. During the course of a run, you’ll come across ore veins you can break to obtain stones, which have their own stats. All the stones in your bag will add together, and reaching certain stat thresholds will give your character buffs. You can equip stones in available slots, which will preserve them even after your run ends. Any unequipped stones in your bag when your run ends will be converted into stone fragments, which can serve as currency or be reforged into new stones by an NPC blacksmith.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During each run, you can also discover special rooms with treasure chests where you can find artifacts. They grant unique buffs and improve your abilities, and over time can build up stacks of elemental effects. If an artifact reaches five stacks, it becomes bonded with a spirit that corresponds to that element and allows you to use unique elemental attacks and effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Becoming bonded to Ignis, the fire spirit, gives you access to a burn debuff that deals continuous damage. Atlen, the water spirit, slows enemies and freezes those with a wet debuff. Rathorus, the lightning spirit, inflicts a shock debuff that deals additional damage. Enryl, the wind spirit, increases your movement speed and enhances multi-hits with a sprint buff. Terrania, the earth spirit, inflicts a petrify debuff that causes fragments to shoot out when you attack petrified enemies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all adds up to a roguelike with a classic “one more run” feeling. Stones provide permanent growth, while your choices for character, starting trait, and ability upgrades make every run different.

The expansion adds a new snow-covered map called Sakhal that spans 83km² (not including ice sheets). There’s a winter wilderness with new challenges and opportunities for survival. “Brace yourself for a truly immersive adventure where the environment itself is as much your adversary as the infected and other survivors,” reads developer Bohemia Interactive’s description.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DayZ players, however, have reacted negatively to Frostline’s price, with Steam user reviews saying it’s “not worth the money.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“... Sakhal does have SOME neat stuff to it, but it is absolutely NOT worth its asking price as of right now,” reads one negative review. “Maybe in time they'll add more interesting features to the map to justify its existence, but right now you can get much better maps for free and Bohemia knows it. If you really want a frozen hellhole experience, play Namalsk. But if you play DayZ on PC I'm sure you already have.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recent reviews for Frostline now have the dreaded ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam, which Bohemia boss Marek Spanel clearly takes issue with. In a <a href="https://x.com/maruksp/status/1861353665455366218" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Spanel revealed that the Czech studio has received less than 10 cents for each hour of live online gaming DayZ has tracked since the game went live over a decade ago, when you factor in the average hours played and dollars spent by the game’s eight million users.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yet DayZ Frostline is currently being review-bombed on the same platform for being too expensive: $26.99 for ‘just a map,’ and some users demand ‘gimme more for less money,’ Spanel continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hmm. Please Please Me.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know that 8 million users for whom we have data on Steam played for an average of 188 hours and paid an average of 30 USD gross in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dayz?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Dayz</a>?

Unfortunately the reaction so far has been largely negative, and that’s because of the apparent prevalence of cheaters who are ruining the integrity of the mode. And yes, as has become Call of Duty tradition, console players are turning off crossplay in a bid to avoid PC cheaters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision said it’s made over 19,000 ranked play bans since the mode launched, and that it was continuing to ramp up its AI systems with code optimizations to accelerate enforcements. “Thanks for your patience as our team continues to fight against cheaters,” Activision added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tweet was met with a healthy dose of scepticism from players, including high-profile Call of Duty content creators and pros. 100 Thieves founder Nadeshot, for example, called Activision’s tweet “complete propaganda.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“... I have played the same cheaters since day one and not a single one has even a scratch on ‘em,” he <a href="https://x.com/Nadeshot/status/1861245061368787123" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. “How could there possibly be 19K accounts banned when the most egregious abusers are giving us the middle finger on the leaderboard? Are we crazy? What is going on?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cheating is not unique to Call of Duty of course, but it has become a significant reputational issue for Activision ever since the free-to-download battle royale Warzone exploded in popularity back in 2020. The mega publisher has spent millions of dollars developing its anti-cheat technology as well as pursuing cheat makers in the courts, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October, ahead of the launch of Black Ops 6, Activision said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-it-wants-to-catch-and-remove-call-of-duty-cheaters-within-1-hour-of-them-being-in-their-first-match">it aimed to kick cheaters out of the game within one hour of them being in their first match</a>. Black Ops 6 launched with an updated version of Ricochet's kernel-level driver (this also applies to Warzone), with new machine-learning behavioral systems focused on speed of detection and the analysis of gameplay to combat aim bots in place. Upgrades were set to launch alongside ranked play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The people behind cheats are organized, illegal groups that pick apart every piece of data within our games to look for some way to make cheating possible," Activision said at the time. "These bad guys are not just some script kiddies poking around with code they found online. They are a collective who profit from exploiting the hard work of game developers across the industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But cheat developers are flawed (clearly – they have to pretend to be good at video games). Every time they cheat, they leave breadcrumbs behind. We’re always looking for those breadcrumbs to find the bad actors and get them out of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

			<p>Today, NCSoft and Amazon Games announced that a new weapon type will be released very soon, on December 5, for the MMORPG Throne and Liberty: the spear. In a dedicated video, the developers went into what makes it unique compared to other melee weapons already in the game:</p>
<p><em>The spear is a fire-attribute close-range weapon. Although it's a melee weapon, you can gain combat advantages through its long reach and pocking plays with throwing mechanics. It enables combo-based combat with fast-tempo skills and has initiating skills that allow you to leap into battle instantly. Overall, it's a hybrid weapon that can fulfill both Tank and DPS roles – what we might call a Bruiser or Fighter – designed specifically for these roles. The existing four Ranged weapons have been performing relatively well in combat by utilizing distance advantages and positional elements.</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore, we needed a weapon that could change the tide of battle. The Spear's image started from concepts like Warrior, Berserker, and Assault Captain. It has defensive characteristics, good mobility, and many utility skills. We designed it to have strategic value on the battlefield. You can look forward to Spear skills useful for dealing with multiple opponents, combat through distance control, and special Spear-specific skills.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><iframe title="THRONE AND LIBERTY | Feature Reveal: The Spear" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tFF6kgNugGM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-already-had-3-million-players-in-its-debut-week-says-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful debut outside of Korea</a> (even in the face of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-wants-to-grow-throne-and-liberty-into-a-respected-global-ip-but-cancels-two-games-amid-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal restructuring at NCSoft</a>), Throne and Liberty just received four new endgame 2-Star Dungeons last week: Carmine Rage Island, Voidwastes, Island of Terror, and Valley of Slaughter.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Amazon Games Globalization Design Manager Daniel Lafuente (whom we interviewed before the game's launch) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y91MABfDFc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the new PvP War Games feature will be introduced to Throne and LIberty on December 5 as well.</p>
<p><em>War Games provides a custom Lobby feature for Conquest battles or Rift Stones and Boon Stones. Within the War Games menu, players can create their custom lobby, selecting what stone they want to fight over, the number of teams that will fight, and the size of each team. Then players join in, and once the lobby is full, you start the match. My favorite thing is you can do private and public matches, so we think the use cases for players is going to be that huge competitive PVP guilds can use it for practices, while less competitive guilds can do inner Guild skirmishes with their friends.</em></p>
<p>There won't be any rewards related to War Games for the time being, but that might change in the future after Amazon and NCSoft have gathered the community's feedback.</p>

            <p>
Just when you thought you'd played all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> - maxed every last stat, drained the XP of every last creature, tap-danced your way along every branching questline - CD Projekt have announced that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> is in "full-scale production".
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"I'm pleased to announce that several weeks ago it moved on to full-scale production," chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz said of the game, currently codenamed Polaris, during the company's <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2024.pdf">latest quarterly earnings presentation</a> to investors (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-says/">VGC</a>). "Of all our projects, this one is currently the most far along, and we're starting the most intensive phase of development."
</p>
<p>
Game director Sebastian Kalemba has also been <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571">talking the announcement up on social media</a>. "No stopping now!" he thrilled. "Stay tuned for what's on the other side of the coin!" The post accompanies a photograph of a coin - see this article's header - on which are engraved rays of light above a cliffside and some runes. Do you know what, I bet there's a picture of a Witcher on the other side of that coin! Perhaps a picture of a Witcher accompanying the words "Witcher 4".
</p>
<p>
The next Witcher game may not be called The Witcher 4, mind you. I attended a sci-fi writing class once in which the tutor grouchily remarked that book publishers get leery about overtly episodic fantasy stories, because "why would I buy Frostblazen Book XII when I haven't bought and read Frostblazen Books I-XI". I imagine video game publishers have similar concerns. It's been a fair old while since The Witcher 3's release - calling it Witcher 4 might scare away players who missed the last game. Perhaps they'll give it an annoying subtitle, instead, or just chicken out and call it "The Witcher", as with Lords Of The Fallen.
</p><p>
As of this March, there were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witcher-4-is-more-than-the-witcher-3-in-new-clothing-promise-cdpr-as-over-400-devs-work-on-polaris">over 400 CD Projekt staff</a> working on Polaris. It'll be the first in a new trilogy of Witcher games. CD Projekt's other current endeavours include a Witcher 1 Remake, developed in collaboration with Fool's Theory, Project Sirius, a Witcher spin-off with multiplayer elements from The Molasses Flood, and Project Orion, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-project-devs-want-to-call-out-big-problems-like-homelessness-and-the-wealth-gap-in-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">the next Cyberpunk game</a>. 
</p>
<p>
What does "full-scale production" mean? It's a blurry category, but basically, it's the longer part of development after the more open-ended <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-latest-next-cyberpunk-game-might-have-multiplayer-witcher-4-enters-production-phase">pre-production phase</a> when things like character models, environments and combat systems are actually being made and finished. I am very much squinting at the tea leaves, here, but it's probably safe to say that CD Projekt will formally announce the thing and share a few videos and images next year.

<p>The world of the extraction shooter continues growing monthly as indie developers jump into the fray with their vision of the genre. Some choose to combine horror elements; others stick with tried-and-tested realism formulas. But one king reigns supreme, and that’s Escape From Tarkov. It’s the one extraction shooter every other title strives to topple. Thanks to a Black Friday deal, you can score Escape From Tarkov cheap!</p>



<h2 id="h-buy-escape-from-tarkov-for-25-off-for-black-friday">Buy Escape From Tarkov for 25% Off for Black Friday</h2>



<p>If you’re one of the many who don’t yet own Escape From Tarkov but have your sights set on the extraction shooter genre, this Black Friday deal should be on your radar. You can score the extraction shooter king cheap—<strong>25% off</strong>—for a limited time between <strong>November 28 and November 30</strong>.</p>



<p>This deal includes all of the game’s various editions. That said, Battlestate Games was quick to tell everyone the 50% discount for upgrading from the Edge of Darkness Edition to The Unheard Edition does not, unfortunately, stack with the Black Friday discount.</p>



<p>Furthermore, it doesn’t appear any of the expansions or additional packages available, like the stash upgrade, will receive similar discounts.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-included-in-each-edition-of-escape-from-tarkov">What’s Included in Each Edition of Escape From Tarkov?</h2>



<p>There are currently four versions of Escape From Tarkov available, ranging in price from $50 to $250 without the current Black Friday discount. Again, that discount kicks in on November 28.</p>

</ul>

The storyline continues with the Requiem crew after their escape from Terminus. And in the first cinematic trailer for the new map, the team runs into an old friend, Sergei Ravenov.</p><p>Most of the trailer takes place from Sergei's perspective, and he's genuinely surprised to see his old allies alive. But this isn't a social call, as the team is looking for a man named Craft who "may be able to bring back Maxis." Presumably they're referring to Samantha Maxis, an adversary-turned-ally before her untimely demise when she sacrificed herself to seal the Dark Aether portal.</p>

		<p>King of Meat is getting a closed alpha test in December, Glowmade and Amazon’s chaotic four player gameshow dungeon ’em up opening the castle gates to invited played on PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> for a limited period of time – <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us/news/articles/king-of-meat-lights-camera-alpha">you can sign up here</a> for a chance to take part.</p>
<p>But what is King of Meat? Well, here’s where a handy new series of videos comes in, explaining the over-the-top medieval world, the co-op hack ‘n’ slash action, and how user generated content comes into the mix as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="What is King of Meat Episode 1: Co-Op Mayhem" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KbFIZ1jlMB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Taking place in the world of Loregok, King of Meat tasks players with completing quick dungeon courses filled with dungeons, trolls, skeletons and traps. But this isn’t actually back in the heyday of fantasy, because there’s all of the glitz and glamour of gameshow stardom, the hyper-capitalism of the modern world smashed into the fantasy setting.</p>
<p>You’ll have to work together with your team to overcome each room of enemies and traps, but at the same time, you’ll want to be the first among equals. On the other hand, you might want to instead be the best level creator out there, earning plaudits for your devilish creations as teams take them on.</p>

<p>You can really see Glowmade’s heritage shining through here, with the studio based in Guildford and featuring developers who previously worked on LittleBigPlanet at Media Molecule and Fable at Lionhead.</p>
<p>For the time being, Glowmade is keeping King of Meat testing private. This is a closed alpha test that is invite-only and will require you to agree to an NDA. Invites will be sent out on 3rd December, before the test gets underway on 4th December for a limited time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This afternoon, CD Projekt RED VP and Game Director Sebastian Kalemba <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571?t=qKSrHnijalfbeBpYM8C1lw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> via Twitter (X) that The Witcher 4 is officially in full scale production after recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-pre-production-is-almost-over-says-cd-projekt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ending</a> the pre-production phase. He also shared his confidence that the new saga could be a remarkable experience for fans.</p>
<p><em>I'm thrilled to announce that Project Polaris has entered the full-scale production phase! With new challenges just around the corner, it’s the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what’s on the other side of the coin!⚔️</em></p>
<p>Kalemba shared a picture with the tweet. This could be our very first look at The Witcher 4.</p>

<p>We first heard of the new game over two and a half years ago when CD Projekt RED also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-next-game-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>they were abandoning their own REDEngine in favor of Epic's Unreal Engine 5 technology. At the time, they called it a true partnership where they would also contribute back to the game-making tool. CTO Paweł Zawodny said:</p>
<p><em>From the outset, we did not consider a typical licensing arrangement; both we and Epic see this as a long-term, fulfilling tech partnership. It is vital for CD Projekt Red to have the technical direction of our next game decided from the earliest possible phase as; in the past, we spent a lot of resources and energy to evolve and adapt REDengine with every subsequent game release. This cooperation is so exciting, because it will elevate development predictability and efficiency, while simultaneously granting us access to cutting-edge game development tools. I can’t wait for the great games we’re going to create using Unreal Engine 5!</em></p>
<p>The switch could speed up the development of future games, but that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-not-speeding-development-cdpr-hopes-helps-in-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won't apply</a> to The Witcher 4, since the team is still familiarizing itself with the new tool. When he <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-aims-to-go-beyond-current-rpgs-says-cdpr-itll-be-a-good-entry-point-for-new-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke</a> about the new installment last year, Sebastian Kalemba teased that the studio aims to surpass current RPGs with new <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-wont-just-retread-the-last-game-adding-new-features-and-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">features and mechanics</a> that break boundaries. Moreover, the new The Witcher game will be a great entry point for newcomers.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-polaris-first-character/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> the first actor who will work on the game. That info also revealed how voice-over and motion capture will begin in 2025. It's hard to say exactly when The Witcher 4 could launch, but it will be at least a couple more years if not more. Until then, you can beautify The Witcher 3 NextGen Edition with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-is-finally-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HalkHogan's definitive texture mod</a>.</p>

Hudson left BioWare in 2014 for a brief stint at Microsoft Studios before returning to BioWare in 2017. Then in 2020, he left BioWare for good saying it was time to, “make way for the next generation of studio leaders.”</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption>Key Art from Humanoid Origin’s unreleased game</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Humanoid Origin</cite></p></div></div><p>In 2022, Humanoid Studios <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2022/3/22/22991023/mass-effect-casey-hudson-humanoid-new-sci-fi-game">announced its first project</a>, “a multi-platform AAA title focused on character-driven narrative in an&nbsp;all-new science fiction universe.” Beyond concept art on the studio’s website, little was known about the game.

With a unique premise, including possession and body horror, along with a vibrant city full of glowing neon lights illuminating the ever-present darkness, the third-person action-oriented horror game stood a great chance at making waves. Despite the studio’s reputation and history, they remained an indie outfit, which likely explains the game’s somewhat soft, understated reception. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196572,196411" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Slitterhead</em> achieved some respectable numbers on launch and garnered “Very Positive” reviews on Steam. Like any new game release, there were plenty of negative reviews from users who found the overall experience bland, low-budget, or outright janky due to its controls and combat mechanics. From firsthand experience, combat was somewhat awkward initially, but it’s rather easy to pick up the core components, making it an overall breeze to defeat the creatures known as Slitterheads.</p><p>On the positive review side of things, most players love the unique combat mechanics and world design, along with the creatures themselves. They point toward the engaging gameplay, a distinct experience breaking from the norm, and a nostalgia trip back to the days of PlayStation 2-era gaming. Many of these reviews seem overzealous in their search for nostalgic gaming experiences, but if <em>Slitterhead </em>speaks to them in such a way, there’s nothing wrong with letting others enjoy the game to such great heights!</p><p>But on the negative review side, many players found the gameplay dated and dull, calling it a remaster of old titles. Others wanted a pure survival horror game, and the reliance on combat really pushed them out of the experience.</p><p><em>Slitterhead </em>is undoubtedly a unique experience that, years down the line, many might come to consider a hidden gem, thanks in no small part to a cult following. It’s that type of game. But if you’re on the fence now and are looking for some unique perspectives, here’s <em>Slitterhead</em>, as told by Steam reviews!</p><hr><figure id="" data-id="5b4e4a413bbcda2ce885b509ff206d7d"

<p>CD Project Red has confirmed that that The Witcher 4, currently known as Project Polaris, has officially entered full production.</p>



<p>The announcement came as part of the studio’s <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q3 2024 earnings report</a> on Tuesday. </p>



<p>“I’m pleased to announce that several weeks ago it moved on to full-scale production,” Piotr Nielubowicz, CD Projekt Red chief financial officer, said during the earnings call.</p>



<p>“Of all our projects, this one is currently the most far along, and we’re starting the most intensive phase of development. I wish to thank the team and I’m keeping my fingers crossed for further progress.”</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Game Director Sebastian Kalemba added, “With new challenges just around the corner, it’s the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what’s on the other side of the coin.”</p>



<p>As of October 31, 2024, the studio has 400 people working exclusively on The Witcher 4. It’s slightly down from the 410 reported in July as the studio moved those employees to other projects within the company. Still, the number represents just over 61% of the company working on the next game of the franchise.</p>



<p>First announced in October 2022, a release date for The Witcher 4 has not yet been announced. Polaris is being called the beginning of a new Witcher saga that will span another new Trilogy for the series. For fans of the first trilogy, the new game will still see a continuation of&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-4-geralts-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geralt of Rivia’s story</a> in some form.</p>

This is actually down from 410 people as of July 31, 2024, before the game entered full production.</p><p>CD Projekt has a number of other games in the works, too, including Orion (the next Cyberpunk game), which has 64 people working on it now. Then there's Sirius (a Witcher spin-off) that has 32 people working on it. A total of 15 people are working on Hadar (a new IP), while other staff are contributing to "shared services" and other projects. You can see a headcount breakdown in the graphic below.</p><p>Not much is known about The Witcher 4, or whatever the game might be called. Management previously indicated, back in 2022, that The Witcher 4 would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-2025-at-the-soonest/1100-6508062/" data-ref-id="1100-6508062">released in 2025 at the very soonest</a>, but this plan could have changed since then.</p><p>As for the story, we know Geralt will be in the game, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-is-in-witcher-4-but-the-game-wont-focus-on-him/1100-6525728/" data-ref-id="1100-6525728">he won't be the focus of the narrative.</a> Joint-CEO Michał Nowakowski previously said The Witcher 4 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-witcher-3-in-new-clothing-dev-says/1100-6522306/" data-ref-id="1100-6522306">not going to be "The Witcher 3 in new clothing."</a> It aims to break new ground and stand apart from the games that came before it.</p><p>Also during the earnings report, CD Projekt announced that Cyberpunk 2077 has now sold 30 million copies, with its Phantom Liberty expansion shifting 8 million copies.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-sales-pass-30-million-as-new-witcher-game-production-ramps-up.1045749/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt has revealed that open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>has hit another major sales milestone, and there's some good news if you're waiting on tenterhooks for the next&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game as well.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1861447302260363516" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a</a><a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2024.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;new financial presentation</a>, CD Projekt reveals that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>sales have hit 30 million as of today, with that number including both sales of the base game and the Ultimate Edition bundle.</p>

<p>What's more,&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty</em>, the DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>that launched last year, has managed to sell eight million copies, which is around the same number as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">lifetime sales of the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake</a>. That's pretty impressive considering&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty&nbsp;</em>isn't a full game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sales-phantom-liberty.jpg?itok=-ila7YeQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sales-phantom-liberty.jpg?itok=kn5dC9H3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty&nbsp;</em>expansion has done pretty well for itself sales-wise.</figcaption></figure><p>In that same presentation, CD Projekt revealed that&nbsp;<em>Project Polaris</em>, which is the codename for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-witcher-game-in-development-cdpr-says" rel="nofollow">next major game in the&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>, has entered full production.</p>

<p>Essentially, this means that the next&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game has left its planning stages and that staff are now working on creating the game in earnest, bringing it one step closer to completion. Of course, we're still a long, long way away from that point.</p>

<p>It's worth noting, too, that&nbsp;<em>Polaris&nbsp;</em>is an entirely new game in the&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>series, and as such, it's distinct from the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-remake-announced-by-cd-projekt-red" rel="nofollow"><em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>remake that was announced by CD Projekt Red</a> back in 2022.</p>

<p>According to the financial presentation, as of October 31st, 400 staff members were working on&nbsp;<em>Polaris</em>, with 64 devoted to&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-orion-new-hires" rel="nofollow">sequel&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-orion-new-hires" rel="nofollow">Orion</a>&nbsp;</em>and 42 working on&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>Sirius</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-polaris-geralt.jpg?itok=_WzXF7Ti 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-polaris-geralt.jpg?itok=V9LMiaFi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The next major game in the&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>series has entered full production.</figcaption></figure><p>From a financial perspective, CD Projekt has had a slightly more humble third quarter this year than it did last year. Revenue is significantly down, as is gross profit, but the company still hasn't posted a loss despite releasing no major projects this year.</p>

<p>When it comes to year-to-date financials, CD Projekt's sales are slightly down over the same period last year, although sales of the&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>series remain steady, and the company's net profitability has actually slightly increased.</p>

            <p>If you're playing a "PS1-style" game these days, odds are it's a horror game. Sometimes, I worry that the association of PS1 with moody, Silent Hillian dankness has gotten to the point that younger players no longer perceive the original PS1 as a video game console at all. Going by Itch.io's Halloween output, the PS1 was just a rusty bucket of rot and gore in which the faithful might periodically hallucinate the face of Spyro the Dragon.</p>
<p>Here to remind us that the PS1 was capable of colours beside "existential grey" is <a href="https://hatimb00.itch.io/blue-exploration">Water Level/b.l.u.e. EXPLORATION</a>, from New York City-based game designer <a href="https://hatimbenhsain.github.io/">Hatim Benhsain</a>. It's a free downloadable experiment inspired by b.l.u.e.: Legend of Water, a Japan-only PS1 adventure in which you are a girl swimming through alien ruins with her dolphin.</p><!--more-->
<p>In Benhsain's rework, b.l.u.e. has become a game about games swimming through each other. Levels from the original Legend Of Water appear within it via emulator, but they're molten and deferred and spliced with other media to the point that you can't really call this emulation (let alone piracy). The older PS1 game occupies a screen within the screen that zooms and blurs, tilts and dissolves and reappears as you no-clip through a larger, enclosing world of azure and stone, awash with "borrowed" chunks from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, Super Mario 64 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>. The soundtrack, meanwhile, slops together waterlogged excerpts from American Idol performances and Madonna, as GameFAQ text unfolds across the top of the screen. </p>
<p>The controls are straightforwardly adapted from Legend Of Water - ah, how strange and joyful to play a 3D controller-based game from the pre-Dualshock era - but what they actually do seems to shift in accordance with the game's steady remixing and refocussing of its source materials. It reminds me a little of synthesising the geography in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mu-cartographer">Mu Cartographer</a>.</p><p>The creator's term for all this is a "plunderludic", or "game made of other games". I hadn't come across this concept before, and am curious to understand what distinguishes a plunderludic from, say, an interactive 3D collage. Benhsain includes a link to a <a href="https://plunderludics.github.io/">resource page</a> with some tools and examples of plunderludic games. It makes connections with the 19th century playwright Bertolt Brecht and George Maciunas, a member of the mid-20th century Fluxus art movement. I'm looking forward to giving it a proper read at some point.</p>
<p>In the short term, I'll only say that it's a delight to play something that takes such delight in swimming, as both a physical practice and an artistic methodology. It's been a while since I enjoyed swimming in a video game - today's aquatic physics and lighting may seem miraculous by PS1 standards, but I wonder if somewhere along the road from Legend Of Water to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, video games have lost the art of making underwater exploration feel magical. If you have any favourite water levels to share, old or new, sing out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
