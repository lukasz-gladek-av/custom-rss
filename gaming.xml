<p>But is it a remake..?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ecd2498efbcc1"><a title="Tomb Raider" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ecd2498efbcc1/tomb-raider.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Core Design</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-game-awards-2025-time-date-and-how-to-watch">The Game Awards</a> is taking place later today (or early tomorrow depending on your timezone), but it seems that yet another major announcement has leaked ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/major-tomb-raider-announcement-leaks-ahead-of-the-game-awards">Eurogamer</a>, the cover art for a new Tomb Raider entry has cropped up online along with a handful of screenshots. Titled <strong>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</strong>, some are speculating that it might actually be (another) remake of the original game from 1996, which itself also dealt with Atlantis.</p>
<p>The cover art features an updated iteration of Lara Croft which seems to blend the original design with the more realistic take featured in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">2013 reboot</a> (which, by the way, recently saw a release on Switch and Switch 2).</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJEHFv10kUS0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6qjsyuv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>So if this is all legit – and it certainly seems to be – is it possible that this new entry could come to the Switch 2? It's hard to say at this stage, but it's a definite possibility. There's been a smattering of Tomb Raider titles on the Switch and Switch 2 in recent years, with the aforementioned Definitive Edition preceded by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_iv-vi_remastered">Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_i-iii_remastered">Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</a> from Aspyr.</p>
<p>Remake or not, the screenshots certainly look pretty neat, so we'll have to wait until The Game Awards to see this thing in action. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is also due to receive a fresh new trailer at the event, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/leon-kennedy-is-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-via-psn-store-image">a new piece of key art</a> from the PSN store prematurely revealed the existence of veteran protagonist Leon Kennedy.</p>

            <guid>1379671</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today might be all about <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards</a>, but it's still another Thursday in a new week, which means another NVIDIA GeForce NOW Thursday is here, with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-monster-hunter-stories/">a new batch of games added to NVIDIA's cloud streaming service</a>. This week, seven titles enter the service for the first time, including two games from one franchise, and three games are added to the selection of titles that are RTX 5080-ready.</p>



<p>The two games from one franchise are Monster Hunter Stories and Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin. Ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection arriving on March 13, 2026</a>, you'll now be able to play through the first two games using GeForce NOW.</p>



<p>Two other notable games joining the service this week are two new releases, Skate Story and Death Howl, both two of the more interesting indie games to arrive towards the end of the year.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining GeForce NOW for the first time this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Skate Story (December 8)</li>



<li>Dome Keeper (December 9)</li>



<li>Death Howl (December 9)</li>



<li>RuneQuest: Warlords (December 9)</li>



<li>Everdream Village (December 12)</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Stories</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin</li>
</ul>



<p>As far as the three games that are now RTX 5080-ready, it's a good week for 4X strategy players and city-sim building players, with the three games being Age of Wonders 4, Cities: Skylines, and Cities: Skylines 2.</p>



<p>Speaking of the RTX 5080 Blackwell servers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-adds-8-games-rtx-5080-servers-soon-to-be-live-worldwide/">they are still one region short of being available worldwide, according to the map of their initial rollout</a>. Stockholm has yet to be added, though it is expected to join the rest of the regions where RTX 5080 servers are already available "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>Lastly, a final mention for The Game Awards, you can play a majority of the nominated games through GeForce NOW, including the heavyweight favourite, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and the games that have a shot at stealing GOTY out from its grasp, like Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and Hollow Knight Silksong.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-goes-into-full-clearance-mode-on-its-soundbar-as-the-s100f-with-bass-reflex-speaker-hits-an-all-time-low-2000652293</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You can’t really enjoy an immersive viewing experience without great sound to match the visuals. If you’re looking to make holiday movie nights better but your current TV doesn’t have solid built-in speakers, adding a soundbar to the setup can be a smart move. And thanks to Amazon, picking one up doesn’t break the bank today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">The Sony S100F 2.0ch soundbar is currently going for just $98 at Amazon, after the retailer took a whopping 39% off its usual price of $160</a>. Shipping is free as well, so you’re not adding anything on top of the sale price. Even better, orders placed today will arrive before Christmas, so you can have fun streaming marathons with friends and family with fuller, richer audio that fills the room. Note that it’s only around for a short time, so it’s best to grab yours before the offer expires.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Surround Sound Experience</h2>
<p>The slim design blends into every entertainment setup well, matching the aesthetics of any room. You can place it on your console right below the screen, or mount it on the wall if you prefer a cleaner setup. It punches well above its weight, though. Sony has packed the soundbar with a two-speaker setup that delivers front surround sound by handling the full audio range without requiring additional subwoofers or speakers. It produces audio as a stereo mix for a wider soundstage that fills the entire room, instead of just blasting from the front.</p>
<p>The bass reflex speaker does an incredible job of delivering punchy, deep bass without compromising on the details, even when you have pumped the volume all the way up. You will be able to vibe to all your favorite tunes, plus immerse yourself in thrilling scenes like never before. S-Force Pro, on the other hand, emulates cinema-style sound fields for better clarity and a 3D experience. Translation? Cars in F1 race past your couch, gunfire erupts right in your living room, and the Grinch’s footsteps feel like they’re actually coming from behind you. Whether you’re planning to watch an action-packed series or stream some good old Christmas title, it makes you feel a part of what’s happening on the screen.</p>



<p>There’s a voice enhancement feature that automatically improves dialog clarity, even in those loud, chaotic scenes. It also comes in handy when you’re catching up with friends on a bigger screen; you will be able to hear everyone on the conference call clearly. Connectivity couldn’t be easier. A single HDMI ARC connection between the TV and the soundbar gets the party started. You can control both the TV and the soundbar with a single remote. Best of all, it supports Bluetooth connections just as well, which is great for when you want to pair your smartphone wirelessly with it. Maybe play some songs or a podcast in the background as you set holiday decorations up!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">On a regular day, this speaker would run you around $160, but this deal lets you grab it for $98, which is quite affordable considering all the features it gets you.</a> If you’ve been after better sound, this soundbar can be an excellent addition to your setup. Snap it up quick, though, as the discount is a limited-time one. The retailer hasn’t specified an end date, but we’re not expecting it to last long. Placing your orders now will also allow you to get it before Christmas!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This ARC Raiders Backpack Has Single-Handedly Crashed the NVIDIA Website]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-backpack-crashed-nvidia-site/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is a beloved game after being on the market for a little more than six weeks. It’s an all-new extraction adventure title from Embark Studios, and it’s proving to be a true disruptor to the genre. Recently, NVIDIA kickstarted a promotional event that allows certain players to unlock an exclusive ARC Raiders backpack, and it has proven to be a little too popular.</p>



<p>If you try to redeem the ARC Raiders NVIDIA backpack right now, you’ll be met with network errors and server issues.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-nvidia-arc-raiders-backpack-is-sought-after">The NVIDIA ARC Raiders Backpack is Sought-After</h2>



<p>There are a few caveats to claiming the ARC Raiders NVIDIA backpack, the most critical of which is that you need to be a PC gamer with an NVIDIA GPU. This is because it needs to link to the NVIDIA App and the GeForce Rewards program.</p>



<p>We’ve got a full guide explaining <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/get-free-arc-raiders-nvidia-backpack/">how to get the ARC Raiders backpack</a> from NVIDIA.</p>



<p>The listing went live at 6 AM PT, and what must be thousands of ARC Raiders fans were waiting to receive it, so much so that the NVIDIA site stopped working:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is a testament to the power of ARC Raiders, which is one of the most popular and successful games of 2025 after just a few weeks on the market.</p>



<p>To be honest, customization in ARC Raiders could be a little better. It’s limited right now, and that’s fine, because it’s a live-service game and Embark Studios is adding more content as they flesh out the holistic offering. But that’s why deals like this NVIDIA ARC Raiders backpack are so special – because people want <strong>more</strong> ways to outfit their character.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you managed to secure one of the NVIDIA backpacks in ARC Raiders.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Skyrim Made Dominic Monaghan's PS3 EXPLODE | Star Players</p>
      </div>
<p>Carofano said Skyrim is a "great game" and the goal in releasing the game in so many places is to help it reach more people "in the best way possible."</p><p>He also discussed bringing Skyrim to Switch 2, saying there is a "whole new generation" of people who might pick up a Switch 2 and "that's the first time they've ever played Skyrim."</p><p>Bethesda previously put Skyrim on the original Switch, so creating a native Switch 2 version was "really an easy development process" and a "pretty quick" job to do, at least compared to Bethesda's traditional development timelines.</p><p>"Making the game takes years and years and years, but bringing it to this new console was a much, much faster process," he said.</p><p>The developer went on to discuss the ways in which Bethesda took advantage of the Switch 2 hardware.</p><p>"A lot of it was really just focusing on taking advantage of the new hardware. We can use DLSS now and get better resolution, better performance, and the game loads faster," he said. "Switch 2 has the Joy-Con 2 controllers that let you use mouse controls, so we added that. A lot of it is really just, 'How do we take advantage of the Switch 2? What can it do? And [how can we] give players the best version of Skyrim for that console?'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIntv_QfQjU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fIntv_QfQjU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Skyrim for Switch 2 launched this week and people quickly discovered numerous issues, including input delay. Bethesda said it is <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/57181" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">now investigating reports of performance issues</a>, but there is no timeline or further details for when fixes will be available.</p><p>Before this, Bethesda boss Todd Howard<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/millions-still-play-skyrim-every-month-todd-howard/1100-6460286/" data-ref-id="1100-6460286"> joked about all the re-releases for Skyrim</a>. He said, "If you want us to stop releasing it, stop buying it." Skyrim was originally released in 2011 for PS3, Xbox 360, and PC, before coming to PS4 and Xbox One in 2016, then Nintendo Switch in 2017, and then PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2021. The Switch 2 edition launched on December 9.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who already own the Anniversary Edition on the original Switch, the Switch 2 upgrade for Skyrim is available for free. Those who don't already own any version of Skyrim on Switch can buy it on Switch 2 for $60. Owners of the non-Anniversary Edition of Skyrim on Switch can upgrade to the Anniversary Edition for $20 and then receive the Switch 2 version for free. The Anniversary Edition includes the base game and its three official expansions, as well as access to Creation Club content made by players.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyrim has sold more than 60 million copies and ranks as one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/" data-ref-id="2900-4814">top 10 best-selling games of all time</a>. Its enduring appeal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-lead-designer-reacts-to-games-enduring-appeal-what-the-hell/1100-6535441/" data-ref-id="1100-6535441">even surprised Skyrim's lead designer</a>, who recently said he expected some other game to eclipse it in the years following its release. Part of the game's enduring popularity comes from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-skyrim-mods/2900-6392/" data-ref-id="2900-6392">Skyrim's vibrant mod scene</a>, where players are always creating new content that can transform the world Bethesda created in surprising ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Bethesda is currently working on Skyrim's sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-483377">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, which was announced in 2018 but does not have a release date. In November, Howard said the highly anticipated RPG is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/1100-6536089/" data-ref-id="1100-6536089">"still a long way off"</a> and that he's "preaching patience" to fans. Howard has previously said he wonders if it was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-talks-elder-scrolls-6-and-retirement-i-want-to-do-it-forever/1100-6517168/" data-ref-id="1100-6517168">mistake to announce Elder Scrolls VI so early</a>.</p>

<p>The video above isn't the trailer the <a href="https://x.com/007">007 Twitter account</a> shared and the yanked earlier today, as spotted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-twitter-account-jumps-the-gun-and-posts-trailer-announcing-first-light-villain.1379350/">users on ResetEra</a>. It is, however, the first thing which comes to mind when I think of musician Lenny Kravitz, whom the trailer shows lending his face to a First Light villain named Bawma.</p>
<p>Bawma, according to the text of the tweet that's handily been screenshotted by the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-leak-reveals-music-star-will-play-new-james-bond-villain-and-youll-never-guess-who-it-is">Ian Games Network</a>, "rose from nothing, broke free, and built his own Kingdom of Aleph." He's "the largest black-market dealer in the Western Hemisphere who's as charismatic as he is unpredictable."</p><p>Bawma shows off this charismatic unpredictability in the trailer by threatening to drop Bond into a pit of female crocodiles. Bond, always thinking with his tadger, ends the trailer by saying "Girls? Of course." Like he's just figured out his life's a big cosmic knob joke. A cosmic knob joke that'll presumably be laughed at again at tonight's Geoff Awards, assuming IO Interactive debut this trailer properly there.</p>
<p>Anyway, shout out to Neil Cicierega for absolutely ruining a bunch of songs for me in the best way possible. Make sure you're <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tdyU_gW6WE">bustin</a> into our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-livestream">Geoff Awards liveblog</a> today if you fancy watching the show alongside us.</p>

Well, well, well, here comes Geoffers. G-Kay, the awarder of golden PDF badges to videogames, best pal to every celebrity less tasteful than Edward Norton. Gentleman Keighley, with his mindflaying footwear and his hands all lubed up to wangle fresh announcements from the games industry's chapped orifices. But what's this! His trousers are bellowing. He's got something stuffed down them, something that honks and rumbles like an elephant seal, something that yearns to raise the banner of victory over 10 million planets. 
</p>
<p>
Geoff grabs his groin and waddles away desperately, but not fast enough. His backside explodes in a rank gust of Promethium. A terrifying cybernetic face peers from the breach. "FOR THE EMPEROR," it hollers, while Geoff frantically seeks cover behind Evanescense. "FOR THE EMPEROR, PROBABLY! BUT MAYBE ACTUALLY FOR THE REBELLION INSTEAD."
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All of which is my extremely funny way of saying that a new Warhammer 40,000 game may be forthcoming at this year's Geoffening, aka The Game Awards, which you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-livestream">stream here</a>. Specifically, a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 40,000 game.</p>
<p>We know from Creative Assembly's 25th series anniversary showcase last week that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creative-assembly-reveal-total-war-medieval-3-while-teasing-a-huge-game-reveal-to-follow">they'll be announcing a sizeable new thing at the annual Keighley Hootenanny</a>. During that previous anniversary showcase, there was also some footage of the developers' new Warcore game development tech, including a shot of a stone house with some filenames next to it. Amongst those filenames redditor Knavbot has found the magic words "40K". See below, via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-total-war-fan-spots-what-looks-like-a-leak-for-creative-assemblys-much-rumored-total-war-warhammer-40000-with-the-game-awards-announcement-just-hours-away">Ian Games</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>40k_outfield_sheet_01_base_colour</li>
<li>40k_outfield_sheet_01_material_map</li>
<li>40k_outfield_sheet_01_normal</li>
</ul>
<p>
The spoilsports among you are hastening to point out that "40K" could refer to something else. Perhaps Creative Assembly have invented the first 40K resolution videogame, for example. Perhaps you will need a dedicated fusion reactor to operate your next gaming PC.</p><p>Detractors may also comment that while it's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/future-creative-assembly-games-may-require-blood-thematically-which-sure-sounds-like-a-total-war-warhammer-40000-teaser">rumoured for yonks</a> that Total War is heading to the grim darkness of the far future, there's a parallel rumour which suggests that the next major instalment of the strategy series will take place a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. Back in May last year, a Dualshockers report <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumours-point-to-total-war-star-wars-in-the-works-at-creative-assembly">spoke of a Total War Star Wars game</a>, much to Nic's (RPS in peace) dismay.
</p>
<p>
"Why not both?" ask the terrible, eternally hungry people for whom nothing is ever Total enough. "After all, that Dualshockers report mentions <em>three</em> currently in development Total War games, and we already know about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-medieval-3">Total War: Medieval 3</a>." Sure! Why not make them all 40K resolution games while you're at it. Why not literally remove the eyelids of every Total War artist. Why not stitch them together into a human centipede that exists only to output scintillating high-def images of falling sand grains on Tatooine.
</p>
<p>
For me, the choice of licensed adaptations comes down to which game title I'll have the most fun abbreviating. I quite like "Star Twar", but "TwartyK" is just, so excellent. Might retire now, tbh. Still, you can probably do better. You can also tell me whether you think Creative Assembly have the chops to make a strategy game that's as ranged combat and vehicle-heavy as a Warhammer 40K or Star Wars game would need to be. Also: space battles?!

            <link>https://kotaku.com/meta-ray-ban-gen-1-gets-cleared-out-for-less-than-regular-sunglasses-even-though-theyre-smart-ai-glasses-2000652301</link>
            <guid>1379617</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The iconic Ray-Ban Wayfarer glasses have been cool all the way back to Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison in the ’50s, and now 7 decades later, they’re getting a whole new life as advanced tech wearables thanks to Meta. These retro-cool glasses are now 21st Century marvels with speakers, camera, mic, and Meta AI all discreetly built in, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6345/">they’re also a great limited-time deal at Amazon right now for just $224.</a></p>
<p>There are 10 different models of the Gen 1 Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers available as part of this limited-time deal, in regular and large sizes for men and women, with a variety of frame colors and lenses ranging from clear to transitions to different shades and colors of sunglasses. They’re the top-selling AI glasses in the world, and now you can find out why for $75 less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6345/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Big Tech, But With Style</h2>
<p>Futuristic tech mixed with impeccable classic style is the mashup we need right now, so seeing Meta team up with Ray-Ban rather than create some bizarre-looking goggles or helmet or other such thing is a hugely welcome development. The Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers looks like the regular Wayfarers made legendary by Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise in <em>Risky Business</em>, and the Blues Brothers, but these also take seriously good 12MP photos and 1080p video, which is probably why&nbsp;<em>Popular Mechanics</em> calls them the best AI glasses for social media. To engage the camera, just touch a button on the glasses’ arm, or use a voice command.</p>
<p>(Side note: While the Wayfarers spiked again in popularity when&nbsp;<em>The Blues Brothers</em> came out in 1980, there’s an ongoing debate about whether they both wore Wayfarers, or if Dan Aykroyd’s Elwood actually wore lookalike vintage sunglasses. Either way, they’re indelibly associated with the Wayfarers.)</p>
<p>The Meta AI features are probably the most mindblowing of all. The multimodal AI can translate signs, identify objects, and even look up and give you historical information on something you’re looking at, in real time. It’s all done discreetly — you gain all of the information while to the rest of the world, you’re just a person in Wayfarers. Real-time audio translations from 6 languages and counting are built in, with no Wi-Fi connection necessary.</p>



<h2>Outstanding Audio</h2>
<p>Even without any actual in-ear extension, the custom-built open-ear speakers sound amazing during calls or if you’re listening to music or a podcast. You get immersive sound that doesn’t intrude on the people standing near you, and you can call and text hands-free. The incredible amount of interactivity provided by the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers make them a content creator’s dream, a multitasker’s must-have, and they just look&nbsp;<em>cool</em> no matter which feature you’re using (or none.)</p>
<p>The opportunity to look like James Dean but have hidden tech worthy of James Bond is worth a heck of lot more than just $224, but that’s the Amazon price tag on the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers during this limited-time deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6345/">Save 25% and grab one of the best and coolest tech wearables available anywhere.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>PlayStation have announced that Killzone content is returning to Helldivers 2, and this time, it’s here to stay. </p>



<p>Back in December 2024, Killzone made its first appearance in Helldivers 2 with two waves of crossover items that included weapons, armor sets, and cosmetics. The developers at Arrowhead have made it clear that they’ve heard the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-killzone-cosmetics-price-backlash-response-from-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan feedback regarding the pricing</a> and that the content will instead be re-released as a Premium Warbond. </p>

<figure><figcaption>The perfect fit for Helldivers 2. Image by PlayStation.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Announced via the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/">Pla</a><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ySta</a><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/">tion Blog</a>, Arrowhead have confirmed that a fresh batch of Killzone-themed gear is on the way to Helldivers 2. For 1500 Super Credits, players will be able to unlock a Premium Warbond packed with iconic Killzone weapons, armor, and cosmetics—plus a collection of brand-new items that weren’t part of last year’s limited release.</p>



<p>Better still, Arrowhead are rewarding returning players. Anyone who <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-x-killzone-cosmetics-are-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously purchased any Killzone item</a>—even a single piece—will receive the full Killzone Legendary Warbond at no extra cost. All previously owned or gifted items will also be medal-unlocked, meaning players won’t need to spend medals to reclaim them and can instead focus on the new additions.</p>







<p>Here’s how eligibility works, as confirmed by PlayStation.</p>



<ul>
<li>Players who have previously purchased any (even one) of the Killzone items, will have the whole Helldivers 2 x Killzone Legendary Warbond unlocked at no extra cost! Additionally, there is no medal vacuum here! The items previously purchased (and those which were gifted last December) will be medal unlocked. So no need to spend medals on the items you already own!</li>



<li>Players who received the gifted items in December 2024 but didn’t pay for any single item, will have to pay the 1500 Super Credits to unlock the full Legendary Warbond.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Not to worry, if you do pay for the Warbond; the gifted items will also be medal unlocked.</li>



<li>Players joining after the Helldivers 2 x Killzone items left the store in December 2024 can access the Warbond by unlocking it for 1500 SC, and then enjoy redeeming medals on their favorite items just as usual.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Premium Warbond includes every item from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/second-wave-helldivers-2-killzone-2-crossover-content-will-be-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first two waves of Killzone X Helldivers 2 content</a>, as well as a list of new items, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>StA-52 Assault Rifle</li>



<li>StA-11 SMG</li>



<li>PLAS-39 Accelerator rifle</li>



<li>AC-1 Dutiful/The Strength In Our Arms cape</li>



<li>AC-2 Obedient/Defender of Our Dream cape</li>



<li>Acclimated Passive</li>



<li>Extrasolar Ash patterns</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re a fan of either franchise, then now’s a great time to hop back into Helldivers 2. Will you be checking out the new Premium Warbond? Share your thoughts in the official <a href="https://discord.gg/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Cyberpunk 2077’s lead writer has stated that the team understood during the game’s pre-production that Night City would be the main antagonist, confirming the age-old fan theory.</p>



<p>The main attraction of Cyberpunk 2077 has always been Night City, which is not only a dense open-world that will keep you engaged the entire journey, but also an all-knowing and all-seeing entity that sells people big dreams, but they always come with massive repercussions. Now, a lead writer has confirmed that Night City is indeed the true villain of Cyberpunk 2077. </p>







<h2 id="h-it-s-always-night-city-versus-everyone-else-in-cyberpunk-2077">It’s Always ‘Night City Versus Everyone Else’ in Cyberpunk 2077</h2>



<p>For some time, players have theorised that Night City is the main character and antagonist in Cyberpunk 2077, and this post on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1aeuz79/v_is_not_the_main_character_my_simple_theory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cyberpunkgame</a> explains it quite well. During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/5-years-on-from-cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-reveals-why-making-night-city-the-main-antagonist-created-an-irresistible-rpg-exploring-the-darker-side-of-human-nature-is-exciting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Cyberpunk 2077’s lead writer, Tomasz Marchewka, confirmed, “Quite quickly, during pre-production of Cyberpunk 2077, we realized that Night City is going to be our main antagonist.”</p>



<p>Marchewka acknowledged that some players had caught on quite quickly and asked about it. The game also features other antagonists, such as Arasaka, Adam Smasher, and others. However, it has always been “Night City versus everyone else, even the big guys. So yeah, that’s a cool concept to make the city the main antagonist,” explained the lead writer.</p>



<p>Igor Sarzynski, the cinematic director, also explained why players might find this world so compelling, stating that for him it was always finding the balance between “subtle, personal, human, and emotional elements – things that are fragile and touching and invite compassion – versus what you mention: the danger, the violence.” </p>



<p>“Everything that forces you to put on armor, literal or emotional, and protect yourself, fight for survival. Night City exists right on the edge of those realms, between beauty and bloodshed, and so you’re never bored; you always think that&nbsp;maybe&nbsp;the next dream will come true,” Sarzynski added. </p>







<p>In other news, the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel will feature a city that feels like ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-city-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago Gone Wrong</a>‘. Additionally, CD Projekt Red and WierdCo have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-tcg-announced-by-cdpr-and-wierdco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> Cyberpunk TCG.

Coincidentally, Treasure is the developer behind the GameCube title. The studio is known for Gunstar Heroes, Sin and Punishment, and Ikaruga.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaPq9Z2xgCY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DaPq9Z2xgCY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Wario World brings the GameCube library up to seven titles on Switch 2 for the Expansion Pack tier. What's intriguing about Wario World is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/">Nintendo has teased GameCube titles</a> that still aren't out on the service, such as Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and Pokemon Colosseum. Meanwhile, Wario World hadn't previously been mentioned. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/luigis-mansion-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-time-for-halloween/1100-6535610/">Luigi's Mansion arrived on the subscription service right before Halloween</a> and was the last addition.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, Nintendo announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-best-nintendo-64-platformers-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online/1100-6536837/">Rayman 2: The Great Escape and Tonic Trouble will come to the Nintendo 64 library</a> for the Expansion Pack tier on December 17. A Nintendo Switch Online membership costs $20 annually and includes NES, SNES, and Game Boy catalogs. For Wario World and Rayman 2, the Expansion Pack tier is required, costing $50 yearly (and $80 for a family plan). However, just to note, only Switch 2 owners have access to the GameCube library.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We are mere hours away from <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, and just like in previous years, that means there are at least a couple of announcements that have been spoiled right down to the wire. This year, it's IO Interactive accidentally posted a reveal that was almost certainly planned for tonight's show, with a new trailer showcasing one key, but until now, an absent part of 007 First Light - and any major James Bond story - the villain.</p>



<p>The initial post shared by the <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI">official 007 First Light X (formerly Twitter)</a> was quickly taken down, though not before <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-twitter-account-jumps-the-gun-and-posts-trailer-announcing-first-light-villain.1379350/#post-148736176">users on ResetEra</a> were able to capture it and share it far and wide across the internet. Which is how we now know that Bawma, the villain in the James Bond coming-of-agent story in 007 First Light, is played by none other than Lenny Kravitz.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's unfortunate for IO Interactive that what would have been a pretty solid reveal was shared early accidentally, and surely some poor intern or social media manager at IO Interactive is not having the best day. That said, the early reveal doesn't take away from the fact that 007 First Light appears to be shaping up to be a classic Bond story, through-and-through.</p>



<p>All the way down to Bond being dangled over a pool of some kind of carnivorous animal that the villain keeps as pets. You don't get more Bond than that, and at this point, it seems like all the game's story might be missing is a front shot of James or his love interest (or both) slowly rising from the water after a swim in the ocean and walking onto the beach. </p>



<p>For more on The Game Awards ahead of tonight's show, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">you can check out the full list of nominees here</a>, which includes 007 First Light and its nomination for 'Most Anticipated Game.' Not that it'll win next to Grand Theft Auto VI, but it has a nomination all the same. You can also check out a list of every announcement that's been rumoured and/or confirmed to appear at tonight's show, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">and all Game Awards information you might need at our full Game Awards hub, here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[HP 17″ Ryzen 5 Laptop (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) Crashes Nearly 70%, With $199 Worth of Accessories Included for Christmas]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-17-ryzen-5-laptop-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-crashes-nearly-70-with-199-worth-of-accessories-included-for-christmas-2000652297</link>
            <guid>1379566</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptop upgrades can cost a pretty penny, depending on the features you’re after. If you’re a work professional or a student looking to upgrade their everyday machine, you need a model with a good display, a comfortable keyboard, a muscular processor, plus at least 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. Most options offering these and more – especially the ones from known brands – sit well over $1,200, but that’s not the case today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6344/">We just spotted the 17-inch HP touchscreen laptop going for just $1,000 at Amazon, after the retailer generously took a whopping 67% off its usual $3,000 tag.</a> Orders placed within a couple of days arrive before Christmas, so you can also consider it as a gift for a loved one. Best of all, the retailer throws in a bunch of useful computer accessories worth almost $200 with your purchase – for absolutely nothing. There are no complicated coupon codes to enter to score the discount or the freebies. Just add the item to your cart, and the offers apply automatically. You’ll also save an additional 5% at checkout, which ultimately brings the overall price down even further. But as you’d expect, discounts this good don’t stick around for long. It’s best to hurry to grab yours, as the price could shoot back up any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6344/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Incredible Work and Play Performance</h2>
<p>The roomy 17.3-inch HD+ (1600×900) display offers plenty of space to work and play without feeling limited. It not only pushes vibrant, detailed visuals, but also features an anti-glare coating that makes the overall viewing experience quite comfortable on the eyes. Whether you’re using it out there in the sun or while sitting in a dimly lit room, picture quality stays consistent and balanced. Touch support makes navigation easy. You won’t have to rely on the keypad or the mouse to find your way around things; just use your fingers directly on the screen to pinch, tap, scroll, draw, and even type. Paired with the screen is a spacious, full-sized backlit keyboard. It makes typing long documents easy on the wrists, while the backlight lets you hit goals even after the shadows fall.</p>



<p>The laptop runs on the AMD Ryzen 5 7430U 6-core processor, which is capable of hitting speeds up to 4.3GHz. It’s powerful enough to support you through all your tasks, from those early-morning deadlines to late-night passion projects. There’s a massive 32GB RAM to keep everything (video calls, resource-intensive applications, games) running smoothly; something that makes a huge difference during busy days when you need to handle a bunch of tasks at the same time. The 1TB SSD lets you store all your important files in a single place. You can throw in a ton of videos, high-resolution photos, work documents, research files, and more with ease. Even better, the memory and storage are expandable up to <strong>64GB RAM and 2TB SSD</strong>, respectively, so you can always add more as your needs grow in the future.</p>
<p>Battery life is just as solid. A single charge gets you up to 9 hours of video playback, meaning you can go a full day without plugging it in. Recharging doesn’t take forever either, thanks to HP Fast Charge that juices the laptop from 0 to 50% in just about 45 minutes. Plug it in during a quick lunch break at work, and come back to a machine ready to help you power through the rest of your day.</p>
<p>The accessory kit includes a Redragon mouse, an external CD/DVD drive, and a clean cloth. <strong>Windows 11 Pro</strong> also comes pre-installed, so you’re literally getting a machine that’s ready to go right out of the box.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A number of Tomb Raider leaks have started circulating ahead of tonight's The Game Awards show.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, The Game Awards and Tomb Raider accounts both revealed we would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-you-miss-her-she-missed-you-the-future-of-tomb-raider-will-be-revealed-at-the-game-awards">finding out the "future" of the Lara Croft-fronted franchise as part of the show</a>. The accounts shared an image of a silhouetted Lara standing atop a rocky formation with her dual pistols readied.</p>
<p>Now, what appears to be cover art for a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider game</a> along with a number of in-game screenshots have started appearing online, mere hours before their official unveiling.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The cover art in question shows Lara in the same pose she was standing in in the earlier Tomb Raider teaser. Her attire, meanwhile, unites her original 'classic' design from the 90s with the more recent Survivor timeline. She is in her short shorts and tank top, and has accessorised with the jade necklace first introduced in 2013's reboot.</p><p>Written above her is the game's name: Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. Additional screenshots also shared of Lara in action - including the leading lady using some impressive gymnastic skills to traverse - have since led many to surmise a full-fat, from the ground up remake of the series' original game will be announced at The Game Awards this evening.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the Tomb Raider images still appear online, and Crystal Dynamics has not sought to remove them. You can check them out via the embeds below.</p> <div>

<p>As well as this rumoured remake, Crystal Dynamics is also working on a new series entry with Amazon. In August of last year, Amazon said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">the upcoming Tomb Raider game was "a huge, huge task"</a>, but things were "going well". Then, just last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-yet-another-round-of-layoffs">Crystal Dynamics laid off a number of staff</a>, calling it part of a restructuring "for our next generation". At this time, the studio cited the next Tomb Raider release as a factor in its decision.</p>
<p>So, will we be getting more than one Tomb Raider announcement in the next 24 hours? The Game Awards 2025 will take place on Thursday, 11th December, at 7:30pm EST. That's very early in the morning on the 12th, if you are in the UK. Leading the nominations at this year's event is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">which is up for 12 awards</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s Game Awards season, y’all. That special time of the year when we gather together to celebrate video games and the people who make them… by watching expensive commercials briefly punctuated by the odd awards speech or musical performance. For better or worse, The Game Awards is the biggest night on the video game event calendar. But with the way things have been going, lately it’s been more “worse” than it has been “better.”</p><p>Between host and industry hypeman Geoff Keighley’s two video game vanity projects, The Game Awards is older and ostensibly more mature than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/679598/summer-game-fest-2025-trailers-news">Summer Game Fest</a>. Conceived in 2014 as a way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/7/18131058/game-awards-2018-geoff-keighly-creaotr-streaming-tga-hydrobot">celebrate both the people who make and play games,</a> the show has always been part awards ceremony, part commercial product. That idea has been executed with varying degrees of success. (Remember the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2016/12/02/the-good-the-bad-and-the-cringeworthy-of-the-2016-game-awards/">Schick Hydrobot</a>?) But for the last few years, it’s felt like the awards part was increasingly getting in the way of the commercial part.</p><p>That was felt most acutely <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23992402/geoff-keighley-the-game-awards-layoffs">during the 2023 Game Awards</a>. Developers accepting statues were often drowned out by music or cut off by teleprompters asking them to “please wrap it up” after their roughly 30 seconds of allotted time. Muppets and <em>Death Stranding</em> director Hideo Kojima, though, had no such time limits enforced on them, with <em>Aftermath </em>calculating that <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-many-game-awards-acceptance-speeches-could-have-taken-place-while-kojima-was-talking/#coral_thread">13 acceptance speeches</a> could have fit inside the five minutes Kojima took to explain his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/783409/od-kojima-xbox-game-trailer">game / not-game <em>OD</em></a>.</p><p>2023 was also the first full year into the now endemic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24009039/video-game-layoffs-2023">video game labor crisis</a> that saw developers laid off by the tens of thousands while studios of popular games got shut down. That crisis went by that year’s game awards with no acknowledgement, angering developers further. “I’m incredibly disappointed in Geoff Keighley for his silence on the state of the industry this year,” Monomi Park senior environment artist Dillon Sommerville told <em>The Verge</em> in 2023.</p><div><div><p id="how-to-watch-the-game-awards"><h2>How to watch The Game Awards</h2></p></div><p>On Thursday, December 11th at 5PM PT / 8PM ET the TGAs will be streamed on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/d-BDeU3R5ic?si=XC2AGGmUKLrak3rH">YouTube</a>. This year, Keighley has also signed a deal to beam the show live <a href="https://thegameawards.com/news/the-game-awards-adds-prime-video">via Prime Video</a> where it’ll be free to watch for Prime subscribers.</p></div><p>Keighley, perhaps responding to the bad optics, <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-2024-future-class-game-changer-geoff-keighley/">acknowledged the continuing labor issue in 2024</a>. The Game Awards also introduced a new category, Game Changer, with its inaugural award going to Amir Satvat, a business development director at Tencent who created a resource to help laid-off developers find jobs.</p><p>But in the months since the 2024 awards, Keighley has once again been accused of poor treatment of the people he’s supposed to be celebrating. In 2020, The Game Awards <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-game-awards-announces-inaugural-future-class">announced a new initiative called The Future Class</a>, designed to celebrate game makers, “who represent the bright, bold and inclusive future of video games.” Inductees are honored during the broadcast and provided with networking opportunities, mentorship programs, and other resources throughout the following year. However, there have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/11/future-class-gamings-oscars-game-awards">reports</a> alleging that Keighley has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23993630/game-awards-2023-developers-react-future-class">ignored Future Class concerns</a> and that resources from the program have been materially lacking.</p><p>In 2023, the Future Class wrote an open letter to The Game Awards and Keighley demanding recognition of the war in Gaza. This wasn’t without precedent. In 2022, the awards show acknowledged the war in Ukraine. But Keighley didn’t respond to the letter, nor has he mentioned the Future Class that much either. The Game Awards hasn’t named a Future Class in the last two years and won’t be naming anymore according to Future Class organizer Emily Weir. “At this time, we are not planning a new Future Class for this year and do not have any active programming plans for Future Class,” she said <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-game-awards-confirms-its-future-class-program-will-remain-on-ice">in a statement to <em>Game Developer.</em></a></p><p>Like a lot of diversity and inclusion-minded programs, Future Class got started in the wake of George Floyd’s murder in 2020. But as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) have become publicly verboten in the rise of the Trump Administration and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104799/gamergate-2024-sweet-baby-inc-diversity">the online right</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24340846/meta-disbands-diversity-dei-team-charged">many</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/google/607012/google-dei-hiring-goals-internal-memo">companies</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/838079/microsoft-diversity-and-inclusion-changes-notepad">including game publishers</a>, have diminished or jettisoned their DEI programs. While there has been no explicitly stated reason for the seeming shut down of the Future Class, it seems like The Game Awards is just doing what it always does — whatever’s popular at the time.</p><p>For as much as The Game Awards has lost the veneer of respectability among some of the people whose work it’s meant to celebrate, rest assured, it ain’t going anywhere. The Game Awards broadcast nets millions of viewers <a href="https://thegameawards.com/news/tga-shatters-viewership-records-154-million-livestreams">with a record-breaking 154 million livestreams in 2024</a>. That’s a lot of eyeballs that <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-summer-games-fest-trailers-can-cost-devs-up-to-550k">developers pay a lot of money to get in front of</a>. And even for those who don’t buy airtime, having your game featured at all during the presentation can net a big boost in sales. After <em>Balatro</em> was nominated for and won multiple awards last year including best debut indie, its publisher PlayStack <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/486246/balatro-mobile-sales-game-awards-2024/">shouted out the awards specifically</a> for contributing to a huge increase in players.</p><p>More generally, the awards also provide a nice focal point for the disparate online gaming communities to gather around… and bitch about. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23998271/e3-gaming-convention-canceled-death">E3 is long gone</a>, and the other big events (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/689708/summer-game-fests-best-games-were-small-and-personal">not also run by Keighley</a>) are the publisher-specific direct livestreams. With everything so fractured now, yelling with your friends or colleagues about how <em>Hades</em> was robbed for game of the year (an event I will <em>never</em> get over) is fun and something TGAs are singularly suited to provide. It is not <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/17/24075044/dice-awards-video-game-developers-awards">the Oscars of gaming</a> — DICE, the BAFTAs, and the International Game Development Awards (IGDA) pretty well take care of that. But if you want popularity, production values, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/13/23507234/flute-guy-pedro-eustache-interview-the-game-awards">Flute Guy</a>, there’s nothing like The Game Awards — even though some of the shine is starting to wear off.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/841710/the-game-awards-2025-preview-geoff-keighley]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Just a few years ago, Valve introduced us to a brand new way to play PC games with the advent of the Steam Deck. Sure, they just copy-pasted the Nintendo Switch, but the key difference here is you can play your Steam games on it. This kicked off a wholly new class of product with the PC gaming handheld. Taking your PC games with you on the go is something we’d only been dreaming of a decade ago. That kind of versatility is great for gamers. If you are a proud owner of Steam Deck, you can make it even more versatile with a Steam Deck dock. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">This one from UGREEN offers a lot of flexibility are is right now discounted down by 35%. Normally the dock goes for $46, so this ends up shaving off $16</a>. You only need to pay $30 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Playing handheld with the Steam Deck is great. I mean, of course it is. That’s the thing it’s designed to do. However, maybe you don’t always want to play on just the 7.4-inch screen. Maybe you want to hook it up to your 65-inch screen in your living room. The Nintendo Switch can do that. So what about the Steam Deck?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Extensive Connectivity for Gaming</h2>
<p>Well, the UGREEN docking station will allow you to connect your Steam Deck to an external display like a monitor or smart TV and be able to play in 4K at up to 120Hz. That kind of visual fidelity isn’t possible when playing handheld. Even with the best model, you’re only getting a 1280 by 800 resolution in up to 90Hz.</p>
<p>This docking station powers your Steam Deck while its sitting in place over USB-C. It utilizes 100W PD charging to provide fast power to your gaming handheld. That makes this dock not just great for playing your games on the big screen, but just being your Steam Deck’s home when you’re finished playing. This way each time you reach for it, you know it will be at full charge.</p>
<p>The dock also has two USB-A ports, great for connecting a wired controller. You can, of course, always choose to use a wireless controller instead over Bluetooth. It connects to a display over HDMI. It also has a built-in Ethernet port so you can maintain a fast connection when playing online multiplayer or just hoping to download a big game super fast. The port is capable of up to 1,000Mbps.</p>



<p>The UGREEN docking station stands apart from other third-party docks on the market because of its overall design.</p>
<p>It can fold up for easy storage. This also makes it practical to take it with you while traveling. Game handheld while on the plane and then go full screen with the TV when you reach your Airbnb.</p>
<p>You can also adjust the viewing angle of your Steam Deck. This is great for using the Steam Deck as a stand and playing off that like a Nintendo Switch in Tabletop Mode.</p>
<p>Under the docking station are a series of non-slip silicone. This adds stability so the dock won’t slide around inside or on top of your media center. It’ll stay firmly in place while you game.</p>

<p>Arrowhead’s CCO has stated that they have a prototype of a rogue-lite mode for Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 has been receiving a whole lot of updates recently, focusing on performance and optimisation. Most recently, the developers made significant progress in reducing the PC file size, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-pc-file-size-reduced-by-85-slim-version-now-available-in-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bringing it down by 85%</a>. Now, it seems they might have something big cooking towards the content side as well. </p>

No other details about this game mode were revealed. </p>



<p>Pilestedt has been providing a lot of Helldivers 2 details on X recently. His recent <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1998864084197073309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> had an image of four directors having dinner at a restaurant with the caption, “with the directors, talking about Helldivers 2 next 4 arcs. Any hot takes? When asked where it will take 3 years to deliver these arcs, Pilestedt responded, stating they will “deliver a bit more often than that” moreso now as they are “in a better technical space”. </p>

Indeed, their statement ends with the suggestion that "all the media attention this has received will do something to convince investors" that Shenmue 4 should be made.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I just wanted to set the record straight for all those who think it might still be half real," JustAFan1 wrote. "It's not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I know many of you will want to hang me for dashing your hopes, but know this was not done out of malice, but love for Shenmue. I realize I went about it the wrong way, and I apologize for that. But I hope all the media attention this has received will do something to convince investors that Shenmue is very much alive and profitable if approached correctly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As proof that they were the creator of the video, JustAFan1 posted a link to a new version of the trailer with additional music and footage, along with a lengthier apology statement in both English and Japanese. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I want to be absolutely clear: I am merely a fan of the series and have absolutely no professional or personal affiliation with Ys Net, nor have I ever had any," this statement reads. "The creation and release of the trailer, which presented itself as an official piece of promotional material recorded behind the scenes, was a lapse in judgment. I take full responsibility for this action."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shenmue 3 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">JustAFan1's statement continues by confirming that the fake trailer's story elements were made using publicly available lore and common fan theories about where the Shenmue series might progress in future, with nothing that specifically reflected any real development that may or may not be underway within Ys Net. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While my intent was centered on a positive outcome, the method I chose to achieve it was misleading and unprofessional. I deeply regret creating and sharing information that was not factual, and I understand the negative impact this misinformation had.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The sole purpose behind creating the 'Shenmue 4' trailer was to demonstrate the sustained and substantial market demand and community enthusiasm for this beloved series," the video statement concludes. "I meant no harm to Ys Net, its brand, or its loyal fans. My motivation was to champion the series and help encourage its continuation, not to mislead or create distress."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to the statement has been mostly supportive, with many agreeing that the trailer had created fresh buzz for the franchise amid hope for confirmation of a new game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nah, you're good," fan hyo_razuki replied. "I knew it was fake from the beginning but it was fun and you generated some enthusiasm for Shenmue, so no biggie, no need to apologize."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of now, it's unknown if a fourth major Shenmue game will ever get made, though the franchise's fans certainly hope it happens. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yu-suzuki-talks-shenmue-4-air-twister-and-40-years-of-game-development">Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki told IGN in 2023 that he wanted to create a fourth game at some point</a>, though he is currently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shenmue-3-enhanced-announced-as-most-refined-version-of-ryo-hazukis-epic-journey">still working on an enhanced version of Shenmue 3</a>. This, Suzuki hopes, will win the game a warmer reception across a wider set of platforms, after a middling response to Shenmue 3 at the game's initial launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
