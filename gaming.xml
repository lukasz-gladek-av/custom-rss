            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-gold-kojima-daruma-doll<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hideo Kojima and his studio Kojima Productions have announced that upcoming open-world epic&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>has gone gold, and Kojima is celebrating with a time-honored Japanese custom.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hideokojimaen.bsky.kojimaproductions.jp/post/3lopyu7eyrk2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Kojima posted a picture of the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>gold master disk. In case you're unaware, a gold master disk is the version of the game from which other copies are pressed, so Kojima's post essentially means&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>is ready to ship.</p>

<p>Alongside the shot of the disk, Kojima also posted a picture of himself filling in the right eye of a Japanese daruma doll. Again, in case you're not familiar with the custom, a daruma doll's left eye is filled in when a goal is decided on, and the right eye is filled in when the goal is completed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-2-gold-running.jpg?itok=DrKGyApg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-2-gold-running.jpg?itok=qpkBjIVQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>has gone gold, so it really won't be long until you can play it now.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, it is, believe it or not, the sequel to 2019's&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>.</p>

<p>While a number of trailers have been released for&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, the game's plot is characteristically abstract. It'll pick up after the events of the first game and will ask the question "should we have connected?", but the specifics and minutiae of the story are still unknown at the moment.</p>

<p>We also know that a number of characters will be returning from the first game, including&nbsp;Léa Seydoux's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-explains-additional-hands-on-fragiles-shoulders-in-death-stranding-2-on" rel="nofollow">Fragile</a>, Troy Baker's Higgs, and, of course, protagonist Sam Porter-Bridges, portrayed by the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-confirmed-by-norman-reedus" rel="nofollow">rather loose-lipped</a> Norman Reedus.</p>

<p>They'll join new additions to the cast like George Miller's Tarman, Debra Wilson's Doctor, and Luca Marinelli's Neil, and we'll get to find out how they fit into the story when&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>launches (although even then, given Kojima's past form, that isn't guaranteed).</p>




<p><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th (although a version for PC will almost certainly arrive afterwards, if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-is-coming-to-pc-after-all" rel="nofollow">the first game</a> is anything to go by).</p>

		<p>The founders of Sumo Group have announced their retirement. CEO Carl Cavers, COO Paul Porter and Director of Excellence and Integration Darren Mills are all leaving the company after leading Sumo since 2003. Under their leadership, Sumo has released games such as Outrun 2, Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing: Transformed, LittleBigPlanet 3, Snake Pass, and Sackboy: A Big Adventure.</p>
<p>“Stepping away from something we’ve built over two decades is never easy, but it’s the right time,” said Carl Cavers, outgoing CEO and co-founder. “We’re incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved together, and we’re confident that Sumo is in a strong position to continue evolving and thriving.”</p>


<p>With the retirement of the three founders there is obviously a change in leadership at Sumo Group. Gary Dunn will take on the role of COO and be co-CEO with &nbsp;Andy Stewart, who is also the Chief Financial Officer. Tim Repa-Davies has moved onto the company’s board of directors, while remaining as the Head of Legal and Business Affairs.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/04/sumo-group-stops-making-original-ip-to-focus-on-partner-titles/">Sumo Group announced it would stop making original IP to focus on partner titles</a>, due to the company’s position and need to maintain a long term strategy for the continued survival of the group. In March, Sumo Group sold off its publishing arm <a href="https://www.sumo-digital.com/news-insights/emona-capital-completes-acquisition-of-secret-mode/">Secret Mode to Emona Capital</a>, a financial investment firm which also has holdings in Relic Entertainment and Amber Studio. At the time of the sale, Ed Blincoe and James Schall remained in leadership positions within of the company. Sumo is currently working to support development of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5/">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-33-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.3, with the latest update for the turn-based gacha RPG landing later this month.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-32-release-date" rel="nofollow">last month's</a> Version 3.2,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.3, also known as "The Fall at Dawn's Rise", will be arriving across all platforms on May 21st. As you'd expect, it'll bring a chunk of new story, plus two new characters for your team and more.</p>

<p>In story terms, you'll be taking part in the "final battle of Flame-Chase Journey", standing against the Sky Titan Aquila, which "controls the cycles of dawn and dusk" thanks to having "the sky as its eyelids". Good luck with that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.3-release-date-hyacine.jpg?itok=ysPR7mAg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.3-release-date-hyacine.jpg?itok=j73OYLem 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two new characters will be available in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.3.</figcaption></figure><p>As is often the case, two new five-star playable characters will debut as part of the latest&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>update. The first, Hyacine, is a healer who can restore her team's HP and boost "overall survivability" thanks to her Ultimate.</p>

<p>Joining Hyacine is Cipher, a Quantum character on the Path of Nihility. She's a damage-dealer who can analyse enemies in order to dish out additional damage based on punishment they've already taken.</p>

<p>Alongside these two, five-star limited fighters The Herta and Aglaea will be returning in the first and second halves of Version 3.3's event cycle, so if you missed your chance to grab them the first time around, be sure to seize this opportunity.</p>

<p>As well as the story,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.3 also adds minigames like the new "Penacony Speed Cup Spheroid Racing Tournament" event, which gives you the chance to race your Spheroid Racer against opponents in "high-stakes showdowns".</p>




<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 3.3, "The Fall at Dawn's Rise", launches across all of these platforms on May 21st.</p>

It is <em>the</em> rivalry of a generation, and it will be rekindled again—perhaps for the final time—at WWE Backlash.</p><p>Born out of the Ruthless Aggression Era, their feud has spanned decades, titles, and turning points in the industry. Cena became the Hulk Hogan-esque face of the company, wearing bright colors, coining memorable catchphrases, always doing the right thing, and securing impossible underdog victories night in and night out.</p><p>Orton, meanwhile, embodied pure evil. Aptly nicknamed the WWE’s “Apex Predator,” his violent move set and remorseless attitude made him one of the most dangerous, despicable heels in the history of professional wrestling.</p><p>In the 2000s and early 2010s, they were two sides of WWE’s main-event coin: Cena the superhero, Orton the supervillain. They were meant for each other.</p><p>Now, in 2025, the roles are reversed, but the animosity remains. Ahead of the WWE Backlash pay-per-view, we examine the ins, outs, RKOs, and Attitude Adjustments of John Cena and Randy Orton’s historic rivalry.</p></div></div><div><p>John Cena and Randy Orton squared off long before the WWE Universe knew their names… and before Cena was literally “Cena.”</p><p>The Prototype, as he was dubbed in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), the WWE’s former developmental territory, met his future rival multiple times in the promotion. Most notably, he defeated “Cowboy” Bob Orton’s son for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw7SgbM7i5w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw7SgbM7i5w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OVW Championship</a></span> in the latter’s final match with the company. The WWE had plans for Mr. RKO.</p><p>Twenty-five years and 31 combined world championships later, Orton looks to return the favor. Orton may very well kill the legend of John Cena at Backlash by capturing the title and sending the GOAT into retirement empty-handed. The full-circle moment writes itself.</p></div><div><p>By this point, Cena had shed his Doctor of Thuganomics persona to be the superhero marine that embodied “Hustle, Loyalty, and Respect” and crashed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcvJV5F1HM4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcvJV5F1HM4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live sex celebrations</a></span>. Orton leveraged his success as the “Legend Killer” in wrestling stable Evolution to become the youngest world champion ever, and nearly decapitate <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xooL_QCFLI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xooL_QCFLI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shawn Michaels</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtf8OcwFZ_0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtf8OcwFZ_0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Van Dam</a></span>.</p><p>The stage was set for the WWE’s new face to cross paths with its most sinister heel.</p><p>Orton hit Cena with several patented “Outta nowhere!!” RKOs leading up to their bout at SummerSlam 2007, which Cena won thanks to a big comeback (shocker!). The following night on Raw, Orton ripped Cena’s father over the barricade and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GETeK8ptPA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GETeK8ptPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">punted the bejesus</a></span> out of him in a move that is still burned in every wrestling fan’s memory over 15 years later.</p><p>The two wrestled at Unforgiven a month later, which Orton won by disqualification seven minutes in when Cena ignored the ref’s calls to stop wailing on his opponent. A payoff match was set for No Mercy the following month, but Cena legitimately tore his pectoral muscle days before, and then was viciously attacked by the newly nicknamed “Viper.”</p><p>With Cena out, Orton won the title. While the feud teased the duo’s electric chemistry, it left a lot to be desired. Fortunately, it wouldn’t be long before the duo traded blows again in the squared circle.</p></div><div><p>In 2008, John Cena pulled off his most iconic Super-Cena feat. The same pectoral injury Cena suffered (thanks to Orton, in kayfabe) was supposed to put him on the shelf for at least 6 months. Instead, he shocked the world than 4 months later to win the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNlObJjzoyk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNlObJjzoyk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royal Rumble at Madison Square Garden</a></span>. If you ever want to know how deafening an audience pop can get, just listen to how the Madison Square Garden crowd roared when Super-Cena came from behind the curtains.</p><p>That meant Cena would face WWE Champion Randy Orton for the title he never lost. But, they didn’t wait until WrestleMania to pick up where they left off. The foes fought at No Way Out in an emotion-filled, physical contest that saw Orton eventually “throw in the towel” (or rather, a wet blanket) by slapping the ref and disqualifying himself to retain.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Cena, Orton, and Triple H met in a Triple Threat match at WrestleMania XXIV. “The Viper” slithered to an underhanded victory, punting Triple H after his former mentor pedigreed Cena, then covering Cena for the 1-2-3 to retain the title.</p><p>Less than a month later, Orton pulled off a similar tactic in a Fatal 4-Way match at Backlash. He eliminated Cena with a punt after Cena forced JBL to tap. If the second John Cena and Randy Orton feud helped establish “Big Match John” as Superman, then Orton’s opportunistic constricting was his kryptonite.</p></div><div><p>Bald-headed Randy was a MENACE!</p><p>Early in 2009, Orton and his Legacy pals (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase) locked horns with the McMahons. He punted Vince and DDT’d, then kissed Stephanie while she lay unconscious next to her helpless, handcuffed husband Triple H. Talk about a bad day at the office.</p><p>Orton attributed his uncontrollable violence to IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder), claiming he wasn’t responsible for his actions… and you believed him. There truly seemed to be “voices” in his head; multiple personalities urging him to commit heinous act after heinous act. When the unforgivable deed of the day was done, he emoted both terror and exhilaration. He was deranged and may have deserved an Emmy for it.</p><p>By the time summer rolled around, Orton’s mental and physical transformation was complete. He shaved his head and became WWE’s Voldemort. VoldemOrton, if you will. Once handsome and charismatic, now sub-human and sadistic. He was pure evil, and the internet remembers.</p><p>Cue John Cena’s music. Cena and Orton renewed their rivalry, embarking on a five-matches-in-four-months odyssey for the WWE Championship, with Orton winning thrice and Cena winning twice.</p><p>Cena officially ended Orton’s reign in a 60-minute, anything-goes Iron Man bout at Bragging Rights. The feud solidified both men as inevitable.</p></div><div><p>Nothing brings WWE superstars together quite like a common enemy.</p><p>A tornado in the form of the Nexus ravaged through the WWE in the summer of 2010, destroying everyone and everything that stood in their path, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcUrh7xUcqM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcUrh7xUcqM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including John Cena</a></span>.</p><p>In his efforts to vanquish the group, Cena competed in a highly stipulated match with the faction’s leader Wade Barrett: if Cena won, the Nexus would disband. If Barrett won, Cena would join the “terrorist” organization. Barrett won and Cena became his lackey.</p><p>Barrett then embarked on a quest to capture the WWE title from Randy Orton, and enlisted Cena to be in his corner during their championship match at Bragging Rights. When that didn’t yield results, Barrett had Cena act as a special guest referee in his rematch against Orton with the understanding that if Barrett didn’t walk away champion, Cena would be fired.</p><p>The morally upstanding Cena counted the 1-2-3, giving Orton the win and costing himself his job. The next night on Raw, Cena made a farewell speech in the ring, and as he walked backstage out of the arena, Randy Orton shook his hand and they hugged. It was a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN1OxTdN0JQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN1OxTdN0JQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surreal Thor and Loki</a></span> brotherly love moment.</p></div><div><p>Three years post-Nexus invasion, the WWE looked different. CM Punk’s pipe bomb promo catapulted him to icon status, The Shield wreaked havoc, Daniel Bryan became the most beloved star since Stone Cold, and The Authority—led by Triple H and Stephanie McMahon—called the shots.</p><p>Despite a new wave of A+ talent and storylines, John Cena and Randy Orton, their generation’s Rock and Austin, fought in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match to unify the WWE and World Heavyweight titles. Orton won the contest (and retained in a rematch at the Royal Rumble), but the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfkSrk1QuY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfkSrk1QuY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Championship Ascension Ceremony</a></span>” on the Raw prior to TLC remains the highlight of the feud.</p><p>As Cena and Orton stood face-to-face, former world champions packed the ring. Orton cheap-shotted Cena, sparking a domino effect brawl involving Triple H, Punk, Shawn Michaels, and Daniel Bryan. The melee ended with Orton accidentally knocking down Stephanie McMahon and Triple H retaliating with a Pedigree.</p><p>Like Daniel Bryan and the “YES” Movement hijacked Raw, they too will hijack this write-up, as the fans’ unrelenting desire for him to become the unified champ—strongly reinforced by this moment—eventually played out. The WWE Universe was ready for a changing of the guard.</p></div><div><p>Since the Elimination Chamber in March, we’ve been living in the Upside Down. John Cena is a heel.</p><p>The self-proclaimed unseen 17-time champion alleges he’s the victim of a decades-long abusive relationship with fans. He low-blowed Cody Rhodes to win the WWE title at WrestleMania and eclipse Ric Flair’s record. He says he’s raised the WWE Universe’s kids better than their own parents. He declares that he’s going to ruin wrestling.</p><p>For someone who hasn’t played the villain since 2003, Cena’s scarily good at it. His logic is so sharp, it’s hard not to think he’s been holding grudges against the fans for years. This isn’t Hollywood Hogan or Final Boss Rock. This is John Cena—hateful, bitter, living his heelish truth.</p><p>Randy Orton’s solution for Cena’s attitude adjustment? Have kids! WWE’s Apex Predator says it’ll help Cena grow up. If that isn’t <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-Iveaww5WM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-Iveaww5WM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SpongeBob SquarePants Opposite Day</a></span>-level shenanigans, I don’t know what is. Somehow, it works. It’s two veterans with new outlooks clashing once again.</p><p>When Randy Orton and John Cena square off at Backlash, it may very well be the last time they do. The time is now to live in the moment and enjoy. We’ve only got a few of those left with Cena.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Killing Floor 3 was initially set to release on March 25, 2025, but the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-delayed-to-later-in-2025/">delayed</a> with no new release date announced weeks before that initial date. On Friday, Tripwire Interactive finally announced the new release date for <strong>July 24, 2025,</strong> making it a four-month delay.</p>
<p>In a press release announcing the new date, Tripwire Interactive's creative director, Bryan Wynia, marked the "<em>incredible</em>" support the studio has seen from fans of the Killing Floor series, since Tripwire delayed Killing Floor 3 specifically to respond to feedback from the series' community.</p>
<p>It was after a closed beta for Killing Floor 3 that didn't go as well as Tripwire would have wanted, which largely influenced the decision to delay the game another four months. Tripwire noted in its March statement confirming the delay that the feedback from that closed beta made the team realize it had "<em>missed the mark</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Since delaying the launch of Killing Floor 3, we've dedicated the additional development time to responding to the community's feedback, ensuring the next chapter in the much-loved cult action/horror franchise lives up to our shared</em> <em>vision,</em>" Wynia said in today's press release.</p>
<p>"<em>The support from fans has been incredible, and with the new July 24th release date in sight, we're thrilled to bring that vision to players not just at launch, but through the continued support of new features and content that is a hallmark of our studio.</em>"</p>
<p>Part of Tripwire's method of responding to community feedback during the delay period has been consistently updating fans on the progress the team made through the game's <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?forums/kf-3-news-announcements.2333661/">official forums</a>. Updates and changes to the UI, design, and artwork have been posted nearly every few days since the delay was announced on March 7, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date-july-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tripwire Interactive has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>release date, with the multiplayer-focused zed-slaying shooter now set to release in the summer.</p>

<p>Back in March (which is also when the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">originally intended to launch</a>), Tripwire <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>, citing a need to implement changes suggested by user feedback from the game's closed beta test.</p>

<p>In a new press release, Tripwire says that its development team has been using the extra time from the delay to address that feedback, and so a new release date of July 24th has been set. In the interim, Tripwire says it will release more dev diaries showing off the ways in which it's implementing player suggestions.</p>

<p>The new release date also means that pre-orders for the three different versions of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>&nbsp;- Standard, Deluxe, and Elite - are once again live.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering, pre-ordering the Standard version nets you the game, plus a weapon skin set, a weapon trinket, and a player card. The Deluxe edition gets you all of that plus two extra Shadow Agent skin sets, a Nightfall Supply Pass, and 1000 Nightfall Creds.</p>

<p>Finally, the Elite edition includes everything outlined above, but ups the Nightfall Supply Pass total to four and the Creds total to 3000. Pre-orders for all three editions are available across PC and consoles right now.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is, it's the third mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>series of multiplayer-focused first-person shooters. Taking place 70 years after&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 2</em>, it sees you and your buddies teaming up to take down an army of slavering monsters known as Zeds.</p>

<p><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430190/Killing_Floor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/killing-floor-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/killing-floor-3/9pfzlckhc1vm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on July 24th.</p>

In addition, this version also introduces two new playable characters—Hyacine and Cipher—each bringing their own compelling backstory and distinct flair to the unfolding saga. A wide array of limited-time events will also offer fresh excitement and challenges throughout the journey.</p><p>In the previous chapter, the Chrysos Heirs reclaimed the Coreflame of “Death” and “Reason.” Now, in Version 3.3, Trailblazers will stand alongside Chrysos Heirs for the final battle of Flame-Chase Journey—confronting the Sky Titan. According to ancient records, Aquila is a hundred-eyed giant bird. With the sky as its eyelids, it controls the cycles of dawn and dusk. In addition, “Echo of War: Glance of Twilight” will also become available in Version 3.3, offering players brand-new challenges and generous rewards.</p><p>While the people of Amphoreus pursue Era Nova from within their world, the geniuses beyond it are watching closely. At the end of Version 3.2, Madam Herta’s data spirit entity successfully reached the Vortex of Genesis. As the Geniuses delve deeper into their investigation, the root of Amphoreus’s tragedy will gradually come to light and its fate will intertwine with that of the galaxy. Yet, how the story unfolds from here is for players to discover in the chapters ahead.</p><p>In the upcoming story, a new 5-star character, Hyacine, will join the Trailblazer’s team as a vital ally. As the chief physician of the Twilight Courtyard, Hyacine has long been responsible for the medical care of Flame-Chasers. Her ideal is to leave a footnote for ordinary people on the blank pages of epic history, doing her utmost to heal every soul in need. A Wind character following the Path of Remembrance, Hyacine excels at restoring HP for the entire team and boosting overall survivability. By using her abilities and summoning Little Ica, she provides continuous healing to her allies. When she unleashes her Ultimate, Hyacine not only restores HP to all teammates but also increases their Max HP. Additionally, whenever any ally (excluding Little Ica) is attacked or voluntarily sacrifices their own HP, Little Ica will consume its own HP to automatically heal them. Beyond healing, Little Ica can also attack enemies, and the damage Little Ica deals scales with the amount of healing performed.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_964199"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Another new 5-star playable character, Cipher, is one of the earliest Chrysos Heirs to join the Flame-Chase Journey alongside Aglaea and Tribbie. As the inheritor of Trickery’s divine authority, Cipher has wielded this power for years, yet her movements remain elusive and unpredictable. No one has ever been able to pin down her true whereabouts… A Quantum character following the Path of Nihility, Cipher specializes in targeting the enemy with the highest Max HP on the field, placing them under a special status that records all damage they take. She can also actively switch the marked target, allowing for adaptive tactics mid-battle. When allies attack the marked enemy, Cipher performs a follow-up attack. Upon using her Ultimate, she unleashes additional True DMG based on the total recorded damage!</p><p>Additionally, the limited 5-star characters The Herta and Aglaea will have their return in the first and second halves of the Version 3.3 warp event, respectively. Their formidable assistance makes them invaluable allies for your future journeys.</p><p>Beyond the compelling story, Version 3.3 also introduces a variety of exciting events that promise brand-new gameplay experiences. Registration is now open for the Penacony Speed Cup Spheroid Racing Tournament, where top racers will gather for high-stakes showdowns! Trailblazers will take the wheel of their Spheroid Racers and engage in thrilling speed challenges. In addition, thanks to Giovanni’s investment, Legend of the Galactic Baseballer: Demon King is officially launching! Based on player feedback during the previous beta test, the official release retains the raccoon’s quest for the bat while adding a host of exciting new elements that bring fresh challenges to the battlefield.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,433 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [23,099 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer and special program below.

            <p>More games have been added to the Video Game Hall of Fame, including Rare's brilliant first-person shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-review">GoldenEye 007</a>.</p>
<p>The Strong Museum's <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/exhibits/world-video-game-hall-of-fame/">Video Game Hall of Fame</a> was established back in 2015, with a goal to recognise individual electronic games from arcade to console and everything in between which have "enjoyed popularity over a sustained period and have exerted influence on the video game industry or on popular culture and society in general".</p>
<p>And now, having missed out on being inducted to this Hall of Fame back in 2023, N64 classic GoldenEye 007 has finally made the cut.</p>

<p>"GoldenEye surpassed its contemporaries to become the third best-selling game on the Nintendo 64, beaten only by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-64">Mario Kart 64</a>," the <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/games/goldeneye-007/">Video Game Hall of Fame team wrote of GoldenEye 007</a>.</p>
<p>"Critics lauded it as the premier example of a first-person shooter to succeed on a console rather than a PC, and it is still considered one of the best multiplayer experiences ever produced on a Nintendo system."</p>
<p>This is honestly one of my favourite games of all time. When it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-comes-to-nintendo-switch-online-xbox-game-pass-this-friday">released on Xbox in 2023</a>, I spent quite a bit of time besting my family in the multiplayer. And, thanks to the introduction of Achievements with this Xbox release, I can still look back at my unforgiving gaming dominance with pride... (see below)</p>

Since its conception in 2015, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-first-video-game-hall-of-fame-selects-its-inaugural-class">49 games have been added to the Strong Museum's World Video Game Hall of Fame</a>.

<p>As for the future of James Bond games, Hitman developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has one in the pipeline, known for now as Project 007. This release will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">kick off a new trilogy of games</a>, IOI hopes. </p>

I hope fans will enjoy and be fulfilled with the experience this new film has to offer."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The film's plot will feel familiar to anyone who played the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-2001"><u>Silent Hill 2</u></a> or the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>2024 Bloober remake</u></a>. It follows "James (Jeremy Irvine), a man broken after being separated from his one true love (Hannah Emily Anderson).

Our worst fears realized yet again. The video game-to-film genre has endured more than a decade of mediocrity.

            <p>The map masters who make the madcap map mayhem of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a> have made more maps for maladjusted mates to mop up their misgivings in machinegunning map-bound mockery. The magnificent maraud 'em up has mustered 37 more maps a mere month after the mapsters mapped <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-1v1-shooter-you-keep-hearing-whispers-about-now-has-an-obscene-226-maps">a further 35 maps</a> into the multiplayer mix-up, meaning that by my map math the myriad maps now measure 263 - much more than many mainstream grudge match manufacturers may have mapped.</p>
<!--more-->
<p> Ahem. </p>
<p>The maps were mentioned in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2386720/view/523090111361976393">major map update</a> that immersed new maps, mechanics and murder machinery into the muzzle misfiring must-play. The makers of the militaristic manshoot have moreover made a stun mine as a means of mystifying your miffed matchmate.   </p>
<p>There's more to mull over. The minicity of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babbdi">Babbdi</a> now manifests as a multiplayer metropolis, a map which may emerge in your memory as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-a-brutalist-city-with-climbing-axes-and-a-trumpet-in-this-great-free-indie-game">the murky municipality in the magnificent muckabout</a> of the aforementioned moniker (my most memorable moment was mounting the motorbike).</p>
<p>Another minor modification sees maps maximise movement with a mini marathon, a "Racing System" that may amass more malevolence among mates. To mollify matters militant messers may now muss up their mohawks with markedly more cosmetics. Meanwhile, the main menu has been met with a makeover.</p>
<p>The macabre mirror matches of Straftat are unmissable. In a moment when many media misfits like myself are miscontent with modern multiplayer movement shooters, the immeasurably multiplying maps of the Lemaitres make for a minorly mythical tale of unmatchable might. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-review">marvellous</a> map for the medium to meet. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has updated its Nintendo Account Agreement with a severe warning against "unauthorised use", in a bid to prevent emulation and piracy.</p>
<p>All those with a Nintendo account will have received an email (including Eurogamer) linking to the updated policy. And, as <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-emulation-hacking-brick-warning-terms-of-service">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a> spotted, the wording for the Licence for Digital Products section has been altered.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/term/eula/GB?lang=en-GB">agreement for UK accounts</a> now states digital products are "licensed only for personal and non-commercial use", and that any "unauthorised use of a Digital Product may result in the Digital Product becoming unusable".</p>

<p>This differs slightly from the US, which states: "You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with the foregoing restrictions Nintendo may render the Nintendo Account Services and/or the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part."</p>
<p>For comparison, here's the original wording (effective since April 2021): "You are not allowed to lease, rent, sublicense, publish, copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble all or any portion of the Nintendo Account Services without Nintendo's written consent, or unless otherwise expressly permitted by applicable law."</p>
<p>And here's the UK update in full: "Any Digital Products registered to your Nintendo Account and any updates of such Digital Products are licensed only for personal and non-commercial use on a User Device. Digital Products must not be used for any other purpose. In particular, without NOE's written consent, you must neither lease nor rent Digital Products nor sublicense, publish, copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of Digital Products other than as expressly permitted by applicable law. Such unauthorised use of a Digital Product may result in the Digital Product becoming unusable."</p>
<p>The US update is as follows: "Without limitation, you agree that you may not (a) publish, copy, modify, reverse engineer, lease, rent, decompile, disassemble, distribute, offer for sale, or create derivative works of any portion of the Nintendo Account Services; (b) bypass, modify, decrypt, defeat, tamper with, or otherwise circumvent any of the functions or protections of the Nintendo Account Services, including through the use of any hardware or software that would cause the Nintendo Account Services to operate other than in accordance with its documentation and intended use; (c) obtain, install or use any unauthorised copies of Nintendo Account Services; or (d) exploit the Nintendo Account Services in any manner other than to use them in accordance with the applicable documentation and intended use, in each case, without Nintendo's written consent or express authorisation, or unless otherwise expressly permitted by applicable law. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with the foregoing restrictions Nintendo may render the Nintendo Account Services and/or the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/term/privacy_policy/GB?lang=en-GB">Nintendo Account Privacy Policy</a> has also been updated ahead of the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>. Now, Nintendo will be able to record video and voice chats stored on your console for a limited period of time - if you give consent.</p>
<p>This is intended for anyone who encounters "language or behaviour that may violate applicable laws", with the company able to review the last three minutes of recorded footage. This is to ensure a "safe and family-friendly online environment".</p>
<p>The update comes ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-finally-explains-what-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-does">Game Chat feature on Switch 2</a>, where players can essentially video call each other during gameplay.</p>
<p>Back in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">Nintendo shared a legal victory over French file-sharing company Dstorage</a>, which it stated was "significant...for the entire games industry".</p>
<p>It followed a string of moves against piracy, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">shutdown of Switch emulator Yuzu</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">lawsuit against a streamer who regularly played pirated copies of Nintendo games ahead of release</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-remake-considered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Chrono Trigger remake may not be in development, but Dragon Quest series creator Yuji Horii, one of the main scenario writers and designers of the classic role-playing game, is "contemplating" developing one.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-yuji-horii-contemplating-a-chrono-trigger-remake-1540193/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameReactor</a>, the beloved developer mentioned that it has been a long time since the original was released and that he definitely wants to do something with it. As he has received a lot of requests from fans for a Chrono Trigger remake, he is starting to contemplate it, suggesting that it would be an HD-2D remake and not a full-blown 3D remake in the vein of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy.</p>
<p>Besides talking about the possibility of a Chrono Trigger remake, the Dragon Quest series creator also commented on the <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/yuji-horiis-best-tribute-to-the-late-akira-toriyama-we-can-make-a-next-title-using-what-he-had-left-1540733/">future of the series</a> in relation to Akira Toriyama's unfortunate passing. After remarking on how he was shocked at learning that Toriyama-san had passed away, Horii-san revealed that he had left many things before he passed, and he believes that another entry in the series can use what he left to ensure some continuity with the rest of the franchise.</p>
<p data-start="142" data-end="587"><a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/">Last week</a>, it truly seemed like a Chrono Trigger remake was in development, as Yuji Horii reportedly confirmed it during this year's Napoli COMICON. However, expectations were quickly dashed when it was clarified that the statement was a misunderstanding caused by an interpreter error. Still, given recent statements, there's reason to remain hopeful, even if it may be some time before we can embark once again on one of the most epic journeys through time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-multiplatform-strategy-publishers-baffled-no-xbox-versions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The current Xbox multiplatform strategy is leaving certain publishers and developers baffled, so much so that they no longer see the need to develop Xbox versions of their games, considering the consolidated PlayStation dominance on the market.</p>
<p>Speaking during a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgCII8nnKHg&amp;t=1150s"> recent podcast</a>, The Game Business's co-founder Christopher Dring commented on the current situation of the console market, highlighting how, with Xbox's multiplatform strategy, PlayStation is the dominant player more than ever before in the console space. Almost every Xbox game launching this year is also coming to PlayStation 5 at launch, like DOOM: The Dark Ages and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>. Only Avowed and South of Midnight did not launch on PlayStation 5 this year, but they could be the final Xbox console exclusives for the time being.</p>
<p>While the Xbox multiplatform strategy could be paying off in some way, as Microsoft's published games on PlayStation 5 are doing quite well, certain publishers and developers are reportedly baffled. From their point of view, they want the competition in the console space, and if Microsoft is releasing their games at launch on other systems, seemingly leaving their hardware behind, they don't see the need to create Xbox versions of games. As such, Christopher Dring highlighted, Microsoft will have to strike a balance in the future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Has Xbox’s Call of Duty Game Pass gamble paid off?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JgCII8nnKHg?start=1150&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Though the current multiplatform strategy seems to suggest otherwise, the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles won't be the last gaming systems by Microsoft. The company is hard at work on its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">next-generation plans</a>, which include an Xbox-branded handheld in development together with ASUS, of which we saw the first images <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-ally-2-and-project-kennan-xbox-branded-handheld-pictured-in-us-fcc-leak/">earlier this week,</a> a full-fledged handheld system and a proper home console that will be the successor to the Xbox Series X and that will deliver the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">largest technical&nbsp;leap to date</a>. With the current market conditions being so challenging, however, plans could definitely change, and it will be very interesting to see how the big console manufacturers will manage to overcome all these hurdles that are making gaming a very expensive hobby.</p>

            <p>I've been meaning to research the Crusades for a while. A series of vicious medieval religious wars for control of the Holy Land, initiated by the Latin Christian Church following the conquest of Jerusalem by the Rashidun Caliphate, they've become a collection of memes bandied around by today's armchair fascists. See also, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deus-vult">"deus vult"</a>. I've explored them indirectly in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">articles about the cultural inheritance of Warhammer 40,000</a>, but never really dipped into any history books or crusader fiction save for ailing 2004 action game Knights Of The Temple: Infernal Crusade, in which Sir Spamalot Go Bonk against a majestic sunset.</p>
<p>One place to start the R&amp;D rollout might be Knights Of The Crusades, a grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> 4X game in which players re-enact the period from the perspective of Christian and Muslim factions.</p><!--more-->

<p>Knights Of The Crusades launched into early access this week, and "takes you on a grand journey through the First Crusade and beyond--across the Holy Land, Spain, North Africa, and Eastern Europe." It's from the developers of the Kingdom Wars games, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unknown-pleasures-the-machine-starts">which we have enjoyed in the past</a>, and strikes me as basically Age Of Empires but Paradox-scale.</p>
<p>The main campaign sees you first tooling up to contest Jerusalem and then, growing your holdings as you "shape a world that reacts to your choices across a massive dynamic map filled with cities, pilgrim routes, shifting alliances, and relentless holy wars". There is much talk in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3440120/_Knights_of_the_Crusades/">the Steam page overview video</a> of raiding hamlets and putting innocents to the sword. Glamorising it may be, but it doesn't seem sanitised. There's the endgame prospect of, essentially, becoming the bad guys from Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p>The above describes the initial Eastern European Christian or Templar campaigns, anyway: as regards the early access update schedule, the developers are promising "a lot of focus on making every culture feel unique, with new units, building sets, and mechanics for Pagan, Orthodox, Muslim, and Western Christian factions."</p>
<p>Will it turn out to be a careful study of two hundred years of zealotry and pillage, or will it be another excuse for the scurvy alt-righteous to cosplay as Richard the Lionheart, or will it be some secret third thing? Only you, a hypothetical Crusades historian and/or time-traveller who has played the 1.0 version, can decide. Right now, I'll settle for saying that I'm abstractly interested in the idea of a campaign that begins with a Zerg rush towards a specific location, then phases into a more open-ended and murky 4X structure.</p>
<p>The obvious place to start any video game-skewed Crusades research would be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a>, but I fear I am too daft and fickle to play Crusader Kings. Or too time-strapped, anyway. Still, I welcome any advice you have about either the Paradox series or other video games that investigate this terrible period and its legacy. It can't be <em>all</em> strategy sims, surely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing some Steam Deck and PC-specific fixes alongside other improvements and balance changes.</p>
<p>The 1.2.3 patch introduces a minor Steam Deck improvement, fixing backgrounds of various menus not displaying correctly on the system, as well as various ultrawide resolutions fixes, including gameplay no longer becoming zoomed after a cutscene, combat UI not properly adapting to ultrawide resolutions, cutscenes no longer getting letterboxed in 32:9 ratio, and more. Mouse and Keyboard controls also received some improvements, such as UI button prompts in the Expedition Menu now being fully visible and triggered with Keyboard, mouse button remaining responsive after first use, and more.</p>
<p>The new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also packs some fixes for areas where characters would get stuck on the world map, situations where Esquie would get stuck, and some balance changes. The skill that saw the most significant change is Maelle's Stendhal, which was extremely powerful in the previous version of the game, and could be easily used to one-shot even the most powerful bosses with the proper setup. You can learn more about every change the patch brings <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/499446847117461384?l=english">here.</a></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.

			<p>Despite the imminent launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the Japanese company will continue to support the older console with new games. The confirmation arrived with <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508_5e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's latest quarterly financial report</a>, which included the following statement:</p>
<p><em>These are first-party titles for Nintendo Switch that have already been announced: Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (2025), Pokémon Champions (TBD). In the Nintendo Direct held this March, we announced plans to release the titles Rhythm Heaven Groove and Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream in 2026.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Going forward, we will continue to bring out new titles for the over 100 million people worldwide who are playing Nintendo Switch.</em></p>
<p>The console's hardware sales have unsurprisingly declined year-over-year. Whereas in fiscal year 2024 Nintendo sold in (to retailers) 15.70 million units, fiscal year 2025 hardware sales stopped at 10.80 million units, a 31.2% drop. Cumulative sell-through (to consumers) lifetime sales are approaching 150 million units.</p>
<p>With such a huge install base, second only in the all-time console hardware charts to Sony's PlayStation 2 (the best-selling console of all time with over 160 million units sold), it's no wonder that Nintendo wants to keep making games for the Switch. At the same time, Nintendo also understands the importance of making exclusive titles to push consumers to buy the new Switch 2 when it lands on June 5. For instance, Mario Kart World <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will only be available on the new console</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be making the switch (pun entirely intended) right away, or will you keep playing with the previous console for some time? Let us know in the comments!</p>

            <p>For those Steamier players among us, I have some whip-cracking good news for you. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is now Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The studio has released a hotfix, which will include those optimised Steam Deck settings (a quick note from MachineGames: "When running the game on Steam Deck, the 'Texture Pool Size' is now set to a value called 'Steam Deck' to avoid exceeding RAM limits that will crash the game. Other graphics options can still be adjusted to preference).</p>
<p>This hotfix features a nice mix of bug fixes. For example, Indy will no longer drop items such as his lighter after fast fingered players rapidly switch equipped items with the d-pad at the same time as picking other objects. The developer said those who have dropped any important progression items should find them restored once they've installed the hotfix and launched the game.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, those using a DualSense to play Indiana Jones and the Great Circle should notice some improvements to the Adaptive Triggers. They should no longer quietly "click" when Indy is looking at a friendly NPC. There is also a Menu option added, which will allow modification of DualSense wireless controller Adaptive Trigger strength. This includes an option to turn it off.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team has sorted out an issue that found the cave door in Iraq closed when players revisited that level.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle initially released on Xbox and PC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-features-detailed">before arriving on PlayStation last month</a>.</p>
<p>"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle makes a successful leap on to PS5 platforms and despite its delayed release, everything we loved about the Xbox experience is intact. In comparison, the Series X is a preference over the base PS5 - given the often higher average resolution on Xbox - but the margin isn't wide enough to be a deal-breaker," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5-excellent-game-solid-port">Digital Foundry's Tom Morgan wrote following the Great Circle's PS5 debut</a>.</p>
<p>"PS5 owners still get a superb take on MachineGames' latest work. In every other respect the two are matched, right down to the consistency of their 60fps readings in gameplay and the use of RTGI."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
