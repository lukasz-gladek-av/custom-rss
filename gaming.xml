<p>A Colorado Federal court has ordered (as per the <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/keighin-final.pdf">Final Judgment</a>) that Keighin must pay Nintendo of America $17,500 in damages. This verdict follows on from an additional motion was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-seeks-injunction-and-usd17500-in-damages-from-pirate-streamer">filed in April 2025</a> after Keighin repeatedly evaded responding.</p>
<p>Magistrate Judge Scott T. Varholak's <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/keighin-reco.pdf">recommendation</a> states that Keighin streamed gameplay footage "before the games were released to the public" on "at least fifty occasions", with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> being the most recent example.</p><div><figure data-videoid="3ZPwyfIL_qU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ZPwyfIL_qU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt3ZPwyfIL_qU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3ZPwyfIL_qU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ZPwyfIL_qU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed444994lokghy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Other games include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>.</p>
<p>However, the court has refused to issue a permanent injunction on the streamer to destroy "all circumvention devices" as it is "unclear what purpose those would serve or what devices would be covered by this provision" as most of them are freely available on the internet.</p>

<p>Similarly, an injunction against third parties has also been denied on the basis that "Plaintiff’s Complaint does not allege that Defendant is working in concert with any third party".</p>
<p>In terms of the streaming, the recommendation highlights numerous times where Keighin publicly acknowledges his actions, including sharing links to emulation software on social media and even directly emailing Nintendo to say that he "will actively help people find newer and updated copies".</p>
<p>Keighin has also made other public posts taunting Nintendo, such as "You might run a corporation. I run the streets". We won't share <em>most</em> of those here, though, as many of the posts use strong and derogatory language.</p>
<p>The court has ordered the Keighin to pay $17,500 — $10,000 for streaming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>, and $500 for 15 violations including distribution of links to emulators, cryptographic keys, and circumventing technological measures to play the unreleased games.</p>
<p>Nintendo has until 13th November 2025 to submit a Status Report to the court laying out its next steps.</p>

He previously wrote for <em>Business Insider, Rolling Stone, </em><em>Futurism, </em>and <em>Popular Science.</em></span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There haven’t been a lot of opportunities to catch Switch 2 games on sale since the console launched in early June, but that’s changing thanks to Woot. The store is having <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/plus/hot-deals-on-video-games" rel="sponsored">a sale on new video games and game accessories</a> that’s live now, and runs through November 8th at 11:59PM CT. Dozens of games for all three current-generation systems are on sale, but the Switch 2 titles caught our eye because of how new they are. Woot’s deals are especially enticing because first-party Nintendo games don’t go on sale very often.</p><p>Woot’s sale also includes discounts on Switch 2 exclusives, including <em>Donkey Kong Banaza </em>and<em> Mario Kart World, </em>and Switch 2 Edition versions of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>and<em> Kirby and the Forgotten Land Plus Star-Crossed World</em>. The latter are enhanced versions of games released for the original Switch that have new exclusive content, a boost in performance, or both. If you already own the original versions of these games, Nintendo allows you to download a paid upgrade pack to get the enhancements instead of paying full price for the entire game.</p><p>There are also some respectable discounts on games released for the original Nintendo Switch, which can be played on the Switch 2, so we’ve included them here. In some cases games are listed as being an “international version” of the title, which is fine because the Nintendo Switch 2 is a region free console that’s able to play them.</p><div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjUy"><p><span>$<!-- -->62</span></p><div><p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>is one of the Switch 2’s first exclusive must-have titles. Its destructible environment allows you to smash your way through each of its 17 levels, and the paths you make will remain intact unless you specifically choose to reset the world. Your companion Paulene’s singing allows you to transform into animals that have abilities that allow you to reach previously inaccessible parts of levels. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjgx"><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><div><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> mixes up the formula that’s remained more or less the same since 1992. You still progress by out-racing your competitors across several cups, but there’s a new Knockout Tour mode in which you actually drive from stage to stage in an interconnected world. There’re new weapons to collect, an item that allows you to change costumes mid-race, and a single player mode loaded with challenges. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjc0"><p><span>$<!-- -->63</span></p><div><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>is one of the most highly-regarded games of all time thanks to its massive open world. The game gives you little direction after a brief tutorial, so you’re free to examine every nook and cranny at your leisure without hitting a single story beat. The Switch 2 Edition runs in 4K at 60 frames per second, so you can appreciate Hyrule even more. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition">Read our hands-on</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjcx"><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><div><p>The Switch 2 Edition of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </em>has the same technical enhancements as <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, but they’re more welcome here because the game struggled to run a bit on the original Switch. The game is set in the same environment as its predecessor, but Hyrule is more dense, so there’s even more to explore. Your physics-based powers help a lot with traversal. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjYy"><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><div><p>At its heart, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> Plus Jamboree TV is a game based around playing a board game with friends. However, optional modes that allow you to play the mini games in rapid succession, or take down Imitation Bowser with bombs shot through a cannon keep it feeling fresh. The Switch 2-exclusive Jamboree TV mode introduces mini games that utilize the system’s Joy-Con 2 mouse controls and optional USB-C Camera. </p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjY2"><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><div><p><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Plus Star-Crossed World </em>includes the original Switch title, plus 12 levels whose environments have been reshaped by a meteorite. Traversing the new worlds requires finding alternate routes and completing new platforming challenges. There’s also a new final boss if you complete the Ultimate Cup Z EX cup in its Colosseum boss rush mode, which requires you to face off against bosses one after another. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767427/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-review-switch-2">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjg3"><p><span>$<!-- -->45</span></p><div><p><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>is the first new side-scrolling <em>Mario </em>game in a long time, and combines the gameplay of previous titles with a neat twist. You still stomp goombas, collect coins, and transform by using mushrooms and other power-ups. However, each level contains “Wonder Seeds,” which turn the stage into a challenging, psychedelic stage when collected. The collectible makes stages even more eye-catching and challenging to clear. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjkw"><p><span>$<!-- -->46</span></p><div><p><em>Super Smash Bros.

It contains every character and level from previous <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>games, and the ability to expand the roster through paid downloadable content. The gameplay is largely the same (choose a fighter and play against people in the same room or online), but its single player “Spirit Mode” lets you progress through a story through matches with set objectives. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128015/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjk3"><p><span>$<!-- -->46</span></p><div><p><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>is the ultimate cozy game. The life sim allows you to build an entirely new town from scratch on a deserted island. The game starts slowly, but you’ll continually improve your living space, craft tools, gather resources, and make the town attractive enough for other characters to move in. <em>New Horizons </em>runs on a real-world clock, a mechanic that incentivizes you to play in short bursts every day. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMzAx"><p><span>$<!-- -->45</span></p><div><p><em>Splatoon 3</em> is proof that Nintendo isn’t done showing off its take on an online shooter—with paint instead of bullets, of course.

Online multiplayer remains Splatoon’s 3’s big draw, so be prepared to square off against fellow squid kids. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23339801/splatoon-3-review-nintendo-switch">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMzA0"><p><span>$<!-- -->47</span></p><div><p><em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> is one of the latest entries in the series, and it’s the most open world mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game to date.

            <p>My dearest Hedwig, I write to you from the churning battlefields of King Friedrich II's campaign to reinforce Silesia against the lurking Gallic aggressor. I regret to inform you that the French Hussars are kicking our Hussarses. We just engaged what our scouts from the 17th Pop-Up Tutorial Squadron promised was a "light" patrol of ill-trained musketmen and cavalry, just outside Hildesheim. French equestrians appear to be made of different stuff than our Prussian chargers. They cleave through our Landmiltz like wheat. Meanwhile, our horseguys can't take a single bayonet to the gaskin without turning for home. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>All is bloodmist and flashing unit banners. There is no time, dear Hedwig, for the baguette-wielding infidels swiftly descend upon my sole surviving regiment of Cantonist Recruits. Our ill-named leader Count von Smash has long since cast down his sabre and left to pursue a second career as a humble peasant with a suspiciously fine moustache. Avenge me, my love! Complete the Silesian campaign in Master Of Command and retrieve my bloody bones!

<p>If you're hungry for another historical Total War, and besotted specifically with the gunpowder combat of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/napoleon-total-war">Napoleon: Total War</a> and Empire: Total War, you might enjoy Master Of Command, Armchair History Interactive's real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> set during the Seven Years War of 1756 to 1763. 
</p><p>That's my conclusion after 40 minutes with it, anyway. The game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878450/Master_of_Command/">only just launched on Steam</a>, and there is a heck of a lot of period detail to chew through, but you can boil it down as follows: you lead an army around a procedurally generated map of real-ish places cloaked in fog of war, duffing up rival armies and claiming or trading with settlements while managing your supplies. 
</p>
<p>Your army consists of upgradeable regiments drawn from a whiskery bestiary of 150 celebrated 18th century European military units. There are officers with buffs and customisable hats, and many kinds of equipment to consider, such as tricking your muzzleloaders out with the latest cylindrical ramrods to shorten the gap between volleys. On the battlefield, meanwhile, you line up your grenadiers, fusiliers, cossacks and whatnot to outmarch, outgun, outflank and otherwise outfox the enemy, while taking advantage of terrain features like hedgerows, and monitoring each regiment's ammo and morale.

<p>I am skimming through the nerdy warfaring minutiae here not out of disrespect for historians (armchair-based or otherwise), but simply because AAAAARGH, I think this game is trying to kill me with proper nouns. I am swimming in a sea of heraldry and plumed headgear. Fortunately, the in-game presentation is quite intuitive, so far, without simply being functional. The maps, menus, UI elements and character portraits are wrought in bright, bold colours. The 3D unit models are simple and toylike, next to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 3's blinged and prancing miniatures, but you'll wince nonetheless when one of your flanking cavalry formations eats a full musket volley. As battles go on, the view fills with gunpowder smoke. The strikingly painted countryside grows bleary and concussed. Oh the humanity!</p><p>Dear Hedwig, I live! Following my last, desperate letter, I managed to escape the carnage by playing dead. After night fell I stole back to camp, where Count von Smash loitered in his tent, having finally regained his nerve after two solid miles of running and screaming. He assures me that we'll give the tricolore trouble-makers what for during our next encounter. I can only hope he reads Armchair Interactive's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3594434716">"basic" guide to units</a> before continuing the offensive. </p>

The supposedly harmonious city’s urban redevelopment plan includes </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1izjtjg/future_kalos_has_antihomeless_benches/"><span>anti-homeless benches</span></a><span>? If we’re supposed to be living alongside Pokémon in the Paris-inspired city, why do they live in walled-off Wild Zones? Yeah, they thankfully have free healthcare, but why is Nurse Joy having to take on two jobs as both healer and shopkeeper in this city? Those are questions that hang over a game that is very much trying to figure its world out, but one of the moments of clarity it does have captures how, in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe, cops would absolutely try to enlist these monsters in state-sanctioned violence. No moment captures that better than the “Investigating with Shuppet” quest.</span></p>  <p><span>Rancun, a Lumiose City cop, asks if you can bring him a Shuppet to help with his investigations. In his mind, the ghost-type Pokémon’s ability to sense negative emotions such as jealousy and vindictiveness is something that could help him identify criminals before they have a chance to commit a crime. If you’ve never encountered stories like the cyberpunk anime </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/psycho-pass-is-a-compelling-cyberpunk-mystery-and-its-5973624"><i><span>Psycho-Pass</span></i></a><span>, there are entire subgenres of dystopian fiction about how police over-surveilling citizens based almost entirely on vibes can lead to an oppressive police state. And this officer is imagining a world in which he can co-opt an innocent Pokémon into his surveillance scheme and doesn’t see anything wrong with that. But the quest is in our log, so what happens when you bring a Shuppet to Rancun? The funniest outcome, actually.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000640502" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640502"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640502">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>After you catch a Shuppet and bring the living puppet to Rancun, he tells the ghost that the peace of the city “depends on” it, and asks it to home in on some of these negative emotions it can sense. Funnily enough, Shuppet doesn’t go looking for someone stealing food to help feed their family, but instead takes the cop right back to his own front door. His wife greets us there and asks her husband if he’s still working. When Rancun says that yes, he’s still on a case, she says, seeming slightly annoyed, “Well, I guess you’re still busy with work…Good luck with the investigation.” Before she can head back inside, Shuppet cries out at her, insisting it’s found some negative emotions here. That’s when the truth comes out: It turns out his wife has been feeling neglected by Rancun’s workaholic nature, and has grown resentful. The grudge had grown so strong, in fact, that Shuppet felt it across the city. Rancun decides he should probably devote more energy to his marriage, hopefully indicating that he’s no longer invested in trying to create a Pokémon-powered police state.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has a surprising track record when it comes to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-detective-pikachu-returns-switch-acab-is-a-cop-1850906651"><span>cop commentary</span></a><span>, including the time </span><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720"><span>got arrested on false charges</span></a><span> and did a jail break.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Netflix is looking into buying Warner Bros. Discovery, which could include the full library of Warner Bros. Games and intellectual properties (IPs).</p>



<p>The news <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-discovery-sale-potential-game-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes just over a week</a> after Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was opening up sales bids after it had received “unsolicited interest from multiple parties for the entire company.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/netflix-exploring-warner-bros-bid-1236603687/">Deadline</a>, Netflix has hired investment bank Moelis &amp; Co to explore a bid for the company. It’s the same firm that helped with Skydance’s merger with Paramount. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-could-happen-to-warner-bros-games-under-netflix">What Could Happen To Warner Bros. Games Under Netflix?</h2>



<p>What’s unclear, though possible to happen, is if a Netflix acquisition would see all of Warner Bros. Games be assumed into Netflix Games. Currently, Warner Bros. Games holds major gaming franchises such as Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC Comics, Game of Thrones, and more. </p>



<p>Warner Bros. Games also owns multiple studios, including Avalanche Software, NetherRealm Studios, Rocksteady Studios, TT Games, and WB Games studios in Montreal, Boston, New York, and San Francisco. All of which would likely be included in any sale. </p>



<p>Netflix declined to comment to Deadline on the report. Insider Gaming has also reached out to Warner Bros. Discovery for comment on whether any sale would include the games division. Thus far, no response has been received.  </p>



<p>Netflix has attempted to make a dent in the games industry in recent years, but it has never fully gotten off the ground. That said, the company is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-is-doubling-down-on-its-gaming-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continuing to invest in gam</a>ing on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-netflix-major-ip-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various fronts</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think the future would hold if Netflix were to acquire Warner Bros. Games? Leave your thoughts down in the comments, and join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

Themed around the Movember mustache movement--an annual event encouraging the growth of moustaches in an effort to raise awareness around men's health issues--this bundle offers a curated selection of PC games for $20. Proceeds will go to charity, and each game in this bundle will be delivered as a Steam key that can be redeemed on your account.</p><p>As for the games, the selection includes titles like Schedule I, Mon Bazou, Gloomwood, and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous - Enhanced Edition. Schedule I has been a sleeper hit this year--and one of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/" data-ref-id="2900-5361">favorite co-op games</a>--even if it does revolve around acts that would be illegal in real life. As a small-time drug dealer, it's up to you to build a drug empire and deal with threats to your organization like rival cartels and law enforcement. The game usually costs $20 on its own, so this bundle deal works out to be pretty good value for money, in case you've been thinking of purchasing Schedule I.</p><p>Anyone looking to revisit the era of old-school shooters will want to check out Dusk, which plays like Quake 2 with a metal soundtrack and horror vibes. The game features three campaigns to blast your way through, and has become a cult-classic over the years with its polished action. Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous can consume dozens of your waking hours with its fantasy gameplay, Valthirian Arc: Hero School Story is a charming RPG, and The Corridor is a game about walking down a corridor--no, really.</p><h2>Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle (2025)</h2><ul><li>Schedule I</li><li>Mon Bazou</li><li>Gloomwood (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Enhanced Edition (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Instruments of Destruction (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Men of War 2</li><li>Hello Neighbor 2 (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Chivalry 2 (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>American Truck Simulator (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Dusk (Steam Deck verified)</li><li>Agent Intercept</li><li>Prodigal</li><li>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Valthirian Arc: Hero School Story (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>The Corridor (Steam Deck Playable)</li></ul><p>For another bundle deal, you can also check out Fanatical's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+Schedule+I+And+14+Games+For+%2420+In+This+Movember+Charity+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+09%3A21%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+09%3A22%3A00&amp;fnarticle_id=6535850&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-shooter-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-schedule-i-and-14-games-for-20-in-this-movember-charity-bundle%2F1100-6535850%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Shooter Bundle</a> deal.

			<p>Grand Theft Auto 4 with RTX Remix Path Tracing looks like the remaster we'll likely never get, introducing significant visual improvements that enhance the game's visuals considerably.</p>



<p>How much <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-look-path-traced-gta-4-rtx-remix-test-build/">the mod developed by Xoxor4D</a> enhances the visuals of the fourth entry in the series by Rockstar Games is shown in a new comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC.</a> The video showcases the vanilla version of the game running side by side with the path-traced version at 4K and 1440p resolutions, utilizing NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation.</p>



<p>As expected, the mod is highly demanding, and even high-end modern hardware has trouble running it at 60 FPS without Frame Generation, but the results seem well worth the performance hit,  although some of the visual elements of the game, besides lighting and shadows, need an evident update, such as character models and low-quality textures.</p>

<p>The Grand Theft Auto 4 RTX Remix mod is not yet available publicly. However, those interested in trying it out before its launch can do so by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xoxor4d">supporting Xoxor4D on Patreon.</a></p>



<p>Replaying through Grand Theft Auto 4 with RTX Remix path tracing and other mods is definitely a good way to make the wait for Grand Theft Auto 6 more bearable. The sixth entry in the series was initially scheduled to launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S this year, but <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Rockstar Games ultimately delayed the game to May 2026. </a></p>



<p>While no precise reason was provided for the game's delay, Rockstar Games stated in the message shared to announce the delay that the additional development time was required to meet and exceed players' expectations for a game whose launch is predicted to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">the biggest entertainment launch to date.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! Happy Halloween! Yes, kids all around the nation get to enjoy one of life’s best treats: A Friday Halloween. Stay up late, kids, and eat so much candy. But before you wreck your teeth and stomachs, let’s get through today’s Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Today, we have evidence of a <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake Xbox port, more layoff news, the reveal of pets in <em>Fortnite</em>, and some new ports of&nbsp;<em>Turok 2&nbsp;</em>arriving courtesy of Nightdive Studios.</p> <h2><strong><em>Fortnite</em> adds animal sidekicks</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000640494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640494"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640494">©Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/introducing-fortnite-sidekicks?lang=en-US">Epic announced</a> that the long-rumored pets feature is finally arriving in <em>Fortnite</em> on November 1 alongside<em> The Simpsons</em> mini-season. These tiny buddies are officially known as “Sidekicks” and will follow you around in battle royale and other <em>Fortnite</em> modes. However, enemy players won’t see them in competitive modes, so your cute puppy doesn’t give away your position and get you killed. Sidekicks will also be immune to damage and will feature their own customization options that can be unlocked by completing quests. I can already hear Epic’s bank account filling with even more money.</p>

 <h2><strong>The <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is likely coming to Xbox in the near future</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1okrnqd/silent_hill_2_has_been_rated_for_xbox_series_xs/">Folks have spotted</a> an ESRB rating for a yet-to-be-announced Xbox port of last year’s excellent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake. This doesn’t officially confirm such a port will happen, but it seems very, very likely that Konami is gearing up to bring the remake to Xbox Series X/S in not too distant future. At the moment, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is only available on PS5 and PC.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>MGS3</em> remake’s multiplayer mode is now available</strong></h2>  <p>When Konami’s fancy remake of M<em>etal Gear Solid 3</em> launched back in August, the game’s promised multiplayer mode was missing as it needed more time in the oven. Now, <em>Fox Hunt</em> is finally out as part of a free update. At launch, <em>Fox Hunt</em> features two stealth-focused multiplayer modes and supports 12 players. While it ain’t a new version of <em>Metal Gear Online</em>, I’m certainly curious to check it out. I mean, once I find time to play it and the 20 other games I still need to play this year.</p> <h2><strong>More layoffs hit Heart Machine</strong></h2> <p>The studio behind <em>Hyper Light Drifter </em>and <em>Solar Ash</em> is reportedly laying off employees for the second time this month. <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-possessor-s-dev-heart-machine-lays-off-more-staff-two-weeks-before-the-game-s-launch">As reported by <em>GameDeveloper.com</em>,</a> at least four different staff members have recently posted on social media that they were laid off. One now out-of-work dev shared a video suggesting that by the time the studio’s next game, <span data-testid="content-text"><span><em>Possessor(s)</em>, launches on November 11, most, if not all, of the people who worked on it might be gone from the indie studio. This is the second round of layoffs to hit the company this month and the third round in early 2025.&nbsp;</span></span></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-battlefield-6-skins-silly-cosmetics-crossover-black-ops-7-steam-2000640251"><em>Arc Raiders</em> will avoid silly, immersion-breaking skins</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-price-inflation-trump-tariff-snap-2000640156">Candy prices are going up thanks to President Trump</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-simulator-2-room-interview-pine-studio-2000639908">A wonderful interview with the devs behind <em>Escape Sim 2</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Six One Publishing, a new publishing wing from the team behind the Six One Indie Showcase, has announced the first game under its label. Introducing Blue Ridge Hunting, a co-op horror game set in the Appalachian Mountains from Jade Meadows.</p>



<p>Players will either go on the hunt solo or with up to two friends to follow the journey of Levi Chambers, <strong>“a disgruntled West Virginia native haunted by sightings of the infamous Mothman his entire life.”</strong> </p>



<p>The game, according to the press release, will explore themes of trauma, grief, and family through the lens of Appalachian folklore.</p>



<p><strong>“The Appalachian Mountains are steeped in some of America’s most chilling folklore, home to legendary cryptids and unexplained phenomena,”</strong> the game’s description reads. <strong>“Step into the boots of the Appalachian Investigation Group, a team dedicated to tracking these elusive creatures. Using a range of tools and equipment, gather evidence, follow the clues, and embark on high-stakes hunts based on real sightings and local legends.”</strong></p>



<p>Features of the game include (courtesy of Six One Publishing):</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Found Footage:&nbsp;</strong>A gritty retro/PSX art style inspired by early 3D horror and analog media.</li>



<li><strong>Always Listening:&nbsp;</strong>Creatures react to proximity voice chat and radio chatter. Communication is crucial, but dangerous.</li>



<li><strong>Into the Woods, Solo or Together:</strong>&nbsp;Explore the Appalachian wilds alone or with up to 5 players in online co-op freeplay mode.</li>



<li><strong>Bump In The Night:&nbsp;</strong>A narrative-driven story (1–3 players) following the Appalachian Investigation Group’s hunt for the truth.</li>



<li><strong>Experience The Legends:&nbsp;</strong>Face unique, intelligent creatures based on real Appalachian legends and folklore.</li>



<li><strong>Dark-Bluegrass Symphony:</strong>&nbsp;An original score that blends haunting melodies with Appalachian roots, amplifying the tension and tone.</li>
</ul>



<p>The game will launch first in early access and include a full story when 1.0 releases. There’s no release date just yet for Blue Ridge Hunting, but a demo is available now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2434930/Blue_Ridge_Hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Steam</a>, along with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jadecompany/blue-ridge-hunting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Kickstarter</a> to help with the game’s development. </p>

                <p>ModRetro has announced two new games for its Chromatic Classics Collection. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-for-game-boy-gets-new-physical-edition-for-franchises-30th-anniversary/1100-6534930/">After releasing a brand-new version of Rayman for Game Boy Color</a> earlier this year, the company is celebrating Croc and GameStop's mascot, Buck the Bunny with new cartridge releases.</p><p>Croc: 25th Anniversary Edition celebrates the cute little reptile's Game Boy Color adventure from 2000, and preorders will open on October 31--or Croctober 31 if you're a fan of the franchise--with a planned shipping date of December 2025. Priced at $45, the classic side-scrolling platformer features over 30 levels spread across four worlds. The original game revolved around Croc taking on Baron Dante and his minions, and this version features upgraded controls and enhanced save functions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594385-croc-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594385" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594385-croc-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594385"></a><figcaption>Croc: 25th Anniversary Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594385-croc-1.jpg"></figure><p>Buck and the Cursed Cartridge is billed as a fast-paced run-and-gun platformer from ModRetro.

The game will feature multi-phase boss fights, upgradeable abilities, and even cheat codes. Priced at $45, it'll be available starting October 31. Both of these games will be available through the ModRetro store and GameStop.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594386-buck-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594386" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594386-buck-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594386"></a><figcaption>Buck and the Cursed Cartridge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594386-buck-1.jpg"></figure><p>One thing to note about these games is that even though they have ModRetro and Chromatic branding on them, they'll still work just fine on the original Nintendo hardware and other FPGA handhelds like the Analogue Pocket. In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-review-a-remarkable-recreation-of-the-game-boy-color/1100-6528473/">the ModRetro Chromatic launched not too long ago and we were very impressed</a> with just how faithfully it created and upgraded the Game Boy Color experience. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-is-back-in-stock-and-available-in-new-colors/1100-6533058/">New stock of the modernized Game Boy also arrived earlier this year</a>, and you can choose between two models: a $200 version with scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass or a $300 version that's equipped with Sapphire Glass and extremely durable materials.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretros-n64-tribute-console-has-a-price-launches-later-this-year/1100-6533380/">ModRetro also announced a modern-day tribute to the Nintendo 64 console</a> a few months back. It doesn't have a release date yet, but it does have an early-bird preorder price of $199.</p>

                <p>It seems that Square Enix is getting into the Halloween spirit and upping its fashion game. That would explain why the company behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/" data-ref-id="5000-148228">Final Fantasy 14</a> announced on October 31 that its long-running MMO would do away with class requirements for glamours, the game's equivalent of transmogrification.</p><p>In layman's terms, players can now use the appearance of any armor set regardless of their current class and job. That means that healers like white mages can now ditch their fancy robes and look like hulking dark knights--one of Final Fantasy 14's tank classes--and vice versa. Pandæmonium, indeed.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1984241152321814609" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Fashion enjoyers, this one is for you!<br>From Patch 7.4 onward, you'll be able to equip any glamours regardless of your class/job! ✨<br>Mix and match your favorite outfits and slay on the battlefield! 💅 <a href="https://t.co/4WogdAbGM6" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/4WogdAbGM6</a></p>  — FINAL FANTASY XIV (@FF_XIV_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1984241152321814609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In the past, Final Fantasy 14 has been fairly strict about jobs using armor that falls within their respective schools of equipment. For example, all tanking and healing jobs share gear, but things get much dicier in this regard when looking at DPS roles, especially ones that differ between ranged attack and melee. As such--as well as to differentiate players and give these jobs unique visual identities--many of these roles have exclusive weapon and armor sets.</p><p>Players are then free to turn armor and weapons that their job can use into glamours, allowing them to swap between appearances and aesthetics that they prefer while using gear that is functionally better. Now though, Square Enix is throwing open the doors to Final Fantasy 14's intense fashion-savvy crowd by getting rid of any restrictions and multiplying player's dress options tenfold.</p><p>The change, which seems to going over <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/en.finalfantasyxiv.com/post/3m4ij6vvmes2z/quotes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">exceptionally well</a> with players, will be introduced in the forthcoming 7.4 patch, which releases on December 16.

            <p>Nintendo has won a lawsuit against streamer Jesse Keighin, who was sued by the Japanese video game giant for allegedly streaming pirated games before they were released.
</p>
<p>Nintendo also alleged that Keighin had taunted the company, claiming he sent a letter: "boasting that he has 'a thousand burner channels' to stream from and 'can do this all day'". <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-wins-lawsuit-against-defiant-pirate-streamer-everygameguru/">Outlet Torrent Freak</a> reported that Keighin posted on Facebook: "Should have done more research on me. You might run a corporation, I run the streets."
</p>
<p>Following the successful lawsuit, Colorado federal courts have ordered Keighin to pay $17,500 to Nintendo. The judge presiding over the case did reject two of Nintendo's permanent injunctions however, these being related to the destruction of circumvention devices, as well as an injunction to apply to third parties who were involved alongside Keighin.

</figure>
<p>The judge deemed the request to destroy these circumvention devices "unclear" and "unreasonable", due to the fact that Keighin used online emulation services. As for an injunction applicable to third parties, the judge rejected the proposal as Nintendo failed to specify who these third parties were.
</p>
<p>The $17,500 figure comes from a $10,000 fine for Keighin's latest infringement, the streaming of Mario &amp; Luigi: Brotherhood, while the remaining $7,500 comes from fifteen separate $500 fines for multiple previous violations of Nintendo's anti-piracy measures.
</p>
<p>This is the latest development in an ongoing war raged by Nintendo against pirates. It was only earlier this month when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-seeks-45m-against-reddit-moderator-accused-of-pirating-switch-games-in-latest-crackdown-against-piracy">Nintendo announced its intent to sue a Reddit moderator accused of pirating its games for $4.5m</a>. Nintendo previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy">updated its Nintendo Account Agreement, reserving the right to brick consoles in an attempt to curb piracy</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Panic Stations is a new game developer formed by former Mediatonic developers who worked on the popular competitive multiplayer title, Fall Guys. The studio announced itself with a <a href="https://x.com/PanicStationsHQ/status/1983881949266530781">post on its official X (formerly Twitter) account</a> in a video filled with cartoon pigeons. Joe Walsh, a game designer at Panic Stations, provides the voice over for the first pigeon you see, beginning the video by saying, "<em>Games should be funnier and they should be stupider. Here at Panic Stations, we're going to fix that</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The team is currently working on its debut game, which it says is "<em>not about pigeons</em>" <a href="https://www.panicstations.com/">according to its website</a>. In an interview with GamesIndustry.Biz, co-founder Paul Croft said, "<em>I'm a huge fan of the online co-op space and it's been amazing to see it evolve over the last few years. It is really exciting to team-up with some old friends - we're aiming to build games that bring immediate joy to players and bring people closer together</em>."</p>



<p>Croft is not wrong to point out that cooperative games are having a bit of a moment, especially when you consider how successful games like Peak, R.E.P.O., and Lethal Company have been recently. A cooperative game with a solid gameplay loop that also encourages comedic gameplay scenarios is a real recipe for success.</p>



<p>Whatever Panic Stations makes for their debut game, it'll certainly be interesting to see, especially when considering the pedigree they have coming from Fall Guys, a game that absolutely no one saw coming <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fall-guys-falling-in-and-out-of-love/">when it first arrived in 2020</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>South Korean game studio Shift Up recently posted a developer interview video to celebrate the third anniversary of its RPG <em>Goddess of Victory: NIK</em>KE. And as reported by <em><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/shift-up-says-it-doesnt-tolerate-any-expressions-of-hate-in-nikke-following-backlash-over-alleged-small-genital-gesture/">Automation Media</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/articles/405545">ThisIsGame,</a> </em>during this video, the studio’s director Hyungsuk Yoo took a hard stance against “<a href="https://youtu.be/dYEX1ND8HrI?t=1864">hateful expressions</a>” in the popular RPG, saying: “We will never tolerate anyone intentionally inserting hate speech into <em>NIKKE</em> or approaching the game with that mindset.”</p> <p>However, the devs don’t directly mention what this is in reference to in the video; it’s very likely an attempt to address a controversial situation involving a piece of art created for <em>NIKKE</em> and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_pinching_conspiracy_theory">odd conspiracy online involving a pinched hand gesture</a> that many men in South Korea believe mocks men with small penises.</p>

 <p>In August, to celebrate the game’s 1,000th day in operation, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251030-53477-001.jpg">a piece of artwork was released.</a> Some South Korean men online alleged that two characters in the artwork were covertly flashing the pinched fingers gesture. <a href="https://game.naver.com/lounge/nikke/board/detail/6464533">Shift Up quickly apologized</a>, edited the image <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251030-53477-002.jpg">to remove the gestures</a>, and blamed the whole incident on an overseas team responsible for the art. But that hasn’t stopped many online players from continuing to harass the devs and leave angry comments. So the recent commitment against “hateful expressions” is seen by many as the studio’s latest attempt to calm things down.</p> <p>It’s unlikely this will work, though, as the “Crab Hand” gesture has become a widely embraced conspiracy theory among many men in South Korea who believe it to be connected to a feminist movement in the country that some believe went too far. As a result of this situation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_pinching_conspiracy_theory#List_of_notable_responses">many, many companies have faced backlash</a> for artwork or ads that seem to include “crab hands,” even when it seems obvious that the art wasn’t intended to mock anyone or the hands are only vaguely pinched.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-race-polymarket-clair-obscur-2000640468</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/betting-markets-have-decided-silksong-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-a-chance-in-hell-of-winning-game-of-the-year.1340446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Polymarket has opened up betting on The Game Awards 2025 and no one seems to have a doubt that <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> will take top honors at Geoff Keighley’s showcase. The odds are so stacked in the French RPG’s favor that a $100 bet on <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> would net you over $1,000 if it actually ended up winning game of the year instead.</p> <p>Gambling on the 2025 GOTY race opened up on <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/game-awards-game-of-the-year-2025">Polymarket</a> on October 29, well in advance of anyone actually voting on what game will actually win has even begun. The Best Game category is decided by media ballots (90 percent) and fan voting (10 percent) with the winner revealed during the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-keighley-e3-trailers-1851083267">live show on December 11</a>.</p>

 <p>Nominees are chosen in November followed by a final round of voting. While it’s Keighley’s show, he doesn’t participate in any part of the selection process. Also, full disclosure, <em>Kotaku</em> has never participated in voting and nothing in this article should be mistaken for financial advice (that’s a thing you’re supposed to write, right?)</p>

 <p>With all of those wrinkles in mind, the first 48 hours of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-goty-game-of-the-year-past-winners-list-1851721067">GOTY race</a> on Polymarket were interesting to witness. While<em> Clair Obscur</em> is currently leading with bets suggesting an 80 percent chance of winning, it didn’t start out that way. It was actually<em> Silksong</em> who was the frontrunner in the initial hour after the market opened. Whoever was betting first must have been all in on the Metroidvania hype.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000640482" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640482"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640482">Polymarket / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But it didn’t take long for the pack of frontrunners, which also included <em>Death Stranding 2</em> and <em>Hades 2</em>, to fall way behind Sandfall Interactive’s surprise turn-based hit. All of those other games are not currently trending in the single-digits. <em>Silksong</em> is second with 8 percent, <em>Hades 2</em> is third with 5 percent, and <em>Death Stranding</em> only has 3 percent. Over $75,000 has been wagered so far.</p>

 <p>From there<em> Split Fiction</em>, <em>The Oute Worlds 2</em>, <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em>, and <em>Blue Prince</em> all have at least a percentage point. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> and every other game that came out this year, on the other hand, are all at decimal points. Shockingly, there is over $900 of betting volume on <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, a game which is not coming out this year. I guess someone didn’t get the memo.</p>

 <h2>The <em>Clair Obscur </em>GOTY train keeps chugging along</h2> <p>What can we make of all this? Remember, prediction markets aren’t an indication of what will happen, they’re a measure of what people&nbsp;<em>think</em> might happen. The complete domination of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> could mean that lots of people played it and think it’s great, or it could just mean people who like placing wagers on Polymarket are seeing how jazzed everyone else is about the game and trying to refine that online noise into quantifiable signals.</p>

 <p><em>Polygon</em>‘s Oli Welsh, who maintains a rolling list of GOTY frontrunners based on a mix of experience, vibes, and data, has had <em>Clair Obscur</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/awards/546327/game-of-the-year-game-awards-2025-frontrunners/">in the lead for a while</a>. Maybe Polymarket users are taking their cues from him! One of the only variations from the current betting landscape is that he has<em> Yotei </em>in closer contention, even if it’s still an outside shot. If you look at Metacritic, however, <em>Hades 2</em> technically has a higher composite review score from all of the aggregated critics. Those are the people who do most of the voting, after all.</p> <p>The actual mechanics of how various outlets vote, from magazines like <em>Game Informer</em> to YouTube groups like <em>Easy Allies</em>, probably play an even bigger role in deciding the outcome than ambient industry vibes. Some ballots are decided on purely by the head of those outlets. Others do informal internal voting. Some might make choices based on what they&nbsp;<em>think</em> is supposed to be the right answer, just like the Polymarket folks are doing. Others might decide based purely on what the most people at that outlet played and liked. Often passion carries the day. Five people really liking game X might not carry the day against three who think Y is the most important game of the decade.</p> <p>Will that messy, inconsistent process yield <em>Clair Obscur</em> as the winner this year?

              <p>Laptops that are specifically designed with gamers and creatives in mind usually don’t come cheap. While the exact price depends on the configuration, most of the powerful options out there with solid graphics easily cross the $1,000 mark. Thankfully, that changes today.</p>
<p>Amazon has slashed the price of the latest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5200/">16-inch HP Elitebook (AMD Ryzen 5, 32GB DDR5 RAM and 1TB PCIe SSD) down to $859, after an unbelievable $1,540 discount on the retail price of $2,399</a>. This is the lowest we have seen this machine drop to in a long while, and we don’t expect the offer to be around for long. It’s best to grab yours before it’s too late. There’s no telling if this discount will return for Black Friday or if the stock will even last that long.</p>

<h2>Reliable Performance for Both Work and Play</h2>
<p>Like most HP laptops, this machine comes in a sleek, lightweight build with a premium finish. The screen is a 16-inch diagonal Anti-Glare WUXGA display that delivers sharp, bright visuals. 400 nits of brightness keep everything clear in all lighting conditions, while blue light support makes all-nighters easier on your eyes. It’s also paired with Radeon 740M graphics, which can handle streaming and gaming without stutters.</p>
<p>There’s a spill-resistant, backlit keyboard that’s quite comfortable to use for longer sessions. Calls are made easy with a 5MP camera paired with Poly Studio-tuned speakers and AI noise reduction – you’ll look your best, and sound just as good.</p>



<p>For power, you’re getting a 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 processor that can clock up to 4.9GHz; perfect for heavier workloads. Even better, it’s backed by 32GB of DDR5 RAM for some impressive multitasking, plus a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD that offers much faster boot times than traditional drives. 1TB is also enough space to store all your essentials, from media content to work documents and games.</p>
<p>Connectivity-wise, it comes with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless connections, plus a full selection of ports including HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, two USB-A ports, and two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports.</p>
<p>The machine runs on Windows 11 Pro, meaning you’ll enjoy a bunch of productivity features right from the get-go. Microsoft Copilot takes the experience even further by assisting you with your day-to-day tasks. It can quickly pull answers to questions, summarize content, and help you stay organized. If you’ve been looking for a powerful upgrade without blowing your budget, this deal is worth grabbing.</p>

<p>Big releases continue to come thick and fast heading into the final months of the year, and the release date for Where Winds Meet stands out as one of the most anticipated in November.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet is set to make waves across the rest of the world, having made its mark in China upon release last year, with millions of players signing up for pre-registration rewards ahead of the drop of the free-to-play title.</p>



<p>If you’re eagerly awaiting the journey across ancient China and are ready to learn the ways of Wuxia combat, we’ve got all the important details on the release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-where-winds-meet-coming-out">When is Where Winds Meet Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>On the horizon. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Where Winds Meet is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC on Friday, November 14, and is available as a free-to-play title.</strong></p>



<p>Initially released in China in December 2024, Where Winds Meet’s global launch is on the horizon and has attracted a wealth of interest, receiving over seven million pre-registrations.</p>



<p>Almost a year since the release in China, Where Winds Meet is well-prepped for the global launch, and there isn’t too much longer to wait before you can begin your adventure.</p>



<p>As ever, though, there will be a bit more waiting depending on where you are located in the world, as the start times vary for time zones.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-where-winds-meet-start-time">Do We Know The Where Winds Meet Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Where Winds Meet has a global release of 3 PM PT on November 14, with access to the game opening for everyone across the world at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike a staggered release, which allows some players in Australia and New Zealand, for example, to be the first to jump in, there are no advantages for such locations this time. In fact, players in those time zones eagerly awaiting the release of Where Winds Meet will actually have to wait a little longer.</p>



<p>The doors open for Where Winds Meet at 3 PM PT, likely to be the same across all platforms, which means a wait until later in the evening, or even the next day, for some time zones.</p>



<p>The table below highlights the release time for Where Winds Meet in major time zones across the world, as shown by the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/where-winds-meet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Where Winds Meet Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">6 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">10 PM – Nov. 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – Nov. 15</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p dir="ltr">However, there are a couple of caveats to consider. For starters, Arc Raiders broke the Steam record when including PvP extraction shooters, but it's arguably not a requirement to fit in the genre. Without PvP, Helldivers 2 holds the top spot for the genre, according to<a href="https://steamdb.info/tag/1199779/" rel="nofollow "> SteamDB</a>, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stop-shtting-your-pants-helldivers-2-boss-jokes-as-game-passes-500000-concurrents/1100-6534312/">saw a huge resurgence in player counts</a> when the game came to Xbox Series X|S in August. Meanwhile, Escape From Duckov has peaked on Steam with a little over 300,000 concurrent players and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-duckov-briefly-outgunned-battlefield-6-on-steam-this-week/1100-6535685/">outgunned Battlefield 6 briefly</a> last week.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of which, Escape From Tarkov looms large in this discussion. The game that arguably put extraction shooters on the map <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-will-finally-escape-early-access-this-fall/1100-6534196/">will finally come to Steam on November 15</a> as part of the version 1.0 release. People who already own Escape From Tarkov <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-on-steam-will-require-you-buy-it-again/1100-6534783/">will have to pay again to play on Steam</a>, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Arc Raiders is also available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S--in addition to PC. So keep in mind the concurrent-player numbers are obviously larger than just what's seen on Steam. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-cross-play-and-cross-saves-explained/1100-6535834/">does have cross-play and cross-save</a>, too.

                <p>Before Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2</a> remake was released last October, there was a report that the game would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-will-be-a-playstation-console-exclusive-for-at-least-a-year/1100-6526604/" data-ref-id="1100-6526604">a timed exclusive for PlayStation 5</a> for at least a year. Now, the year is up and an updated listing by the Entertainment Software Rating Board appears to indicate that a leap to Xbox Series X|S is immanent.</p><p>The ESRB has slightly modified <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40337/silent-hill-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its Silent Hill 2 page</a> (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>) to state that it's certified for the "Xbox Series" consoles. The rating itself hasn't changed, and it's still M for Mature. However, Microsoft and Konami have yet to formally announce the port or set a date for it. We can't even say for certain if Silent Hill 2 will get a physical release on Xbox, or if it will be digital only.</p><p>For now, there are no signs on the ESRB page that Silent Hill 2 will be coming to Switch 2 any time soon. But it's not out of the realm of possibility for the future.</p><p>Following Bloober Team's success with the Silent Hill 2 remake, Konami announced that the studio is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-remake-seemingly-teased-by-bloober-team/1100-6532382/" data-ref-id="1100-6532382">a remake of the original Silent Hill</a>. That project doesn't currently have a release window.</p><p>The most recent game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a>, was released last month to largely positive reviews. Konami announced that title alongside Silent Hill 2's remake, and Silent Hill: Townfall during the same livestream in 2022. Series producer Motoi Okamoto has said that the team revealed all three projects at once because, "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-producer-explains-why-konami-announced-three-games-at-once/1100-6535588/" data-ref-id="1100-6535588">We wanted people to feel how serious we were about reviving the series</a>."</p><p>Outside of the games, a new live-action film, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-will-hit-theaters-in-early-2026/1100-6532537/" data-ref-id="1100-6532537">Return to Silent Hill</a>, will be released on January 23, 2026. The movie will be an adaptation of Silent Hill 2, and sees the return of the original film's director, Christoph Gans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/battlefield-6-reclaims-no1-as-ea">The Game Business</a>, backed by <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">GSD data</a> shows that for last week's EU video game sales (October 19-26), Battlefield 6 has taken back the top spot after Pokémon Legends Z-A <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/">had it for its launch week.</a> Legends Z-A drops to third, with EA Sports FC 26 keeping its top-three spot on both the units sold and revenue earned sales charts.</p>



<p>After Pokémon Legends Z-A took the top spot for its launch week, with Battlefield 6 in second and EA Sports FC 26 in third, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-eu-launch-sales/">Battlefield 6 is back on top</a> with EA Sports FC 26 in second, and Pokémon in third, with regard to units sold. However, this is the point where it should be noted that Nintendo does not share digital sales data, and that the numbers GSD uses are only based on physical sales.</p>



<p>Every other entry on the top ten list for revenue and units sold that's not a Nintendo game is based on both digital and physical sales, so while it's possible that Pokémon Legends Z-A could remain in third place if we had a complete picture, it's also a safe bet that Legends Z-A has in fact remained at the top spot in the charts when including digital sales.</p>



<p>But we don't have the digital sales data, so as it stands, the top three are the same for the revenue earned charts. Beyond the top three, both charts start to show discrepancies, some more significant than others.</p>



<p>Like how on the units sold charts, Ninja Gaiden 4, one of the many major releases in October, is nowhere to be found. The same goes for The Outer Worlds 2; however, both games earned a spot in the top ten for revenue earned, with Ninja Gaiden 4 making the list in the number six spot and The Outer Worlds 2 squeezing in at the number nine spot.</p>



<p>There are also three games on the units sold charts that don't make the revenue charts, and only one of them is a new release. That marker goes to Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted, which makes the units sold top-ten at number six and then just below Grand Theft Auto V, in the number eight spot is Titanfall 2, which jumps up 3,688% compared to where it was on the charts a week prior.</p>



<p>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition is another that made huge leaps to make it into the top ten at the number ten spot on the units sold charts. Both leaps are impressive on the face of it, though slightly less impressive when checking their price history via SteamDB, which shows that both <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1237970/">Titanfall 2</a> and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1328670/">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</a> are coming off a major sale where they were both 90% off, making the cost for one of the best shooters of all time and one of the best RPG trilogies of all time the price of a coffee to pick up, if you didn't already own them.</p>

              <p>As we enter into the holiday season, there’s one event in particular to look forward to and that’s Black Friday (and to a lesser extent, Cyber Monday). It’s a great time to get some of your gift shopping wrapped up, or for you to get some gifts for yourself while saving some cash. Even though we’ve still got a few more weeks to go, you can find some Black Friday-level deals at Amazon if you look hard enough.</p>

And with a 1ms response time, you can expect your controls to feel responsive and snappy. Don’t discount the importance of a fast input time. It could be the difference between feeling like light on your feet or feeling like you’re moving through mud. I’ve been playing&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>at first on an old 2017 Vizio TV on my Xbox, but recently moved over to a new monitor for my PC and it’s night and day. The platforming sections have become a breeze.</p>
<p>The display has smooth visuals with vivid colors and high-resolution graphics made possible via the HDMI 2.1 input and DisplayPort 1.4 input. Both allow for up to 240Hz as well.</p>

<p>The headphone jack is capable of sending over accurate spatialization and localization for games that support 3D audio. Fully immerse yourself in you game, hearing sound from all directions.</p>
<p>The stand is fully adjustable. The LG UltraGear can be slid up and down and titled forward and back. This allows you to perfectly position it in your sight line and even adjust it as you play as your posture changes. Always have the best view possible.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Love and Deepspace has been out for almost two years now, but its playerbase is growing increasingly exasperated over a persistent issue impacting players with dark-skinned custom main characters: their characters are literally invisible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're unfamiliar with Love and Deepspace, it's an otome game developed by Chinese studio Papergames and published globally by Infinity Nikki developer Infold Games. Love and Deepspace is unique in that it's a 3D otome game with action RPG elements, where players can build relationships with five different potential love interests while also fighting off space monsters. But the romantic elements are the big draw, with visual novel segments and highly detailed, fully animated cutscenes between the player character, or MC, and their love interest, presented as gameplay rewards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Love and Deepspace has now been out since January 2024, almost two years. It's been wildly successful during that time, too, with over 50 million players worldwide as of 2025. It won Best Mobile Game at Gamescom this year, and has been praised for its positive tone toward women and their needs in relationships. Admittedly, Love and Deepspace isn't exactly a pioneer on the diversity front: there's only one body type available for the MC, and all the available love interests are light-skinned. But there are a variety of customization options for the MC's looks, including multiple darker skin tones. It's a feature which hasn't historically been a common one in otome games, and which has helped players with darker skin create MCs that they feel represent them in the romantic scenarios the game presents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But ever since its release, players have been reporting issues with the game's lighting causing MCs with darker skin tones to look weirdly shadowed, or occasionally become totally invisible during certain cutscenes. The complaints go back to the launch of the game and are still being posted as recently as this week, and they all look something like this:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/Love_Deepspace?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Love_Deepspace</a> for giving us darker skin players NO LIGHTING in this new card😒 <a href="https://t.co/innx60E7et" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/innx60E7et</a></p>— MadameSynclair (@MoonkissedMuse) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoonkissedMuse/status/1976999057332879509?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That's, uh, pretty bad! The issue isn't consistent across every cutscene and varies depending on skin tone, but the common factor is that players whose MCs have darker skin tones never know, when a new update is released, if their characters will be visible in the cutscenes or not. Players experiencing this issue say they've reported it to Infold many times, and recently, IGN received a small flood of submissions to its tips email aliases from players upset about the issue. Until now, Infold hasn't said anything about the issue at all. But when IGN reached out for comment, Infold provided the following statement:</p><blockquote>At Infold Games, we’ve always believed that our games are shaped together with the players who love them. The community’s feedback, discussions, and creative passion are what keep Love and Deepspace evolving and alive.</blockquote><blockquote>We’ve seen the conversations and truly value everyone who has taken the time to share their experiences and thoughts. Every comment, whether it’s about visuals, storytelling, or representation, helps us better understand how our work resonates across different perspectives and cultures.</blockquote><blockquote>Love and Deepspace is, at its heart, a shared world of emotion and imagination. We hope to keep building it hand in hand with our players, learning and improving together along the way.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Love and Deepspace players are understandably frustrated by this issue. After all, the game has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-love-and-deepspaces-quest-to-become-the-biggest-name-in-global-romance-games">explicitly been promoted by the company</a> for its extremely in-depth technical achievements in getting every detail of the characters to feel real: hair, skin, clothing, everything. It would be one thing if this was a one-time issue with one card that was quickly fixed. But after two years and absolutely no acknowledgement, players with darker skin are linking the problem to long-time issues in games with racism and colorism. Even if it's not intentionally malicious, they say, it all goes back to developers prioritizing making sure white skin tones look good, and only throwing in darker skin tones as an afterthought, without taking care to make sure they look just as nice. As <a href="https://x.com/StarPop_Arts/status/1924726566807871759" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one player, StarPop, put it eloquently on Twitter back in May</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In history, dating games has been set where it was just a fair/pale Mc and black/brown players don't invest in playing the game because they don't see themselves. For us, we are seeing someone else or pretending to be someone we're not. Because of racism and colorism, pale skin meant beauty as dark tones meant dirty, disgusting, unlovable just because they don't 'fit the beauty standard'. With dating games that doesn't suggest skin tone variation, it's another way of telling us that we aren't worthy of love nor attention. For games that's supposed to represent you falling in love and being treated fairly because the love interests love you for who you are, it excluded many potential players due to it. When Love and Deepspace came out, black/brown players got into it and it felt like heaven that the MCs skin tone can change."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">In history, dating games has been set where it was just a fair/pale Mc and black/brown players don't invest in playing the game because they don't see themselves.

"Just doing lighting on a default mc when you implemented different tones doesn't work because not everyone has the same skin tone."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">StarPop's thread is just one person's experience, but it reflects dozens of other comments from non-white players and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ryjVLOrjrA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content creators</a> that have <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@his_lily00/video/7562744637941714189?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-90xSrjMQOpZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popped up</a> across social media on Twitter, Reddit, Discord, YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms over the last two years. Unfortunately, many of the comments recently have begun despairing of there ever being a fix to this issue. Though the community is still encouraging players to report the issue to Infold during player surveys, it's without any real hope of change:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I almost made a post about this but realized it wasn't worth getting my or anyone else's hopes up," wrote one Reddit user in a reply to another post on the subject from three days ago. "Not saying people should give up campaigning that they fix it (not even make dark skin MCs look perfect, just VISIBLE), but with the complexity of the lightning and the fact that they couldn't even be bothered to change the shading on the injuries in Edge of Continuum (my MC's "scratches" look like she tried to apply the wrong foundation, THERE ARE ONLY LIKE 5 SKIN COLORS BRO, COME ON), I'm resigning myself to having to submit another bug report that my MC looks like a shadow person and just enjoying the card as much as I can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And if by some miracle they actually addressed it and it looks decent, I will give InFold every last prop in my arsenal. All the props, straight to their inbox."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip?

And now, a similar rating has been added to the site specifically for the "Xbox Series" platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unlikely to be a surprise to most — we already knew that the remake of the horror game was a year-long console exclusive for PS5, and that expired last month — but it's good news nonetheless given Konami itself had been a little coy about when we may see the port release on Xbox Series consoles (and silent completely on the highly anticipated Born From a Wish DLC).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-hit-25-million-as-franchise-surpasses-10-million"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake has sold 2.5 million worldwide</u></a>, which pushes sales of the franchise overall to 10 million. IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake review</u></a> returned an 8/10.
