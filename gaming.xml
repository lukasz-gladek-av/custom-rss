            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-showrunner-will-flat-out-not-go-past-the-story-in-the-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Craig Mazin, showrunner and writer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-hbo-series-multiple-season-things-to-be-flipped/">HBO's The Last of Us</a>, has made himself crystal clear regarding whether he and the show's creative team will pull a Game of Thrones and go beyond the story he's adapting.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-season-2-craig-mazin-interview-1236169252/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Mazin said "<em>I am not going to go past the game. I’ll just say that flat out.</em>"</p>
<p><em>"I’m basically setting a decade of my rapidly dwindling life on fire to tell this story</em>," he continued.</p>
<p><em>"The show is so hard to make. It has to have an end. So I’m not going to go past. Who knows me, there might be a Dunk and Egg The Last of Us show that happens that somebody does. But for me, the only question is: Is it going to be one more season or will it require two more? If this can happen all in one more season, great. If we feel like it makes sense to break it into two, then we will do that.</em>"</p>
<p>After the first season of the TV series adaptation of Naughty Dog's beloved franchise covered the entirety of the first game, there have been a lot of questions regarding how quickly The Last of Us Part II's story would be covered.</p>
<p>Mazin and co-showrunner Neil Druckmann have previously commented about how the show will tell Part II's story over the course of multiple seasons, potentially even <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-show-will-have-a-shorter-season-2-but-season-3-will-be-larger-and-there-may-even-be-season-4/">needing a total of four seasons</a> to get the job done.</p>
<p>Whether it'll be four seasons or three will become clear as season two premieres, and we start to have a clearer picture of how the show is being paced out. If we're off to the races with Ellie chasing after Abby by the end of the first episode, then things might be moving fast enough to make it three.</p>
<p>In the same interview, Mazin also addressed criticism around Bella Ramsey potentially not being able to portray the darker side of Ellie that players saw in The Last of Us Part II. While Mazin admitted to understanding the trepidation viewers have, he reiterates that Ramsey's physique is not why she was chosen for the role.</p>
<p>"<em>I understand the difficulty that some people have where they say, “She looked like she was 14 in season one. She still looks roughly the same to us, even though now she’s 19.” Ellie in the game looks much older. Some people do change quite dramatically and some people don’t. I’m not interested in the physical aspect — although I’ve been looking at Bella’s face for years while editing, and I can see that she’s certainly grown. I’m interested in the emotional maturity, and the change in personality.</em>"</p>

I find city builders to be quite a stressful genre, mostly because I get freaked out as soon as my virtual bank account starts dipping into the red. Every now and then, though, one comes along that looks like it might actually be a calming time, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/synergy">Synergy</a> looks like it could fill that gap. It's been out in early access for almost a year now, but developer Leikir Studio announced today that Synergy will be leaving early access and entering 1.0 in just two weeks time on April 16th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The announcement came with a new trailer that keeps things brief but hands over the important thing (the aforementioned release date), as well as an overall look at what the game will offer. Over on Steam, though, a few more details about what the 1.0 update will bring. First up is that there'll be a new campaign with three new scenarios to explore, though what those are, you'll have to wait and find out.

<p>
There's also new plants and buildings to work with, as well as some new challenges linked to dry seasons, alongside an exploration rework. Outside of saying "and more", the Steam post just makes note that there'll be "huge [Quality of Life] improvements you've been waiting for", but again, not specifics, so you'll probably have to check out the 1.0 patch notes whenever they drop.
</p>
<p>
For those unfamiliar with Synergy, you can probably guess just from looking at its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moebius">Moebius</a>-inspired stylings that it's a lot more plant and nature focused as opposed to the concrete jungles or historical encampments you might usually find in the genre. You can explore different regions, build up community, learn about its alien world. Nothing too stressful to be found here, just the way I like my sim games. You can check it out on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989070/Synergy/">here</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-free-to-play-battle-royale-gamemode-has-been-datamined/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-free-to-play-battle-royale-gamemode-has-been-datamined.1153107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-free-to-play-battle-royale-gamemode-has-been-datamined/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New leaks have revealed that Battlefield 6 will indeed have a free-to-play Battle Royale coming to the game.</p>



<p>The information originates from several different dataminers, who have been able to datamine Battlefield 6 having gained access to the files via Battlefield Labs. Last week, over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-concept-art-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20 concept art images of Battlefield 6 leaked</a> because of dataminers.</p>



<p>Allegedly, the datamines reveal that a Battle Royale gamemode will be coming to Battlefield 6, which was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously exclusively reported by Insider Gaming</a>. </p>



<p>According to the datamines, the gamemode (which Insider Gaming understands to be in development by Ripple Effect), will have a lot of traditional features that you’d come to expect from a Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Such features include solo, duo, trio, and squad matches, an armor system, call-ins, loot rarity, update kits and weapons, and a shrinking zone. </p>



<p>Also mentioned was a “free-to-play component”, which is understood to be the core Battle Royale experience. Gauntlet, another mode that Insider Gaming reported on in the past was also mentioned and referred to in some of the game files.</p>



<p>As for if a Battlefield Battle Royale experience for Battlefield 6 can be success or not is unclear, but this time around DICE and EA seem to be doing the right thing by at least making the experience free-to-play. It’s believed such a decision was made by Byron Beede, the new General Manager of the franchise and who had been previously leading live service for Call of Duty.</p>



<p>It seems that this time around Battlefield wants to follow a similar to model of Call of Duty and Warzone, where the free-to-play experience brings in the players, with the hope that some cross progression and customization can eventually convert players into premium purchases of the full game with its campaign and multiplayer. </p>



<p>Are you looking forward to a free-to-play Battlefield Battle Royale? Let me know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-switch-2-was-almost-named-%E2%80%9Csuper-nintendo-switch%E2%80%9D.1153104/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-was-almost-named-super-nintendo-switch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>April 2 will go down in history as a monumental day for the Nintendo Switch 2. We finally got a deep insight into the console specifications and how it will perform, but I did not have the Switch 2 nearly being called the Super Nintendo Switch on my bingo card.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 has a release date</a>, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eye-watering price tag</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price of games</a> is a serious conversation to be had. The name of the Switch 2 has barely mustered a whisper, though. We all assumed it would be called the Nintendo Switch 2, it ended up being called the Nintendo Switch 2, and this very nearly wasn’t the case.</p>



<p>An interesting developer interview shows history could’ve looked very different. </p>



<h2 id="h-we-nearly-had-the-super-nintendo-switch-instead-of-the-switch-2">We Nearly Had The Super Nintendo Switch Instead of The Switch 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It would have been cool. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">special interview</a> with Nintendo developers Kouichi Kawamoto, Takuhiro Dohta, and Tetsuya Sasaki was released on the Nintendo website shortly after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 Direct</a> showcase.</p>



<p>Many questions and musings about the Switch 2’s development were posed. Topics covered include cross-platform capabilities between the Switch 1 and Switch 2, improvements in the Nintendo Switch 2, and the device’s name.</p>



<p>One interview question stood out: “However, we haven’t touched on the name yet…How did you land on the name Nintendo Switch 2?” </p>



<p>The answer was interesting: “There were a lot of ideas for the name, and we really struggled to find the right one. We even considered ideas like “Super Nintendo Switch.” However, Super NES, which came out after the NES, couldn’t play NES games. Since Switch 2 can play Switch games, it didn’t feel right to use the same naming convention as Super NES. Switch 2 is a new system with improved performance, but we’d like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs, but rather to think of it as the latest system developed by Nintendo.” So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2,” said Kawamoto.”</p>



<p>So there you have it! The name “Super Nintendo System” was on the cards, but I question how close we were to the name. Nevertheless, it’s a cool detail and one to remember as trivia for obscure Nintendo quizzes in the future.</p>



<p>Should it have been called the Super Nintendo System? Would it have been a neat throwback to yesteryear? Let us know over at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Unlike a regular physical game cartridge, Game-Key Cards don't include game data but are instead a "key" that can be used to download and later access a particular game. The Game-Key Card is required even after that game has been downloaded and installed and is in many ways treated just like a normal game cartridge, minus the console actually running the game off it.</p><p dir="ltr">One note worth mentioning is that an internet connection is only required when booting up a Game-Key Card for the first time, after which the game can be accessed offline. However, the Game-Key Card will still need to be inserted into the Switch 2 console in order to access the digital game.</p><p dir="ltr">Games that are a Game-Key Card will be designated by a special white banner at the bottom of Switch 2 game cases, with a QR code that can be scanned for additional information. It's unclear if downloading a Game-Key Card game ties it to whatever console it's being used on, or if the Game-Key Card could be shared with a friend (or sold) and transferred to another system like a normal physical game cartridge.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4469598-0864551248-bee-gamekeycard-art-en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469598" data-ratio="0.529" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4469598-0864551248-bee-gamekeycard-art-en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469598"></a><figcaption>An example of a Switch 2 game case with a Game-Key Card label.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4469598-0864551248-bee-gamekeycard-art-en.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">While it's still unclear why some games are Game-Key Cards instead of a normal cartridge, we know of at least one Switch 2 launch title that will be using the feature: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bravely-default-hd-remaster-is-a-switch-2-launch-title-will-feature-new-minigames/1100-6530569/" data-ref-id="1100-6530569">Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Game-Key Cards, unless they can be sold or given to others, aren't entirely different from how Nintendo treats certain original Switch games that can be bought physically in a store but are in reality just digital download codes inside a case. Those games can also be played offline once downloaded but can't be transferred to others, with the game instead tied to that specific account.</p><p dir="ltr">Game-Key Cards are not to be confused with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-cards-will-let-you-share-digital-games/1100-6530424/" data-ref-id="1100-6530424">Virtual Game Cards</a>, a new system Nintendo is using for digital-only games on both the Switch and Switch 2. Virtual Game Cards are also treated as if they are physical games despite being digital, and can be shared with different accounts playing on the same Switch or members of the same Nintendo Switch family account via local wireless. Only one copy of a Virtual Game Card can be used at a time, meaning if a game is lent to a friend or family member, it will be inaccessible to the original owner, just as if they had physically let someone borrow the game. It's unclear if a game accessed via a Game-Key Card can also be used as a Virtual Game Card.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has shared all kinds of new details about the Switch 2, going more in-depth with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-support-hdr-4k-and-120fps/1100-6530547/" data-ref-id="1100-6530547">Switch 2 hardware and capabilities</a> as well as some of the exclusive games coming to the console.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-has-put-in-an-offer-to-acquire-the-entire-tiktok-platform.1153071/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-big-acquire-tiktok-platform/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As the TikTok ban looms in the United States following President Trump’s extension of the shutdown, Amazon has reportedly made an eleventh-hour bid to acquire the entire platform. This news comes from the New York Times, wherein it was also revealed that <strong>nobody appears to be taking the offer seriously</strong>.</p>



<p>In recent months, a few potential buyers have been touted in the press, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-buy-tiktok/">Bobby Kotick</a> and the owners of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kick-intends-to-buy-tiktok-us/">Kick.com</a>.</p>



<p>Could Amazon be about to acquire the biggest video-sharing platform in the world?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-last-minute-purchase">Last-Minute Purchase</h2>



<p>Amazon could be set to acquire TikTok to prevent the platform from being eradicated from the United States – and to pry it from the hands of its Chinese owners. TikTok faces a nationwide ban in America following concerns being raised regarding the inherent security of the app, given the ties it has to Beijing.</p>



<p>The recent article posted in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/business/media/amazon-tiktok-bid.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">New York Times</a> explains that ‘parties who have been involved in the talks do not appear to be taking Amazon’s bid seriously’.</p>



<p>That might be down to how the bid has surfaced:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The bid came via an offer letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, according to a person briefed on the matter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Attempts to reach ByteDance (TikTok’s owner) and Amazon have been fruitless, and nobody has any insight into how much Amazon has put forward for the acquisition or to what extent it <strong>could </strong>go ahead. </p>



<p>Amazon already owns Twitch, the premier streaming site that outclasses competing platforms like YouTube and Kick.com. If it were to acquire TikTok, it would have a dominant hold over content creators and streamers worldwide. </p>



<p>Unfortunately for Amazon, TikTok might not be for sale in the first place. In a statement released on January 18, ByteDance revealed a willingness to let TikTok go dark in the United States if the government enforced the ban.</p>



<p>Do you think Amazon buying TikTok is a shrewd move? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you wanted to indicate the power of the Nintendo Switch 2, look no further than this tidbit – <strong>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is coming to Switch 2 when it launches on June 5.</strong> The impending arrival of CDPR’s open-world epic was revealed today during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, stunning fans worldwide.</p>



<p>Dozens of games were revealed for the Nintendo Switch 2, including both brand-new titles and re-releases of older games, like Star Wars: Outlaws and Hogwarts Legacy.</p>



<p>Am I going to buy a Nintendo Switch 2 just to experience Cyberpunk 2077 from an all-new angle? Yes, I am.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-night-city">Back to Night City</h2>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is a rags-to-riches story like no other. When it debuted in 2020, it was a shambolic title that left people bewildered. It crashed in terms of reviews, fell down the charts, and came under fire from investors and shareholders.</p>



<p>Today, it’s considered one of the best open-world RPG titles ever made.</p>



<p>The turnaround is one for the history books, and although development has officially stopped on the game to facilitate the next title (and The Witcher 4), there’s one last run around the block left in the tank for Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>It was revealed earlier today that Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5 when the console hits the market. The Ultimate Edition is the best way to experience the game, given that it’s bundled with Phantom Liberty, a phenomenal expansion that was the first and last major piece of DLC for the game.</p>



<p>Netizens were quick to make jokes about the processing power of the Nintendo Switch, suggesting that Cyberpunk 2077 will look nothing short of laughable on the handheld console, but the new unit has a little more under the hood than the predecessor. It won’t look as good as it can on other platforms, but that’s the sacrifice you make for the convenience of gaming on the go.</p>



<p>Do you plan on buying Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo Switch 2? Let me know in the comments, or hit up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

And alongside arriving in the Switch 2 launch window, Agent 47 will also be donning some new, appropriately Nintendo-themed duds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On <a href="https://ioi.dk/?panel=hitman%2Fnews%2F2025%2Fsignature-edition-launching-on-nintendo-switch-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IO Interactive's site</a>, the developer confirmed Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition will go up for pre-order soon, for both digital and physical editions. A pre-order of the digital edition will get you the Signature Pack, which includes two red-and-white outfits for Agent 47, a golden wrench, and a mushroom. Mushroom effects unknown at this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Physical pre-orders, meanwhile, offer both the Signature Pack and the Quack Pack, which offers a Luigi-themed green-and-grey suit and a green rubber duck. Much like a bald guy in a red tie and suit at a Paris fashion show, nothing unusual to see here.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/02/unnamed-1-1743612341462.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/02/unnamed-1743612341462.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Less-than-subtle references aside, it's fun to see Agent 47 get some Nintendo attire.

Starting with 2016's Hitman, the WoA trilogy runs up through Hitman III, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-3-review">IGN gave a 9</a>, saying: "Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is one of the barcoded butcher's best appearances."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition combines all of it together into one package. This includes the main campaign, contracts mode, escalations, Elusive Target arcades, and featured live content for Hitman, Hitman 2, and Hitman 3. Also included is the Freelancer game mode, a roguelike option for those who want even more variety and options in their Hitman experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition is due to arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in June 2025. Its also available now on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, the original Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation PS VR2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo offered a closer look at the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> during its latest Nintendo Direct presentation, showcasing the system's hardware and new features.

            <p>
Amid all the excitement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2's big news bonanza</a>, Nintendo has quietly confirmed some physical releases on the console won't have any game data on the included game card.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is referring to these physical releases as game-key cards and, unlike standard game cards, they'll only contain a download "key", rather than the full game data. Inserting the card into your Switch 2 starts the download process, after which you'll need to stick the game-key card into your console any time you want to play.
</p>
<p>
Physical releases containing game-key cards will be clearly labelled on their packaging, with the example on <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68415/kw/switch%202">Nintendo's overview page</a> featuring a prominent white strip along the bottom of the box, reading, "Game-Key Card" and "Full game download via internet required." It's similar to the messaging Nintendo used on Switch 1 when games were only partially included on cards - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/la-noires-switch-physical-edition-requires-14gb-download-to-play">LA Noire being an infamous early example</a> - even if the key-on-card approach itself is new.

<p>
As per Nintendo's explanation, Switch 2's homescreen will provide instructions on downloading the game when a game-key card is inserted into the console for the first time. Players will need sufficient free space either in Switch 2's system memory or on an attached microSD Express card to initiate the download (game-key card boxes clearly state how much space is required), and the game can then be played once the download is complete.
</p>
<p>
This means an internet connection is mandatory the first time a game is launched, but not after - although, to reiterate, game-key card games can't be started unless the card is inserted, unlike downloaded digital Switch 2 titles. None of this is perhaps a hugely encouraging sign for physical media fans, but given Nintendo's confirmation standard regular game cards will still exist, it's hard to tell how commonplace the new game-key card system is likely to become.
</p>

The Switch 2 will have a faster-performing eShop channel “even when displaying a large number of games,” Takuhiro Dohta, Nintendo’s senior director for entertainment planning and development, said in an <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Ask the Developer</em> interview</a>.</p><p>Dohta said the Switch 2’s eShop speed improvements are “thanks to the system’s performance capabilities,” which, of course, is a significant jump from the original system’s aging software that increasingly struggled in both menu and games over the years. “We believe the act of finding the game you want to play is itself part of the game system experience,” Dohta said.</p><p>Additionally, the eShop will have a new “Game Finds for You” feature that, as explained by producer for entertainment planning and development Kouichi Kawamoto, will let you “quickly see screenshots and watch introduction videos” for various games so you don’t have to “search every nook and cranny” of the store.</p><p>Nintendo has the chance to nail the next generation of the digital games experience if it can make the eShop more intuitive and easier to navigate.

For the most part, anything to do with the Nintendo Switch 2 won't have much to do with anyone in this neck of the woods, but its inaugural Direct did have some goodies for us PC players too. Like, for example, the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> Chapters 3 and 4 now have a release date, June 5th (which also happens to be when the Switch 2 comes out but that's neither here nor there). Mind, this is almost a good seven years after the first chapter dropped, and almost four since Chapter 2 was released, so it's been a long time coming.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
That release date reveal came with a little teaser trailer that kicked things off with a person in a not at all annoying dog costume (that honestly looks pretty damn comfortable) before showing off a few, brief clips from the third and fourth chapters. It looks like everyone's favourite font-themed Skeleton will be back once again, alongside some new mechanics during battle, one of which appears to be manoeuvring your analogue sticks to protect yourself from… squiggles?

<p>
There's a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guitar-hero">Guitar Hero</a>-esque bit too, and a couple of teases of scenes explicitly from Chapters 3 and 4 (there's tiny bits of the first two in the trailer) that seem a bit mysterious as well. Not much to go off of all in, but when has Toby Fox and co ever given away the goose that easily?
</p>
<p>
I can't offer you any more details than that, because there aren't any, though there is apparently a <a href="https://deltarune.com/newsletter/">newsletter</a> coming with some details sometime today that might be worth keeping an eye on.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, Chapters 3 and 4 will be paid unlike the first two, and they won't be the end of Deltarune either. There's plans for a total of seven, so we'll have to wait and see about those last three.

This hasn’t changed from Switch to Switch 2. I also wanted to create an experience that as many players as possible could enjoy, rather than an experience made specially for those who prefer high-performance hardware.”</p><p>Dohta says Nintendo’s plan is that the Switch 2 name will “communicate simply” to customers that if you want a Switch, well, the Switch 2 is the newest and best version.</p><p>“We really struggled because there were so many different ideas,” admitted Dohta.

As a result it will also be Nintendo’s most expensive digital release at $80. Maybe that’s to push more people toward the $500 Switch 2 bundle that includes a digital version of the game, a price tag within spitting distance of the company’s most expensive inflation-adjusted console release ever: the original NES.</p><p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is $70 digital, suggesting the baseline price for all Switch 2 premium games has gone up at least $10 this generation. Plus there’s the apparent $10 price hike for all physical versions of Switch 2 games, even though some might only be game-key cards, meaning they just let you download the full version of the game rather than containing it themselves. It’s effectively a digital experience at a potentially 15 percent higher cost to the consumer.</p><p>And then there are the accessories. Joy-Con controllers are $10 more this console cycle. So are the Switch 2 Pro controllers. The camera, a big part of today’s pitch for the new hardware, is sold separately for $50. Switch owners’ current memory cards aren’t compatible with the new hardware and will need to be upgraded too. While some Switch 2 upgrades for existing games are free, others for <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>will be locked behind paid Switch Online subscriptions, which you also need to have to pre-order the Switch 2 to begin with. Sold separately, they might be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1907451279401427076&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1907451279401427076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anywhere from $10 to $20</a></span>. </p><figure id="" data-id="f14a3f43c8cd3db0327a4f75b17274ec" data-recommend-id="image://f14a3f43c8cd3db0327a4f75b17274ec" data-format="png" data-width="947" data-height="403" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A post talks about Mario Kart World prices.

At the high end are PC rigs with GPUs that alone cost over $1,000 and cutting-edge consoles like the PS5 Pro that cost $700. At the low end are free-to-play hits like <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite </em>that can run on smartphones. And now that everything is an Xbox you can play some of the biggest games around, like upcoming shooter <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, in a web browser for just $12 a month. </p><p>One of the virtues of the original Switch wasn’t just the portability and being able to take open-world blockbusters like<em> Breath of the Wild</em> on the go. It was also being able to do so without breaking the bank. Nintendo abandoning the graphics arms race led to better games but also a more economical gaming experience overall that more people could be a part of. <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> on the $200 Switch Lite lowered the barrier to much needed self-care during the pandemic for everyone. </p><p> “Not worrying about the price of games is how we end up closing the doors of the hobby and later the profession to an entire class, and one that further harms diversity efforts,” wrote <em>But Why Tho?</em> EIC Kate Sánchez‬ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/ohmymithrandir.bsky.social/post/3lltn6mbyz22z&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/ohmymithrandir.bsky.social/post/3lltn6mbyz22z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Bluesky</a></span>. “I have worked with game dev students at wealthy and poorer schools and the path for all of them starts with when they knew games was a career path which often translates to when they began having access. Affordability is important and if you can’t see that I don’t know what to say.” </p><p>In addition to concerns about limiting diversity and economic gatekeeping, others have pointed out that Nintendo’s premium pricing strategy is being deployed at the exact same time that many in the video game industry are worried about stalled growth and losing ground to forever-game time sinks like <em>Minecraft </em>and<em> Grand Theft Auto Online </em>as well as endless scrolling time pits like TikTok and YouTube. Nintendo might be able to make the math work in its favor, but that doesn’t mean everyone else on the platform will benefit.</p><p>In addition to the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct, April 2 is also when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trump-tariffs-nato-allies.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/politics/trump-tariffs-nato-allies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump plans to announce a slew of new tariffs</a></span> on foreign goods.

Bloomberg correspondent Takashi Mochizuki suggested Nintendo’s philosophy around its gaming business is shifting as well, in part due to increased ambitions and more shareholder scrutiny. </p><p>“The company now has the largest pool of investors ever, with its shares <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">soaring to new heights</a></span> on anticipation about the new console,” he wrote. “Its recent crop of hires also comes from top-tier institutions and might expect a somewhat more cautious approach than the buccaneering spirit of the early era of video game development.” These new prices might not just reflect a pricier gaming landscape overall, but also a different Nintendo. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/motorsport-games-stock-falls-below-1-as-questions-mount/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Motorsport Games is officially a penny stock. At 9:50am ET, the company’s stock was trading at less than $1 on the NASDAQ. The stock has sense rebounded back above $1 as of publishing, but it remains in flux. </p>



<p>The stock has fallen over 7% over the last five days. Looking back a bit further, it has fallen by nearly 20% since the company reported its 2024 fourth quarter earnings on March 21. </p>



<p>Reasons for the stocks falling are multiple. Not only is the United States market a volatile place right now, but Motorsport Games has seen its value drop over the last couple of years. The company has lost both its Indy Car and NASCAR licenses, and currently only develops one game: Le Mans Ultimate. </p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that the game has sold more than 100,000 copies since it released in early access in February 2024. However, the company itself is still losing millions of dollars per quarter, reporting a fourth quarter loss of $2.9 million. This comes despite the company increasing its revenue for 2024 by 25.7% ($8.7 million) compared to 2023 ($6.9 million).</p>



<p>Motorsport Games also has, as of February 28, 2025, $1.2 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand. With the limited amount of funds, the company said in its <a href="https://ir.motorsportgames.com/news-releases/news-release-details/motorsport-games-reports-fourth-quarter-full-year-2024-financial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent earnings report</a> that it didn’t believe it had “sufficient cash on hand to fund its operations over the next year”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the company has continued to have multiple discussions regarding either a complete buyout or, at the very least, the selling of more assets. Those talks, however, have not resulted in any known finalized deal as of publishing.</p>



<p>What do you think of Motorsport Games’ stock continuing to fall? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

Much like the existing carrying case for Switch, this should be a good option for anyone looking to keep their Switch 2 safe while stowed in a backpack or suitcase.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/accessories/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.nintendo.com\/us\/gaming-systems\/switch-2\/accessories\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/accessories/">Nintendo Switch 2 All-In One Carrying Case</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/accessories/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.nintendo.com\/us\/gaming-systems\/switch-2\/accessories\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/accessories/">$80</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Plan on traveling with not just your Switch 2, but all of its accessories?
