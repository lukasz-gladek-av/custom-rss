            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/merge-games-shuts-down<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Smalland: Survive the Wilds&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX&nbsp;</em>publisher Merge Games has announced it's shutting down, putting an end to a 15-year journey in the games industry.</p>
<p>Posting <a href="https://x.com/MergeGamesLtd/status/1839264412579831900" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Merge announces that it's closing down, although it doesn't disclose a reason in the post. However, in all likelihood, the closure of Merge is related to the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/maximum-entertainment-merges-six-games-divisions-under-parent-brand" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unification of all of parent company Maximum Entertainment's divisions</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>In its post, Merge says its team started "from a tiny, cramped attic" and grew to "a tight, multi-disciplined 22-person team", bringing "hundreds of indie gems to storefronts around the world". Rather poignantly, Merge says its team "loved every moment of it".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merge-games-smalland-frog.jpg?itok=nVt9Jhx2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merge-games-smalland-frog.jpg?itok=9lnEW4cH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Merge Games is responsible for games like&nbsp;<em>Smalland: Survive the Wilds</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Merge continues by thanking its fans for their support and asks that if you see a former Merge employee or interact with them, "just know that they're an incredible person who worked their hardest".</p>
<p>With regards to Merge's upcoming releases, which include narrative adventure&nbsp;<em>Spirit of the North 2&nbsp;</em>and cozy farming RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pixelshire-is-cute-farming-rpg-coming-in-2023"><em>Pixelshire</em></a>, the studio <a href="https://x.com/MergeGamesLtd/status/1839266756545671227" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> its slate will "be managed by [its] parent company, Maximum Entertainment".</p>
<p>It's not clear whether all of Merge's employees will be laid off or whether they'll be absorbed into Maximum Entertainment, although the wording of Merge's post suggests that its staff might be out of a job now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merge-games-pixelshire.jpg?itok=mLjA7iIl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merge-games-pixelshire.jpg?itok=NWXIgyJS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Merge's upcoming releases, including&nbsp;<em>Pixelshire</em>, will be handled by Maximum Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>Merge is just one of a number of studios that have been shut down or significantly downsized in the industry in recent months. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/risk-of-rain-2-hopoo-games-valve"><em>Risk of Rain 2</em>'s Hopoo Games</a>,&nbsp;<em>Doom 3 VR&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-3-vr-developer-archiact-shuts-down">Archiact</a>, and (allegedly)&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Risen&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report">Piranha Bytes</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Of course, it's possible that Merge's shutdown has been on the cards since February's Maximum consolidation, and it's fair to say that the above studios don't all have the same reasons for shutting down. Still, today, we mourn the loss of a fascinating little publishing house. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The enormous fantasy RPG is due out October 11, but roughly six hours of the game are already available, across consoles and PC. Except, it turns out that PC version isn’t working out so well.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The extraordinarily huge 43 GB demo is struggling with performance issues, as players report stuttering and a number claim the game is only running on one CPU core. This means a game that doesn’t exactly push graphical boundaries is seeing its framerate leap about uncomfortably, despite running smoothly on PS5 and Xbox Series.</p><p>This matched my own initial experiences. My PC is a few years old now, but remains a decent AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, with 32 MB RAM, and a GeForce RTX 3070. Despite the first playable section of the game running at a smooth 60 FPS, as soon as I was in the first busy combat, it was jumping all over the place, rarely dipping below 40, but changing so frequently as to be extremely distracting. (I’m no framerate weirdo, and would be very happy to play at a steady 40 FPS, but the jittering between is the issue.)</p><p>The demo also lacks a large number of standard PC graphics settings, without even options for anti-aliasing, which suggests a dubious port of the console version, for the demo at least. It’s something PC players see too often, where vital settings required to play properly on the wheezing towers are missing. It also raises concerns for those hoping to play the full game on their PC in three weeks’ time. We’ve reached out to Sega and Atlus to ask about all this.</p><h2 id="h83024"><a id=""></a>Possible ways to fix <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>’s performance issues</h2><figure id="" data-id="a8e824aa2610be7d0636caa744571a8a" data-recommend-id="image://a8e824aa2610be7d0636caa744571a8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Rendering Scale options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Rendering Scale options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8e824aa2610be7d0636caa744571a8a" data-recommend-id="image://a8e824aa2610be7d0636caa744571a8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Rendering Scale options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, some are suggesting some solutions. Reading through Steam reviews of the demo—which are currently a mix of people furious about how badly it runs, and other people telling them that they’re wrong—it seems the most frequent solution on offer is to reduce the game’s rendering scale. Which sounds like a bummer of a fix, until you learn that the game is frequently defaulting to 125 to 150 percent in the first place. My own launched at 125 percent.</p><p>And yeah, it worked. I put it down to 100 percent (of what? I’m honestly not sure—I feel like more than 100 percent should have had the game hanging out the sides of my monitor, but the options go from 50 percent to 200), and then I was hitting a solid 60FPS in busy streets packed with dozens of NPCs.</p><p>In fact, after changing this I was able to put Texture Quality up to High and didn’t see any performance knock at all. And this is all running at 2560x1440 in a window.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/metaphor-refantazio-demo-launches-on-pc-to-framerate-woes-but-fans-are-already-cracking-fixes-for-the-new-jrpg/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/metaphor-refantazio-demo-launches-on-pc-to-framerate-woes-but-fans-are-already-cracking-fixes-for-the-new-jrpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GamesRadar</em></a></span> also spotted <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaphorReFantazio/comments/1fpnsne/metaphor_refantazio_pc_stuttering_fix/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaphorReFantazio/comments/1fpnsne/metaphor_refantazio_pc_stuttering_fix/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Reddit thread</a></span> that suggests a slightly harder-core solution (pun so very much intended). With the game running, open Task Manager (Ctrl Shift Esc is a neat shortcut for this!), choose the Details tab, then right click on METAPHOR.exe and choose “set affinity.” Deselect all the cores but one, hit OK, then do it again and re-select all the cores. Apparently this will help if rendering scale does not. I tried it too, and yeah, I then put my rendering scale up to 150 percent, and my framerate hovered between 55 and 60. Which is good enough for me!</p><p>Hopefully, by the time the game comes out October 11, the PC version will feature a far better suite of options, including standards like anti-aliasing, DLSS, etc, and have any core use bugs ironed out. In the meantime, these fixes worked for me and others.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-20-million/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been revealed that Black Myth Wukong sold 20 million units in its first month across the PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>



<p>The information comes from Ken Kutaragi at the Toyko Game Show (via <a href="https://x.com/deantak/status/1839133380891300082/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dean Takahashi</a>), in which a presentation slide reveals that Black Myth: Wukong sold 10 million units in its first three days and 20 million units in one month. The game also saw three million concurrent players across all platforms.</p>



<p>Interestingly, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2358720/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamID</a>, just over 2.4 million of these concurrent players were on PC (assuming this was the 3 million peak), meaning that around 600,000 players were on PlayStation 5. That means that according to these numbers, at least for the concurrent number at least, about 80% of Black Myth: Wukong’s players were playing on PC.</p>



<p>20 million units in one month puts Black Myth: Wukong firmly in one of the top spots as one of the fastest-selling games to date.</p>



<p>According to review aggregator Metacritic, the game received generally favorable reviews from PC and PlayStation 5 users, with an 81/100 score for PC and 75/100 on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>According to analyst&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DanielOlimac/status/1835067614118527363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1835067614118527363%7Ctwgr%5Ed1ce3b33a730825310523a25d786dc3b5b5b2039%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.geekinout.pt%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daniel Camilo</a> (who also reported the 20 million number a few weeks ago), <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-coming-early-2025-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLC for Black Myth: Wukong</a> is expected to release sometime around Chinese New Year.</p>

                <p>Nintendo visionary Shigeru Miyamoto has commented on the company's stance regarding artificial intelligence, saying the Mario maker aims to "go in a different direction."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, Miyamoto said Nintendo is often perceived as a company that bucks trends and does its own thing only for the sake of it. But that isn't true. It's an intentional effort to be different, Miyamoto said. And the same thinking applies for AI--whereas plenty of companies are adopting and embracing it, Nintendo may not.</p><p>Miyamoto said Nintendo's ambition is "trying to find what makes Nintendo special." He added: "There is a lot of talk about AI, for example. When that happens, everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction."</p><p>Earlier this year, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa explained that AI could be used "in creative ways" but there were also "issues with intellectual property rights" to deal with.</p><p>"Generative AI, which is becoming a big topic recently, can be used in creative ways, but we recognize that it may also raise issues with intellectual property rights," <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Furukawa said</a>. While Nintendo is open to "utilizing technological developments," it is currently relying on its experienced employees to develop unique games.</p><p>"We have decades of know-how in creating the best gaming experiences for our players. While we are open to utilizing technological developments, we will work to continue delivering value that is unique to Nintendo and cannot be created by technology alone," Furukawa said.</p><p>Nintendo's stance on AI is indeed different from some of the video game industry's other major players. Electronic Arts boss Andrew Wilson believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-drive-microtransaction-sales-help-games-get-made-faster-no-comment-on-human-impact/1100-6521669/" data-ref-id="1100-6521669">AI could be used to develop games more quickly</a>. Microsoft, meanwhile, is heavily invested in AI and has said AI will be featured in every product it makes going forward, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exec-believes-ai-will-be-a-major-inflection-point-for-gaming-but-says-nothing-about-human-impact/1100-6519555/" data-ref-id="1100-6519555">including Xbox</a>, and Ubisoft plans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-trying-to-make-ai-npcs-that-have-real-conversations/1100-6521970/" data-ref-id="1100-6521970">create AI NPCs that players can have conversations with</a>.</p><p>AI technology, of course, has been used in game development for decades--but what's new and different in recent years is what's referred to as generative artificial intelligence. Many remain concerned that growth of the generative AI market could lead to job losses, and companies like EA and others have admitted this is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/">legitimate concern</a> in the short term. In the longer-term, people like Wilson of EA and others believe generative AI will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-future-could-be-a-bigger-seamless-world-and-more-players/1100-6525024/" data-ref-id="1100-6525024">similar to previous labor revolutions that had short-term job losses and long-term growth.</a></p><p>The video game industry has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">faced brutal layoffs in 2023 and 2024</a>, though what role advances to artificial intelligence technologies has had on these cuts is unknown.</p><p>Nintendo is gearing up to announce its next console, presumably <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">the Switch 2</a>, and a reveal is expected soon or perhaps near Nintendo's next earnings briefing in November as some have speculated.</p>

            <p>Bravely he stood, alone on his hill, unwavering in the face of backlash: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> should have just let Frog be a talking frog instead of being a knight turned into a frog. So, trash game. Fortunately, I can finally experience what it’s like to actually enjoy Chrono Trigger - Canadian Studio Riyo Games are making what they describe as a "spiritual successor". It’s called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/threads-of-time">Threads Of Time</a>, it’s "aided by legendary developers and composers from Japan who have helped define Xenoblade Chronicles, the Mana series and more," and it looks beautiful. Hop on over to the trailer below.</p>

<p>News of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has actually been floating around for a while now, with Riyo sharing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/130m08j/my_dream_of_20_years_is_coming_true_im_making_a/">a little snippet</a> on Reddit a year or so ago. Even in such a small clip, you can see how lovely it looks. Here’s some words from the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>Threads of Time features gorgeous 2.5D pixel art powered by Unreal Engine 5 that instantly transports you across breathtaking locales through the ages. Explore different eras, assemble your party and restore the ancient order of the Time Knights. From the majestic age of dinosaurs to the distant future teeming with mechanical marvels, every era is packed with adventure and secrets waiting to be unearthed. As you navigate this vast tapestry of history, uncover a sinister plot threatening to unravel the very fabric of time as told through striking anime cutscenes.</p></blockquote>
<p>A Steam page is supposed to be up today, but it isn’t showing up right now. Maybe it was only a frog pretending to be a Steam page. Who knows! Here are some features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><p>Time-Traveling Adventure: From an age where dinosaurs roam to the far-flung future and alternate realms in between - travel across fantastic and distinctive time periods, and discover the threads that bind the ages. Uncover an epic tale of interwoven fates, and secrets that shaped civilizations…and follow the threads of a sinister plot that traverses the tapestry of time.</p></li>
<li><p>Timeless Turn-Based Combat: Weave together powerful attacks in visually dynamic, strategic turn-based battles. Bend time to your will, unravel enemies’ defenses, and unleash your party’s full potential through devastating team combos.</p></li>
<li><p>Heroes From Across Ages: Assemble a party of charismatic and unique characters recruited from different eras. Restore the ancient Order of the Time Knights and unite heroes from across epochs to defend the timeline from impending chaos and corruption.</p></li>
<li><p>Retro Charm Meets Modern Visuals: Step into vibrant worlds powered by Unreal Engine 5, meet lovingly hand-crafted 2D characters and experience the timeless charm of pixel art as you explore through the ages. Threads of Time captures the essence of your favorite retro RPGs, wrapped in a new and immersive adventure.</p></li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>“I'm distracted by them using "AD" and "BC" though. Christ exists in this fiction? So did God invent magic, then? Was Jesus a wizard? Tell me more plz,” mused Graham in Slack. It’s been a while since I’ve played Chrono Trigger (which I enjoyed, before you go feral on me in the comments), but some searching tells me the ‘B.C’ in that stood for ‘Before Cedric’. Will Threads Of Time also feature a Cedric? What if it's Jesus transformed into a Cedric? I await these answers longingly.</p></div>

<p>Merge Games has announced that it will be closing down after 15 years of publishing games.</p>



<p>The announcement came earlier today on <a href="https://x.com/MergeGamesLtd/status/1839264412579831900">X</a> (formerly Twitter), which read,</p>



<p>“Hello! After 15 years, Merge Games is closing down.</p>



<p>Starting from  tiny, cramped attic and growing to a tight, multi-disciplined 22 person team, we’ve brought hundreds of indie gems to storefronts around the world and loved every moment of it!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/26/funko-fusion-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Funko’s remain an ubiquitous part of the shopping landscape, row after row of plastic figures styled after every popular franchise in the world languishing on shelves in every supermarket, toy shop and place of geekdom. Collectable, displayable, and kind of cute in their own way, they also don’t <em>do</em>&nbsp;very much, and their pervasive presence and plastic build mean that they’re edging ever closer to being throwaway tat. Funko Fusion is the company’s attempt to ‘do a Lego’, taking their real-world products and popping them into a video game. These Funkos definitely do something, but whether it’s enough to change people’s mind about them remains to be seen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Funko Fusion - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2ATcFLgSMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The biggest question that arises from playing Funko Fusion is a simple one: who is this really for? It draws together a disparate batch of franchises – Jurassic World, He-Man, Scott Pilgrim, The Umbrella Academy, Battlestar Galactica, The Thing and Hot Fuzz are your starting points – and tasks you with saving this plasticky multiverse from the forces of evil who are set on destroying it. You do that by mostly beating, bashing and shooting your way past a host of enemies, while solving the occasional puzzle, and if the team were hoping to emulate the Lego games, they’ve mostly got it right.</p>


<p>It’s probably little surprise to find this vein of child-friendly action games running through Funko Fusion, as 10:10 Games was founded by former Traveller’s Tales team members Arthur Parsons and Jon Burton. The biggest issue here is that barring Jurassic World, the majority of franchises here are aimed at people in their 30s and 40s, running the gamut of old-school names through to a worrying vein of horror titles like Child’s Play. Hell, it’s not even the most recent Battlestar Galactica (which is already 20 years old), it’s the original 1970s one, which came out before I was born. And I’m old.</p>


<p>All this means that, bizarrely, Funko Fusion is rated 16. It is not for children. But, the only people who have been really excited to play it have been my children – aged 8 and 13 – and predominantly because it has dinosaurs in it. We started with Jurassic World, but the moment I moved onto He-Man – the only other clearly child-friendly franchise here – their interest swiftly waned.</p>
<p>That was probably the right thing to happen, as the scary, slightly vicious streak that also runs through Funko Fusion from the outset had me questioning my parenting choices. The vinyl is melted right off the bones of a cute fox character early on, and that underlying darkness is only enhanced by the arrival of Chucky, M3GAN and characters from The Walking Dead as you head deeper into the plastic depths of Fusion’s worlds.</p>

<p>Again though, Funko Fusion <em>looks</em> like a kids game, and it’s an excellent-looking one at that. The plasticky stars look very much like their real-world counterparts, and each franchise-specific location manages to capture the look, feel and nostalgia of those original titles. The strains of recognisable themes helps as well, but having taken the original Lego route of forgoing dialogue, and relying on slapstick humour – oh look, their head’s come off and now they’re covered in poo! – means that again, this feels like a kids game that’s not for kids.</p>
<p>“But games can just be fun!” a corner of the internet will cry. Yes, they can be fun, and Funko Fusion broadly is. I like a good spot of nostalgia as much as the next guy, and seeing the DeLorean from Back to the Future appear or Masters of the Universe’s Snake Mountain in 3D, made a ton of feelings bubble up to the surface – not least wondering whatever happened to my original Castle Greyskull. It’s light, and fairly inconsequential, but enjoyable nonetheless.</p>

<p>The combat here is straightforward, but when I started out with my review it was actually surprisingly tough. So much so that 10:10 Games has already patched it to make it easier, raising further questions about who they’re targeting. For kids raised on Fortnite and Lego games, there’s little here that will surprise them, but it’s solid and engaging enough as you wonder what the next little Easter Egg will be.</p>
<p>The most criminal exclusion at launch though, is the lack of cooperative multiplayer. <a href="https://x.com/FunkoFusionGame/status/1831347215928807428">It’s coming in updates</a> through October and November for various world, just in time for Christmas, but if ever a game screamed out for playing with friends it’s this one, particularly if they share the same sense of nostalgia for these franchises.</p>

		<p>One of the few notable announcements from the Xbox Tokyo Game Show stream was the reveal of Threads of Time, a time-travelling JRPG that is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Threads of Time | Announce Trailer EN" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tRMgzkwumfc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A time-skipping adventure, Threads of Time will take players from the prehistoric land of dinosaurs (where humans and dinos coexist like it’s The Flintstones) through to the far future. The Watcher of Time guides you through these disparate ages, as you look to assemble a team to restore the Order of the Time Knights, hoping to foil a plot that threatens the fabric of time itself.</p>

<p>Threads of Time takes liberal inspiration from classics of the JRPG genre –&nbsp;most specifically Chrono Trigger – in particular with the visual stylings that feature a 2.5D pixel art style not too far removed from Square Enix’s HD-2D games, though arguably with even more cinematic flair. It’s leaning on Unreal Engine 5 to achieve this.</p>

<p>The turn-based combat has a focus on building up combos, forcing you to think a bit more strategically as you face off against such enemies as Fenrir, the wolf of legends, and Ruin, a massive robotic behemoth in the far future.</p>
<p>It looks really interesting and is a game we’ll certainly be keeping an eye on. Threads of Time is in development at Riyo Games, with Humble Games set to publish.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-has-no-trouble-pushing-120-fps-gameplay-even-without-optimization-and-pssr-%E2%80%93-rumor.992940/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-120-fps/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro will apparently have little trouble running games at 120 FPS, according to a new report.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a> Broken Silicon podcast, host Tom confirmed to have been sent footage of a game running on PlayStation 5 Pro from an unnamed developer. This game ran with dynamic resolution averaging 1440p resolution, going as high as 1600p and as low as 1300p, at around 50 FPS, but unlocking the framerate brought the average framerate up to 100 FPS and above, without any sort of PS5 Pro optimization. With more work and the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, the developer felt confident they would have the game running at 1440p, 1600p resolution, and locked 120 FPS, which is definitely impressive for a console. The developer is also gearing to test out 4K@60 FPS resolution, which they feel confident they can achieve.</p>

<p>Following the PlayStation 5 Pro reveal, Sony allowed several outlets to check out the system. Among them was Digital Foundry, who outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-digital-foundry-hands-on-delivers-first-impression-on-pssr-ray-tracing-improvements-and-more/">yesterday</a> the improvements for many different titles, highlighting how, in many ways, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vast-improvement-playstation-5-pro/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> is the poster child for the console, mostly due to the poor image quality the game sports on the base model in Performance Mode.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th, 2024, worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fatal-fury-city-of-wolves-street-fighter-crossover<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SNK has announced that two&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>characters are making their way into the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>, which is currently due to launch in spring.</p>
<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/SNKPofficial/status/1839263065369620722" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter</em>'s iconic characters Ken and Chun-Li will make an appearance in&nbsp;<em>City of the Wolves</em>. I guess this is SNK returning the favor to Capcom after <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1839077427617661290" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Terry Bogard was featured</a> in&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>.</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>is still some way from being released, SNK doesn't give much away about exactly how Ken and Chun-Li will play in the game, but I'm guessing they'll be pretty similar to the way they appear in&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-street-fighter-crossover-combat.jpg?itok=n3b7ksGc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-street-fighter-crossover-combat.jpg?itok=HXd5loBW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>is getting two&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>characters.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether this is the full extent of the&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>crossover, or whether more&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>characters will arrive via DLC, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>We also don't know whether&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury&nbsp;</em>will make reference to the conclusion of Terry Bogard's story in&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>, whereupon he battles Ken as his final opponent. The two have an ongoing rivalry in crossover series&nbsp;<em>Capcom vs. SNK</em>.</p>
<p>In any case, you can check out the trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>crossover right here. It doesn't give a whole lot away, though.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>is, it's the first new mainline entry in the&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury&nbsp;</em>series of fighting games since 1999's&nbsp;<em>Garou: Mark of the Wolves</em>.</p>
<p>Although it constitutes a revival of the franchise, characters from&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury&nbsp;</em>have made appearances in other games, including the aforementioned&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>, as well as spinoff series&nbsp;<em>The King of Fighters</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-king-of-fighters-xv-dlc-hinako-shijo">still going strong</a>.</p>
<p><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>is currently scheduled for release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2492040/FATAL_FURY_City_of_the_Wolves/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009499" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves/9p9m35wvgck9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on April 24th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-review-switch-1851657826<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How do you follow up on some of the most critically acclaimed games of the past decade? Many thought that Nintendo couldn’t surpass the sheer open-world wonder and physics toy-box creativity that made <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild such a revelation</em>. However, Nintendo seemed to do just that with <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, introducing a host of new ways for players to interact with the world and expanding the already vast realm of Hyrule both into the skies above and into the depths below, arguably improving so much on its extraordinary predecessor as to make it obsolete.</p><p>In between those two games, we also got <em>Link’s Awakening,</em> a 2019 remake of a classic Game Boy adventure that replaced the original’s pixel art with toy-like and dioramic visuals, trying to recreate the retro feel for a modern age. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> takes that same charming art direction and applies it to a completely original story featuring our beloved Hyrule princess, Zelda. It also attempts to combine the player-driven creativity and problem-solving from both <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>with classic top-down <em>Zelda</em> gameplay, and it works! Mostly.<br></p><p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s story finds Hyrule threatened by dark rifts engulfing the land, trapping its inhabitants, including our usual green-tunic-wearing hero Link, in a frozen time-space continuum. Zelda, with her fairy-like companion Tri, set out to dispel these rifts and set those trapped free. With Link himself imprisoned in one of these rifts, it falls to Zelda, in a first for a mainline game in the franchise, to rescue the land herself.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="42b0a609acf664865f259f15676c6a70" data-recommend-id="image://42b0a609acf664865f259f15676c6a70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda, standing on a rocky outcropping over a lake, looks toward a castle in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zelda, standing on a rocky outcropping over a lake, looks toward a castle in the distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42b0a609acf664865f259f15676c6a70" data-recommend-id="image://42b0a609acf664865f259f15676c6a70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda, standing on a rocky outcropping over a lake, looks toward a castle in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The main difference between playing as Zelda and stepping back into Link’s boots is that she doesn’t fight enemies directly with your typical sword and shield, at least most of the time. With Tri’s magic, Zelda is able to create “echoes,” which are clones of items and monsters she’s encountered throughout Hyrule. She can summon things like beds, tables, and chairs, but also creatures like electric-force-field-inducing blobs and goblins with spears (or moblins, in the Hyrule parlance). This is where <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s freeform creativity comes into play.<br></p><p>When traversing the game’s dungeons and puzzles, my go-to strategy was always to stack beds on top of each other, forming a makeshift bridge to cross wide gaps. It was similar to a strategy I used in <em>Tears of the Kingdom,</em> where I would just stick logs together to make a bridge. While this frequently helped me in the early game, I eventually had to think more creatively in later dungeons. For example, when gaps were too wide for my bed bridge, I stood at the edge of my incomplete creation and also used an echo that, when picked up, blew a windstream opposite of Zelda’s direction that propelled her far enough to reach the other side. When your solutions actually end up working, there’s a huge sense of accomplishment, and <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> provides those feelings in spades, making you feel satisfied and confident throughout.<br></p><p>When <em>Echoes </em>begins, Tri’s magic is limited so there’s a hard cap on how many echoes you can have out at a time. But the game’s progression system feels quite natural; as Tri becomes more capable, she and Zelda clear more rifts throughout the story and the cap increases, allowing Zelda to summon more echoes at once.<br></p><p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> feels something like a puzzle game, reminiscent of those older series entries that had intricately constructed dungeons you had to not just fight your way through but to solve, and in this game, you can progress through them with her echoes, which almost act as the key, traversal-aiding items that you’d otherwise obtain in games past.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="9a8309b085013f106b26e8f53ce4569b" data-recommend-id="image://9a8309b085013f106b26e8f53ce4569b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda looks up, smiling, while a blue frog-like creature glows above her and text reads, &quot;You learned the Drippitune echo!&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zelda looks up, smiling, while a blue frog-like creature glows above her and text reads, &quot;You learned the Drippitune echo!&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a8309b085013f106b26e8f53ce4569b" data-recommend-id="image://9a8309b085013f106b26e8f53ce4569b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda looks up, smiling, while a blue frog-like creature glows above her and text reads, &quot;You learned the Drippitune echo!&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To further maintain that classic <em>Zelda</em> feel, our intrepid heroine has limited access to Link’s iconic swordfighter repertoire. For a limited time, she can enter a “swordsman mode” that lets her swing a sword, shoot arrows, and throw bombs, all of the things Link could do when he was the protagonist. At times, this felt like a concession to longtime Zelda players who just want to return to Link’s gameplay. In the context of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s mechanics, it feels quite overpowered, even if it’s only active until Zelda’s energy meter runs out. Part of Zelda’s fighting style involves using the echoes to do the dirty work for her. That means risking your bomb-making fish echo being destroyed by an enemy before it can go off. The swordfighter mode essentially becomes like a “press to win” button because Zelda can just spam bombs. Additionally, Zelda can continually down smoothies that she can make with various ingredients throughout Hyrule to recharge her energy meter. This method effectively lets her enter and stay in swordfighter mode more frequently and for longer. As a result, this unfortunately ends up trivializing most of Zelda’s arsenal of echoes, as swordfighter mode makes quick work of even bosses.<br></p><p>Combat is at its best when you rely on echoes, and finding new echoes is half the fun of actually using them. Every time I defeated a new enemy, I was excited to scan them and create echoes of them. It felt like I was playing <em>Pokémon</em>, trying to collect as many as I could. However, that leads me into <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s most prominent issue: echo management.<br></p><p>There are dozens upon dozens of these echoes, and it’s a total pain in the butt to cycle through your entire list of all of them while looking for the particular one you need for your particular situation. There are some helpful sorting tools, such as being able to organize by your most recently used or the latest one you acquired, but I wish the game allowed you to manually organize your collection of echoes.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="0f0bf351028f658f36b8e32eeb06f452" data-recommend-id="image://0f0bf351028f658f36b8e32eeb06f452" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows collected echoes, sorted by Last Used, with a Bombfish echo highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu screen shows collected echoes, sorted by Last Used, with a Bombfish echo highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f0bf351028f658f36b8e32eeb06f452" data-recommend-id="image://0f0bf351028f658f36b8e32eeb06f452" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows collected echoes, sorted by Last Used, with a Bombfish echo highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Exploration also plays a huge role in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>. The map looks a lot like that of <em>A Link to the Past</em>, feeling like a sort of homage to the franchise’s past. The game is surprisingly long as well, taking about 25-30 hours to just complete the main story. It’s filled with dozens of side quests and optional dungeons. Some of these side quests are quick and easy, like finding and killing a monster that has the ability to summon rain and showing it to a local townsperson, or searching for missing chickens scattered throughout a town and putting them back into a farm. Others, meanwhile, are quite elaborate, including a multi-step one in which you’re eventually rewarded with the powerful ability to build robots that have humongous AOE attacks. They’re a huge boon, especially in boss fights.<br></p><p>I felt like the rewards you get for completing side quests are much more worthwhile than in most role-playing games. While you’ll probably just earn more rupees to spend at shops, you’re also likely to encounter a new echo along the way that could prove helpful later on. In fact, some of the most useful echoes are stowed away in optional dungeons, which makes exploration even more rewarding. Early on, I came across a giant plant that could propel itself into monsters, constantly dealing damage with its appendages. It was an incredibly powerful echo at that point in the game, and let me steamroll many of the early game bosses.<br></p><p>While exploration is fun and rewarding, I do wish Zelda’s running speed was faster. She runs abysmally slow and it’s incredibly frustrating. She has a little spin move that doesn’t do any damage, but when combined with running, actually makes her move much more quickly than her usual sprint. So I was constantly mashing the right bumper button while moving to break into a makeshift spin-dash whenever I was running out in the wild.<br></p><p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> successfully combines the feel of earlier <em>Zelda</em> games with the new creative direction that the modern entries have been going in. By fusing the classic key item progression of older Zelda games with the more modern, player-driven problem-solving of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> and <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> creates something both familiar, yet distinct from every other game in the series so far. Also, our long-suffering Hyrulian princess finally gets some time in the spotlight, and that is a welcome change of pace.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-workers-encouraged-to-strike-over-return-to-office-mandate/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Employees at Ubisoft’s French offices are being urged to strike over the company’s recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-mandating-3-days-in-office-for-all-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global return to office mandate</a>.</p>



<p>STJV (Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo) made calls for a strike over a <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/09/call-for-strike-for-all-french-ubisoft-entities-on-october-15-16-and-17-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">three-day period in October</a>. According to the union, the decision to mandate a return to office policy without “any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers’ representatives.”</p>



<p>“After more than five years of working efficiently in the current remote-work context, many of our colleagues have built or rebuilt their lives (family life, housing, parenthood, etc.) and simply cannot return to the previous working conditions,” the union’s statement reads. “Our employer knows this perfectly well.&nbsp;The consequence of its decision will be the loss of our colleagues’ jobs, the disorganization of many game projects, and the drastic increase in psychosocial risks for those who remain.”</p>



<p>As far as what they are looking for, STJV says its demands are clear. They want a “formal agreement on remote work” as well as an increase in all salaries to “compensate for the drop in our living standards in recent years”. Lastly, they say they want to company to implement true “social dialogue” instead of a system where “management seems indeed to confuse monologue with dialogue”.</p>



<p>STJV is asking for all France-based employees to strike from October 15-17.</p>



<p>The calls for a strike come while Ubisoft is facing its most tumultuous time in recent history. The company announced on Wednesday that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> until February while also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealing an investigation and review</a> of the company was set to take place. On top of that, its stock prices have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-11-year-low-after-assassins-creed-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fallen to 11-year lows</a> due to changes in financial targets for the year.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>What do you make of Ubisoft employees being encouraged to strike in October? Join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/505/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <p>Threads of Time is a newly revealed retro style RPG described as a spiritual successor to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>.</p>
<p>The game was shown today by Xbox at the Tokyo Game Show, and is being developed by Canadian studio Riyo Games.</p>
<p>This is the studio's first game, though its developers have experience from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a>, and Tomb Raider. What's more, development has been aided by "legendary developers and composers" from the Xenoblade Chronicles and Mana series.</p>

<p>As you can see from the above trailer, it features a gorgeous 2.5D style that blends pixel characters with 3D effects, classic turn-based battles, and is heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger with its time travelling plot.</p>
<p>It begins in prehistory with battles against dinosaurs, but also includes a dystopian cyberpunk city, an apocalyptic future, and a fantastical past of airships and magical creatures.</p>
<p>If all this sounds familiar, it certainly has shades of Sea of Stars from developer Sabotage Studios - also based in Canada. That game was similarly a love letter to Chrono Trigger and had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/composing-nostalgia-how-sea-of-stars-revisits-the-past-through-music">music from that game's original composer Yasunori Mitsuda</a>.</p>
<p>The release date for Threads of Time is yet to be revealed, but it's set to launch on Steam and consoles (including Xbox), and is available to wishlist now.</p>
<p>Until then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-free-carnival-themed-dlc-throes-of-the-watchmaker-revealed">Sea of Stars will receive free carnival-themed DLC</a> Throes of the Watchmaker in Spring next year.</p>
<p>What's more, Xbox also announced a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-brings-mana-and-final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-to-xbox">Square Enix games are now available Xbox consoles</a>, including the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Square Enix has brought eight of its remade and remastered Mana series and Final Fantasy classics to Xbox, strengthening their ties with Microsoft and their commitment to future cross-platform game launches. All eight games are available today, with some also on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>The eight games are:</p>


<ul>
<li>Final Fantasy I – VI Pixel Remaster</li>
<li>Trials of Mana (2020 3D remake)</li>
<li>Legend of Mana (2021 remaster)</li>
</ul>
<p>Trials of Mana and Legend of Mana are both being added to Xbox Game Pass today, as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster | TGS Xbox Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6rgISfgAxEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Available as a bundle or individually, the Final Fantasy I – VI Pixel Remaster series was first released through 2021 and 2022 for PC and mobile, retaining the graphics of the original releases but bringing some solid enhancements and quality of life improvements along the way – though it’s also fair to say that not everything was perfected, such as <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/11522-how-to-fix-that-awful-font-in-the-final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-games-on-pc">an odd font choice</a>. They then arrived for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch in 2023, and it’s great to have them on Xbox in 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Legend of Mana | Xbox Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y8CKJYTD-XY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The same can be said of having more of the Mana series on Xbox, as well. Legend of Mana is another pixel graphics remaster that brings the 1999 game to modern platforms, while Trials of Mana was giving a full 3D remake treatment in 2020.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Trials of Mana | Xbox Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/noste-L_SoY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/22/trials-of-mana-remake-review/">Trials of Mana remake review</a>, Miguel said, “Trials of Mana is an exciting new step for the Mana series, breathing new, fully 3D life into a SNES classic that was left inaccessible to English fans for decades. The inventive and memorable story of the original game blends perfectly with the flashy new real-time combat system, and while muddy textures and a lack of co-op prove to somewhat sour the experience, this is still a stellar action RPG remake that anyone can get a kick out of.”</p>
<p>Well worth checking out, in other words.</p>

			<p>As per the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-rumors-intensify-ahead-of-tgs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a>, Square Enix has indeed announced some new Xbox ports during the Tokyo Game Show 2024 broadcast. However, they're all for old games. Anyway, nearly all of them are available today on Xbox, and some are included with the Game Pass subscription.</p>
<p>To start with, Square Enix has ported the so-called <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-series-sales-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters</a>, which include all mainline games from the first installment to the sixth. Here's an overview of some of the improvements in these remasters:</p>
<p><em>New pixel art optimized for HD displays, rearranged soundtracks, and several quality-of-life features, including multiple font options, the ability to switch back to the old soundtracks, the ability to boost experience gains for faster leveling, turn off random enemy encounters, and even auto-battle.</em></p>
<p>Trials of Mana and Legend of Mana are also out today on Xbox and included with Game Pass. Trials of Mana launched nearly four and a half years ago, with the remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/trials-of-mana-from-snes-to-switch-this-sword-still-shines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earning an 8.5/10 score on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>Even if you already know the story beats by heart and can recite the optimal path to beat all eight Benevodons by heart, Trials of Mana still feels refreshing enough to be considered a brand new game. If you've already paid off your Nook loans and are itching for a new single player RPG to enjoy at home, Trials of Mana is a modern classic worth considering.</em></p>
<p>Legend of Mana is a remaster of the 1999 game that originally launched on the first PlayStation console. Lastly, Square Enix confirmed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-gamescom-hands-on-pixel-excellence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Quest III HD-2D REMAKE</a> will launch on Xbox Series S|X on November 14 in addition to the previously announced platforms.</p>
<p>However, it's hard not to be disappointed with today's news. Not only did Square Enix not announce Final Fantasy XVI, they didn't even port the latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/visions-of-mana-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visions of Mana</a> game. Of course, these ports could still be announced at a later date, but for now, Xbox fans will probably still feel like second-class users.</p>
