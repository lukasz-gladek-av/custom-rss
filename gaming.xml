            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-extra-crispy-gun-lets-you-cook-eat-and-turn-your-enemies-into-fried-chicken-and-people-are-blaming-it-all-on-fortnite-once-again<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The impact of all-conquering metaverse battle royale Fortnite on Call of Duty ‚Äî indeed the competitive multiplayer video game landscape ‚Äî is a topic of long-running debate. In truth, Activision left Call of Duty‚Äôs military sim tone behind long ago, resulting in what players have now: a no-holds barred fusion of pop culture and modern warfare.</p><p>But Call of Duty‚Äôs latest gun has thrust that debate back into forums and social media once again, and that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs perhaps the silliest weapon ever seen in the first-person shooter franchise.</p><p>Dataminers unearthed the trailer for the ‚ÄúExtra Crispy‚Äù gun, which lets users cook, eat, and turn their enemies into fried chicken. Call of Duty dataminer <a href="https://x.com/realityuk_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@realityuk_</a> was first to bring it to fans' attention.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Extra Crispy Keep Trailer <a href="https://t.co/a3DfLd6y28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/a3DfLd6y28</a></p>‚Äî Reality (@realityuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/realityuk_/status/1807501354086060472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>This weapon, currently exclusive to <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile">Call of Duty Warzone Mobile</a>, has an elaborate weapon inspect animation that sees the player stick a raw chicken on the end of the barrel of the gun, cook it, and eat it. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can officially eat and cook fried chicken in Call of Duty with the weapon inspection on the ‚ÄúExtra Crispy‚Äù bundle üçó<a href="https://t.co/a2v7mAa4Vo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/a2v7mAa4Vo</a></p>‚Äî ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1807166495618720183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Shooting enemies with the gun, meanwhile, turns them into pieces of fried chicken.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HQ Kill Effect for the Extra Crispy HCR56 <a href="https://t.co/6Af5KMHwPB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6Af5KMHwPB</a></p>‚Äî Reality (@realityuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/realityuk_/status/1807500343791747313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>It‚Äôs fair to say some of Call of Duty‚Äôs more hardcore fans, perhaps those who played the series before battle royale Warzone became the focus from 2020, are in a flap over this new fried chicken gun. Activision, however, might argue the chicken gun is getting a raw deal. "When will they stop adding nonsense to the game?" asked @Junxrrcarter.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The damage Fortnite has unintentionally done to the multiplayer game aesthetic is unrepairable <a href="https://t.co/CbTXQ4JHOc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/CbTXQ4JHOc</a></p>‚Äî Kelski (@kelskiYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/kelskiYT/status/1807864888318218295?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Others, meanwhile, don't see the problem with this sort of thing as an optional cosmetic in Call of Duty, while pointing out that the Zombies mode is about as unrealistic as you can get in a shooter. Indeed many are having a joke about it all.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">‚Äî Spectre (@SpectreOG) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpectreOG/status/1807361941460983933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>It seems Activision is happy to go a step further for Call of Duty mobile weapon skins than it is for the main game on console and PC. Perhaps that has something to do with mobile players being less inclined to take issue with this sort of thing because they haven't had that history with the series before Call of Duty Mobile came out. Either way, the official X/Twitter account for Call of Duty Warzone Mobile has leaned into the negative reaction, perhaps wisely so.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Watching our big reveal get cooked <a href="https://t.co/AaJKwKku0x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/AaJKwKku0x</a></p>‚Äî Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile (@WarzoneMobile) <a href="https://twitter.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1807897307146604720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Call of Duty makes Activision, and now parent company Microsoft, billions of dollars in microtransactions, and much of this comes from outlandish bundles sold post-launch. High-profile crossovers have seen everything from Warhammer 40,000 characters to Gundam mechs running around Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone in recent months. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-dataminers-unearth-what-looks-like-an-unannounced-deadpool-wolverine-crossover">There‚Äôs even evidence of an upcoming Deadpool &amp; Wolverine crossover</a>. Truly, in the world of Call of Duty, anything goes, and Activision won‚Äôt stop here.</p><p>But it‚Äôs worth pointing out that with the release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> later this year, Call of Duty cosmetics will see something of a fresh start. That‚Äôs because all those bundles you‚Äôve bought for Modern Warfare 2 and 3 won‚Äôt carry over to Black Ops 6, which means for launch, at least, we‚Äôre back to some semblance of realism.</p><p>Enjoy it while it lasts!</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

</div><div>



            <p>Capcom spat a little squirt of news bile on us yesterday, like a hideous zombie vomiting up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/demon-battling-escort-em-up-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-gets-a-demo-on-steam">demos</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-a-steam-release-date-also-confirmed-graphics">release dates</a>. One of the smaller chunks was a brief comment by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7</a> director Koshi Nakanishi, who confirmed that a new Resident Evil game is in the works. That's not too much of a surprise - big franchise gonna franchise - but still, it's nice to hear.  "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said, "but I found it. And to be honest it feels substantial."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We did not get more information than that, unfortunately. The quick and easy assumption to make is that this will be Resident Evil 9, or whatever the developers decide to call it. But Nakanishi stops short of saying this outright. Considering there are unconfirmed rumours that claim both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-0-remakes-are-rumoured-to-be-in-development-at-capcom">Resident Evil 0 and Resident Evil - Code: Veronica will be getting remakes</a>, I feel iffy about jumping to conclusions about exactly which Resi this heavyweight director will be lending his overseership to. It probably is number 9, which has seen its own leaks and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows-pops-up-online-along-with-ps5-versions-of-code-veronica-zero-and-resi-5">reportedly called Resident Evil 9: Revenant Shadows</a>. But still, no official confirmation of that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd83elIk_aI">Capcom Next broadcast</a>, Nakanishi reminisced about Resident Evil 7's shift away from action and back to horror.</p>
<p>"When we first started development [on Resi 7], Resident Evil was... well, if I'm being honest, as a brand we were off-track. The action element had been expanded and fans reacted much more negatively than expected. In the end an RE game has to be scary... the general consensus from fans of the series was that a Resident Evil game is one that should scare the hell out of you. That was the starting point for Resident Evil 7."</p>
<p>If Nakanishi is heading development of Resident Evil 9, my hope is that he continues to push the team back into the dark realm of horror. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> was interesting, but I found it much more shooty than expected, especially after the seventh game's hobbled houseboundness. Then again, I like my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> slow and creepy. I'd be happy if a Resi game came out with, like, three monsters in it. So long as it was dark and tense.</p>
<p>PC-loyal Resi fans desirous of the classics have seen some good news recently, now that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-from-1996-comes-back-to-pc-after-decades-of-gathering-flies">original 1996 Resident Evil is available to download on PC for the first time</a>. And ye olde Resi 2 and 3 are coming soon, according to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_2">placeholder pages</a> <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_3">at GOG</a>. No word on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-code-veronica">Resident Evil - Code: Veronica</a> though, which holds the distinguished honour of being the only Resident Evil game with my granny's name in the title. </p>

			<p>A new gameplay video for an upcoming Splinter Cell RTX Remix mod has been released, showing off path tracing.</p>
<p>While we wait for <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft's Splinter Cell Remake</a>, modder '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@skurtyyskirts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skurtyyskirts</a>' is working on an NVIDIA RTX remix mod path tracing mod for the original Splinter Cell. Last month, the modder released the first video showing off this WIP mod, and today we wanted to share a new gameplay video (<a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/videotrailer-news/heres-another-look-at-the-tom-clancys-splinter-cell-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/#more-181431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via</a> DSOGaming). As this mod is still in active development, there are some issues with culling, but it has to be said that the initial results look impressive. Check out the new WIP gameplay video below:</p>
<p><iframe title="Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell RTX - (WIP)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TL3xNtLiJQ8?start=163&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Initially released for the original Xbox in 2002 as a Metal Gear Solid killer, Splinter Cell featured amazing lighting effects at that time. As said, Ubisoft is <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-snowdrop-engine-linear-not-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now working on a remake</a> of the game, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-helmed-farcry-6-lead-game-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being spearheaded by Far Cry 6's Lead Game Designer</a>. The remake will offer a <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-rewritten-updated-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rewritten and updated story for a modern-day audience, according to Ubisoft</a>.</p>
<p>The Splinter Cell Remake is slated for a release on PC and consoles, but has yet to receive a release date.</p>
<p>We've included some information about the original Splinter Cell from the game's initial press release below:</p>
<p><em>You are Sam Fisher. A lone shadow-operative in a world where lost seconds can allow terrorist plans to become deadly reality. You operate in the heart of hostile territory. Sent to execute desperate missions, you're the last resort of your government. Should you be captured or killed, all knowledge of your existence will be denied. You are a Splinter Cell.</em></p>
<p><em>When two CIA agents mysteriously vanish in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, the NSA's secret sub agency, Third Echelon, deploys Sam Fisher-its most capable splinter cell operative-to recover them. Fisher soon uncovers a deeper conspiracy: a plot that threatens to destabilize the world order and spark nuclear conflict.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dark Souls 2 DLAA/DLSS Mod Shows Greatly Reduced Aliasing]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-2-dlaa-dlss-mod-shows-greatly-reduced-aliasing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dark-souls-2-dlaa-dlss-mod-shows-greatly-reduced-aliasing.916845/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-2-dlaa-dlss-mod-shows-greatly-reduced-aliasing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin Lighting Engine mod, originally published on Nexus <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-2mod-volumetric-fog-ambient-occlusion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in May 2023</a>, has aimed since its inception to improve the visuals of FromSoftware's game released in 2014. It started with volumetric fog, ground truth ambient occlusion (GTAO), new distant geometry and many more lights casting shadows, improved material rendering for metals/non-metals, and adaptive tessellation.</p>
<p>Over time, modder GanaBoy added more features, such as parallax occlusion mapping and PCSS (Percentage Closer Soft Shadows) shadow filtering. The most interesting addition, however, is NVIDIA DLAA/DLSS support. GanaBoy is still testing the upscaler, but he published two videos showing how much of an improvement DLAA and DLSS can bring to Dark Souls 2's visual, especially when it comes to reducing aliasing on grass.</p>
<p><iframe title="DLSS Grass Test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5zkTG5aDGNo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="DLAA Test 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_63hPFFLA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you're so impressed with the enhancements that you cannot wait for GanaBoy to upload the new mod version on Nexus, a beta release is available via the <a href="https://discord.gg/fBcZVW2Sb4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Discord of the Dark Souls 2 Lighting Engine mod</a>. While there is already a sharpening slider, the modder said it doesn't currently work, probably due to the lack of another library. As with any DLAA/DLSS mod, it requires a PC equipped with NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 20/30/40 Series graphics cards. That said, someone may reverse engineer support for AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution and/or Intel XeSS, which work cross-platform. It has happened before with several PC games.</p>
<p>Dark Souls 2 is considered to be the least successful game in FromSoftware's series, though it does have a sizable following despite its flaws. Following the third installment in Dark Souls, FromSoftware has moved on to create Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, and Elden Ring, the latter of which has broken all of the studio's previous records when it comes to critical and commercial reception.</p>

                <p>There are so many active Capcom franchises that it seems like a big deal whenever a new franchise is added to the lineup. Later this month, Capcom is dropping Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess on most of the major consoles and PC. But you don't have to wait long to play it, because the Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess demo is out right now. There's no limit on the playtime, so you can play it as often as you want. Capcom has also released a trailer for the demo, which you can see below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBbz12bhyE8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TBbz12bhyE8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game puts players in control of Soh, a warrior who is driven to protect a divine maiden, Yoshiro, and the village she lives in from evil. It's an action game with some real-time strategy and tower-defense elements. During the day, Soh has to prepare the villages' defenses and utilize his resources at hand. By night, the enemy creatures attack and not even injuries can stop Soh from his sworn duties. Through Soh, players can still direct the village's defenses even when severely wounded.</p><p>Additionally, Capcom announced a collaboration between Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess and Okami, the classic 2006 video game that put players in control of the Shinto sun goddess Amaterasu. Although Amaterasu doesn't appear in Path of the Goddess, Soh's costume is clearly inspired by her in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc89yTB1XDs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wc89yTB1XDs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Okami collaboration is running between now and July 17, and it features more than just special outfits. Music and weapons from Okami are also available. And as an added incentive to players, Capcom will release the Okami items as a free update for Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess if enough players complete the demo by the end of the Okami collaboration.</p><p>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess will hit PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC on July 19.</p>

            <p>"Should we bother with Summer Game Fest this year? Are there other shows better suited for our title? Should we do our own event?"</p>
<p>Every year, I see the same questions getting thrown my way when it comes to what used to be E3's spot in the calendar. What was once a singular event that brought every publisher, developer, journalist and gamer together to celebrate the industry and its latest and greatest has since morphed into a series of smaller events scattered about before, during and after the typical E3 scheduled week.</p>
<p>Opinions have always been mixed on the newer methods of announcement delivery with some liking its wider and longer lasting presence during June and others seeing it as messy and too thinly spread. Regardless of opinion though, there's little denying the impact these events have across the summer; gamers are watching in anticipation much like they used to with a conference from one of the platform holders at E3.</p>
<p>With so many options for publishers and developers in which to announce or show off their new and exciting title, where should they turn? Who is going to provide them with not just the most sets of eyes but more importantly an engaged audience? That has been and continues to be the million‚Äìdollar question.</p>
<blockquote><p>More games in a show sounds great to consumers, but it makes things especially tough from games businesses</p></blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, these events are about one thing: exposure. Whether that's with press going hands on, influencers reacting to shows and reveals or just general discussion over social media, the hope of each event is that it acts as a catalyst to generate attention. This summer was particularly busy with events big and small, so snatching that spotlight and standing out from the crowd has been no easy feat (much like it wasn't when E3 was still a thing). However, instead of a condensed few days, shows are now spread out across several weeks.</p>
<p>Comparing several June events, Fancensus analysed every featured game, measuring its overall PR and social flare score achieved up to 72 hours after each respective event. This score out of 100, combines a game's performance across around 3,000 websites, plus channels across YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and X. Everything was analysed, from front page placement on websites and video views to X interactions and YouTube engagement rate, weighing each outlet based on its impact on a title's campaign.</p>
<p>A score of 100 on a game, for example, would mean that essentially it dominated every single metric on all five channels (website, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and X) ‚Äì highly unlikely but not impossible with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 the only close candidate scoring in the 90s. Doing this not only allows for a fair comparison across hundreds of titles, but considers multiple outlets all key to raising their awareness with consumers.</p>

<p>For starters, looking at the shows overall, Xbox Games Showcase and Summer Game Fest have the highest sum total flare scores between all their featured titles. On paper that sounds great for both ‚Äì after all, they've scored well over double that of any other competing shows this summer so far. However, when you account for the total number of games featured in said shows, that statistic becomes less impressive for Summer Game Fest.</p>
<p>Last year's The Game Awards saw its number of featured titles increase by 50% year-on-year to over 60, with Summer Game Fest following suit with a similar count and increase. With that in mind, the average press and social flare score per game would wind up falling to just 8.7 out of 100, placing it well behind all three platform holder shows and the Ubisoft Forward. So while, as an event, it may have seen its games shine bright collectively, individually they would tend to struggle to grab the spotlight.</p>
<p>A survey of over 1,300 US and UK regular PC and console gamers conducted by Fancensus, would ask which gaming events they were aware of and watched or were interested in, with the feedback generally showing they were more aware and willing to watch platform holder streams from Nintendo, Xbox and PlayStation, aligning with the trend of content produced on websites and social media.</p>

<p>Not only that but of Geoff Keighley's three major events across the year, Summer Game Fest and Gamescom Opening Night Live ranked tenth and twelfth respectively, with just under 50% of those surveyed aware of the latter and half of those interested in watching. Clearly, consumer expectation for Keighley's shows is highest for The Game Awards, with little in the way of competition in December and the bigger announcements usually expected. However, while enthusiasm toward ONL and Summer Game Fest may not be as high for gamers when compared with other competing events, it's tough to deny that the shows still do big numbers for some of its featured titles.</p>
<p>All this tracks too with the data IGN revealed recently for the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/astro-bot-beats-doom-as-the-no1-wishlisted-game-of-the-summer-games-showcases">highest wishlisted games from any shows this June</a>, five of those featured in the Xbox Games Showcase, three from the Nintendo Direct, the bursting-with-creativity Astro Bot from the State of Play, and Assassin's Creed Shadows, which appeared in both the Xbox Games Showcase as well as Ubisoft Forward. Any games shown in shows outside the three platform holders it would seem didn't resonate as strongly with IGN visitors.</p>

<p>Breaking things down to the games themselves, it's clear that Xbox had a very strong showing, accounting for half those featured in the top ten when ranked by flare score. Not only that, it would also see 17 of its featured titles within the top fifty performers, the highest of any show and around 55% of all Xbox Games Showcase games.</p>
<p>The State of Play, meanwhile ‚Äì an event that back in May was met with a relatively lukewarm reception from gamers ‚Äì performed admirably too with ten of its 14 featured titles making the top fifty list.</p>
<p>As for Summer Game Fest, with such a large quantity of titles, 14 would find themselves scoring among the top fifty performers; not an amazing proportion of its 61 but still making some noticeable waves online. It's worth noting though, that of the four games from its show ranking 20 or higher, these included two games currently out (Street Fighter 6 and Valorant), the world premiere of LEGO Horizon Adventures, and Star Wars: Outlaws, whose tease performed lower than the gameplay reveal of the Ubisoft Forward several days later.</p>

<p>While more games in a show might sound great from a consumer standpoint, it often makes things especially tough from a business one as the quantity of competition is so much higher. It can also result in a case of there being too much to remember, evidenced in my conversations just days after the Summer Game Fest or Future Games Show where friends would struggle to name off more than two or three standouts. Compare that with June's Nintendo Direct or Xbox Games Showcase and suddenly they'd recite off game after game as if they were some sort of Broadway stage actor.</p>
<p>It sounds silly but sometimes you can have too much of a good thing. Of those surveyed by Fancensus who watched all or some of Summer Game Fest 2024, the top performing title from the show achieved less than a 50% recall rate with other big AAA titles seeing rates in the 30s, a sign perhaps that too many games can overwhelm.</p>

<figcaption>AAA games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 dominated consumer attention</figcaption>

<p>It's unsurprising but nearly half of the top fifty consisted of AAA titles, with a further 36% A‚Äìtier. That meant mid‚Äìtier and indie accounted for just 16% and 2% respectively. As a result, Future Games Show and PC Gaming Show ‚Äì two shows that tend to focus on smaller projects ‚Äì would see none of their feature games score among the top fifty titles overall.</p>
<p>It was clear from the shows that the platform holders were more focused on bigger titles, proof that their consoles have big things to look forward to, and as a result indie games felt like they fell by the wayside. It would be Keighley then that would deliver on the indie front, accounting for 24 of the show's 60 titles and even going so far as to open the show highlighting the success smaller studios have had in 2024.</p>

<p>And while its great these smaller releases would get their moment on such a large platform, looking at the noise created with press and social, flare scores for indie titles scored an average of five out of 100 versus the seven, eight and 11 of Nintendo, Xbox and PlayStation shows.</p>
<p>In fact, the Summer Game Fest average flare score was closer to Future Games Show and PC Gaming Show. It's a similar story with mid‚Äìtier titles as well; Summer Game Fest was sandwiched between the platform holder shows and the smaller PC Gaming Show and Future Games Show. Considering the expense of even a 30-second slot in Summer Game Fest it does raise the question: if you're a smaller publisher or developer, would you be better off utilising the smaller shows, potentially producing similar results?</p>
<blockquote><p>If you're a smaller publisher or developer, would you be better off utilising the smaller shows?</p></blockquote>
<p>Even the aided recall rate of Summer Game Fest titles for gamers who watched the show would reveal the best performing mid‚Äìtier or indie title as Killer Bean with 23% while indie titles in general would fall as low as 8%.</p>
<p>2024 has certainly been interesting for the 'unofficial E3' period. After the so‚Äìso State of Play in May and Keighley's expectation‚Äìlowering talk on a stream before Summer Game Fest, many expected a quieter June with smaller announcements and little in the way of surprises. What followed could be described as anything but, with some journalists even claiming some shows like the Xbox Game Showcase summoned feelings of old E3 again. It saw platform holders relying on themselves to reach their fans, shows like Future Games Show, PC Gaming Show and plenty more offer a stage for smaller studios and bigger companies hedge their bets between multiple.</p>
<p>The result has been interesting to watch unfold, showing how big publishers can yield strong results from simply doing their own thing, while indies and mid‚Äìtier titles hit their audience through cheaper shows. Summer Game Fest finds itself in a rather unique spot upping its quantity of titles but not necessarily their impact, whilst delivering quieter results for the smaller projects it set its focus to.</p>
<p>Next year will likely continue to see the same options available to publishers and developers, but perhaps the main takeaway here is that the biggest and loudest show with the most charismatic presenter may not be the one for you.</p>

Taking control of Aarik, you have to find a path through the mystery which has seen your father, the King, become bedbound and your mother, the Queen, disappear on her own quest to save the kingdom.</p>

<p>The debut title from Shatterproof Games, Aarik and The Ruined Kingdom uses a number of different mechanisms for its puzzles, including perspective shifting, time manipulation, and object control, allowing for the levels to offer different challenges, though none of them are too difficult to solve. That level simplicity feeds into what appears to be Shatterproof‚Äôs aim of creating a relaxing and cosy puzzle game that will entertain rather than tax your brain too much. That isn‚Äôt to say there aren‚Äôt some headscratchers thrown in, but you should be able to complete the game within a few hours.</p>


<p>The game will draw comparisons to others that have populated the genre, most notably the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/31/monument-valley-pc-panoramic-collection-release-date-12-july/">Monument Valley</a> games, but Aarik and The Ruined Kingdom has a whimsical charm of its own and moments of comedy interspersed throughout. While there is not much dialogue in the game, when it is present it nicely moves the story along and helps build the world just enough to allow you to fill in some of the blanks, but never all of them.</p>


<p>Aarik‚Äôs powers come from gems that are embedded in his father‚Äôs crown. None of the gems are present at the start of the game, and it is only through going through the levels that each gem is found, unlocking a new power for Aarik to use. The perspective shifting is there from the start. With this you change the angle from which you view the puzzle, and doing so can create paths that Aarik can walk along, or find objects that were previously hidden from view, like the hidden crowns dotted in every level. The first gem you get then allows Aarik to move objects via telekinesis to move objects that help create or open paths up. That is soon followed by the power to turn gears and wheels, then an ability to control robots to get their assistance to solve the more complex puzzles, and changing the course of time to rebuild ruins and shift the sands. Each of these powers compliments the other, with the latter puzzles using a mix of all of these elements to really create fun brain teasers.</p>
<p>You cannot fault the visual design of Aarik and The Ruined Kingdom. It looks lovely with very well thought out puzzles in a vibrantly colourful world. As you traverse the world you see the ruin that has engulfed it, yet there is always this sense of underlying hope that it can be rebuilt and saved. The music is well composed too, lending itself to the relaxing and cosy atmosphere that the game evokes.</p>

<p>While Aarik and The Ruined Kingdom is fun, it is not without some issues and gripes. One of those is how finicky it can be to place objects in the correct place. Even if you think you have everything lined up, you cannot always tell for certain. If you‚Äôre wrong the object will go back to where you originally picked it up from. Some feedback in these scenarios would be welcome, even if it is as basic as a click sound to indicate a connection has been made. There is also a puzzle where you need to move barrels out of the way physically to open a path, but there is no animation or prompt that indicates that at first. It was the only time in the game that Aarik had to physically walk into something to move it out of the way. Another bug was movement sounds playing when robots/objects under your control had seized moving.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Aarik and The Ruined Kingdom is a well crafted and great looking puzzle game that entertains for its 2-3 hour playtime. It is let down by various bugs, like sounds playing unprompted, and the issue of placing objects being more cumbersome than it needs to be. However, for less than ¬£7 it is worth a playthrough if you enjoy perspective shifting puzzle games.	</p></div>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear-hunger">Fear &amp; Hunger</a> games are pitch-black horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s quite unlike anything else I‚Äôve ever played, taking aspects of JRPG, survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure games</a> and distilling them into something I‚Äôd be tempted to call bleakly nihilistic if they didn‚Äôt display so much evident love for their craft. They also both start with a content warning listing ‚Äúextreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage‚Äù. You‚Äôll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It‚Äôs a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fearandhunger/mods/13">a mod</a> to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre‚Äôs massive schlong, however.</p>

<p>Either way, both titles are currently sitting at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Miro%20Haverinen">30% off on Steam</a>, or just over a tenner in brit-nuggets. You should consider them if you like any of the following: Berserk, Robert Chambers‚Äô The King In Yellow, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill">Silent Hill</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, Hellraiser, or that thing lots of FMV games and cinematic platformers used to do where you can get killed in lots of different, instant ways by making the wrong choices. They also remind me quite a bit of tabletop game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-obsession-with-a-singular-board-game-makes-me-fear-the-unchill-passage-of-time">Kingdom Death: Monster</a>. Sometimes, you don‚Äôt get killed, you just get your legs chopped off and have to quite literally crawl around for the rest of the game. Sometimes you lose both eyes. You can keep playing, if you want, you just won‚Äôt be able see anything.</p>
<p>The genesis for the first game, apparently, was as a sort of impromptu storytelling game that creator Miro Haverinen used to play with his uni classmates, where he‚Äôd pose them horrific moral choices in a dungeon setting, which became the first game's trap-and-trauma laden environments. As the name implies, you‚Äôll need to keep your party of characters well fed and sane during your travels. It's likely the only game in which you can give both a dog and a child opium to calm them down. The Twitter account 'Can you offer a pipe stuffed with opiates to the dog?' is much more popular in the timeline we deserve, imo.</p>
<p>You‚Äôll fail repeatedly as you play, losing run after run until you slowly start to acclimate yourself to obscure terrors, becoming fluent in the series‚Äô uniquely sadistic grammar, and picking up tricks to eke out just a little more progress. It sound utterly miserable, but I find this kind of exploration incredibly compelling. It‚Äôs got very little to do with the <em>points</em> of it all, just the experience, as you slowly form a mental map of these previously inscrutable places, right down to which barrels have the best drugs in them. If you‚Äôre looking for something somewhat similar but less intense, though, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/felvidek">Felvidek</a> is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/felvidek-review">singularly stark indie RPG</a> that probably won‚Äôt make you want to go for a wash afterward.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-3-1-lags-behind-dlss/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite some improvements, AMD FSR 3.1 still lags behind other upscalers in terms of image quality, such as NVIDIA DLSS 3.7 and Intel XeSS 1.3.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the DF Direct Weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a quick look at the new version of AMD's upscaler, highlighting how the update made to upscaling does bring some light improvements in terms of image clarity, but it still looks noticeable worse than NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS latest version, mostly due to these upscalers attempting to do anti-aliasing on moving pixels, which is quite noticeable in the Horizon Forbidden West still upon which their quick comparison is based. At the end of the day, the differences with version 2.2 are minimal, and the upscaler still shows its limitations with moving objects.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #169: Dragon's Dogma 2 Fixed? FSR 3.1 First Look, Dead Rising Remake" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQIBknDAj4g?start=120&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>These issues that have yet to be improved with AMD FSR 3.1 are also highlighted quite clearly in a new comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmark PC</a>. As such, the most notable change introduced by the new version of the upscaler is the update to the frame generation component, which can now be used with any upscaler or anti-aliasing solution. This is especially good for those with NVIDIA RTX 2000 and 3000 series cards who do not get access to NVIDIA's Frame Generation solution included in DLSS 3.0 onward.</p>

<p>AMD FSR 3.1 was announced back in March. You can learn more about the changes the new version has brought by going <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-3-1-announced-frame-generation-on-dlss-xess-upscaling-solutions-improved-image-quality-40-game-support/">here.</a></p>

            <p>
After putting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gary-bowser-gets-more-than-three-years-in-jail">Switch pirate Gary Bowser behind bars</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">targeting emulator software Yuzu</a>, Nintendo is continuing its fight against the lucrative modded console business with a pair of fresh lawsuits. 
</p>
<p>
James "Archbox" Williams, the main moderator behind r/SwitchPirates, a subreddit with nearly 200,000 members, faces paying potentially millions of dollars in fines after being named by Nintendo in a new case filed last week, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-modded-hardware-and-r-switchpirates-moderator-archbox-240701">TorrentFreak</a> reports.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's interest in Williams primarily seems to be as an operator of "several pirate shops" through which he offers "massive libraries of pirated Nintendo Switch games", Nintendo's legal filing alleges.

But Nintendo also claims Williams has used his position on the SwitchPirates reddit to encourage piracy and offer technical advice, violating DMCA terms and infringing on Nintendo's copyright.
</p>
<p>
"Defendant is well aware that his conduct is unlawful and infringes Nintendo's intellectual property rights," the company states. "Indeed, Defendant has bragged publicly that he is a 'pirate' who '[isn't] going to give Nintendo $50 for a game'."
</p>
<p>
A second, separate lawsuit takes aim at Modded Hardware - a group whose name rather speaks for itself. Run by Ryan "Hombrew Homie" Daly, Nintendo has had the group in its sights for several months. 
</p>
<p>
TorrentFreak reports that Nintendo asked Modded Hardware to stop selling modded hardware, to which Daly agreed earlier this year, but then didn't. Nintendo finally filed suit against Daly last week.
</p>
<p>
The filing notes that Modded Hardware sells mod chips, a memory card which unlocks the ability to play pirated games, mail-in modding services and fully modded consoles. Again, Nintendo could potentially win millions of dollars in fines.
</p>
<p>
In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jail-term-for-nintendo-pirate-gary-bowser-was-unique-opportunity-to-set-example-court-documents-reveal">Nintendo lawyers argued Gary Bowser should serve the maximum jail term of five years</a> for his role in Team Xecutor, a piracy group that Nintendo claimed had cost it "greater than $65m" of financial damage. Despite not being one of Team Xecutor's two founders - who are yet to be brought to trial - Bowser was ultimately given a 40-month prison sentence and fined $14.5m.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, Tropical Haze, the developer of open-source Switch emulator Yuzu, agreed to pay $2.4m in damages to Nintendo and cease all operations in response to a lawsuit which alleged the group had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-switch-emulator-creator-for-facilitating-piracy-at-a-colossal-scale">enabled piracy "at a colossal scale"</a>.

            <p>A UK employment tribunal has ordered Cloud Imperium Games to pay a former employee ¬£27,748 in compensation following a discrimination claim about its return-to-office policy.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cloud-imperium-games-discriminated-against-disabled-employee-with-return-to-office-policy">Game Developer</a>, senior programmer Paul Ah-Thion was dismissed in 2022 after his requests to permanently work from home to accommodate his disability were denied.</p>
<p>Ah-Thion previously worked in-office at its former Wilmslow location before Cloud Imperium mandated employees to work from home during the pandemic. In 2021, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cloud-imperium-to-open-manchester-studio">CIG opened its Manchester studio</a> ‚Äì which is now its UK headquarters ‚Äì and mandated staff to return to the office.</p>
<p>As found by the tribunal, Ah-Thion reportedly asked to continue working remotely rather than relocate to the Manchester studio, which was denied. He was then let go due to "performance issues related to his remote working setup."</p>
<p>The tribunal found that Cloud Imperium's "concern about the claimant's performance seemed rather retrospective in the sense that whilst the claimant was employed [Cloud Imperium] never formally investigated those concerns" and that it "failed to give any evidence to suggest why they could not monitor it successfully remotely whilst he was working from home."</p>
<p>"There is no evidence that working from home would have failed to achieve the respondent's legitimate aim of ensuring the acceptable performance of a senior gameplay programmer," the judgement further read.</p>
<p>"We find that [Cloud Imperium] has treated the claimant unfavourably because of something arising in consequence of his disability. [It has] been unable to show that dismissal was a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim."</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>has reached out to Cloud Imperium for comment.</p>

            <p>Capcom has announced the next (and long-rumoured) entry in the Resident Evil series is now in development.</p>
<p>The news was shared during Capcom's NEXT broadcast last night, in an oh so casual way. "We're making a new Resident Evil," said Resident Evil 7: Biohazard director Koshi Nakanishi, essentially confirming he will be helming development on the next game.</p>
<p>"It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7. But I found it, and to be honest it feels substantial."</p>

<p>Nakanishi was unable to share any further details on the next Resident Evil game during the broadcast, but said "I hope you're excited for the day I can".</p>
<p>Along with his work on Resident Evil 7, Nakanishi has previously served as lead designer on Resident Evil 5, as well as being director on both Mercenaries 3D and the first Resident Evil Revelations game.</p>
<p>There has long been speculation and hearsay regarding a Resident Evil 9 reveal of some description, but other than last night's brief tease from Nakanishi, Capcom has been playing its cards close to its chest. Nakanishi didn't even specify he was talking about Resident Evil 9, although it is fair to assume he was.</p>
<p>Other Resident Evil projects said to be in the pipeline include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-remakes-currently-in-development-leak-claims">remakes of both Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a>.</p> <div>

This particular game is currently slated to launch digitally across Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 19th September, with a physical release set to follow.</p>

            <p>When Edwin disappeared into the hot mists of Summer Games Fest we couldn't know he would return with a crazed look in his eye, raving about "phantasmagorical mulch" and insisting: "As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence." That's because he played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess</a>, the upcoming action strategy game about defending a maiden from colourful monsters and recruiting villagers to cleanse demonic defilement. Developer Capcom released a demo for the game yesterday, ahead of its July 19th release date. So now the rest of us can join Edwin in becoming entranced by the swirling colours of this sword-swinger.</p>

<p>The demo is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510710/KunitsuGami_Path_of_the_Goddess/">available on Steam</a>, and the developers say that if enough people play it (and gather enough of a certain type of collectible) they'll include some themed gear for your characters in the full release, namely costumes based on calligraphic wolf simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/okami">Okami</a>. They announced all this in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p7hiMS0Hct4?si=KT1RJMJQW9_4Al4c&amp;t=930">Capcom Next</a>, the studio's marketing broadcast that also covered some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-a-steam-release-date-also-confirmed-graphics">news about the Dead Rising remaster</a> and a confirmation that they are working on the next Resident Evil. They said nothing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</a>, and their silence on this issue continues to provoke <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">the howling laments of everyone ever</a>. </p>
<p>As for Kunitsu-Gami, it's being priced at ¬£40/$50. "It will take no less than 20 hours just to clear the story," said the game's producer producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi when <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-prices-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-affordably-but-it-has-the-volume-of-a-full-price-game-devs-say/">Automaton asked</a> how the price reflected the scope of the game. "Then, of course, there will also be missions and challenges to clear after completing the story, so I think the volume of the game is comparable to that of a full priced title.‚Äù</p>
<p>20 hours sounds grand. I'm downloading the demo as I type. Edwin described it as "unabashedly ornate" and concluded it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-was-the-best-game-i-played-at-summer-game-fest">the best game he played at Summer Game Fest</a>. That, plus all the sword swishing in the trailers, has me convinced enough to give it a bash. I love the way the katana seems to wound the air itself, creating a gorgeous kaleidoscopic ribbon as it flows through space. The enemy design of the Seethe (the creepy-beautiful demons you'll be fighting) is also quite something. So many hands! </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-reveal-why-some-games-run-better-on-ps5-despite-xbox-series-x-being-more-powerful<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It is widely accepted that Microsoft‚Äôs <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X</a> console is the most powerful ever made, so why do some games run better on Sony‚Äôs PlayStation 5? That‚Äôs a question finally answered by the tech experts at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a>.</p><p>Both Microsoft and Sony launched the next-generation of consoles at the same time, November 2020, and while the less powerful Xbox Series S obviously struggles on the performance front, the Xbox Series X is a tech monster; it's capable of 12 teraflops of GPU performance, whereas the PS5 is capable of 10.28 teraflops.</p><p>Xbox executives have said they wanted to avoid repeating the narrative established in the last generation, where the Xbox One was significantly underpowered compared to the PlayStation 4 resulting in a mismatch when it came to multiplatform game performance. And so, Microsoft went hard with the Xbox Series X, ensuring it could safely call it he "world's most powerful console‚Äù in marketing. </p><p>But now, as we approach each console‚Äôs fourth birthday, has that power difference born fruit in the video games we play? It turns out that some games run better on PS5 than Xbox Series X. But how can that be?</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-if-xbox-series-x-is-more-powerful-how-does-ps5-compete-so-closely" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry‚Äôs conversations with developers</a>, ‚Äúthe combination of a more efficient GPU compiler, lower-level APIs, and higher clock speeds allows PS5 to match or even exceed the outputs of Xbox Series X in some scenarios.‚Äù</p><p>One example of this at play is FromSoftware‚Äôs <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>, which runs faster on PS5 than on Xbox Series X. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-long-standing-tech-issues-have-been-ignored" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry‚Äôs analysis of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</a> shows a surprising frame-rate difference in favor of PS5, which is apparently the less capable machine.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But, as Digital Foundry notes, there remains value in the approach Microsoft took for Xbox Series X, which has a commonality with PC development that helps game makers. ‚ÄúAdditionally, there are situations where the Xbox ecosystem and feature set yields dividends,‚Äù Digital Foundry explains. ‚ÄúFor example, while Elden Ring may run faster on PS5, Sony's limited implementation of variable refresh rate support means that we'd much rather play the game on Xbox Series X ‚Äî it's just a smoother and more consistent experience.‚Äù</p><p>So, what happens next? Sony is heavily rumored to be ready to release a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-everything-we-know">PS5 Pro</a> later this year, with Microsoft heavily rumored to be ready to release an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-xbox-handheld-rumors-being-able-to-play-games-locally-is-really-important-ign-live-2024">Xbox handheld</a>. Digital Foundry expects the PS5 Pro to ‚Äúlean into the same strengths that made PS5 competitive and go beyond ‚Äî PSSR machine learning-based upscaling should act as an effective 'multiplier' of sorts on its increased GPU performance.‚Äù</p><p>And then? No doubt we‚Äôll have to do this all over again when Microsoft releases its next-gen Xbox and Sony releases the inevitable PS6.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Last week, those teases at Capcom dangled a remastered version of 2006 zombie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> gem <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-rising">Dead Rising</a> before the darting, entranced eyes of me specifically. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a>, presumably named so to differentiate it from the 2016 HD Remaster, now looks to be shambling ever closer to full remake territory if the new footage Capcom shared as part of yesterday‚Äôs NEXT showcase is anything to go by. Also, it‚Äôs coming to Steam! I‚Äôve checked with the rest of the treehouse, and this means it‚Äôs also confirmed for PC. Get in!</p>

<p>For the video haters among you (moving pictures truly are the devil‚Äôs work), here‚Äôs a quick comparison between what looks like the 2016 HD version, and the upcoming (19th September 2024) Deluxe version:</p>

<p>Please, please, save your applause. Oh, sure. Some might say my coverage is ‚Äúgiving Digital Foundry a run for their money‚Äù. But I do this for you, not for petty accolades.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the showcase, Director Ryosuke Murai sheds a bit more light on what exactly the ‚ÄúDeluxe Remaster‚Äù entails. It wouldn‚Äôt be an exaggeration, he says, to call it a remake, considering the amount of work that went into it. It‚Äôs a 4K/60 FPS job, with control tweaks like letting protag Frank move while aiming. I‚Äôm a bit less jazzed about the autosave feature, since the tension of having limited saves was one of the original‚Äôs main draws for me, but I‚Äôll hold out to see how it‚Äôs implemented. That said, I absolutely welcome promised improvements to hopefully stop the idiot escortable NPCs being idiots quite so often. Do check out the above showcase for more details on the new tech.</p>
<p>If you missed Dead Rising the first time around, our Matt Jarvis does a great job of explaining <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-dead-rising-is-getting-a-deluxe-remaster-ahead-of-its-20th-anniversary">why it was so great</a>. I like it a lot, too. So much, in fact, that I once spent an entire day grinding out one of the most infamously ridiculous Xbox achievements of all time. ‚ÄòZombie Genocider‚Äô had you kill 53,594 - the population of the town the game is set in - zombies in a single playthrough. In reality, this meant I was sat on a sofa with a tenners of shit hash and a homemade Lucozade bottle bong, mowing a car back and forth through zombo-infested underground tunnels, for roughly eight solid hours of my life. </p>
<p>I regret nothing, although I will not be repeating the experience when the new version <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2527390/Dead_Rising_Deluxe_Remaster/">releases on Steam</a>. Unless you all make it very clear in the comments that you'd very much read this sort of Gonzo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/every-monkey-game-on-itch">self-flagellation</a> games writing, in which case Graham might let me do it. Wait. What am I saying? No. Never again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-demo-out-now-okami-collaboration-announced/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The third game to be featured in CAPCOM's NEXT showcase beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-is-out-on-september-19-powered-by-re-engine-and-enhanced-in-many-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-is-official-director-it-was-difficult-to-figure-out-what-to-do-after-7-but-i-found-it-and-it-is-substantial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil 9</a> was Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess.</p>
<p>The action/strategy game based on a new IP is very close to its July 19 debut. The reception from fans has been lukewarm so far, and that's probably why CAPCOM has decided to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2842890/KunitsuGami_Path_of_the_Goddess__Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release a free demo</a> to allow players to try the game before purchasing. The demo of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess lets players check out some of the stages of the main game as many times as they like without a time limit.</p>
<p>CAPCOM has also added some extra spice to the demo with the Okami collaboration. Demo players across the globe are called to complete two missions. Should they succeed, all players would receive costumes based on Amaterasu and Waka from Okami, as well as unlocking a collab soundtrack for the full game.</p>
<p>Using a day/night cycle and creatively mixing several genres from action-adventure to real-time strategy to tower defense, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess aims to test players' strategic and real-time decision-making skills. During the day, they will explore the village, purifying the tainted villagers, assigning them different roles, and choosing where to place them to best protect the maiden Yoshiro. During the night, the sinister Seethe foes emerge to attack the mountain. Upgrade villager roles to gain more support and issue commands to villagers as you fight alongside them to defeat the Seethe and cleanse each village.</p>
<p>Players are free to reset upgrades and reassign them to other roles and can even upgrade protagonist Soh with new attacks and abilities to customize their strategies to achieve their goal of safeguarding Maiden Yoshiro and restoring peace to the villages of Mt. Kafuku.</p>

		<p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will launch across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on 19th September 2024, Capcom has confirmed with a new trailer that dives into all the improvements and changes being made.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIAiUWhxmrs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> is closer to a remake than a quick upscaling effort, as the game has been rebuilt within Capcom‚Äôs excellent RE Engine. On the latest generation consoles, the game will run with an ‚Äúup to‚Äù 4K resolution and at 60FPS, while also featuring updated character models for Franke West, all the psychopaths, NPCs like Brad, Jessie and Madonna, and all those zombies you‚Äôll be bashing about. You can really see the difference in the trailer above, with some dramatically overhauled lighting effects, West having a face that looks like it‚Äôs already been in a fight or seventeen, and plenty more.</p>
<p>Capcom also detailed further quality of life improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frank West now has the ability to move while aiming!</li>
<li>Aspiring photojournalists can customize action shots with filters to get the best glam shot of their favorite zombies!</li>
<li>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster now has auto-save functionality! Need a bathroom break? Don‚Äôt worry‚Ä¶manual saves are still available when you need a breather.</li>
<li>All NPC and survivor interactions are now fully voiced!</li>
<li>New and improved NPC behaviors!</li>
<li>Real-time lighting and shadow effects!</li>
<li>More intuitive and user-friendly controls!</li>
<li>New fine-tuned user interface!</li>
<li>Fully voice overs for nine languages (English, Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, French, Italian, German, Castilian Spanish, and Russian), and subtitles for fourteen (the aforementioned plus Korean, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Polish, and Arabic).</li>
</ul>
<p>Dead Rising was a classic from the early Xbox 360 days, using the then powerful new system to stuff a shopping mall with undead and have you clatter your way through them using all manner of ridiculous items as weapons. It introduced photojournalist Frank West as the protagonist, and gave you just 72 hours in-game to figure out the truth behind the outbreak ‚Äì this time limit was perhaps the most contentious part of the game, which Capcom dropped for the third and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/02/dead-rising-4-franks-big-package-review/">fourth</a> games in the series. It sounds like it‚Äôs back here in full force, though with auto-saves and other tweaks it should be easier to live with.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-is-official-director-it-was-difficult-to-figure-out-what-to-do-after-7-but-i-found-it-and-it-is-substantial/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-is-official-director-it-was-difficult-to-figure-out-what-to-do-after-7-but-i-found-it-and-it-is-substantial/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the CAPCOM NEXT Showcase, after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-is-out-on-september-19-powered-by-re-engine-and-enhanced-in-many-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster's pricing and key features</a>, the studio also dropped a little bomb about Resident Evil 9. Yes, the next mainline installment in the revered survival horror franchise is officially in development.</p>
<p>The announcement was tied to the showcase of Resident Evil 7, which is out now on Apple's iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and every iPad and Mac with the M1 chip or later. The main game is bundled with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Not A Hero story DLC</a>, starring franchise veteran Chris Redfield, while the optional Gold Edition upgrade allows fans to get all of the content from the other DLCs, including additional story content and game modes. The package also supports universal purchase and cross-progression, so Apple gamers can play across iPhone, iPad, and Mac and continue their save games at home or on the go. Resident Evil 7 Biohazard runs natively on Apple devices. This version also features newly optimized controls for iPhone and iPad, including an auto-fire option and fully touch-compatible menus.</p>
<p>The reason the announcement of Resident Evil 9 was tied to this Resident Evil 7 showcase is fairly straightforward: the new chapter in CAPCOM's IP is being led by Koshi Nakanishi, who directed the first game in the series to switch from third-person view to first-person view. Nakanishi said:</p>
<p><em>We're making a new Resident Evil. It was really difficult to figure out what to do after 7, but I found it, and to be honest, it feels substantial. I can't share any details just yet, but I hope you're excited for the day that I can.</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, speculation will now run rampant as to when exactly CAPCOM will finally show Resident Evil 9. A good option could be the upcoming Tokyo Game Show, scheduled to take place at the usual venue of Makuhari Messe between September 26 and 29. Of course, it's also possible the game will be reserved for later shows, such as The Game Awards.</p>
<p>However, that would clash with rumors from CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem that the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may be targeting early 2025</a> for the launch of Resident Evil 9. If that's the case, then TGS seems the only real option. Dusk Golem also previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-monster-hunter-wilds-rumored-to-be-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the game would go open world, just like Monster Hunter Wilds, and he turned out to be right about CAPCOM's other tentpole franchise.</p>
<p>Are you excited about getting a new Resident Evil? Who do you want to see as protagonists?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-is-out-on-september-19-powered-by-re-engine-and-enhanced-in-many-ways/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-is-out-on-september-19-powered-by-re-engine-and-enhanced-in-many-ways/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the CAPCOM Next Showcase, the Japanese studio revealed that Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is slated to launch on September 19 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2527390/Dead_Rising_Deluxe_Remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, with pre-orders now open on all platforms.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-surprise-announcement-2024-release-and-controversial-frank-west-redesign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teaser trailer</a>, we immediately noticed the noticeable visual upgrade. Indeed, CAPCOM has now confirmed the game is powered by RE Engine, whereas the original ran on the old MT Framework.</p>
<p>The game is now targeting 4K resolution and 60 FPS frame rate, and much higher quality character models have been made for Frank West, the unhinged Psychopaths, NPCs like Brad, Jessie, Isabela, Madonna, the survivors of the outbreak, and the seemingly endless waves of zombies. In the original game, CAPCOM focused on quantity over quality to pack a large number of zombies in the mall, but with the power of new hardware, they have been able to greatly improve the look of individual zombies, too. Real-time lighting and shadow effects have been introduced as well, which means the locations take a different look depending on the time of day.</p>
<p>The improvements of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster go well beyond the visuals. The user interface (UI) has been refined, the controls have been made more accessible and use-friendly, the NPC behaviors have been expanded, and all NPC and survivor interactions have been fully voiced. Moreover, there's now auto-saving functionality (a popular demand from fans) on top of manual saving.</p>
<p>Combat-wise, the biggest change is that protagonist Frank West can now move while aiming, bringing the feel more in line with modern games. The language support is much bigger, too, as there are full voiceovers in nine different languages (English, Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, French, Italian, German, Castilian Spanish, and Russian), plus subtitles for 14 languages (the aforementioned nine plus Korean, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Polish, and Arabic. Lastly, action shots with Frank's camera can now be customized with various filters to get the best possible shots.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ed-kfsJnhdU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is priced at $49.99, though there's a Digital Deluxe Edition priced at $59.99 that adds 17 costumes for Frank and 17 BGM tracks playable in the mall. All pre-orders will include the following three costumes and BGMs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costume: Frank West 2006 (Dead Rising); BGM: "Dreams of Yore (Mall Music 2 arranged)"</li>
<li>Costume: Chuck Greene (Dead Rising 2); BGM: "Super Shopper" (Dead Rising 2)</li>
<li>Costume: Willamette Parkview Mall Bee (Dead Rising); BGM: "Happy Flight! (Mall Music 6 arranged)"</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Pikachu in Pok√©mon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pok√©mon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Pikachu is not a confirmed Pok√©mon that gets a ‚Äúpermaboost‚Äù (meaning that it‚Äôs a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pok√©mon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pok√©mon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pok√©mon rates.</p>
<h3 id="thj8sX"><strong>Where can I find a list of available shiny Pok√©mon?</strong></h3>
<p id="WRj9xa">LeekDuck keeps <a href="https://leekduck.com/shiny/">a list of currently available shiny Pok√©mon</a>. It‚Äôs a helpful visual guide that illustrates what all of the existing shiny Pok√©mon look like.</p>
