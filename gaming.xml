			<p>Four years after the last Hyrule Warriors release, Omega Force, the studio behind Age of Calamity within Koei Tecmo, is set to release Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 later this week on November 6, 2025.</p>



<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment sets players in the Imprisoning War, the events of which would lead to the story that unfolds in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Princess Zelda fights alongside King Rauru and the legendary Sages, each with unique fighting styles that players can utilize in this musou-style game.</p>



<p>The latest trailer showcases a bit more gameplay ahead of launch, like the kinds of combination attacks you can perform with other characters to decimate waves of enemies. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>When Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity came out in 2020 on the Nintendo Switch, Wccftech's reviewer noted that one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-not-exactly-next-gen/">key drawbacks to the game was its poor framerate and performance</a>, writing, "<em>I genuinely had a minute where I was positive that the game's framerate had dropped into the single digits for a lengthy period of time. Playing co-op with two characters which both have heavy effects on their attacks is a recipe for a low framerate, and a low number of enemies being drawn on screen. It's a shame as co-op is still the best way to play any Warriors game, but the framerate sacrifice and loss of screen real-estate can make it feel more like a hassle than a fun way to play with friends.</em>"</p>



<p>Even though the game was able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-3-million-copies/">sell over 3 million copies before the end of the year</a>, setting a new record for the Warriors series, its performance issues continued to be a refrain that harmed players' perception of the game.</p>



<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, has the chance to shirk the bad performance narrative if it's able to launch mostly issue-free thanks to the power of the Switch 2 hardware. Of course, it's naive to think any major game will launch completely without bugs, but hopefully we won't see the kinds of major performance issues that held back Age of Calamity.</p>

Originally, plans seemed to call for it to debut in theaters before Zootopia 2, which launches on November 26.</p>



<p>In addition to its theatrical showing, the outlet adds that it should appear online beforehand.</p>



<p>“The trailer will drop online before November 21st, and then make its theatrical debut with Wicked For Good,” they said. “That releases a week before Zootopia 2. It could still play before Zootopia 2, but that won’t be its official cinema debut.”</p>

Movie from 2023. The sequel will see Chris Pratt return as Mario, along with Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Kamek.</p>



<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is scheduled to release in theaters on April 3, 2026. Its release will mark exactly three years to the day of the original’s launch.</p>

      </div>
<p>Klaitz said there is also a case to be made for making GTA 6 priced at a level where it can be "more accessible," but if it is $100, that would make sense to him.</p><p>"I would also like to see it made more accessible to more fans so I get that side of the argument too to make it affordable for folks. That's cool too. Maybe there's like a way to split the difference, but I share the sentiment that this game warrants that price tag. Yeah, I get that," he said.</p><p>Sales data for video games shows that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">people are ready and willing to pay $80 or more for new games</a>, but it's still anyone's guess as to the price for GTA 6. Other experts believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-one-wants-a-100-gta-6-analysts-say/1100-6535494/" data-ref-id="1100-6535494">$70 is the right price. </a>At least one developer maintains that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/at-least-one-dev-hopes-gta-6-is-100/1100-6535457/" data-ref-id="1100-6535457">GTA 6 "deserves" to be $100</a> due to the size and scope of the project. Some have said the game does not need to be $100 because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">the game's expected online mode could be the real money-maker</a>.</p><p>The discussion around a possible $100 price for GTA 6 stems back to researcher Matthew Ball, who said in a memo in January 2025 that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">"there is hope"</a> from people in gaming that GTA 6 could be priced between $80 and $100. He pointed out that, adjusted for inflation, GTA 4 was priced at $90 and GTA 5 was $83. Things like movie tickets, rent, subscription services like Spotify and Netflix, gas, groceries, and numerous other items have gone up in price while video games have remained at "record lows," Ball said. His own personal prediction is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">GTA 6 will be priced at $70.</a></p><p>Also in the interview, Klaitz said he would like to see a future GTA game take place outside America and possibly go somewhere like Dubai. "You could be in like a big city with huge skyscrapers but then you’re out in the desert one minute later. GTA: Dubai would give you a lot of fun environments and scenarios to play with and build a game on," he said, adding that other options could be the North Pole or Greenland.</p><p>Klaitz also talked about the possibility of a GTA TV series, saying it would be "really cool to try to pull off," adding that he would personally like to see it be a live-action show as opposed to animation.</p><p>"It would be tough to translate because it's that sandbox-type game and people can do whatever they want, wherever they want, whenever they want. It's hard to sort of refocus that into a straight narrative. But it would be fun to try," he said.</p><p>GTA 6 launches in May 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

The upcoming Smugglers Run update may be the first clear step in that direction, combining storytelling, gaming technology, and theme park interactivity in ways that blur the line between real and virtual worlds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">Halo: Campaign Evolved,</a> which confirmed that the longtime Xbox-exclusive series would be coming to PlayStation, GameStop posted a lengthy statement about it being the end of the console wars. The White House, of all entities, responded with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-console-wars-over-halo-on-ps-white-house-trump-ai-spartan-armor/">AI-generated photo of Donald Trump in Spartan armor,</a> as if to depict him as the protagonist in Halo, Master Chief. Shortly after that, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) used more Halo imagery <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">to promote its own political agenda</a>, and has even followed it up with a <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1983604918239031569">similar post co-opting Lord of the Rings</a>. </p>



<p>And the DHS has made it clear that it will not stop there, which we know thanks to a report from <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261">independent journalist Alyssa Mercante</a>, who obtained a statement from the DHS after inquiring about its use of Halo imagery. At the time of her inquiry, the Lord of the Rings post had not been made, though it would go out shortly after this statement was delivered: </p>



<p>"<em>We will reach people where they are with content they can relate to and understand, whether that be Halo, Pokémon, Lord of The Rings, or any other medium. DHS remains laser focused on bringing awareness to the flood of crime that criminal illegal aliens have inflicted on our country. We aren’t slowing down. - DHS SPOX</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Microsoft has yet to make an official comment on the DHS using Halo to promote its own political agenda, nor has Amazon, which currently holds the rights to The Lord of the Rings, made a statement regarding whether the use of these images was approved. </p>



<p>Both Amazon and Microsoft, if they were so inclined, could have the images taken down, and while the lack of any statement doesn't explicitly confirm they agree with the posts in question and how they are being used, not saying anything at the very least admits that neither party will stop the DHS from continuing to use franchises like Halo and The Lord of the Rings in the future.</p>



<p>Individual Halo creators have made statements, however, with Marcus Lehto, a co-creator of Halo and the lead designer of the character Master Chief, told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/halo-ice-developers-react">Game File</a> that "<em>It really makes me sick seeing Halo co-opted like this</em>."</p>



<p>Jaime Griesemer, a lead designer of the original Halo games at Bungie, added, "<em>Halo is a cultural icon and like anything with cultural capital, it is going to be used by politicians and brands and anyone else looking for relevancy</em>. <em>Usually, I take it as a compliment to Halo’s continuing legacy</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Using Halo imagery in a call to ‘destroy’ people because of their immigration status goes way too far, and ought to offend every Halo fan, regardless of political orientation</em>. <em>I personally find it despicable. The Flood are evil space zombie parasites and are not an allegory to any group of people.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tga-game-awards-goty-puzzle-mimesis-poe-2000640780</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-game-awards-needs-a-puzzle-category.1342156/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Why is the old<em> Path of Exile</em> more popular than the sequel right now? How does co-op horror game Mimesis copy teammates’ voices? And what’s the real difference between a remake and remaster these days? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Digital Foundry has a new retro gaming podcast. It’s very good and you should <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqtLH0MOkgI">go check it out</a>.</p> <h2>Where are all the puzzle award categories for games?</h2> <p>It’s a question bubbled up across my feed <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edmondtran.bsky.social/post/3m4pq7uz5yk2m">over the weekend</a>. The Game Awards has genre shout-outs for role-playing games, action games, and even family games, whatever that means (it’s usually shorthand for whatever Nintendo put out that year). But other popular genres like horror and even shooters don’t get any special consideration. With puzzle games, that short shrift feels especially acute, however.</p>

 <p>That’s because there are lots of great puzzle games lately that just don’t usually have a shot of winning Best Game or the indie categories they’re otherwise most often represented in, like “Games for Impact.” A puzzle category in 2025 would be full of strong contenders, including Blue Prince, <em>The Roottress are Dead</em>, and the recently launched <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-fantasy-kingdom-seance-blake-manor-dispatch-2000640533"><em>The Séance of Blake Manor</em></a>.</p>

 <p>Even Double Fine’s excellent <em>Keeper</em> might be more likely to get an honorary mention with a best puzzle category than awkwardly shoving it into best indie game (that happens to be published by the largest game publisher in the world).</p> <h2>Fans discuss whether to boycott <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> dev’s next game after layoffs</h2> <p>“Hard to support devs when they can no longer see a cent from a game,” wrote one user on the Steam discussion page for Possessor(s), <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/as-players-debate-whether-to-purchase-possessor-s-after-heart-machine-lays-off-staff-a-week-before-launch-its-creators-and-publisher-respond-as-a-developer-who-is-slated-for-lay-off-please-buy-this-game/"><em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a>. Heart Machine has undergone multiple rounds of layoffs over the last year and put its Early Access action-RPG <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> on ice. But publisher Devolver Digital said laid off staff are still eligible for revenue sharing from the game’s sales, and “As a developer who is slated for lay off—PLEASE BUY THIS GAME,” former narrative director Tyler Hutchinson told Steam players.</p>

 <p>This same issue has come up recently with news of <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">alleged union busting at Rockstar Games</a>. Some fans have immediately called for a boycott of <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, despite no indication from any of the fired developers that that’s what they want to happen in response. Consumers can choose to spend their money however they want, but it’s usually good to check with the people you’re trying to support before launching a boycott in their name.</p>

 <h2>Remasters sell, but remakes sell better</h2> <p>That’s according to new research from Ampere Analysis as reported <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/consumers-spend-twice-as-much-on-video-game-remakes-than-remasters-according-to-research/">by<em> VGC</em></a>. The data firm counted 15 remakes and 27 remasters released between January 2024 and September 2025. It found that remakes generated 2.2 times the revenue of remasters, despite only being released half as often. Of course, the Ampere also counted games like <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> as, well, a remaster, even though it certainly veers more into the territory of a remake.</p>

 <h2><em>Peak</em> is getting a new Kashyyyk biome</h2>  <p>It’s called Roots. It’s full oe redwood trees. And it seems like there will be lots of spiders.</p> <h2><em>Mimesis</em> is a new co-op horror game that copies your voice</h2> <p>That’s one of the ways its enemies try to trick players into thinking they’re on the same team. It’s the latest crew-like to quietly have a big week on Steam after arriving in Early Access on October 27.</p>

 <p>“It’s pretty much a <em>Lethal Company</em> clone but with an LLM mimic feature that actually tries to make sense out of the voice clips it gets per session,” is how one user described it. There’s no generative-AI disclosure on Steam page so it’s unclear how the whole thing works.</p> <h2>The original <em>Path of Exile</em> has exploded on Steam again thanks to a new update</h2> <p>Patch 3.27 is called Keepers of the Flame and arrived on November 1. The action-RPG hit over 180,000 concurrents on Steam over the weekend after it went live. <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3869068">The massive update</a> focuses on an invasion of Breach Monster and includes tons of changes to skills, characters, and everything else in the game for what is essentially it’s next big season.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/stellar-blade-shift-up-crab-hand-small-penis-hateful-expression-apology-nikke-2000640487">The small penis pinching controversy, explained</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-race-polymarket-clair-obscur-2000640468">Nobody thinks<em> Silksong</em> has a chance at GOTY&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-piracy-lawsuit-streamer-2000640438">Switch streamer owes Nintendo $17,500 after trying to troll them</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p><span>Ever since choice-based games moved away from dialogue options in which you see exactly what your character will say before they say it in favor of little blurbs that try to sum up the general vibe of what you’re going to say or do before you watch it unfold on-screen, there’s been a loss of clarity between what we think we’re about to say and what we actually end up doing in video games. Part of me thinks this is just the consequence of a more cinematic approach to choice-based games, but poorly communicating what a player will do when they make a decision is a game design issue, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-1-2-review-aaron-paul-critical-role-2000639678"><i><span>Dispatch</span></i></a><span>, the first project from AdHoc Studio, made up of several ex-Telltale developers, is one of the latest games to fall victim to this incongruity between what the screen says your characters will do and what actually ends up happening after you choose it.</span></p> <p><span>Studios have found different ways to circumvent this danger. BioWare uses emotive icons to communicate an emotional intent with different options, or has even started adding small pop-up windows to lay out exactly what you’re going to do alongside your dialogue option. However, games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i></a> <span>have the advantage of pausing dialogue to let players consider their actions before moving forward. </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>, like many of the old Telltale games, including </span><i><span>The Walking Dead </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Tales from the Borderlands, </span></i><span>has timed dialogue choices to create a sense of urgency and keep a scene flowing. That has its advantages, but it also means you can’t include a bunch of clarifying pop-ups like other games might because players won’t have time to read them all thoroughly. That said, you can also just write dialogue options that are straightforward, rather than obfuscating what you’re actually going to do. Minor spoilers for </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s third</span> <span>episode follow:</span></p>

  <p><span>In episode three, protagonist Robert Robertson III is gathering his crew of ex-villain dispatchees to let them know that, by the end of their shift, at least one of them will be off the team and in the unemployment line. Exactly who that ends up being is the final decision of the episode, but before you make any such call, the group gathers in a meeting room, and Golem, a sentient pile of mud and dirt, knocks Robert to the floor as he enters the room. The player is given two options here: kick him out, or “give him the chair.” That could be interpreted as you offering him a chair to sit down on, but if you choose that option, that’s not what happens. Instead, Robert throws the chair at Golem, which lodges in his shoulder. Robert gives him a very apt talking-to about being aware of his surroundings, but the violence to get there is not clearly communicated in the options you’re given. It makes for a funny streaming moment, at least, but given Telltale’s history with these kinds of ambiguous dialogue options, folks aren’t thrilled to see these interactions return in </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>.</span></p>         <p><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>is halfway through its eight-episode run, and while I’m enjoying parts of it, I have been feeling a bit railroaded by its decisions thus far. I’m curious to see just how much impact those choices can make by the time the game ends later this month, but for now, it’s mostly just felt like I’ve been on the ride.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Monolith's classic survival horror game&nbsp;<em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>has been delisted from digital storefronts, and no reason has been given by the publisher as to why this has happened.</p>

<p>As spotted by Wario64 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3m4iwmggyjz2s" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on Bluesky</a>,&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>was taken down from Steam and the Xbox storefront on Halloween. In case you're wondering, it's not available via GOG either, having not been added to that platform's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">excellent Preservation Program</a> yet.</p>

<p>Sega hasn't given any kind of official statement regarding the reason for the game's delisting, and since Monolith was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">shuttered by parent company Warner Bros</a> back in February this year, the developer isn't available to comment on the situation either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/condemned-criminal-origins-delisted-subway.jpg?itok=6ysfC0Qa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/condemned-criminal-origins-delisted-subway.jpg?itok=rRyYlHcW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>is no longer available on Steam or Xbox.</figcaption></figure><p>Released back in 2005,&nbsp;<em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>is a first-person survival horror game in which you play as Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent who's looking into a spate of serial killings, as well as the homeless population of his city suddenly becoming aggressive and violent.</p>

<p>The game features a mix of tense action-horror combat and exploration, detective mechanics, and mild survival elements. It's a real classic, although I suppose we now have to describe it as a "lost" classic, since it's not available for purchase anymore.</p>

<p>It's possible, of course, that Sega is gearing up to announce a remaster of the game, perhaps alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease" rel="nofollow">remaster</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-shares-update-on-system-shock-remake-release" rel="nofollow">remake</a> connoisseurs Nightdive. That could just be wishful thinking on my part, though; it's equally possible that the game has disappeared for some arcane rights-related reason.</p>

<p><em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>was followed up by a sequel,&nbsp;<em>Condemned 2: Bloodshot</em>, which, unlike its predecessor, was ported to the PlayStation 3 as well as releasing for the Xbox 360. This one, however, never appeared on PC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/butchers-creek-condemned-delisting.jpg?itok=dLiKytsC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/butchers-creek-condemned-delisting.jpg?itok=m7wJQi3y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games like&nbsp;<em>Butcher's Creek&nbsp;</em>are carrying the&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>torch.</figcaption></figure><p>Luckily, developers like&nbsp;<em>Dusk</em>'s David Szymanski are here to carry the torch, with titles like January's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512560/Butchers_Creek/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Butcher's Creek</a>&nbsp;</em>attempting to pay homage to&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>through similar tense first-person survival horror gameplay.</p>

<p>For the time being, sadly, it looks like you'll have to fall back on your physical copy of&nbsp;<em>Condemned: Criminal Origins&nbsp;</em>on Xbox 360 if you want to play it. Hopefully, a remaster or remake is announced soon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mac-mini-rival-running-windows-hits-40-off-christmas-showed-up-early-on-amazon-2000640785</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s Mac Mini gets all the attention for compact computing but plenty of people need powerful Windows machines that don’t take up half a desk. Developers running Windows-only software, small business owners managing Microsoft ecosystems, content creators working with Adobe suites, and anyone tired of bulky tower PCs all face the same challenge: <strong>serious processing power in a tiny package that runs Windows natively</strong>.</p>
<p>The GMKtec M2 Pro S delivers exactly that: an Intel Core i7-1185G7 processor, 32GB RAM, and triple 4K display support, in a case smaller than most hardcover books. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5306/"> has slashed this mini PC from $639 to $409, placing legitimate desktop-class performance within reach at a price</a> that makes sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5306/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tiger Lake Performance in a Desktop Form Factor</h2>
<p>Intel’s Tiger Lake is its 11th generation of Core i7 mobile chips but GMKtec adapted <strong>the Core i7-1185G7 chip for use in desktop mini PCs with great results</strong>. This quad-core chip runs at a base frequency of 3.0 GHz and turbos up to 4.8 GHz on single-core workloads with all four cores sustaining 4.3 GHz under full load. Those frequencies matter: They’re a determinant of how snappy your applications respond, how well your video-editing software scrubs through timelines, and how many browser tabs you can have open before things start crawling. Eight threads through Hyper-Threading technology allow the processor to juggle multiple tasks simultaneously.</p>



<p>It’s handled by the Intel Iris Xe Graphics with 96 execution units that deliver performance well above older integrated graphics and give even some entry-level dedicated GPUs a run for their money. That matters from smooth <strong>desktop animations to hardware-accelerated video encoding, plus casual gaming</strong> and the ability to run design software without throwing hundreds of dollars at a separate graphics card</p>
<p>The 32GB of dual-channel DDR4 RAM comes properly configured from the factory, and gives both the CPU and GPU maximum memory bandwidth for the best performance. Dual-channel operation essentially doubles the speed at which data flows between RAM and processor compared to single-channel configurations, eliminating a common bottleneck that cripples many budget systems. The 1TB NVMe SSD connects via PCIe 3.0, delivering read speeds around 3,500 MB/s that make your entire system feel instantaneous compared to old SATA drives or mechanical hard drives.</p>



<p>The triple display capability transforms this mini PC into a serious multitasking powerhouse: <strong>Two HDMI 2.0 ports</strong> each output 4K resolution at 60Hz, while the <strong>USB-C port with DisplayPort</strong> alt mode handles the third 4K display at 60Hz. <strong>Running three 4K monitors simultaneously</strong> gives you over 24 million pixels of workspace, letting traders monitor multiple markets, developers keep code on one screen with documentation and testing on the others, or video editors spread their timeline across displays. The <strong>60Hz refresh rate</strong> ensures smooth motion and responsive cursor movement.</p>
<p>The GMKtec mini PC now costs $409, instead of $639, which makes it far cheaper than many standalone processors.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-dual-14-laptop-screen-extender-goes-for-peanuts-amazon-clears-out-stock-before-black-friday-2000640775</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-dual-14%E2%80%B3-laptop-screen-extender-goes-for-peanuts-amazon-clears-out-stock-before-black-friday.1342123/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Working on a single laptop screen is like trying to prepare a five-course meal in a studio apartment kitchen: constant minimizing of windows, lost tracking of tabs, and clicking back and forth between applications until your wrist hurts from all the mouse movement. There’s a great laptop screen extender on sale at Amazon that solves this by adding two full 14-inch displays that clip right onto your laptop, instantly creating a triple-screen setup: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5305/">Amazon has dropped it from $239 to $189 which makes this the cheapest route into serious screen real estate</a> without buying separate monitors and dealing with all that cabling.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5305/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Display Quality in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>Each <strong>14-inch screen delivers full HD 1080P resolution through IPS panel technology</strong>&nbsp;which means you get consistent colors and clear text from almost any viewing angle. That’s where IPS panels make all the difference; they avoid that annoying color shift and brightness drop you get from cheaper TN screens just from tilting your head a little. The 1920×1080 resolution gives you enough pixel density to keep text sharp and images detailed without having that fuzzy look budget monitors often suffer from. <strong>Both displays boast blue light filtering technology</strong> that reduces eye strain during long work sessions. That means it cuts the harsh blue wavelengths that mess with your sleep cycle and tire your eyes. The <strong>anti-glare coating scatters ambient light</strong> instead of reflecting it straight back at you so you can actually see what’s on screen even when sitting near windows or under office lighting.</p>
<p>Built-in speakers mean you get audio from the extended displays without needing separate speakers or relying on your laptop’s often mediocre sound system. At just <strong>0.24 inches thick, these screens fold flat for transport</strong> and barely add bulk to your laptop bag.</p>



<p>The connectivity covers all the bases <strong>with two USB Type-C ports and one HDMI to USB-C port</strong>, which gives you flexibility in how you connect depending on what your laptop offers. Plug and play means exactly that-no driver downloads, no software installations, just connect the cables and your operating system immediately recognizes the extra displays. You can run both screens in extended mode to genuinely expand your workspace or switch into mirror mode for presentations where you want everyone seeing the same content. <strong>The triple-screen configuration legitimately increases your visible workspace by 200%</strong>, and lets you keep email open on one screen, your primary work on the laptop display and reference materials or chat windows on the third screen.</p>
<p>This extender <strong>works with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems</strong> and supports game consoles like PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch to extend your game into multiple displays.</p>



<p>Studies regularly demonstrate that using a <strong>dual monitor setup increases productivity 20-42% over using a single screen</strong> and the gains are even higher when adding a third screen. This gain in productivity is realized by reduced window switching, better visibility for information, and the ability to retain tools, references, and communications visible all at once.</p>
<p>At $189, this extender is less than the cost of buying even one decent standalone portable monitor, yet you get two screens plus mounting hardware and all the necessary cables.</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021.

The crossover starts harmless enough. But then, things go awry for the Fortnite clan--especially the cute-looking banana.</p><p dir="ltr">Peely slips trying to run away from the Simpsons, who pull out weapons to get the Fortnite characters to leave their couch. That misstep leads to a terrible fate for poor Peely.

The battle-royale game almost hit 2.7 million concurrent players, per <a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count" rel="nofollow ">Fortnite.gg</a>.

            <p>The Simpsons has a long running couch gag bit, which plays out during the show's title sequence. Sometimes this sees America's yellow cartoon family taking part in a group dance or being abducted by aliens.  There are also times when the fivesome are surprised by some unexpected visitors already plopped down in front of the TV, leaving Homer and co with nowhere to park their own rears. </p>
<p>And, that is exactly what has happened in the latest episode of The Simpsons, this time with familiar faces from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> taking a seat at 742 Evergreen Terrace.</p>

<p>During the opening sequence of The Simpsons' season 37 episode 5 - known as Bad Boys... For Life? - Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie all arrive at home to find the likes of Fishstick there. Not a family to take this intrusion lightly, the Simpsons proceed to draw some weapons on the Fortnite lot and, errrr… let Peely know who is boss.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time The Simpsons has given a nod to video games. Last year, during season 35 (I still can't quite believe how long this show has been going for), we got a Mario Kart parody, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-simpsons-mario-kart-parody-is-the-closest-weve-got-to-a-hit-run-sequel">complete with a moustachiod Lisa and a Bowser-esque Nelson</a>.</p>
<p>As for the here and now, this opening is a timely addition to the show's lineup, with Fortnite itself hosting a The Simpsons season.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is it fair to call this the Big One? Of all the very many nerd conventions around the world, New York Comic Con certainly has claim to be one of the most defining events in the calendar. So of course&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>&nbsp;ensured Minerablu’s excellent team of photographers were at the event, capturing the best cosplay that appeared on the show floor.</p> <p>As you might imagine, New York Comic Con attracts a host of big-name actors and creators, with 2025 seeing the likes of Hollywood stars like James McAvoy, Elliot Page, Martin Sheen and Ming-Na Wen, alongside writers George R.R. Martin and Joe Hill, voice actors Laura Bailey and Ashley Johnson, and all-time heroes like Ernie Hudson, Seth Green and Peter Weller. But we’re not here for autographs; we’re after the most impressive cosplay to walk through the exhibition hall doors. And as ever, we have a mighty-fine selection.</p>

 <p>More unusual costumes include a spot-on Bad Bunny, a Supergirl/Sabrina Carpenter crossover, and—er—quite the Jeff Goldblum. There’s also the finest Predator I’ve ever seen, and what I hope will become a permanent fixture of these galleries:&nbsp;<em>Demon Hunters</em>‘ Derpy.</p> <p>We’ll have a video of the event soon, but meanwhile click on to enjoy the pics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most people just want a laptop that works without drama or over-engineering. Lenovo’s <em>IdeaPad</em> line is specifically designed with all the everyday scenarios in mind and peel away the extraneous gaming trim to focus on practical computing that normal people actually need. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5304/">has dropped the Lenovo IdeaPad 1i down to $279 from its regular $399 price</a>, bundling in a full <strong>year of Microsoft 365</strong> alongside an impressive combination of 12GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage plus 1TB of cloud storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5304/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Computing Power for Everyday Tasks</h2>
<p>The 12GB of RAM in this configuration changes everything about how budget laptops traditionally perform. Most entry-level machines ship with 4GB that starts choking the moment you open more than a few browser tabs but 12GB gives you real breathing room for multitasking across applications. You can run Word documents (you can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/word">download Word for free here</a>) while researching in Chrome with YouTube playing in the background, all without that frustrating slowdown that makes budget laptops feel ancient. The <strong>Intel Celeron processor handles everyday computing tasks</strong> like email, web browsing, document editing and video streaming without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Storage comes in two forms that work together beautifully: <strong>fast local storage and massive cloud storage</strong>. The 256GB SSD provides fast local storage for your operating system, applications, and files you access regularly, delivering quick boot times and snappy performance that makes modern computers feel responsive. That is complemented by the massive 1TB of cloud storage through Microsoft 365 for backing up photos and everything else you want to keep safe but don’t need instant access to.</p>



<p>The<strong> 14-inch HD anti-glare display</strong> hits that sweet spot for portability and usability-large enough to handle comfortable work sessions without the bulk of a 15.6-inch model that barely fits into backpacks: That anti-glare coating does wonders when you work near a window or under strong overhead lighting and cuts down on the reflections that otherwise drive you to push brightness to uncomfortable levels. The <strong>screen manages to achieve an 87% active area ratio</strong>&nbsp;which means Lenovo has been able to keep the surrounding bezels quite minimal to provide more screen area in a compact form factor. <strong>Two Dolby Audio speakers</strong> flank the keyboard and stream robust sound surprisingly well for video calls, streaming shows, or background music while working.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life stretches to 11 hours on a full charge</strong> which is enough to get through a full workday or school day without hunting for outlets. WiFi-6 connectivity brings faster speeds and better performance in crowded wireless environments like apartments or dorm buildings where dozens of devices compete for bandwidth. The Flip to Start feature powers on the laptop the instant you open the lid and shaves off those annoying seconds of waiting while Smart Noise Cancelling automatically filters out background sounds during video calls.</p>
<p>Windows 11 is preinstalled and it performs all the modern computing tasks you’d want, from productivity software to entertainment apps. The bundled Microsoft 365 subscription includes all the Office applications you’d want, <strong>including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, along with that 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage</strong> we mentioned earlier. This software package alone usually costs about $70 per year so getting a full year included with the laptop counts as genuine added value rather than marketing fluff.</p>
<p>At $279, this Lenovo undercuts generic no-name laptops that often cost $400 or more while delivering inferior build quality and zero brand support.</p>

              <p>Beats, a brand by Apple, makes some of the best audio gear out there. It offers bold sound, and the headphones play nicely with a range of devices. If you’re after a solid pair of over-ear headphones that do not blow your budget, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p>Amazon is being generous with a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/">35% discount on the Beats Solo 4 wireless headphones, which brings the price down to $129 from $199</a>. The discount applies to all color options, so you can pick one that matches your aesthetic the best.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Updated Drivers for Rich, Deep Sound</h2>
<p>The build is sleek yet sturdy, and the headphones are quite comfortable to wear. These feature an UltraPlush cushion that provides a snug fit without putting too much pressure on your ears, so it’s going to be easy to have them on for longer periods. The headband itself is foldable, meaning you can easily tuck the pair into a bag or backpack when not in use.</p>
<p>For powerful sound, there’s custom acoustic architecture with updated drivers. All the highs and lows are delivered well, across all genres. Listening to the Chester Bennington scream in Given Up or just winding down after a long day with a podcast, these headphones hold up well. Best of all, there’s Personalized Spatial Audio support with dynamic head tracking for a more immersive sound that follows you.</p>



<p>A built-in microphone makes calls clearer, and Class 1 Bluetooth makes sure you enjoy an extended range with fewer dropouts. If you want to enjoy audio just the way the creator intended, you can plug in using either the USB-C or 3.5mm audio cable. Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 50 hours of listening time on a full charge, so you can go at least a couple of days without worrying about recharging them. And if you’re running low, Fast Fuel lets you top up with 5 hours of playback in just 10 minutes.</p>



<p><strong>These headphones work well with both Android and Apple devices</strong>, so compatibility won’t really be an issue. Pairing literally takes a few minutes, so you’ll be jamming to your favorite beats in no time.</p>
<p>All things considered, Beats Solo 4 headphones are a great option to consider if you’re after solid audio, reliable battery life, and a comfortable fit. These would normally run you around $200, but this deal lets you snag them for just $129. It might be wrapping up soon, though, so it’s better to get your orders in fast.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Keanu Reeves would love to play Johnny Silverhand again, but how can he given the events of Cyberpunk 2077? It turns out Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith has worked out a way to make it make sense, and has told the much-loved actor: “contact me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, speaking with IGN while promoting his movie Good Fortune, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">Keanu Reeves said that he wanted to be part of the sequel to CD Projekt's 2020 game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Absolutely. I’d love to play Johnny Silverhand again," Reeves said when asked if he’d be interested in revisiting his legendary rockstar terrorist character in Cyberpunk 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reeves's love-affair with the Cyberpunk community began with his viral "you're breathtaking" moment at E3 2019. Reeves, on-stage to announce the release date of Cyberpunk 2077, was interrupted by a fan who shouted out "you're breathtaking!" Reeves' response was to double-down with his own "you're breathtaking... you're all breathtaking!" Cue wholesome memes across the internet forever more. You can see the iconic gamer moment in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is, could Reeves actually play Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2 even if he wanted to? In other words, could Johnny Silverhand return in the sequel, given the events of Cyberpunk 2077?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While many players believe Cyberpunk 2077 provided a suitable ending for Johnny and V's story, depending on which ending of the game CD Projekt makes canon for Cyberpunk 2, the door may be left open for Reeves' return. Could Johnny return in cameo form perhaps, having downloaded himself into someone or something else? Canon ending dependent, could V end up becoming Johnny Silverhand in mind and body for Cyberpunk 2? Perhaps we could see Johnny as part of a flashback to events before Cyberpunk 2077, as Cyberpunk 2077 had?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">A History of Keanu Reeves in Video Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like Mike Pondsmith has been thinking about this ever since Reeves’ interview with IGN. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc?si=Ta51TFmBnop3th3L" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CD Projekt livestream to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Cyberpunk 2077</a>, Mike Pondsmith said, matter of factly: “Not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again. I have ways to do that, Keanu. Contact me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pondsmith, understandably, did not reveal what those “ways” were, but as we’ve mentioned, there are plenty of theories fans have come up with to make it make sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reeves isn’t the only big Hollywood name to appear in Cyberpunk 2077. Idris Elba starred in the successful expansion, Phantom Liberty, which Pondsmith was delighted by. Indeed, he revealed he worried that CD Projekt might get sued because his character, looked so much like Elba, before it was revealed it actually was Elba playing the role.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"'So let me get this straight,'" Pondsmith recalled of his reaction to the news. "'You got Keanu Reeves, and then you turn around and get Idris Elba. What's next? Scarlett Johansson?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Scarlett, you know, I have roles for you. You can do anything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlett Johansson in Cyberpunk 2? That remains to be seen. But Pondsmith has been chatty about the hotly anticipated sequel in the past. In May, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-has-night-city-and-another-city-that-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong-mike-pondsmith-teases"><u>Pondsmith teased some previously unknown details</u></a> when he was asked about the scope of his involvement with Cyberpunk 2 (then known as Project Orion) at the Digital Dragons 2025 conference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pondsmith admitted he wasn’t as involved this time around, but said he does review scripts and had been to CD Projekt to check out the ongoing work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Last week I was wandering around talking to different departments, and seeing what they had, ‘Oh look, this is the new cyberware, what do you think?’ ‘Oh yeah, that’s pretty good, that works here.’"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, the morsel on the sequel: that it features a brand new city in addition to the Night City we know from Cyberpunk 2077. Pondsmith described this new city as “like Chicago gone wrong.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion, because there’s another city we visit — I’m not telling you any more than that but there’s another city we visit. And Night City is still there. But I remember looking at it and going, yeah I understand the feel you’re going for this, and this really does work. And it doesn’t feel like Blade Runner, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong. I said, ‘Yeah, I can see this working.'”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/03/gettyimages-1154859517-1762173368424.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Could Keanu Reeves reprise his role as Johnny Silverhand for Cyberpunk 2? Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth pointing out that Pondsmith’s comments do not necessarily suggest the Cyberpunk sequel will feature a future Chicago, rather a city that has the feel of a dystopian version of the city. It may well be a take on future Chicago, but that isn’t confirmed based on these comments. There is also some debate about whether Cyberpunk 2 will expand upon the Night City that’s in Cyberpunk 2077 or feature a new version, and the extent to which it is playable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like we'll have to wait some time to find out. CD Projekt is of course focusing on The Witcher 4, and CD Projekt co-CEO Michał Nowakowski has suggested Cyberpunk 2 won’t be out until at least 2030.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"It wouldn't really have worked in the same way elsewhere."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Rockstar boss Dan Houser has explained why the Grand Theft Auto series won’t leave the United States in terms of its setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=udC7HKm43mCRmXtt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Lex Fridman podcast</a>, Rockstar co-founder and former lead writer Houser said that — GTA London apart — Grand Theft Auto remained firmly rooted in the United States because it leans so heavily on Americana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We made a little thing in London 26 years ago — GTA London — for the top-down for PS1. That was pretty cute and fun, as the first mission pack ever for PlayStation 1. I think for a full GTA game, we always decided there was so much Americana inherent in the IP, it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You know, you needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective. But that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't really have worked in the same way elsewhere.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a trend that’s set to continue with next year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>, which is set in the fictional U.S. state of Leonida (a reimagining of Florida). And based on the two GTA 6 trailers we've seen so far, that parody of American culture is once again front and center.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an interesting time, then, to wonder if GTA might hop on a plane and venture abroad at some point in the future. But it feels unlikely, not just based on Houser’s comments, but based on the GTA brand — built up over decades at this point — and what the public expects from it. Indeed, such is GTA’s relationship with America over the course of its many video games, that a University of Tennessee history professor will teach a GTA college history class early in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-got-a-gta-college-history-class-before-gta-6">Professor Tore Olsson recently told IGN</a>: “Video games are great at conjuring fictional worlds, but they also impact players’ thinking about real-world times and places. And just as Red Dead Redemption 2 has shaped folks’ perception of the nineteenth-century American West or Ghost of Tsushima has informed their vision of feudal Japan, millions of people around the globe imagine contemporary America through the lens of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Just think of how many GTA veterans have recognized landmarks in Los Angeles and New York thanks to their hours in Los Santos and Liberty City!”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Houser’s position on GTA is similar to that of the creators of post-apocalyptic role-playing game series Fallout, which has also remained in the United States. Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-explains-why-bethesda-plans-to-keep-fallout-set-in-the-us">Bethesda development chief Todd Howard ruled out leaving the U.S. behind for a future Fallout video game</a>, saying he’s a big fan of the “Americana naivete” that informs so much of Fallout’s tone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the wait for GTA 6 goes on, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026"><u>May 26, 2026</u></a> the current release date. We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2"><u>all the details we’ve discovered so far</u></a>, a roundup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-70-brand-new-screenshots-reveal-the-characters-and-places-of-leonida"><u>70 brand new screenshots</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-look-even-better-on-ps5-pro-experts-give-their-verdict"><u>the expert opinion on how GTA 6 will look on PS5 Pro</u></a>. As for how much will Grand Theft Auto 6 cost?

			<p>Oh, sequels, what a tribulation you are for both gamers and developers alike. Sometimes a follow-up captures everything you loved about the original game and then manages to expand, develop and refine it. Other times a sequel seems to, with unerring accuracy, cherry pick everything that irked you about its predecessor and, for some obscure reason, seeks to do more of that. Biped 2, I’m saddened to say, is the latter kind of sequel.</p>
<p><iframe title="Biped 2 Release Date Trailer | November 5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N9NDROVfsLc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A cute isometric puzzle platformer, Biped 2 tasks you and now up to three co-op partners with navigating your endearingly charming robots around an array of levels. Controls remain as fiddly as ever, though they are oddly satisfying when it finally clicks. Each thumbstick operates a leg of your bipedal bot, so movement requires a whole lot of alternate waggling to get you where you want to go. Precision control is available by standing on one leg and then spinning like a top to plant your other leg on your desired target, until you’re ready to lift your original leg and go again. To travel greater distances you can push both thumbsticks in the desired direction to activate your hover skis and propel yourself forward with rocket-fuelled abandon, though this erratic movement option will be of little help in solving the numerous physics-based puzzles ahead of you.</p>


<p>Biped 2 makes one critical mistake; it assumes you played the original game within the last month or two. Now, maybe you have, in which case you’ll be better prepared for the difficulty spikes you’ll encounter here, but when it’s been five years since you last played Biped, this sequel just feels plain nasty. An unrelentingly gruelling challenge that seems to forget that the players might actually want to have fun together.</p>


<p>It’s important to point out that my co-op partner and I have a rock-solid track record when it comes to these types of collaborative game. We’ve seen off numerous Trines, Double Fine’s finest, and a whole heap of metroidvanias, brawlers, and platformers together. So, when I say that Biped 2 broke us, it really means something. For a game that looks just as cute and adorable as the original, this has ended up as one mean SOB.</p>
<p>From the get-go, the challenges here demand a level of precise control and collaboration that was simply beyond us. With no means of altering the difficulty, you’re stuck trying each obstacle again and again until you reach the point that you relationship might shatter if you play anymore. Take an early challenge as an example, in which your bipeds need to cross a chasm; sections of chunky platforms can be briefly extended by your partner stepping on – using the obscenely fiddly control scheme, remember – three different symbols. As they do this, you need to drunkenly saunter – using the obscenely fiddly control scheme, remember – from each extending and retracting platform to the other. If your partner stands on the wrong symbol, you fall off. If you get the timing even slightly wrong, you fall off. Then if that wasn’t enough, entirely random puffs of wind from the nearby cliff-face blow you from your perch.</p>
<p>After numerous attempts, once you’ve reached the other side – mostly through dumb luck, may I add – you’d think there’d be a shortcut to bring your partner over quickly. Perhaps a catapult or cannon that you could activate? Oh no, my friend, now you must do it all again, only with <em>you</em> pressing the symbols on your side of the chasm instead. This is level three. Suffice to say it turned me into a broken mess.</p>

<p>Thing is, if the control scheme or the physics were more nuanced, this level of challenge would be appropriate, but they’re not. Controls are so clunky and silly they belong in a lightweight party game, not a precision platformer. Meanwhile, the physics regularly misbehave. So, you and your partner might make it across the giant rolling log, alternating your steps so the platform beneath your feet doesn’t disappear, only for the physics to throw you off because, well, reasons.</p>
<p>In short, Biped 2 is in conflict with itself, it wants to be a co-op party game, but it also wants to offer an intense challenge. These two things, like chalk and cheese, don’t belong together, the end result being something entirely insufferable.</p>

<p>Horii is the first video game designer to receive such an award, yet he seemingly remains as humble as ever with his accompanying comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve been making games for a long time, about 40 years now, but it’s not just my own efforts, it’s all thanks to the staff who helped me make it, and the users who have always supported me. I’ve levelled up in many ways, done many things, and all my hard work has paid off.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latest entry to the series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, just recently launched on the Switch and Switch 2 and is likely to be a monumental success over in Japan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Horii is also busy at work on the next mainline entry, <strong>Dragon Quest XII</strong>, which has still yet to receive a firm update or release date since its initial announcement.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>So far, GTA London 1969 remains the only installment in the franchise to take place outside of the United States. Fans have long wondered if Rockstar would ever return to London or perhaps even bring the series elsewhere in the world. </p>



<p>However, based on the statement relayed by Dan Houser (who wrote all the games in the series save for the upcoming sixth), that seems unlikely. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3gbXDjNWyI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to the Lex Fridman podcast</a>, he explained that the franchise is intrinsically linked to American culture. </p>



<p><em>We made a little thing in London 26 years ago, GTA London, for the top-down for the PS1. That was pretty cute and fun, as the first mission pack ever for PlayStation. I think for a full GTA game, we always decided there was so much Americana inherent in the IP, it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else. You know, you needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective. But that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't really have worked in the same way elsewhere.</em></p>



<p>Of course, Houser <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-dan-houser-co-founder-leaving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left Rockstar Games in early 2020</a>, so it isn't really up to him anymore. That said, having worked there for twenty-two years, he certainly has a sound inkling as to the way the studio thinks about its prized IP.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creator-reveals-favorite-character-says-llms-will-be-good-at-cheap-stuff-not-magic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elsewhere in the interview</a>, Dan Houser mentioned that his favorite character in the series was GTA IV's Niko Bellic, as the most earnest and nicest of all, although he also mentioned CJ from San Andreas and Michael De Santa from GTA V as standout, partly due to the respective voice actors doing a great job at bringing them to life.</p>



<p>Houser then said he isn't worried about generative-trained large language models taking the jobs of writers because he reckons that LLMs can only create cheap, decent stuff, but are unable to come out with new, interesting ideas, which is where 'magic' comes from in writing.</p>

            <p>Cancelled Rockstar espionage flick Agent ended up being filed away without releasing because the studio found a spy narrative impossible to reconcile with their open-world approach to games, according to long-time GTA writer Dan Houser. Despite that, Rockstar subsequently ended up getting halfway up the road of a secret agent-centric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> DLC before opting to don cowboy hats instead.</p>
<p>If the name Agent isn't ringing any bells for you, Rockstar announced what would've been their take on a Bond-style spy game at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4nxFUmSaOU">E3 2009</a>, attaching a PS3 exclusive tag to it. One would assume it'd likely have hit PC at some point, had it not ended up gradually fizzling out into cancellation instead.</p>

<p>In a lengthy interview with Lex Fridman, Rockstar co-founder Houser revealed that Agent went through "about five different iterations" ranging from a game set during the Cold War tensions of the 1970s to something more "current". After rotating through all of those ideas, the writer arrived at the idea that the strengths of Hollywood-style spy stories simply aren't compatible with Rockstar's open sandboxes.</p><p>"I don’t think it works," Houser said. "I keep thinking about it sometimes, I sometimes lie in bed thinking about it, and I’ve concluded that what makes [spy stories] really good as film stories makes them not work as video games. We need to think through how to do it in a different way as a video game."</p>
<p>"I don’t know what it would’ve been because we never got it enough to even do a proper story on it," he then added. We were doing the early work where you get the world up and running, and it never really found its feet in either of them. And I sort of think I know why." Houser's theory is that the "very frenetic" and "beat-to-beat" style of storytelling which sees the likes of James Bond rush all over the world doing missions "against the clock" doesn't fit with the lulls an open world game will have when it lets a player wander off to do their own thing. Houser reckons being a criminal's much more ideal for that, since "you fundamentally don’t have anyone telling you what to do".</p>
<p>The writer touches on this need to marry the 'on the job' and 'off the job' sides of an open world game earlier in the interview, citing GTA 5's Trevor and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> more loosely as occasions when he reckons the studio did well to reconcile the two sides by providing morally grey characters who, to put it bluntly, didn't feel as jarring to go on a murder spree with. On the other hand, Houser said GTA 4's Niko ended up possibly having too much going for him on the story side of things, leading players to feel more empathy for him than would be ideal in terms of him being an "effective avatar in the open world".</p>
<p>To me, the need to serve as a believable hand through which mayhem can be wrought upon the world's always a secondary thing, though that's an easier view to hold now GTA Online's protagonist exists as a go-to silent chaos-causer if I ever feel bothered about going beyond the pail for main story characters. I'd be interested to know whether Rockstar might have looked into trying to balance the spy and agent of chaos sides of any not-quite-Bond in a similar fashion to how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sleeping-dogs">Sleeping Dogs</a> handles Wei Shen's duelling undercover cop/triad criminal roles. That system's far from perfect roleplaying-wise, but it'd possibly have helped make things fit a bit better. That's assuming just biting the bullet and making a more linear spy game that differs from the standard open-world fare is off the table.</p><p>Strangely, despite Houser saying Agent didn't work because open-world spying didn't mesh, the interview also sees him confirm that that a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta5-nearly-had-story-dlc-that-made-trevor-a-007-style-spy-until-it-was-cancelled-and-turned-into-a-gta-online-heist">secret agent-themed single-player DLC for GTA 5</a> was "half-done" by the time it was canned, with the studio moving to work on Red Dead Redemption 2 instead. This add-on was set to see Trevor take on the secret agenting, with Houser saying it was "cute", but "never quite came together". While obviously on a smaller scale than a full game and with a character established as an effective psychopath who can get up to just about anything without it seeming too strange, I'm left wondering how it'd not have seen Rockstar have to find a way to reconcile open worlding and spy storying as they struggled to with agent.</p>
<p>Based on the findings of datminers, the spy-ish save the world narrative in GTA Online's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-online-doomsday-heist">Doomsday Heist</a> seems to have taken on some elements of the canned Trevor DLC. In that case, from what I remember the framing of an agency bringing in a criminal contractor to handle some of their dirty work tends to do the heavy lifting, but the degree of separation being that simple to make does lead you to wonder how a similar wrinkle couldn't have been worked into Agent.</p>

              <p>Gaming sessions with friends hit different when everyone has a controller: There’s nothing worse than passing around one gamepad or having to troubleshoot compatibility across various devices. The Xbox wireless controller has become the go-to option for millions of gamers and right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">Amazon has it down to just $39 from its usual $64 price</a>. That’s practically half the cost of Sony’s DualSense controller, and it makes this deal all that much sweeter if you need to stock up on extra controllers for those multiplayer sessions.</p>

<h2>A Controller That Goes the Distance</h2>
<p>New in this 2025 edition of the Xbox controller are features that truly make for meaningful changes in your experience while gaming: The <strong>battery life runs as long as 40 hours on one set of two AA batteries</strong> which means you can game through several weekends without having to fear running out of power. This controller now <strong>includes a 9-foot USB-C cable right in the box</strong> for easy flexibility between wireless freedom and the reliability of a wired connection at any time.</p>
<p>These ergonomic updates to the controller have made marathon gaming sessions far more comfortable. Xbox has <strong>refined the sculpted surfaces and geometry</strong> for a better fit of various hand sizes while adding textured grips on the triggers, bumpers, and back case. These grip enhancements give you more control in high-intensity moments when your palms start sweating and this <strong>hybrid D-pad provides a nice balance between precision and comfort</strong> in fighting games and menu navigation alike. The <strong>Share button integration is really handy</strong>, too: you can capture screenshots and recordings without having to fumble through menus or break focus during crucial gameplay moments.</p>



<p>In real-world practicality, the strength of this controller comes in with cross-platform compatibility: You can pair it<strong> wirelessly via Xbox Wireless or Bluetooth to your console, PC, phone, tablet, Fire TV Stick, smart TV, or even VR headsets</strong>. That means one controller works across your whole gaming ecosystem, not different gamepads for different devices. A <strong>3.5mm headset jack</strong> lets you plug any compatible headset directly into it, and a USB-C port supports direct plug-and-play connections to your console or PC without any setup hassle.</p>
<p>At $39, you’re getting a premium controller that normally sells for $64, and this represents the lowest price we’ve tracked for this model. With over 21,000 reviews averaging 4.6 stars and more than 10,000 units purchased in the past month alone, this controller has proven itself in real-world use.</p>
