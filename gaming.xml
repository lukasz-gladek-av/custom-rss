Challenging combat, awe-inspiring visuals, and an expansive open world ripe for players to explore cemented Elden Ring as Game of the Year at the 2023 Game Developers Choice Awards, where it also won Best Visual Art and Best Design. It even scored a lofty <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring/reviews">10 from IGN's review team</a>.

Considering how new this DLC is, it's no surprise it's not as heavily discounted as the base game, but it's still a $28 discount from its standard retail value of $79.99.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9 More PS5 Games Under $20</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">More PS5 Black Friday Deals to Explore</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty of other Black Friday deals still going strong on popular games, though they're certainly not as reduced in price as what we've gathered for you here. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDkkN?object_uuid=1863d934-3c0b-44e6-bef6-b2453fa9fbbd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D2FY9H73" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, which is primed to take the title of Game of the Year, can be picked up right now for $20 off its retail value — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-black-friday-deal-2024">its lowest sale price yet</a>.

Make sure to read up on the sales schedules of your favorite retailers to take advantage of their deals while they last. But be warned: Some of these games are likely to sell out well before the sales even end.

While it’s easy to focus on the new bestiaries, rods, fish, and mutations added to the overall experience, fans should note that the update comes bundled in with the gargantuan Megalodon Hunt. It’s an event that adds giant prehistoric creatures to fish for, making this an especially enticing addition to one of Roblox’s most popular games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/30/fisch-ancient-isles-the-megalodon-hunt-1732988478803.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fisch The Ancient Isles update gives Roblox fishing game its biggest content drop yet.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Ancient Isles have just been discovered—lush jungles, glowing ruins, mystery filled caves, and ancient fish whisper of secrets long forgotten,” a description from Fisching says. “What mysteries could these legendary lands unveil?

                <p>Fortnite is gearing up for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-start-date-battle-pass-skins-and-everything-else-to-know/2900-5955/" data-ref-id="2900-5955">Chapter 6 Season 1</a>, closing the book on Remix Chapter 2 with its massive Remix Finale event, the latest in a years-long run of in-game concerts that Epic has put on for players. Shortly after the event, the official Fortnite account on Twitter/X revealed that the Remix Finale event was, in fact, the biggest in-game concert the game has ever hosted.</p><p>With more than 14 million players, this latest event has usurped Travis Scott's "Astronomical" in-game concert from 2020 as the biggest Fortnite in-game music event ever. Scott's interactive concert saw a high of 12.3 million players. In the summer of 2021, Ariana Grande starred in the Rift Tour, a concert of a similar scale, though player counts were never revealed for it, thereby inferring the total was less than Scott's showcase.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1862950664281919658" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">You.

In the case of Scott's show, this led to nearly 28 million unique players experiencing the concert before its run of shows came to a close. Today's event, however, will be shown just once more at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET today, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-servers-are-down-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up-for-chapter-6-season-1/1100-6527547/" data-ref-id="1100-6527547">Fortnite is down</a> ahead of Chapter 6 Season 1. The new chapter is expected to begin tomorrow, December 1.</p><p>The show featured a four-pack of artists: Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice, and Juice WRLD, with the lattermost appearing<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-epic-is-bringing-the-late-juice-wrld-to-fortnite/1100-6527957/" data-ref-id="1100-6527957"> posthumously and with the blessing of the late artist's mother and record label</a>. Many other concerts have been in the game since Grande's, including shows starring The Kid Laroi, Metallica, and many more, but there is often a noticeable difference in scale among these various shows. The Remix Finale event was much more in the style of the Astronomical and Rift Tour shows, making it the first to feel that way in three years.</p><p>The event also came close to being Fortnite's biggest live event ever, though that distinction still belongs to the Marvel crossover event from December 2020, during which time <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1333954587879821314" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game saw a peak count of 15.3 million players</a>.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has finally done it. Tonight's Remix Finale event has at last beaten the game's long-standing concurrent player record for a live concert, set back in 2020 when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-eye-popping-live-concert-hits-all-time-player-record">12.3 million players tuned in for the first broadcast of its lockdown-era Travis Scott concert</a>.
</p>
<p>
14.3 million people were in-game tonight for Fortnite's Remix Finale event, according to the game's public player stats, while millions more were watching online via <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> and YouTube. 
</p>
<p>
That's higher than the 9.8 million watching in-game earlier this month when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-than-10m-fortnite-players-watch-snoop-dogg-ice-spice-headline-concert-streamed-live-from-times-square">Fortnite Remix mini-season kicked off with a livestreamed concert in Times Square</a> featuring Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice. It's more than double the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-live-event-sees-56m-players-defeat-doctor-doom-in-hour-long-battle">5.6 million players who logged in for October's hour-long Doctor Doom boss battle</a>. And perhaps most impressively, it's also higher than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-the-big-bang-event-was-a-blast-of-marketing-for-the-games-multi-genre-future">last December's much-hyped The Big Bang event</a>, which was attended by 10 million players at the end of the game's hugely popular OG season.
</p>
<p>The only event to ever get higher within Fortnite was its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-showstopping-marvel-finale-drops-a-huge-cliffhanger">Marvel season finale featuring Galactus</a>, again back during the lockdown era of 2020, when 15.3 million people were in-game.</p>

<p>It's been a while since Fortnite itself has commented on its own player stats. Tonight, Epic Games <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1862950664281919658">noted</a> the Remix Finale's huge attendance and it confirmed it was a record for any Fortnite concert event. Excluding concerts - which draw huge engagement but are brief affairs - Epic Games last noted a player milestone at the launch of last year's OG season. Then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">an astonishing 44 million players logged in over 24 hours, for Fortnite's biggest day ever</a>. (Could this record be broken next week, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">Fortnite OG returns as a permanent mode</a>?)</p><p>
Fortnite's Remix Finale kicked off on top of Snoop Dogg's restyled Agency headquarters, site of the fan-favourite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-the-device-live-event-analysed-as-epic-sets-up-fortnites-longterm-future">Chapter 2 live event The Device</a>. Here, players saw the first of several nods back to previous Fortnite live events, as pylons rose from the waters surrounding the building - now decked out in loudspeakers - and the 'Device' itself appeared - now a giant microphone for a skyscraper-sized Snoop Dogg to pick up and rap with. Snoop's section of the event continued with the rapper free-styling alongside a cel-shaded version of himself, around the Agency and then also in a space-set section where players skipped along a planet's rings.
</p>
<p>
As Snoop blasted off atop the Battle Bus, Eminem dropped in for sequence initially inspired by his appearance in last year's The Big Bang event. This was followed by a brilliant anime-inspired section where Snoop fought Fortnite's fan-favourite bear robot (or Mecha Team Leader, to give its full name) from the game's memorable 2019 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-fortnites-mecha-vs-monster-battle-played-out">mecha versus monster battle</a>.

</figure>
<p>Next up came Ice Spice, initially via a more intimate sequence that saw players follow the rapper across city rooftops. A second track saw her turn kaiju-sized, before players were sent off to the concert's final section featuring the late singer and self-proclaimed Fortnite fan Juice WRLD, who died in 2019. </p><p>How Fortnite handled Juice WRLD's involvement here was interesting. Never before has the game highlighted a celebrity who has passed away, but this section felt an engaging and respectful tribute. Players saw a giant version of the singer surrounded by stars and Fortnite's rift butterflies, rapping on the horizon. One section, featuring the newly-released track Empty Out Your Pockets, saw players transform into and move around the sequence as one of said butterflies (with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/moments-of-2018-when-fortnite-stopped-everything-for-a-butterfly">nod back to the game's 2018 butterfly event</a>, too). And there was more Juice WRLD to come - at the very end of the concert, there was the option to watch the debut of the official music video for the track. It's a stylish animation set within Fortnite's world, featuring many of its characters, and fitted tonight's proceedings perfectly.</p>

<p>As the music came to a close, fans of Fortnite's storyline were treated to something more - a look towards the game's future, with some key characters again along for the ride. </p>
<p>The event's end saw long-time Fortnite hero Jones and Chapter 5's new main character Hope zooming off into a rift, quickly followed by the Battle Bus and what looks to be a shard of the Zero Point. Huh! As players followed, they were taken to... the game's new Japan-inspired battle royale Island, which will launch properly tomorrow morning.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-launch-trailer-goes-live-early-reveals-roaming-godzilla-and-giant-turtle">Yesterday's trailer leak</a> - presumably meant to go live after the event tonight - picks up immediately after, showing the Zero Point shard impacting the Island and sparking demons to come through a portal. Oops. But that's tomorrow's problem.</p>
<p>Back to tonight, and Epic Games has an encore showing of the Remix Finale event scheduled for 1am UK time (8pm Eastern, 3pm Pacific), should you wish to join in yourself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24305460/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-concert-eminem-snoop-juice-wrld-ice-spice<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24308372/fortnite-remix-finale-concert-juice-wrld-chapter-6-how-to-watch">most recent virtual concert</a> was supersized in multiple ways. Unlike previous events, which focused on specific artists like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/29/24187226/fortnite-metallica-concert-interview">Metallica</a>, this one featured a cast of four different artists: Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice, and the late Juice WRLD. And it turned each one of the large lineup into a kaiju-sized performer, while also integrating deep cuts of <em>Fortnite</em> lore and providing a tease of what’s next for the game.</p><p>Things started out at Snoop Dogg’s compound, which has been at the center of the battle royale map since the beginning of November. From there, a gigantic version of the rapper performed, before whisking players away into space for another song. In fact, the event constantly moved around: up next was Eminem who fought against a giant robot following a dramatic storm, followed by Ice Spice towering over a cityscape like Godzilla. It ended back on the battle royale island with a pair of Juice WRLD songs.</p><p>The humongous versions of the stars were reminiscent of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">the Travis Scott show from 2020</a>, and — much like the Grande concert — the event also weaved in bits of <em>Fortnite</em>’s strange history. Eminem’s sequence was similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701930/fortnite-epic-games-live-event-mecha-monster-battle-showdown-giant-robot">the game’s mecha-monster battle from back in 2019</a>, while during Juice WRLD’s songs players were turned into the glowing butterflies that first appeared in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"><em>Fortnite</em>’s ambitious black hole event from the same year</a>. At the end players were given a glimpse of what appears to be the new version of the battle royale island that will be playable when the game’s next chapter kicks off on December 1st.</p><p>After things wrapped up, the game was used to premiere Juice WRLD’s new animated music video for “Empty Out Your Pockets,” which takes place inside of <em>Fortnite</em>:</p><div><p>This all comes after an interesting, music-filled month for the battle royale game. At the beginning of November Epic kicked off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24283508/fortnite-remix-chapter-2-concert-snoop-dogg-ice-spice">a remixed version of <em>Fortnite</em>: Chapter 2</a>, which was a month-long and focused on a different musical artist each week. It was preceded by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music">a real life concert in Times Square from Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice</a>. The mini season also introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301624/can-i-kick-it-yes-i-can-on-thursday">a new cosmetic item in the form of kicks</a>, and saw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301710/fortnites-subscription-is-about-to-become-a-better-deal">Epic revamp its battle pass structure</a>.</p></div><p>The concert not only closed out Chapter 2: Remix, it also set up the game’s next mainline season.

		<p>The War of the Worlds: Siberia has got its first proper trailer that gives a look at the game which has been inspired by H.G. Wells classic story. The game is set in 1896, in a world where the Martians have invaded Earth. Cities and nations have fallen to the invasion. London fell first followed by other capital cities. The story of The War of the Worlds: Siberia is set after the invasion of Petrograd, and your are one of the survivors heading east.</p>
<p><iframe title="The War of the Worlds: Siberia — Premiere Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/63r65WiQoww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The player character is simply called Student. He is separated from his friends and family after fleeing Petrograd, and is embarking on a new life in Siberia on a mission to survive. The War of the Worlds: Siberia is a third person action adventure, in which the Student will use weapons from the era as well as his brain to solve puzzles. The real enemies are the other survivors as groups try to survive in a world where the aliens could strike at any moment. There will be a number of characters that will shape the Student’s journey, both friends and foes.</p>
<p>War of the Worlds: Siberia is not open world and instead will have levels to progress through, with the story being the focus. In this alternative universe Saint Petersburg is Petrograd, even though in our universe, the name Petrograd was not used until 1914. The imperial family is also called Romeyev, not Romanov, and players will not meet any historical figures. Players will not be venturing as far as Lake Baikal, but the Trans-Siberian Railway does appear. Three difficulty levels are planned which will essentially be easy, medium, and hard. Player choice will impact the story in some ways, and there will be abilities to unlock though these will be grounded in reality.&nbsp; At the moment, War of the Worlds: Siberia is only set to be released on PC, though 1C will consider other platforms.</p>

With Knull still dormant, Venom prefers to wait until they can harness this power safely. On the other hand, the Guardians, tasked by Shuri, are eager to immediately neutralize Knull’s influence over the gods including Bast.

		<p>Motorsport Games has confirmed that all of its NASCAR games will be delisted from digital storefronts on December 31st, 2024. This follows on from the sale of the NASCAR license to iRacing, which has been completed. Motorsport Games is not in the best of positions as it struggles with its finances, with recent financial results stating the company needs more funding to continue operations over the next year.</p>
<p>In a statement, Motorsport Games said, <em>“<span>To the NASCAR game community! From December 31, 2024, all NASCAR game titles and their DLC content will no longer be available for purchase on all digital storefronts but will remain available to play after this time. This includes the NASCAR Heat, </span><span>NASCAR Rivals, and NASCAR Ignition </span><span>franchises. Please lookout for various platform promotions this December to complete your NASCAR console game collection while you can! We sincerely thank our community for the enthusiasm and support you’ve shown for these games over the years and hope you have enjoyed racing with us.”</span></em></p>


<p>The recent <a href="https://motorsportgames.com/motorsport-games-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results/">third quarter 2024 financial results for Motorsport Games</a>, have reference to the company’s troubles, with it saying, <em>“Based on its cash and cash equivalents position and the average monthly cash burn, the Company does not believe it has sufficient cash on hand to fund its operations over the next year and that additional funding will be required in order to continue operations. In order to address its liquidity short fall, the Company is actively exploring several options, including, but not limited to: i) additional funding in the form of potential equity and/or debt financing arrangements or similar transactions; ii) other strategic alternatives for its business, including, but not limited to, the sale or licensing of the Company’s assets in addition to its recent sales of its NASCAR license and Traxion; and iii) further cost reduction and restructuring initiatives.”</em></p>
<p>Motorsport Games has already seen developers get laid off, and it seems the company could be considering such a move again if it cannot secure additional funding, along with selling other licenses. Motorsport Games currently holds the license for Le Mans.</p>

Though, I have to admit, getting $100 worth of Robux at a $20 discount is something you could even gift to yourself. A $100 gift card is equivalent to about 10,000 Robux. By saving $20, you're basically getting a whopping 2,000 Robux for free.

<p>Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455844537830474746">full list of fixes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue when the second wave of monolith soldiers would not spawn during the On the Edge mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>Fixed the issue when Ritcher could be found dead during the A Minor Incident mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>The fixed issue was a player could get stuck after installing the fuse in the Wild Island area if they got the Emitter from Faust's Cell first during the Just Like the Good Old Days mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>The fixed issue was when a player could not successfully complete the All That is Left mission while exploring the Chemical Plant region.</li>
<li>Fixed issue when quest enemies could spawn in unreachable areas for a player during the “Down Below” mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when Scar could be missing during the Visions of Truth mission.</li>
<li>A few more EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION errors are fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Thanks again for your support. We will continue working on future updates, reading your comments and feedback, and fixing 'anomalies' if they occur," the team concluded.</p>
<p>"If you detect any - report them to our <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.stalker2.com%2Fhc%0A">Technical Support Hub</a>. That will help us investigate your particular case and implement fixes faster."</p>
<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has, of course, got off to an impressive start despite its technical issues. Earlier this week, GSC Game World revealed the shooter has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">already sold 1m copies</a> - and that figure doesn't including all those players exploring The Zone via Game Pass.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This second patch is not as fix heavy as the first patch, instead fixing some progression issues in some of the game’s missions. Those fixes include making sure enemies spawn when they should, and having characters be where they are supposed to be. Patch notes are below, but be aware of spoilers.</p>

<p>In our STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl review, Stefan said, “STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</p>

            <p>Re-Logic has confirmed there's "no way" we'll see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a> 1.4.5 released this year.</p>
<p>In a lengthy update on the official <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-state-of-the-game-november-2024.139594/">forums</a>, Ted "Loki" Murphy said that whilst the team was approaching the end of their respective to-do lists, end-of-year releases are "fraught with peril" due to review cycles and people going on early leave for the holiday. Consequently, he will not "force anyone on our team or anyone else's team to crunch".</p>

<p>"The work on the final lists from each dev team member is nearing its conclusion, which is a great measure of progress," wrote Murphy. "That said, we are pretty certain that there is no way that we will see Terraria 1.4.5 release this year.</p><p>"To make a long story short, end-of-year releases (especially if you are trying to sync launch across PC-Mobile-Console AND do so globally at the same time) are fraught with peril due to review cycles, people leaving early for the holidays, etc. The hope was that we would be able to get things in ahead of that end of year mess, but that isn't looking to be the case.</p>
<p>"We are also not going to force anyone on our team or anyone else's team to crunch for what would be an arbitrary deadline," Murphy added. "So, that said, the next Terraria update is moving along into 2025."</p>
<p>After acknowledging that the news "will not be welcome for many", Murphy added that Re-Logic "remain[s] committed to being a quality-first studio, so we will take the time necessary for each update to feel 'just right'... and we think that once the update is out, everyone will appreciate that time and care".</p>
<p>"Apologies for this one taking so long for sure, but it will be well worth it," he added.</p>
<p>We recently learned that Terraria will be linking up with open world pocket monster survival game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-announces-major-update-terraria-crossover-despite-ongoing-legal-issues">Palworld for the latter's first big brand crossover</a>. Exactly what this will entail remains to be seen, but artwork posted to social media earlier this week shows characters from the two games interacting ahead of the crossover happening at some point in 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With a unique premise, including possession and body horror, along with a vibrant city full of glowing neon lights illuminating the ever-present darkness, the third-person action-oriented horror game stood a great chance at making waves. Despite the studio’s reputation and history, they remained an indie outfit, which likely explains the game’s somewhat soft, understated reception.  - Brandon Morgan </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/slitterhead-as-told-by-steam-reviews-1851708414?_gl=1*1bl4u8j*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjk3NTgzMS4zOTcuMS4xNzMyOTc4MzcyLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/slitterhead-as-told-by-steam-reviews-1851708414?_gl=1*1bl4u8j*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjk3NTgzMS4zOTcuMS4xNzMyOTc4MzcyLjYwLjAuMA..">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="443cb764ae416bbc8eeed5ccc3c2490a" data-recommend-id="image://443cb764ae416bbc8eeed5ccc3c2490a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Art from Nine Sols, Mouthwashing, and Zelda." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Art from Nine Sols, Mouthwashing, and Zelda." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->RedCandleGames / Wrong Organ / Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="443cb764ae416bbc8eeed5ccc3c2490a" data-recommend-id="image://443cb764ae416bbc8eeed5ccc3c2490a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Art from Nine Sols, Mouthwashing, and Zelda." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s the Thanksgiving holiday week, and that means if you work for a company worth a damn (and some that aren’t worth a damn, but I digress), you probably have the next couple of days off.
