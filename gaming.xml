</section></header><section>

<p>Although we've been racing around in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for the past month, there's actually been some activity in the Nintendo mobile title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/mario_kart_tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>.</p>
<p>The game's Pipe Tour is currently back for its second run, and now in another update, Nintendo has announced it will be celebrating the arrival of the Switch 2 game with four new karts as well as some familiar themed outfits for Mario and Luigi.</p>
<p>This Mario Kart World "special campaign" is taking place exclusively in Mario Kart Tour, and is also part of the Sunshine Tour which will run from 23rd July 2025 until 6th August 2025.</p>
<p>This follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-datamine-suggests-nintendo-isnt-done-with-mario-karts-mobile-entry-just-yet">a rumour in May</a> that Mario Kart Tour would be receiving new content to celebrate Mario Kart World's release.</p>
<p>In some related news, Nintendo has also <a href="https://x.com/SuperMarioRunJP/status/1945741894694416456">announced a new event</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, where you can unlock themed statues to celebrate the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.

<p>In recent weeks, we've been finding out more details about the developers behind the Switch 2's launch line up of games, and now Nintendo's 1-UP Studio has updated its website with two major projects.</p>
<p>It helped out with not only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> but also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. It previously supported Nintendo EPD on projects like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and assisted with multiple other entries in the Mario series during the same generation. You can see the rest of the company's history <a href="https://1-up-studio.jp/company/history.html">on its official website</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4sgnpvy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>According to 1UP's website, its responsibilities on Donkey Kong Bananza included "design, level design, programming" and "part of the sound". As for Mario Kart World, it's mentioned how it assisted with "part of the design". As with many major first-party Nintendo titles nowadays, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/06/xenoblade_studio_monolith_soft_is_helping_make_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">collaborative efforts like this</a> have become increasingly common.</p>
<p>This follows an update from Nintendo earlier this month, which confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">"the Super Mario Odyssey team"</a> developed DK and Pauline's latest outing for the Switch 2. We've also got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-credits-confirm-the-voice-actors-behind-dk-and-pauline">confirmation of the voice actors</a> involved in this new entry.</p>

<p>Now arriving this November</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2b78ba65d5ed0/inazuma-eleven.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>After multiple delays, Level-5 has announced it will be delaying its upcoming title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> again.</p>
<p>Instead of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-finally-has-release-date-out-on-switch-2-day-one">previous August release date</a>, it's now been pushed back to <strong>13th November 2025</strong> for the Switch 2, Switch and multiple other platforms. The latest delay is apparently tied to recordings, localisation and "other related processes". Here's the scoop, via the game's <a href="https://x.com/InazumaSeries/status/1946252039518044194">official social media account</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important Announcement Regarding the Release Date</strong></p>
<p>Due to the content volume exceeding our initial expectations, additional time is required for voice recording, multi-language localization, and other related processes. As we work toward the final stages of development, we have decided to adjust the release date to ensure the best possible quality.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<div><p>The release date of "Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road" has been changed from August 21, 2025, to [November 13, 2025 (GMT)].</p><p>

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to all the fans who have been eagerly waiting for a long time, and truly appreciate your understanding and continued support.</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see the video below detailing this delay and it also reiterates how development is apparently in the "final stages". The team believes this next date is when it will "finally be able to release the game".</p>
<p>The same video also highlights the development progress and improved features players can expect when this title does finally arrive. The team does not want to make any compromises and intends to use the extra time to further polish and enhance the overall experience.</p>

<p>This delay follows Level-5's launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, which got off to a positive start in its opening months – surpassing 1.2 million in "global cumulative sales".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">indie.io is a video game publishing platform that works with lots of different developers and publishes games in a variety of genres. They’ve published dozens of games, several of which are discounted on Nintendo Switch right now as part of a sale that will run through July 30.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with indie.io’s library as a whole, the sale includes a wide range of genres. There’s cozy adventures, tactical RPGs, creature collectors, management sims, and more. You can check out the full sale <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/sales-and-deals/indie-io/#sort=df&amp;p=0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>here</u></a>, but we thought we’d highlight six games that showcase the diversity of titles that are available. Let’s get started:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/c60f2d286cca1b53dc4a30f52f70ca80da94835ae2297b81e3ec14893b86046b-18001013-07-18-2025-11-38-am-1752863926860.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/echoes-of-the-plum-grove-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Echoes of the Plum Grove</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 20% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cozy farming sim genre has been thriving in recent years, and Echoes of the Plum Grove adds to the formula by letting you experience multiple generations. Initially, you wash up on an island shore and start with a modest plot of land. Over time, you can expand your homestead, start a family, and grow that family. You can befriend or insult your neighbors, form an alliance with a local witch coven, or poison people who cross you. As the generations pass, these decisions will shape your descendents’ experiences and ultimately define your legacy. The game world is fully hand drawn, with 2D characters in 3D environments that heighten the cozy feel. And while forming relationships through the generations is the central core of the game, there are also mysteries across the island for you to uncover.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/27a7c9cc1a10206916f1d18b8d7340a182f602a5c43711113b15024ecec6d14f-18001013-07-18-2025-11-39-am-1752863980107.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dark-deity-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Dark Deity</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 75% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Deity is a strategy RPG that was clearly inspired by classics of the genre. You build up an army, lead your soldiers in turn-based combat, and choose what classes to promote them into as they grow stronger. There are 30 playable characters, and if one of them falls in battle, they’ll suffer grave wounds that drop their stats. So you need to be careful and strategize as you lead your squad from rookies to heroes. The main story is told across 28 chapters that take more than 20 hours to complete, and the “Suns Out, Swords Out” DLC is also available for 20% off as part of the current sale. It adds seven additional levels, each telling a story from before or after the events of the base game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/778f5d494b38cab2cc5e5e2d834aec4594c160ff025b2e40e10e42c8ad85a29d-18001013-07-18-2025-11-40-am-1752864071071.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/coromon-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Coromon</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 50% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another modern game that takes inspiration from and builds upon the classics of the genre, Coromon is a monster tamer with more than 100 monsters to catch and train. Each monster is defined by its element, traits, and skills. The battle system is stamina-based and every skill costs SP, so you need to be strategic about when you use your most powerful skills. Meanwhile, traits are inherent to a monster and can trigger when certain conditions are met. They don’t sap stamina when they trigger and differ between monsters of the same species, so they can be an important factor of building your perfect team. The story of Coromon takes you across six biomes as you try to stop a mysterious threat, and there are more reveals and plot twists than you might expect in a typical monster tamer.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/aaed8882d691d0f6920791bbe29c0276e710ec58867defd9b941d8d906bb9d69-18001013-07-18-2025-11-41-am-1752864126105.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cat-cafe-manager-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Cat Cafe Manager</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 40% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game titles don’t get much more clear than this one. In Cat Cafe Manager, you … manage a cat cafe. You inherit an old, rundown cafe in the town of Caterwaul Way, and you’ll need to rebuild and renovate it to give the local stray cats a proper home. You can decorate and expand the space to fit your personal tastes, as well as hire new employees and refine their skills. You can make plenty of feline friends, but you’ll build relationships with humans too. It is a cafe, after all. The villagers will want to stop by and take a load off after a long day, and you can travel across the town to chat with the locals and discover new recipes and other opportunities for your cafe. Who knows, you might even uncover a mystery or two in need of solving.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/52131427f1e6fcb529f5060bd6c12056d8129d7565f008ae75862f7cdbe37ee1-18001013-07-18-2025-11-42-am-1752864169029.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/9-years-of-shadows-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>9 Years of Shadows</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 35% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, for something completely different. 9 Years of Shadows is a side-scrolling Metroidvania where color has been drained from the world for almost a decade (hence the name). You play as Europa, a warrior bent on fighting her way to the mechanical giant Talos and stopping the corruption seeping out of it before everything is swallowed in darkness. You’ll befriend a cute floating bear called Apino who has the ability to bring back color, and together you’ll wield elemental armors, restore vibrant hues, and try to free the world from the colorless curse that plagues it. And as you do, enjoy a soundtrack from composers Michiru Yamane and Norihiko Hibino, known for their work on Castlevania and Metal Gear Solid, respectively.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/73436094b39ccee444a40a85b45e169ce1b377fc45f7a3f150c57e4197ab78cd-18001013-07-18-2025-11-43-am-1752864212426.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mail-time-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Mail Time</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 30% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our list ends by circling back around to a cozy, relaxing game. Mail Time is a cottagecore adventure set in a whimsical forest where you’re a courier who uses light platforming to deliver letters. You can customize the look of your character and run, jump, and glide your way across the forest to make deliveries to the critters who live there. Relaxation is the focus of the game, with gameplay that doesn’t saddle you with anything stressful. There’s no time limits, pressure, danger, or fall damage. You can just chill, make your deliveries, upgrade your gliding, and do it again. Simplicity can be nice sometimes.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/6-diverse-games-in-the-indieio-publisher-sale-on-nintendo-switch]]></content:encoded>

The promotional images don't do a great job of displaying the colors. After receiving the case recently, I can confirm that it's forest green, similar to Link's iconic tunic.</p><p>The case was designed for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original Switch Pro Controller</a> and Joy-Cons with a grip attached.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbc-firebreak-will-get-its-first-major-update-in-september-remedy-understands-the-opening-hours-are-%E2%80%9Cfrustrating%E2%80%9D.1247670/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/">FBC: Firebreak</a> is the first stab at making a multiplayer game that Remedy Entertainment has taken, so it's not the biggest surprise that things haven't been smooth sailing from the jump. In its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536607976683733002">latest blog post on the game's Steam page</a>, Remedy acknowledged the issues players are having with the game, including the fact that its opening hours can be fairly frustrating.</p>



<p>Remedy also confirmed that its first major update, which it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-details-two-major-updates-coming-in-fbc-firebreaks-post-launch-roadmap/">previously set to arrive sometime in Fall 2025,</a> will launch this coming September, though it didn't provide a specific date.</p>



<p>"<em>The weeks since launch have given us a huge amount of feedback, from you, the community, as well as reviews, and the data we are looking at</em>," the post reads<em>. "We've seen many players come into the game and leave within the first hour. And that's because our first hour can be frustrating; you feel ineffective and confused as to what to do. This needs to be improved."</em></p>



<p>"<em>For many of you already playing FBC: Firebreak, us focusing on the opening experience may seem less exciting, but to keep the game healthy (and your matchmaking fast), we need to bring in more people with a better first-time experience than before.</em>"</p>



<p>Remedy goes on to say that it will introduce more narrative onboarding for players who are hungry for more information about the world in which FBC: Firebreak exists, the same world as Control and Control 2, the latter of which is arguably the game that players are most excited to see from Remedy. It also says that it intends to improve the "<em>pop-up tips you receive while playing by offering important information at relevant times</em>."</p>



<p>The studio also confirms that it will be adding three new heavy guns to the game as part of its efforts to change how weak the gunplay can feel off the top. It also plans "<em>to drop all 'generic' upgrades from equipment (guns and tools) and start players with a playable and powerful version of everything a Firebreak needs from the beginning</em>."</p>



<p>Remedy is working on a Mod system to replace those more "<em>generic</em>" upgrades which the studio says will let you tweak weapons and how they become more powerful over time based on how you want to play. More about this new system will be revealed with the update in September.</p>



<p>Remedy will also be making "<em>big changes</em>" to Jobs and their content, starting with the Clearance and the Corruption levels being replaced by "<em>pre-made, exciting (you'll have to take our word for that for now) variations of Job experiences that can still be short or long or filled with Corrupted items, but also a whole lot more</em>."</p>



<p>It will also introduce a new Job with the September update, and the team is also currently looking at ways in which it can create more variety in the things to do in FBC: Firebreak, and to add more to the game.</p>



<p>"<em>We are pushing a lot of improvements and changes into the game for our first major update. Some of these ideas were improvements we weren't able to add before launch, but all were decided on and developed based on what we heard from you (listening to feedback) and seen from you (looking at data). We are extremely excited about these changes and about delivering even more than we'd originally been planning, but changes now also mean changes later. We need to see what's working for you and to hear from you again before we can be certain that we're prioritizing the right things</em>."</p>



<p>Last month, The Game Business reported that Ampere Analysis claimed Firebreak had only <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-reportedly-has-just-under-250k-players-while-junes-other-major-releases-like-fbc-firebreak-dune-awakening-and-rematch-all-exceed-1m/">managed 1.3 million</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-reportedly-has-just-under-250k-players-while-junes-other-major-releases-like-fbc-firebreak-dune-awakening-and-rematch-all-exceed-1m/">players</a> in its opening week, and while that's not exactly anything to scoff at, it's below what a modern multiplayer game needs to survive. There's also the fact that, because Firebreak is available on Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus Extra, the player count absolutely does not equal copies sold.</p>



<p>FBC: Firebreak might not be going as well as Remedy would have hoped in its opening month, but it's clear that the studio is trying to be transparent with its community and fix elements of the game that it and its community have identified as weak. If it can successfully listen to its community, then Remedy has more than a good shot at making FBC: Firebreak a very successful multiplayer game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-review-a-great-intro.1247667/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Corvus Belli’s recent Fantasy skirmish wargame, <i>Warcrow</i>, released last year with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warcrow-winds-from-north-review" rel="nofollow"><i>Winds of the North starter set</i></a> and followed up with a few <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warcrow-syenann-action-pack-review" rel="nofollow">additional lines of forces</a>, but overall it hasn’t felt like the game truly received the introduction into the world it deserved… until now!</p>

<p>Corvus Belli just sent us an early copy of the newest release, <i>Warcrow</i> Song of the Dormant, and we’re digging in to check it out, see what’s included, and dive into how it plays.</p>

<h2>What’s Included in <i>Warcrow </i>Song of the Dormant?</h2>

<p>The new Battle Pack boxed set includes everything two players need to jump into the game, as it pits the forces of Feudom against the Scions of Yaldabaoth (more on both of these forces shortly). Included in the box set is:</p>

<ul><li>Beginner Rule &amp; Scenario Booklet</li>
	<li>Dice</li>
	<li>Range Rulers</li>
	<li>Cardboard Terrain</li>
	<li>14 miniatures Consisting of:</li>
	<li>1x Verena of Aurtigard</li>
	<li>1x Morgane of JauCret Syzigian</li>
	<li>1x Knight of the Sacred Relic</li>
	<li>4x Feudom Guisarmiers</li>
	<li>1x Uruk, He Who is Without Prejudice</li>
	<li>1x Needle</li>
	<li>1x Breath</li>
	<li>4x Intact</li>
</ul><h2>Who are the Feudom and the Scions?</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-knight-vs-needle.jpg?itok=7tscaUqH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-knight-vs-needle.jpg?itok=QuD3JBOi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Perhaps the most exciting element of the new <i>Warcrow</i> Song of the Dormant Battle Pack is the inclusion of two new factions to the game: Feudom and Scions of Yaldabaoth. But who are they, and what do they fight for?</p>

<p>The Feudom are your very classic holy warriors in a lot of ways. They seem organized (based on the bit of lore included in the instruction booklet) around a series of different realms and leaders, and rely on their faith to grant them strength and power.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-verena.jpeg?itok=WEKsxwXE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-verena.jpeg?itok=tkohYnzj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Verena of Aurtigard leads the Feudom Faction</figcaption></figure><p>Verena of Autrigard, a gorgeous looking miniature, is the High Priestess of this little fighting force, and leans on her imposing presence and connection to her faith to rain down holy punishment on her foes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a culture that relies on the populace to maintain safety and order - in more ways than one, as the rulebook references the toll that heavy taxation in the Feudom has on the everyday person.</p>

<p>But who are they fighting against? Who is it that crawls out of the fog? Meet the Scions of Yaldabaoth, “Dark Minded” elves who have embraced the corruption of magic, all for the pursuit of knowledge, power, and advancement.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-uruk.jpeg?itok=eUuTLTDB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-uruk.jpeg?itok=gSGdshYE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Master Uruk brings forth his forces from the Fog</figcaption></figure><p>They’re unafraid of change, going so far as to augment their bodies! Uruk, He Who Is Without Prejudice is the leader of this fighting force, and his body is so twisted and honed to be a killing machine that he looks unlike anything else on the battlefield.</p>

<p>One thing I love about these miniatures, and which goes a long way toward describing the whole ethos of the Scions, is the description of the Intact. The Intact are described as not yet changing their bodies with transformations, and being so shamed by that fact that they cover their bodies in the bones, skin, and limbs of others!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-guisarmers.jpeg?itok=WNE24tn8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-guisarmers.jpeg?itok=U1ieVYZK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I’ve said from the beginning that, even when the rules could feel a little intimidating at times (not a problem with this new set, as we’ll soon see), the world building is top-notch!</p>

<h2>The Learn-To-Play Experience in <em>Warcrow</em> Song of the Dormant</h2>

<p>The Learn-To-Play experience in <i>Warcrow</i> Song of the Dormant takes big leaps forward for the game, and this feels like a true introduction to the game. The booklet begins with lore for each of the two factions, and then we get right into playing the game.</p>

<p>Assuming you’ve already assembled the miniatures (they’re very easy to assemble, without instructions because it’s mostly intuitive), the tutorial game walks you through every step.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-rulebook.jpeg?itok=FApaebGc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-rulebook.jpeg?itok=XgmNZ3Zf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The rulebook walks you through every step of learning the basics of the game</figcaption></figure><p>You don’t even roll the dice, instead, the booklet tells you what the roll result should be at every point to show you how the game flows. Once you make it through that beginning tutorial, there’s a QR code to scan to get the full rules, but you’ll have most of what you need to keep going!</p>

<p>And from this point on in the booklet, you’ll see a truly well-thought out mini campaign for the two forces as they face off against each other.</p>

<p>There’s lore describing the setting and the stakes involved, and then we crack off into three mounting scenarios, with mission briefings for each side of the battle.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-intact.jpeg?itok=dPsZ3xez 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-intact.jpeg?itok=esJVbQNS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Warcrow Song of the Dormant - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This new Battle Pack is so well-presented, clear, and easy to understand - and the translation into English is the cleanest we’ve seen. I really like the look of all the miniatures in the box, and the inclusion of cardboard terrain is a nice touch.</p>

<p>All in all, this really feels like the introduction that <i>Warcrow</i> deserves, and I believe the game is ready to hit the big-time. If you’ve been curious about <i>Warcrow</i> but haven’t seen a clear path into the game yet, this is the product you should be reaching for - and it should be hitting stockists in late August.</p>

I wasn't planning on picking up the new Nintendo console off the bat, but the incredible reviews of Donkey Kong Bananza convinced me to cave and buy one much earlier than I'd expected. IGN gave the game a rare <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">10 out of 10 review</a> and people are already talking about how it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-game-of-the-year-2025-donkey-kong-bananza-clair-obscur-expedition-33-death-stranding-2">giving GOTY vibes</a> barely a week after release. As a lifelong Nintendo fan, the potential of missing out on a Donkey Kong masterpiece for a full year was just enough to push me over the edge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was first introduced to Donkey Kong in the Super Nintendo days.

Then came <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, which if I remember correctly, actually required an Expansion Pak to function.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was called a  “regurgitated cum bubble” within the first minutes of booting up Gunzilla’s free-to-play battle royale shooter, <em>Off The Grid</em>.

Things only got worse and weirder from there. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196345" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="126" data-playlist="196345,197525,195922" data-current="196345"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21893.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I didn’t know what to expect when booting up <em>Off The Grid. </em>But since launching in early access in October 2024, the game has been marketed heavily on the PlayStation Store and has now leapt to Steam after previously being exclusive to the Epic Game Store on PC. To help promote <em>Off The Grid’s</em> Steam launch, sites like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/polygon-valnet-off-the-grid-gunzilla-rip-this-sucks&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-valnet-off-the-grid-gunzilla-rip-this-sucks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon, IGN,</em> and even <em>Kotaku </em>itself</a></span> ran sponsored posts about the game. These posts championed its frequent updates, “strong following,” and heavily mentioned that <em>District 9 </em>director Neill Blomkamp helped create<em> Off The Grid’</em>s world. So, I decided to finally check out <em>OTG</em>, as the kids call it, and see what this game is all about! </p><p>After an admittedly well-produced intro video, I was introduced to Master Sergeant Cobra, perhaps the most annoying video game man I’ve ever met. After his lovely “cum bubble” insult, he explained the basic premise of <em>Off The Grid</em>. It’s a third-person battle royale in which you try to survive while also finding valuable loot that you can extract mid-game and sell to other players later. More on that in a bit.</p><h2 id="h115224"><a id=""></a><strong>So, what is <em>Off The Grid</em>?</strong></h2><p>Then the game tossed me into a match. And sadly, Cobra was still in my ear, yelling at me, saying things like: “Come on, you chickenshit pussies!” and “Your safe zone is collapsing.” And best of all, you get to hear these same insults over and over. Fun stuff. So happy I’m here.</p><p>The actual gameplay of <em>Off The Grid </em>isn’t groundbreaking. You jump out of a plane, land on a map, find weapons and loot, fight other players, and hopefully end up the last team standing. In my first match, most of the players I encountered seemed to be bots. Looking online, this seems to be a common problem. Also looking online, I spotted a lot of players worried the game was going to get shut down soon because it takes a long time to find matches, and often you get paired with bots. </p><p>When I finally ran into a real player, or what seemed to be a real player, they were dressed like Donald Trump. Trump and Kamala Harris are skins you can buy in the game’s store. Trump’s skin has a “No Woke” sticker. After playing a few matches, I saw a lot of real players running around in the Trump skin. I’ll let you decide what that means about <em>Off The Grid</em>’s playerbase. </p><p>After a few hours of winning and losing, I had figured out what <em>Off The Grid</em> was: It’s a so-so third-person battle royale with a few neat ideas buried under a ton of garbage and bullshit. Gunplay feels snappy enough, but movement feels floaty in a way that makes it hard to control my character. Being able to swap out your limbs on the fly with new ones you find or loot off dead players is cool, and some of the limbs have unique power-ups that can help. Sadly, most of my time in <em>Off The Grid </em>was spent looking for other players to fight and waiting for matches to start. </p><h2 id="h115225"><a id=""></a>Remember NFTs? Gunzilla hopes not</h2><p>In all those previously mentioned sponsored posts advertising the game, they all failed to reveal that this is an NFT/blockchain game. Remember how I mentioned that you can extract loot during matches and sell it to other players? Well, it’s all NFTs, baby. </p><p>I earned a rare arm and sold it for 60 GUN (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gunz/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gunz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gunzilla’s cryptotoken</a></span>) to another player.

It’s a battle royale game with an optional NFT element. If you want to try out NFTs, you can; if you don’t want to, you don’t have to. It’s entirely up to the player how they want to play the game, and the game is playable without dipping into NFTs.</p></blockquote><p>And that’s true, in the sense that you can play games and never do anything with the loot you earn from matches. But that seems to be a big part of the gameplay loop built into<em> Off The Grid</em>, so ignoring NFTs and the player marketplace seems like a bad way to experience the game. </p><p>Of course, the real question is: Do you want to experience<em> Off The Grid</em>? If we ignore the NFT shit, the actual game isn’t much to write home about. I struggled to find real players both before the match started and after I was in the game. Combat is fine, but if I’m going to play a third-person battle royale, I’d rather play <em>Fortnite</em>. And the game’s entire attitude just sucks. Being insulted over and over by the announcer gets old fast, and every inch of the game is filled with the kind of edgy jokes that 13-year-olds repeat after learning a new swear word. </p><p>So, yeah, I guess if you want to grind away at earning fake coins on the blockchain by farming rare loot in a mediocre third-person shooter, you might be the target audience for <em>Off The Grid</em>. For everyone else, throw a dart at a board covered in other battle royale games and play the one you hit instead. At the very least, you won’t have to deal with players dressed as Donald Trump.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/off-the-grid-review-nft-blockchain-crypto-gunz-gunzilla-1851786579]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> supplement's physical release has been delayed. The new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> supplement, the first new supplement for the 2024 ruleset, will not be available on physical bookshelves for a few more months.</p>



<p>In an official post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2019-an-important-update-on-eberron-forge-of-the" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast announced the reason for the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> delay is that the print run of books did not meet their production standards. As illustrated in some screenshots in the post, the books appeared to be satisfactory until the book covers began to warp. Upon closer inspection, it became clear that this defect was present in all printed books.</p>

Since this will take time, the new physical release of the book is now December 9, 2025.</p>

<p>In a somewhat confusing decision, this release will also affect the digital release of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em>. If you have early access to the book, either from pre-ordering or through a D&amp;D Beyond Master Tier subscription, you can access the book's contents two weeks early on November 25. D&amp;D Beyond Hero Tier subscriptions will have one week of early access on December 2.</p>

It will contain updated rules and mechanics set in the Eberron setting, created by Keith Baker.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Everquest</em> maker Daybreak Games is suing the creators of a popular <em>Everquest</em> emulator called <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em>, accusing the company of copyright infringement and other DMCA violations. The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.casd.819107/gov.uscourts.casd.819107.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original complaint</a> was filed in June in a California court and was first <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/06/24/daybreak-is-chasing-everquest-emulator-operators-from-the-heroes-journey-in-court/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by gaming outlet Massively OP</a>. In <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889955351/Prelim-injunction-motion-via-Aftermath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new documents filed this week</a>, Daybreak Games’ lawyers suggest that the existence of <em>The Heroes’ Journey </em>threatens “the very existence of <em>EverQuest</em> itself.”</p><p><em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> is one of dozens of <em>EverQuest</em> servers in operation, the majority of which are made possible due to an open-source project <a href="https://www.eqemulator.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">called <em>EverQuest Emulator</em></a>. It’s the most popular <em>EverQuest</em> server, according to EQ Emulator, <a href="https://eqemulator.org/index.php?pageid=serverlist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with more than 2,000 active users at the time of writing</a>. Some of these fan-run <em>EverQuest</em> servers run with permission from Daybreak Games, such as <a href="https://www.everquest.com/news/project-1999-daybreak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Project 1999</em></a>, which made an agreement with Daybreak Games in 2015. After the lawsuit was filed, one <em>EverQuest</em> emulator called <em>Project Quarm</em> shut down preemptively; it’s now come back online <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectQuarm/comments/1m0816j/project_quarm_has_entered_into_an_agreement_with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with permission from Daybreak Games, so long as it’s not-for-profit</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The key piece for <em>Project 1999 </em>and <em>Project Quarm</em>, for Daybreak Games, appears to be that they’re not-for-profit — meaning they don’t make money, whereas <em>The Heroes’ Journey </em>does, on top of it competing with the original <em>EverQuest</em> game. The other issue, which lawyers explain in the original complaint from June, is that <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> reportedly requires players to run the <em>EverQuest</em> client and mods it to access the unauthorized server. Daybreak Games says the mods “constitute unauthorized derivative works of Daybreak’s copyrighted software and circumvent technological measures implemented by Daybreak to control access to its copyrighted works.”</p><figure><figcaption>from Daybreak Games' lawsuit</figcaption></figure><p><em>EverQuest</em> was originally released in 1999 as a massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Its experience hinges on a lot of people playing it at once; the social element is a core function of the game. <em>EverQuest</em> is free-to-play, though it also has a premium membership plan that gives players different perks. Daybreak Games had previously been denied a temporary restraining order that would have taken <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> offline through the next phase of the lawsuit, and <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.casd.819107/gov.uscourts.casd.819107.29.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later agreed to an order</a> that instead prevented <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> from getting major updates and forced revenue into an escrow account while the lawsuit is ongoing. In Daybreak Games’ latest filing, a motion for preliminary injunction, the company seeks to have <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> taken down because it claims that its existence is a threat to <em>EverQuest</em> due to a reduction in Daybreak Games' <em>EverQuest</em> playerbase; damages for monetary harm aren’t enough, lawyers wrote.</p><p>“At the same time that EverQuest has experienced unprecedented decline, THJ has grown exponentially due to the direct theft of EverQuest users,” lawyers wrote.</p><p>It’s not clear how many players <em>EverQuest</em> currently has, and portions of the documents that discuss it are redacted. (In 2020, <em>EverQuest</em> had 82,000 monthly active players and 66,000 playing members, <a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EG7-Investor-Presentation-Dec-2020-Acquires-Daybreak-Games.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per an earnings report</a>. Aftermath has not been able to locate player numbers in the years that followed.) The newly filed documents imply that the existence of <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> has led to a decrease in <em>EverQuest</em> players; “Since THJ’s launch in late 2024, [redacted],” lawyers wrote. “A decline in user base not only causes a decline in revenue to Daybreak but also damages the entire gaming experience which depends, by definition, on the simultaneous play by thousands of users. This drop in users has irreversible ripple effects across the entire gaming experience, creating a downward spiral that will be impossible to reverse. Each day of delay allows Defendants to continue diverting players and revenue from Daybreak’s legitimate EverQuest service.”</p><p>They continued, “As a result of the damage that Defendants have already caused and are continuing to cause, [redacted.] This is the exact type of irreparable harm that preliminary injunctions are designed to prevent.”</p><p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889955350/Daybreak-vs-THJ-via-Aftermath-filing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a separate filing</a>, Daybreak Games attorney Nicholas Janda spends two pages discussing how much players love <em>The Heroes’ Journey, </em>using comments from YouTube, Reddit, and other social media. “Hands down the best thing that has ever happened to the game,” read one YouTube comment Janda cited. “Never going back to original EQ again.” Another person wrote, as cited by Janda: “The day I started THJ I stopped my EQ subs.”&nbsp;</p><p>Daybreak Games claims <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> has more than 30,000 users. That’s a huge increase since its launch in late 2024; Janda said Daybreak Games received an anonymous email in December 2024 that stated <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> had 2,000 users and was making $20,000 per month. Lawyers are drawing a line that they say shows “a clear correlation&nbsp; between THJ’s growth and the decline in official <em>EverQuest</em> server populations.” Daybreak Games is asking the court to force <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> offline, take its GitHub repositories down, and cease operation of its website while the lawsuit is ongoing.</p><p>“Player departure creates an accelerating effect where each departing [<em>EverQuest</em>] player makes the remaining experience less attractive, encouraging additional departures,” lawyers wrote. “As guild membership declines, group activities become harder to organize, and the social ecosystem that originally attracted players deteriorates.

                <p>In case you've been wondering, Ubisoft is indeed working on a new entry in its long-running Ghost Recon series. The news, which had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-ghost-recon-is-in-development-report/1100-6502229/" data-ref-id="1100-6502229">heavily rumored</a> for a while now, was confirmed by Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot in what sounds like a heated shareholder meeting last week.</p><p>First reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, the confirmation of the the untitled Ghost Recon game came from a question about Ubisoft's history with live-service titles. Touting the company's success with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</a>, Guillemot added, "In addition to the flagship game that I just mentioned, our objective is to also make strong progress in the growing market, generally speaking, by continuing to enhance our current experiences that we offer--and capitalizing on upcoming launches, such as The Division and Ghost Recon."</p><p>Later on, Ubisoft's CFO Frederick Duguet specifically called out the upcoming Ghost Recon title as one of the company's "first-person-shooter-type games," seemingly also confirming that the next entry will be an FPS. Though multiple titles in the franchise have offered first-person perspectives, the Ghost Recon games have largely been presented as third-person shooters since 2006's Advanced Warfighter, making this a significant shift for the series.</p><p>A new first-person live-service Ghost Recon game is not an entirely unprecedented thing. Ghost Recon Wildlands was a huge success for Ubisoft back in 2017, one which the company built upon by quickly following it up with a worse-received sequel, Breakpoint. Despite the difference in their receptions, both of these titles enjoyed a great deal of post-launch support. Ubisoft, in a controversial move, even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-first-nfts-are-like-steam-marketplace-on-the-blockchain/1100-6498699/" data-ref-id="1100-6498699">added NFTs</a>, a form of digital collectible rooted in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, to Breakpoint back in 2021.</p><p>Despite the confirmation of a new Ghost Recon game, neither Guillemot nor Duguet provided any timeframe, suggesting that the title is still a ways out. In the meantime, Ubisoft is keeping busy, spinning off many of its core franchises into a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">new division</a>--which is being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/" data-ref-id="1100-6533205">co-led by Guillemot's son</a>--as part of its terms with Tencent, and finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-assassins-creed-tv-series-moves-ahead-with-halo-sons-of-anarchy-veterans/1100-6533232/" data-ref-id="1100-6533232">greenlighting a Netflix adaptation</a> of its popular Assassin's Creed games.</p>
