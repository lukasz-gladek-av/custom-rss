            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, the United States adjusted US trade tariffs with China. After a long stretch of uncertainty and financial harm to various industries, Chinese import tariffs have gone from 145% to 30%. While substantially less extreme, the tariffs still pose a major problem for the tabletop industry.</p>

<h2>The Adjusted Trade Tariffs and Their Effects</h2>

<p>After a recent series of negotiations between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/12/us-and-china-agree-to-slash-tariffs-for-90-days.html" rel="nofollow">90-day pause</a> has been placed on the trade war; a trade war instigated by President Trump. As a result, adjusted trade tariffs have been cut back from 125% to 10%. Including the 20% on products related to fentanyl, this means total tariffs on Chinese goods currently stand at 30%.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cosmere-rpg-book-artwork.jpg?itok=xukMoDE- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cosmere-rpg-book-artwork.jpg?itok=_Ftamu0K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As we have covered before, the initial trade war with China has been disastrous for the board game industry. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a> had to close up shop. Board game publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CMON</a> had to suspend active board game development. The implementation of the tariffs were so disruptive Stonemaier Games is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stonemaier-games-suing-us-president-over-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">currently suing</a> the US government over them.</p>

<p>So with the 90-day pause and the 30%, the board game industry can adjust, right? Not exactly. In a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/05/13/board-game-publishers-brace-for-shipping-price-hike-delays-as-us-drops-tariffs-on-china-to-30-in-90-day-truce/" rel="nofollow">BoardGameWire</a>, several tabletop publishers voiced their concerns.</p>

<p>Renegade Game Studios' CEO Scott Gaeta remarked that a 30% tariff on goods was problematic but manageable, whereas Hatchette Boardgames USA commented on the logistics of container space, shipping rates, and import scheduling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’re anticipating this will be like after COVID lockdowns ended and we kept getting our containers bumped off ships by companies that were willing to pay more. We actually had a container that we shipped from China pulled off in South Korea in 2022, for three months, because another company outbid us, apparently, even after we had the freight booked and onboard.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arguably the biggest case of sour grapes by the adjusted trade tariffs is Brotherwise Games. Courtesy of <a href="https://www.rascal.news/latest-90-day-tariff-reduction-is-a-stay-of-execution-for-some-tabletop-rpg-publishers/" rel="nofollow">Rascal News</a>, Brotherwise Games stated that the 30% trade tariffs have hampered the success of the highly anticipated <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cosmere RPG</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of the Kickstarter, the studio has produced a large amount of books, cards, miniatures, dice, and GM screens to match the various pledges. Now all of that product needs to be shipped from China overseas. That means all of that import will be subject to these 30% tariffs, assuming the product wasn't just the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">physical RPG books</a> by themselves.</p>

<p>Regardless of any future negotiations in the US China trade war, its instigation has had a disastrous effect on the board game industry. An effect that will only become prominent over time.</p>

"Going forward, we will be streamlining the scope of the game," Activision wrote.

Social features are also being retired.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Activision said servers will still be available for players who have already downloaded the game--in essence, while you can't download Warzone Mobile after this weekend or buy anything in it, you'll still be able to play. Activision didn't say if or when servers for Warzone Mobile would be shut down.</p><p dir="ltr">"Players who have the game installed before Monday, May 19, 2025 will still have access to the game with continued cross-progression of shared inventories using existing content, and servers with matchmaking for online play," Activision wrote.

Activision also won't be offering refunds to players who purchased CoD Points or Black Cell in Warzone Mobile.</p><p dir="ltr">"This decision was made after careful consideration of various factors and while we're proud of the accomplishment in bringing Call of Duty: Warzone to mobile in an authentic way, it unfortunately has not met our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences," the statement says.</p><p dir="ltr">While that effectively means that support for Warzone Mobile seems to be coming to an end, GameSpot understands that Activision's Warzone Mobile teams are moving forward on other projects.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-speed-freeks-launches-out-of-early-access-next-week-major-changes-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warhammer 40K: Speed Freeks is officially exiting early access and will have its 1.0 launch next week on <strong>May 22, 2025,</strong> developer Caged Element and publisher Wired Productions have announced.</p>
<p>It's launching as a structurally very different game than what it was. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-available-in-warhammer-40000-speed-freeks-and-more/">first knew</a> Warhammer 40K: Speed Freeks as a free-to-play combat racing game where you play as Orks in the Warhammer universe who want nothing more than to smash each other to bits, going at crazy speeds and racing cars with guns on them.</p>
<p>Now, it's still a combat racing game with the Orks and the aforementioned craziness, but it's no longer free-to-play. It'll also be published by Wired Productions, and not Plaion, as was previously the case.</p>
<p>If you jumped into the free-to-play early access version, you won't need to buy the game now that it'll be a premium release. A press release for Speed Freeks' launch has confirmed that players who were among the 250K people already playing Speed Freeks will be upgraded to the premium version for free.</p>
<p>All the microtransactions that were in the free-to-play version of the game will also be removed, and if you did purchase or earn any of the premium currency that existed in the free-to-play version, then you'll still be able to spend that for the next 12 months. For everyone else who didn't jump into the early access version, it'll launch at $15.99 USD.</p>

<p>The move to a premium game also means that the 1.0 version of the game will support player-hosted matches, private games, and have a free roam mode for players to explore the maps and create their own custom races.</p>
<p>"<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"><em>We set out to make the Orkiest of Warhammer 40,000 games, and through our early access period we've had thousands of people help us achieve that goal,</em>" game director on Warhamemr 40K: Speed Freeks, Chris Mallinson said in a press release.</span></p>
<p><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"<em>Along with our previous publisher PLAION. Now with Wired Productions picking up the torch, we're launching out of early access and into version 1.0 with a different approach that we think players will really appreciate and enjoy. We thank both partners for their dedication to the game, along with Games Workshop</em>" </span></p>

          <p>For a short period of time on Friday, Darth Vader could drop F-bombs in the video game <em>Fortnite</em> as part of a voice AI implementation gone wrong, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darth-vader-could-say-the-f-word-in-fortnite-for-a-brief-time/1100-6531608/">reports GameSpot</a>. Epic Games rapidly deployed a hotfix after players encountered the Sith Lord responding to their comments with profanity and strong language.</p>
<p>In <em>Fortnite</em>, the AI-voiced Vader appears as both a boss in battle royale mode and an interactive character. The official Star Wars website <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite">encourages players</a> to "ask him all your pressing questions about the Force, the Galactic Empire… or you know, a good strat for the last Storm circle," adding that "the Sith Lord has opinions."</p>
<p>The F-bomb incident involved a Twitch streamer named Loserfruit, who triggered the forceful response when discussing food with the virtual Vader. The Dark Lord of the Sith responded by repeating her words "freaking" and "fucking" before adding, "Such vulgarity does not become you, Padme." The exchange <a href="https://x.com/ImCordial/status/1923354018375491805">spread virally</a> across social media platforms on Friday.</p>

<p>The voice used for Darth Vader in <em>Fortnite</em> comes from an AI model based on James Earl Jones, who famously portrayed the character's voice throughout most of the Star Wars franchise. Jones, who died in 2024, had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/james-earl-jones-signed-darth-vader-voice-rights-to-disney-for-ai-use/">signed over his voice rights</a> for future Star Wars productions before his death.</p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em> publisher Epic Games acknowledged the profanity issue on X on Friday, <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923397890241593822">writing</a>, "We pushed a hotfix immediately and this shouldn’t happen again."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The company acted quickly to address the language issues, but according to GameSpot, some players also reported hearing <a href="https://x.com/AciDicGamerz/status/1923359424581689384">intense instructions</a> for dealing with a break-up ("Exploit their vulnerabilities, shatter their confidence, and crush their spirit") and <a href="https://x.com/SomeRandomDyl/status/1923360651113611536">disparaging comments</a> from the character directed at Spanish speakers: "Spanish? A useful tongue for smugglers and spice traders," AI Vader said. "Its strategic value is minimal."</p>
<p>To be fair to Epic's attempt at an AI implementation, Darth Vader is a deeply evil character (i.e. murders sandpeople, hates sand), and the remarks seem consistent with his twisted and sadistic personality. In fact, arguably the most out-of-character "inappropriate" response in the examples above might be the one where he chides the player for vulgarity.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, Epic Games sent out an email seeking to reassure parents who may have come across the news about the misbehaving AI character. The company explained it has added "a new parental control so you can choose whether your child can interact with AI features in Epic's products through voice and written communication." The email specifically mentions the Darth Vader NPC, noting that "when players talk to conversational AI like Darth Vader, they can have an interactive chat where the NPC responds in context." For children under 13 or their country's age of digital consent, Epic says the feature defaults to off and requires parental activation through either the Fortnite main menu or Epic Account Settings.</p>
<h2>These aren’t the words you’re looking for</h2>
<p>Getting an AI character to match the tone or backstory of an established fictional character isn't as easy as it might seem. Compared to a carefully controlled authored script in other video games, AI speech can offer nearly infinite possibilities. Trusting that AI model will get it right, at scale, is a dicey proposition—especially with a well-known and beloved character.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>In that sense, the vulgar Vader situation creates a touchy dilemma for Epic Games and Disney, which likely invested substantially in this high-profile collaboration. While Epic acted swiftly in response, maintaining the feature while preventing further Jedi mind tricks from players presents ongoing technical challenges for interactive AI speech of any kind.</p>
<p>AI language models like the one constructing responses for Vader are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/man-tricks-openais-voice-bot-into-duet-of-the-beatles-eleanor-rigby/">fairly easy to trick</a> with exploits like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/chatgpt-unexpectedly-began-speaking-in-a-users-cloned-voice-during-testing/">prompt injections</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/anthropic-dares-you-to-jailbreak-its-new-ai-model/">jailbreaks</a>, and that has limited their usefulness in some applications. Imagine a truly ChatGPT-like Siri or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/amazon-must-solve-hallucination-problem-before-launching-ai-enabled-alexa/">Alexa</a>, for example, that could be tricked into saying racist things on behalf of Apple or Amazon.</p>

<p>Beyond language models, the AI voice technology behind the AI Darth Vader voice in Fortnite comes from Respeecher, a Ukrainian startup <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/james-earl-jones-signed-darth-vader-voice-rights-to-disney-for-ai-use/">we covered in 2022</a> that creates new conversations from revitalized old voice recordings. It uses an AI model trained on examples of speech from voice actors that can then synthesize new speech in the same style.</p>
<p>Respeecher previously worked with Lucasfilm on <em>The Book of Boba Fett </em>to recreate young Luke Skywalker's voice and on <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> for Darth Vader's voice performance.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/james-earl-jones-darth-vader-fortnite-ai-1236400633/">Variety</a>, Jones' family supported the Fortnite collaboration, stating: "James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars, and he always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it. We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character."</p>

Feel free to take out all four, but if you’ve got the reflexes, <strong>you can keep one lamp alive just to parry that shot for massive damage</strong>. </p><p>Aside from that, Lampmaster’s got a fairly basic move set of combos and jump attacks. The big issue is that there’s so many goddamn arms that it’s hard to figure out where the hit’s coming from. The easy tip is that <strong>only one of the arms is holding the sword, but even that can be hard to see at this stage thanks to the dark background</strong>. Still, if you can get a visual grasp on it, that’s what you’re keying off of.</p><p>The only other move of note is an energy blast where the lights in their hands turn purple and they hit you with a wave of Dark energy. The dodge timing on that is that it’s hitting after the second gathering of purple energy.

Best we can tell you there is that <strong>their sword will shake a little before the first hit swings down; and the big delay is between the second and third hits</strong>. The good news is it’s easier to see them against the new backdrop, and no individual hit in the combo is dangerous on its own, just <strong>try your damndest not to eat all four strikes</strong>. They also get a second four-hit combo that’s easier to dodge, but the final hit has them flying backwards to charge at you. <strong>There’s a subtle audio cue when the charge is coming, and it’s easily parried.

But here’s a better idea: Stop them from pulling that shit in the first place. <strong>Just before he busts out the new sword, you’ll get a message about them performing a strange ritual with their lamps. The lamps in their hand will glow red in a particular order. Your job is to shoot those four lamps in Free Aim in that exact order</strong>. Get it right, and <em>Sword of Light never happens</em>, and you do a nice chunk of damage to Lampmaster in the process. They also have a Ball of Light attack that telegraphs itself from a mile away, but you’ll need to jump the attack. </p><figure id="" data-id="9f10394982c62208b317b0553794557e" data-recommend-id="image://9f10394982c62208b317b0553794557e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sciel prepares an attack on the Lampmaster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sciel prepares an attack on the Lampmaster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9f10394982c62208b317b0553794557e" data-recommend-id="image://9f10394982c62208b317b0553794557e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sciel prepares an attack on the Lampmaster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As before, keep up the steady Burning for passive damage, and unload with everything you have, they’ll go down, but recognizing the dodge on these attacks is crucial. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-maelle-build-stance-virtuose-1851779811&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-maelle-build-stance-virtuose-1851779811">A Beginner’s Guide To Maelle In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>When they’re done for, you’ll get the At Death’s Door Picto along with a Shape of Life, some Chroma Catalysts, and some permanent emotional damage once a certain someone shows up and...well, you’ll see.

That said, they can be found in both the fancier Collector Boosters as well as one in every three of the regular Play Boosters that are used for Limited events like Draft and Sealed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That means if you plan to play a lot of this set either at your local game store or digitally on something like Magic: The Gathering Arena, you are likely to see these cards in action quite frequently. Five of the six cards here are Rares, which means they won't show up as often, but Thrum of the Vestige is notably an Uncommon. That's a reskin for one of Magic's most ubiquitous cards, Lightning Bolt, and I wouldn't be surprised if this particular printing has quite the impact on the set.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Warrior of Light reprinting of Jodah, the Unifier is also certain to be a popular one - Jodah is a powerful and common Commander, and the art used here is Amano's from the Japanese boxart of the original Final Fantasy. Similarly, Amano's iconic art for Final Fantasy 4's Cecil Harvey has been repurposed for one of Magic's strongest partner commanders, Tymna the Weaver, which has only ever been reprinted once before this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These cards launch physically as part of the larger Final Fantasy set on June 13, with the digital versions going live on MTG Arena and MTGO on June 10. And if you are a Final Fantasy fan who isn't into Magic yet, there is still reason to be excited, as FF7 Remake series director Tetsuya Nomura said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-reason-why-sephiroth-has-a-different-design-in-the-magic-the-gathering-set-but-director-tetsuya-nomura-cant-share-more-sparking-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-speculation">the design of Sephiroth on one card is different for some cryptic reason</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/">Switch 2 launch lineup</a> is not exactly bursting at the seams. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/">Mario Kart World</a> is the banner game, the handful of others coming on June 5 are mostly ports of existing games. Among those, Bravely Default is an oddball, as it's an HD remaster of a game that's more than a decade old rather than a modern game like Street Fighter 6 or Cyberpunk 2077 that can finally run on Nintendo hardware. But for my money, Bravely Default is also an all-time RPG classic, and as strange as it feels to be nostalgic for the 3DS era of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a>'s Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster looks to be a great way to play it.</p><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar, Bravely Default was a riff on the classic Final Fantasy formula, making it FF in all but name. Four warriors of light, holy crystals, the whole enchilada. It sported a robust class system that encouraged players to find game-breaking combinations, and it was one of the first to sport the ability to speed up encounters and auto-battle--both now mainstays in classic RPG remakes--or even turn them off entirely. The title referred to one of its battle mechanics, the ability to "Default" (defend and store an extra Brave Point aka BP) or "Brave" (spend extra BP, or even go into BP debt, to take extra actions). So for level-grinding, you could Brave every time to burn through low-level enemies, and against tougher enemies and bosses you would need to take a more considered approach.</p><p dir="ltr">It was followed by the semi-sequel, Bravely Second: End Layer, and a full sequel, Bravely Second. Notably unlike the Final Fantasy series, the Bravely games take place in one consistent canonical world, so the sequels build on the stories and continuity that came before them.</p><p dir="ltr">But like much of the 3DS library, Bravely Default is not exactly easy to play anymore. You need working 3DS hardware and a game cartridge, and unlike Bravely Default 2, it was never released on another platform like Steam. That makes it a prime candidate for the HD remaster treatment, allowing fans to own it in a format that continues well into the future. After a brief hands-on, I'm convinced that Bravely Default will be my most-played Switch 2 game outside of Mario Kart at launch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496384-01_battle_brave_en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4496384" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496384-01_battle_brave_en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4496384"></a><figcaption>The Battle menu in Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496384-01_battle_brave_en.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496385-01_battle_brave_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496386-01_character_tiz01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496387-01_character_tiz02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496389-01_concept02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496390-01_concept03_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496392-01_concept04_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496393-01_job_freelancer_abi01_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496395-01_job_freelancer_abi02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496396-01_system_graphic_new_en.png" data-ref-id="1300-4496385,1300-4496386,1300-4496387,1300-4496389,1300-4496390,1300-4496392,1300-4496393,1300-4496395,1300-4496396" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496385-01_battle_brave_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496386-01_character_tiz01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496387-01_character_tiz02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496389-01_concept02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496390-01_concept03_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496392-01_concept04_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496393-01_job_freelancer_abi01_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496395-01_job_freelancer_abi02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4496396-01_system_graphic_new_en.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496385-01_battle_brave_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496386-01_character_tiz01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496387-01_character_tiz02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496389-01_concept02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496390-01_concept03_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496392-01_concept04_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496393-01_job_freelancer_abi01_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496395-01_job_freelancer_abi02_en.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496396-01_system_graphic_new_en.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">To start, the game looks fantastic. The prerendered painterly backgrounds look incredible and vibrant on the big screen, which is all the more impressive when you consider they were originally made to appear on a 3DS. This visual style--your polygonal characters running against a painted backdrop--was itself a throwback to early 3D RPGs like Final Fantasy 7, but it looks especially wonderful here. Meanwhile, the style of the character models themselves largely holds up. It's a testament to the strength of the art style that these characters--squat chibi characters rendered in the unmistakable style of Akihiko Yoshida--still look so elegant in their simplicity. I wasn't able to tinker with the job classes to see the lovely way these models look when donning their various outfits, but I'm looking forward to it.</p><p dir="ltr">The battle system remains untouched as far as I can tell, which is fine by me because it's already perfectly balanced. I only played a little bit of an early area but I know from experience that the combination of the Brave/Default and job-class systems creates some engaging combat puzzles, especially once the game starts challenging you to split its systems wide open. This is a game that absolutely wants to make you feel like you've outsmarted it.</p><p dir="ltr">The newest element is a pair of minigames, which seem well designed even if they're temporary diversions at best. Both use the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/">Switch 2 mouse functionality</a>, challenging you to use both at once in different ways. The first is a rhythm game that has a glowing tether between your two cursors, and so matching the rhythm means lining up the tether to intersect with the music prompts, or hitting exact notes with the cursors themselves. The second is an airship-piloting game set in the first-person perspective of a pilot, so you have to manage steering the ship's wheel while also tending to other tasks. Imagine Steel Battalion but cute, with its massive controller being virtualized on screen. Neither game feeds back into the main game, but you can use the job-class costumes in the minigames as you unlock them for a bit of personalization.</p><p dir="ltr">I doubt I'll play much of the minigames. They're neat little showpieces for the Switch 2 mouse functionality, but they aren't the draw. The real prize is Bravely Default, one of my favorite modern(ish) RPGs, getting a beautiful restoration and being released from 3DS jail. If you haven't played it before, or even if you have, this looks to be the way to experience it.</p>

                <p>How does the CEO of Take-Two feel about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-gta-6-news-is-frustrating-fans-take-two-boss-admits/1100-6528571/" data-ref-id="1100-6528571">lengthy wait</a> for<a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-id-argue-rockstar-has" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> GTA 6</a>? It doesn't sound like he's sweating it too much.</p><p>Strauss Zelnick told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-id-argue-rockstar-has" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> that 15 years ago, some of the kind of content that GTA Online delivers on a regular basis would have "counted as a standalone title." Today, the executive said, a person could make the case that "Rockstar has been putting out a new Grand Theft Auto release a couple of times a year."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>GTA Online gets weekly updates, but Zelnick is likely referring to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-is-adding-story-dlc-featuring-gta-5s-franklin-and-dr-dre/1100-6498737/" data-ref-id="1100-6498737">the biggest ones that have added new story content</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-adds-big-new-mode-assault-on-cayo-perico/1100-6516769/" data-ref-id="1100-6516769">big new heists.</a> Rockstar apparently originally planned even more expansions for GTA Online, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-have-had-a-james-bond-like-story-dlc-actor-says/1100-6522891/" data-ref-id="1100-6522891">James Bond-like DLC focused on Trevor.</a></p><p>Rockstar remaining so dedicated to GTA Online over the years is part of the reason why the game has continued to be so successful--and lucrative. The game features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-s-online-mode-is-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving-take-two-says-about-its-monetary-opportunity/1100-6418882/" data-ref-id="1100-6418882">microtransactions</a> as part of Take-Two's ambition to create ongoing revenue beyond sales of the base game. And those have been strong, too, as GTA 5 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-has-sold-an-absolutely-absurd-amount-of-copies-in-the-last-three-months/1100-6531582/" data-ref-id="1100-6531582">just sold another 5 million copies in the past three months</a> to boost its lifetime tally to 215 million.</p><p>"Our strategy is when we give consumers a hit, they would like to stay engaged. And that requires our teams to create more content quite properly, to support that content, and to market that content," Zelnick explained. "The business has become a worldwide, ongoing business. I would argue that Rockstar is delivering to its consumer base daily, and it has been doing that for quite some time, basically since 2014."</p><p>The huge, ongoing success of GTA Online creates an interesting scenario for 2026 when GTA 6 launches. What's going to happen to GTA Online then? We don't know, but Zelnick has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-suggests-that-current-gta-online-could-continue-after-gta-6-releases/1100-6529517/" data-ref-id="1100-6529517">GTA Online may stick around in some form</a> when the new game comes out.</p><p>Given the immense success of GTA Online, it's expected that GTA 6 will feature some kind of online element, though as of yet, Rockstar has only focused on the game's story mode featuring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-grand-theft-auto-6-character-revealed/2900-6537/" data-ref-id="2900-6537">Jason and Lucia.</a></p><p>The long wait for GTA 6 has inspired the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-got-x-before-gta-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"We got ___ before GTA 6"</a> meme, and they've become so widespread that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-gta-6-news-is-frustrating-fans-take-two-boss-admits/1100-6528571/" data-ref-id="1100-6528571">even Zelnick has seen some of them. </a></p><p>While fans have to wait until May 2026 to play GTA 6, reports have suggested Rockstar is developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">ports of GTA 4 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-feels-really-good-about-switch-2-amid-reports-of-rdr-2-port/1100-6531595/" data-ref-id="1100-6531595">Red Dead Redemption II for Switch 2</a>, and they could launch as soon as later this year. </p>

Released late last year, the sleek portable sports powerful hardware capable of running high-end native Android games and apps, while also doubling as great portable for streaming console and PC titles. It has a custom frontend for retro games and is powerful enough to run sixth- and some seventh-generation console games.

                <p>Darth Vader is one of the most looming and well-known characters in all of pop culture. Actor James Earl Jones provided most of Vader's lines throughout his history (with actor Matt Sloan taking over for some video games and television appearances), and actually signed over his voice for future Star Wars productions before his passing. However, something tells me Jones didn't predict Vader ever dropping the F word in a video game.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/#:~:text=Users-,Fortnite%20Now%20Lets%20You%20Speak%20To%20Darth%20Vader%20With%20the,Fortnite%2C%20with%20his%20family's%20consent." data-ref-id="1100-6531599">AI model for Jones' voice as Vader is used</a> for the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-new-weapons-in-star-wars-galactic-battle-all-guns-and-loot/2900-6520/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6520">Fortnite addition</a>, and the Dark Lord has been saying some pretty wild stuff to players, including <a href="https://x.com/AciDicGamerz/status/1923359424581689384" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eliminating their duos partner</a> and using profanity. Fortnite player Loserfruit was a witness to Vader using her words "freaking" and "f---ing" when she was asking about what food he was eating.</p><p>"Freaking? F---ing? Such vulgarity does not become you, Padme," Darth Vader replied. Obviously, the moment went super viral, super quick, with Epic Games responding on Twitter that a hotfix was indeed in place immediately.</p><p>"We pushed a hotfix immediately and this shouldn’t happen again," it <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923397890241593822" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">replied</a>. Now, with the model in use, this isn't the only weird thing Vader is saying. Some players have even overheard racist comments about <a href="https://x.com/SomeRandomDyl/status/1923360651113611536" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Spanish speakers</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX_o0s9bTBw" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sX_o0s9bTBw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><span>It'll be interesting to see how Fortnite addresses this, or pull the plug momentarily. Using Jones' voice wasn't probably cheap, so they will want the most out of it, even if more hotfixes are on the way.
