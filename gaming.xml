                <p>Nintendo Alarmo is now available to <a href="https://howl.link/kgeoewucx9jdb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17401681870318?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">purchase for $100 at Best Buy</a>. The Nintendo-themed interactive alarm clock first released in October at the Nintendo Store, but you needed a Switch Online membership to buy it. At that time, Nintendo said Alarmo would launch at major retailers in March 2025. The quirky accessory has arrived a bit earlier than expected.</p><p>Alarmo is currently only available at Best Buy (and the Nintendo Store). That said, we'd expect the gamified alarm clock to pop up at other major retailers soon, including Walmart, Target, and GameStop. It's possible Amazon will sell it, too. While the online retail giant doesn't carry Nintendo Switch products at this time, it still stocks a wide variety of official Nintendo merch.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3181" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Nintendo Alarmo" data-collection="" title="[Various] Nintendo Alarmo">             <h2>                    <a href="https://howl.link/kgeoewucx9jdb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17401681870318?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/kgeoewucx9jdb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17401681870318?u1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/kgeoewucx9jdb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17401681870318?u1=subid_value">Nintendo Alarmo - Interactive Alarm Clock</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://howl.link/kgeoewucx9jdb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17401681870318?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/kgeoewucx9jdb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17401681870318?u1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/kgeoewucx9jdb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17401681870318?u1=subid_value">$100</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Mario-red alarm clock has a dynamic front display and built-in speaker.

            <p>
Marvels Rivals, which has been a huge success for publisher NetEase since its launch last year, reportedly almost didn't make it to release. It's claimed the company considered cancelling the project because its CEO objected to paying Disney for use of its characters.
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/netease-s-billionaire-ceo-slashes-jobs-and-games-in-profit-push">according to a new Bloomberg report</a> detailing NetEase chief exective officer William Ding's recent strategic upheaval - which has included sweeping jobs cuts, studio closures, and a pulling back on international investment - amid slow growth for the company and a decline in topline results over the last two and a half years.
</p>
<p>
It's claimed Marvel Rivals - which has reportedly now generated over $200m for NetEase since its launch last December - was also in Ding's sights prior to its release. According to Bloomberg, discussions of its cancellation arose after Ding objected to paying Disney for the use of its popular Marvel characters - with the CEO at one point reportedly asking artists to swap in NetEase's own character designs. Those efforts were eventually aborted.

<p>
The decision - described as being "emblematic of the abrupt changes ushered in by the CEO" by Bloomberg's sources - is said to have ultimately cost NetEase millions of dollars, although a spokesperson denied the account in a statement shared with the publication, insisting the company had "enjoyed a close partnership with Marvel" since 2017.
</p>
<p>
Over the last year, Ding's shifting strategy has impacted multiple studios in the west. In November, for instance, BioWare veteran Mac Walters <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">announced a "pause" in operations</a> at his NetEase-backed Worlds Untold, and Jar of Sparks - a first-party NetEase developer founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">halted work in January</a>, laying off staff. 
</p>
<p>
This week also saw NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-microsoft-muse-ai-xbox-avowed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What a week Microsoft has had. On one hand, it published a clear game of the year contender in <a href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-subtitles-lore-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Avowed</em></a>, a fantasy role-playing game jam-packed with surprises and inventive touches. On the other, it <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-muse-ai-phil-spencer-dipshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Muse</a>, a game-making tool no one asked for that serves as additional proof that generative AI’s time is running out. The contrast here is stark: <em>Avowed </em>is such a revelatory experience in large part because its world feels <a href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-dawnshore-lighthouse-obsidian-microsoft-xbox-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meticulously crafted</a> by a human team with a specific vision in mind. Tools like Muse threaten to displace those people. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>We begin the episode champing at the bit to talk about <em>Avowed</em>, but first, The News: NetEase shocked the game-playing public by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-director-and-entire-seattle-design-team-laid-off-netease-tells-fans-not-to-worry-about-the-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off</a> members of the team behind <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, the biggest breakout success story to come out of the live service sector in years. What happened? Well, decaying relations between the United States and China, for one, but also a seismic <a href="https://nikopartners.com/chinese-video-game-companies-are-adapting-their-us-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shift in how Chinese companies are developing games</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we discuss Microsoft’s new Muse AI, which it intends on shoehorning into game development projects – a plan you will not be surprised to learn that nobody likes! Game developers <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/xbox-muse-generative-ai-developers-say-nobody-will-want-this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">least of all</a>! This is especially pertinent considering that Microsoft just published <em>Avowed</em>, a fantasy role-playing game that’s so good because it was crafted by human hands in a way that feels tangible for every second of the experience.&nbsp;</p><p>We then talk about all the things we like about <em>Avowed</em>: The world design, the combat, the (slightly wonky) progression, and even the fact that your main character is a weird-looking cop who everyone regards with suspicion. Lastly, we decide which game console would work best as a house (Gamecube for humans, PlayStation 4 or 5 <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-repairmen-explain-why-cockroaches-love-ps4s-1794393470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for roaches</a>).</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can write so many blogs about <em>Avowed </em>that companies will finally attempt to succeed at the Video Game Industry Value People Challenge (Impossible).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> [Microsoft] might as well just be an AI company at this point. They have services – whatever. The degree to which Microsoft is all in on this shit is so troubling that I worry from an existential perspective what happens when it all drops out. I wonder what happens to the game studios, I wonder what happens to Xbox, I wonder what happens to the very good games they seem to be investing in. It’s gonna tank a lot of things, and I know it’s small-minded to narrow it down to just this thing, but I’m looking at what’s in front of me, and I don’t want to lose that.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> The [Muse] announcement almost felt like it was under duress, like it was a hostage video in some ways. Not Phil Spencer’s performance and input specifically, but just the packaging around the whole thing suggests that Microsoft is so overextended on AI.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> They’ve got to put it in everything, in every corner of their business.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Yep. “Xbox, it’s your turn. You need to come up with something. We need a name for it. We need some videos. Sell AI.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The crux of all of this – and this was true with <a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-ai-demo-imagination-creation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA’s AI demonstration last year</a>, too; the one with all the cardboard boxes that looked like dogshit – is that companies keep going back to this notion of “We’re going to give you something that will help you come up with ideas.” That’s the one thing nobody is lacking! There are so many ideas! There are too many ideas!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Have you ever talked to a stranger at GameStop? They will give you ideas for video games unprompted.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Admittedly, they’re not very good, but…&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Yeah, often with the caveat of “I don’t know how to program or do much of anything, but…” But there’s no shortage of imagination. It’s not the expensive thing you need to automate. This is the thing: Games are so hard to make well that all they have is, like, a Magic Eight Ball or whatever the fuck they’re coming up with. It’s bad.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think it’s especially pertinent because we’ve all been playing <em>Avowed</em>, and one of the standout qualities of it is that it feels very deliberately handcrafted. You can feel the human touch of that entire studio everywhere you go in that game. And I saw somebody on Bluesky talking about it last night, saying that, in some ways, because it feels so designed, it does add this element of artificiality to it. It feels like a video game. But that’s not a bad thing in this case. I think it really accentuates the game's positive qualities.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>The number one way they’re probably describing that is that you associate a game in that engine and in this setting with being a sprawling open-world <em>Skyrim </em>or <em>Witcher </em>kind of thing where you can ride your horse or walk around for days on end and not see anything.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> And you have all these big, empty landscapes.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>This is a theme park RPG. This is a small open world, and you cannot walk over a hill or turn a corner without running into someone who’s in trouble or a bunch of mushroom monsters or something like that. There’s no vast wilderness here. There’s something everywhere. Because it’s not trying to be a realistic landscape, it’s like “This is a video game. You’ve got swords and spells, and you want to hit shit, and you want to kill things, and you want to save people. We are gonna put this stuff everywhere, and it’s gonna be super cool because you can do something at all times.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> And [Obsidian is basically saying] “It’s gonna be so rich with things that we have written, that matter to us to convey.” The fact that that is everywhere, that it suffuses the whole project, is indicative of where their priorities lie compared to these other open-world games that are very big and sprawling but are maybe lacking in substance in other areas.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-obsidian-magic-gun-combat"><h3>I Love Being A Gun-Wielding Wizard In Avowed</h3></a><p>The only thing more fun than talking my way out of problems is shooting people.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-dei-remove-website-cowards"><h3>IGN’s Parent Company Ziff Davis Removes ‘DEI’ Mentions From Its Website</h3></a><p>Some sections mentioning diversity 'have been removed from the website entirely'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Rivera also officially revealed some new features coming to 2XKO. One major change will see the game's Pulse Fuse (which enables beginner-friendly autocombos) removed. However, autocombo functionality will instead be added as a toggleable option in the game's settings.</p><p dir="ltr">Rivera said this was done for two reasons. The first was so players could take advantage of the game's powerful Fuses while still using autocombos. The other reason is so that when playing as a team, each player could go with their own autocombo preference instead of being locked into using them or not via the Pulse Fuse.</p><p dir="ltr">There is also an entirely new Fuse coming, Sidekick, that will actually remove the tag functionality from Riot's tag-based fighter. Sidekick makes it so a team's point and assist character can't swap places, with the point character gaining bonus health to make up for the fact that they can't be tagged out. It essentially turns one character, or one player if playing co-op, into a support character only capable of using assist attacks, in a way channeling one of the core roles from League of Legends itself.</p><p dir="ltr">"We received a ton of feedback from players who wanted an experience that felt like more of a support role where they could learn the game at their own pace, and we are excited to hear what you all think when you get a chance to check it out in the future," Rivera said.</p><p dir="ltr">2XKO, which will be free-to-play, is slated to release sometime in 2025 but does not have an official release date. Players got their first major hands-on with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2xko-alpha-lab-playtest-players-can-expect-a-decent-amount-of-jank-riot-says/1100-6525611/" data-ref-id="1100-6525611">2XKO as part of its Alpha Lab playtest in August 2024</a>, which was live for a little over a week. At the time, Riot warned players the playtest would have a "decent amount of jank" and work-in-progress elements. Those interested in joining future playtests can sign-up on the 2XKO <a href="https://alpha.2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>.</p>

                <p>Neil Druckmann is one of gaming's biggest names, and he's helped write and direct games in the critically and commercially successful franchises like The Last of Us and Uncharted. But Druckmann isn't always confident in what he's making while he's making it--with one exception.</p><p>During a speech at the DICE Summit recently attended by <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/the-remarkable-banter-of-cory-barlog-and-neil-druckmann-on-the-creative-process/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, Druckmann said only with 2009's Uncharted 2: Among Thieves did he feel "confident" throughout the process. "Every other project where I was at the head of it, I was sure at many points that we were not going to succeed. You just have to power past that feeling," he said.</p><p>Part of what creates anxiety for Druckmann is the scope and scale of any given project, including staff and large budgets. "There's all this pressure," he said. "There's no formula for how to succeed. You can never guarantee success. All you can do is follow your instincts, follow the advice the team gives you, trust the process," he said.</p><p>The "process" for Naughty Dog is how the studios works together and vets ideas, Druckmann said, as well as iterating again and again.</p><p>"We know that our first idea is never the best one. We have to get to the seventh one to get something interesting, something unique. The first few, you've heard of it. It's something you've seen before," he said. "That's how you start to dig deeper. We know we’ll have to throw work away. That's part of our process. At times that can be frustrating for people, members of the team, ourselves. But going through it over and over again, that's how you get past your doubts. Doubt will always be there."</p><p>Druckmann also mentioned how having a schedule is critical to his working process, even if he might not personally enjoy sticking to a strict schedule. "I need it. The team needs it as well, because--it's not unique to me. It's just Naughty Dog. We're perfectionists. Without it we would just keep iterating," Druckmann said.</p><p>Druckmann is now directing Naughty Dog's new IP, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, while he may also be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">The Last of Us 3</a>. Beyond games, Druckmann worked alongside Craig Mazin on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbo-finally-sets-a-date-for-the-last-of-us-season-2/1100-6529601/" data-ref-id="1100-6529601">The Last of Us Season 2, which comes to HBO in April.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/avowed-obsidian-magic-gun-combat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I play fiddly role playing games, I usually like to talk my way out of problems. But what’s really surprised me about <em>Avowed</em> is how fun it is to be a wizard with a gun.</p><p><em>Avowed’s</em> combat systems really intimidated me at first. I’m playing a character with high perception and intelligence, which opens up a lot of interesting conversation options. Between that and the simplicity of just hitting things with a sword and blocking them with a shield, I figured I wouldn’t waste my energy fighting when I didn’t have to.&nbsp;</p><p>I changed my mind on this once I finally got my hands on a gun, inspired by advice from Chris Person. The novelty of having a gun in a robust fantasy world is hilarious enough—but you can also dual wield basically every weapon, as well as mix and match. Putting a grimoire in my off hand and using a pistol as my main weapon, ranged combat becomes a thrill. As enemies rush at me through a narrow corridor, I trap them in place with a spell, then I open my palm and spray them with fire, burning them and giving them a status effect that delivers damage over time. As if that wasn’t enough, I shoot them in the fucking head.</p><p>As a combat-agnostic player, I’ve surprised myself by my willingness to try and re-try combat encounters in <em>Avowed</em>. It isn’t just setting trapped enemies on fire and then putting pellets in their brains, it’s the way that elemental magic works with other characters and on the <a href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-dawnshore-lighthouse-obsidian-microsoft-xbox-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">environment</a>. When you hit enemies with a spell that freezes them, your companions can then shatter them with their own weapons. That same ice spell can also freeze water, giving you temporary platforms to climb to find new vantage points for shooting, burning, freezing and electrifying enemies. The more I play, the more possibilities open up. One unique pistol delivers electric damage, and then can be enchanted to deliver shock damage to nearby enemies. There is nothing that I want more than to be able to add electrocution to my repertoire of trapping, burning and shooting my many enemies in the Living Lands.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/avowed-subtitles-lore-explainer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Talking</a> your way out of problems is still incredibly fun in <em>Avowed</em>, and I won’t stop trying to weasel my way out of combat if I can. With conversation trees this robust, why not exhaust them? But as Teddy Roosevelt once said—speak softly, and carry a big stick.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-microsoft-muse-ai-xbox-avowed"><h3>Microsoft’s New ‘Muse’ AI Is Doubly Bad Because Avowed Is So Good</h3></a><p>"The [Muse] announcement almost felt like it was under duress, like it was a hostage video in some ways"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-dei-remove-website-cowards"><h3>IGN’s Parent Company Ziff Davis Removes ‘DEI’ Mentions From Its Website</h3></a><p>Some sections mentioning diversity 'have been removed from the website entirely'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Avowed, the latest roleplaying game by Obsidian Entertainment and the first they published under Xbox Game Studios, has been officially out for three days. The first real data on player concurrency will come in this weekend, as the game will presumably reach a new peak on Steam, but in the meantime, Bloomberg has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-21/new-xbox-game-avowed-took-six-years-two-reboots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a tidbit as part of their interview with Game Director Carrie Patel: Obsidian is happy with sales so far.</p>
<p>In the conversation with Bloomberg, Patel went over the <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-has-had-a-reboot-of-sorts-and-may-be-further-away-than-anticipated-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reboot</a> that happened in 2021, when she took over from the prior director.</p>
<p><em>I feel like I've learned so much over the past four years that I wish I'd known at the start of this process. It's definitely been a job where the highs are really high and the lows are really low. Normally, if you're stepping back and reevaluating your creative direction, putting together a new vertical slice and revised production plans, you would do that with a very small team. We did not have a very small team at that point. A lot of lessons we learned as we were building Avowed, ideally we would've learned on a small scale with a true preproduction.</em></p>
<p>One of the biggest changes brought by the reboot was downsizing from a Skyrim-like open world to something more akin to the studio's previous productions. On this subject, Patel said:</p>
<p><em>With any game, you think, 'Ok, we can't climb every mountain - which ones are really worth the effort for us? We knew from The Outer Worlds that we could build a really great game with 'open zones', and that also adds some advantages in terms of letting you really theme your areas more distinctly and intentionally, and provide a sense of progression as the player's going from one environment to the next.</em></p>
<p>Patel also ended with a seemingly hopeful sentence about potential sequels for Avowed:</p>
<p><em>Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I'd love to see us do more with it.</em></p>
<p>She previously worked on Pillars of Eternity, so it's likely she was referring not generally to the world of Eora but specifically to this action version rather than those cRPGs. Of course, whether she gets her wish will mostly depend on Microsoft's assessment of the sales and overall reception.</p>
<p>For more about Avowed, including why I think it's a great RPG, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out our review</a>. As a reminder, Obsidian is also working with a separate team on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, which is slated to launch late this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

                <p>Avowed was originally going to have multiplayer components, similar to that of Destiny where players could walk around in a massive world.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-21/new-xbox-game-avowed-took-six-years-two-reboots?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MDE2MDg3MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQwNzY1NjcyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUzFPT0xUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.FhUrXseBBb83k69Ovuo9PgY3sOuBdW-owuWeanAYc5o&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, director Carrie Patel said that Obsidian Entertainment pitched Avowed as a cross between Destiny and Skyrim to prospective buyers, which ended with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-acquires-fallout-new-vegas-star-wars-knights-/1100-6463175/" data-ref-id="1100-6463175">Microsoft purchasing the studio</a>. Avowed's development started in 2018 but went through two reboots, which led Obsidian to scrap its multiplayer component.</p><p>The second reboot occurred in January 2021, when Obsidian replaced Avowed's leadership as they were about to enter production. Patel initiated two major pivots to Avowed, the first of which was to focus on its story and lore from the Pillars of Eternity universe. The second was to replace Avowed's original open world with open-zone ones, similar to that of Obsidian's The Outer Worlds. The latter decision was made so that the development team could create more distinct and denser spaces.</p><p>As a result, the development team had to scale back in creating large and sprawling maps like Skyrim. "We knew from The Outer Worlds that we could build a really great game with 'open zones' and that also adds some advantages in terms of letting you really theme your areas more distinctly and intentionally, and provide a sense of progression as the player’s going from one environment to the next," Patel explained.</p><p>Patel also said that the team is happy with Avowed's sales numbers so far. Although Patel wouldn't reveal what her team's next project is, we do know that Obsidian Entertainment is currently working on The Outer Worlds 2. Initially announced in 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-first-gameplay-trailer-debuts-during-the-game-awards/1100-6528439/" data-ref-id="1100-6528439">Obsidian released its first gameplay trailer at The Game Awards 2024</a>. The game is set for release sometime this year for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Avowed is now available on PC and Xbox Series X|S, as well as Game Pass. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/avowed-review/2300-6465692/" data-ref-id="2300-6465692">Avowed review</a>, we said, "Avowed's impactful and satisfying combat is undone by a widely unbalanced upgrade system and an uninteresting story that wastes its potential."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/south-of-midnight%E2%80%99s-southern-gothic-folklore-world-is-rooted-in-authenticity.1115817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/617373/south-of-midnight-preview-interview-ahmed-best<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It was hard playing a preview of <em>South of Midnight</em> because, 20 minutes in, I just started bawling. The demo for the action-adventure platformer starts at the beginning of chapter three. The protagonist, Hazel, is working her way through a swamp trying to find her mother, who, along with their house, had been washed away in a hurricane. At the same time, she comes to learn her newfound powers as a Weaver — a person who can manipulate the metaphysical strands that connect all life — from the ghostly echoes of an enslaved woman who used her powers to escape to freedom and help others do the same.</p><p>With all that weighing on me, I held it together pretty well. But as I went through the double jump tutorial, a choir started singing a hymn in the background and I just lost it. It wasn’t that it was an emotional hymn; I didn’t even recognize it. But I <em>knew</em> the song was of me and for me even without having heard it before. That’s the kind of cultural weight the developers at Xbox studio Compulsion Games have invested in <em>South of Midnight.</em></p><p>The authenticity that oozes from the game was intentionally cultivated. Its story draws upon American Southern Gothic folklore, which itself is a mix of tales and characters from indigenous, African, Creole, and Cajun traditions. Nailing the tone of such a rich and nuanced tradition in a respectful way was important to the narrative team. “If we’re going to tell the story, we have to go to the source,” Zaire Lanier, a writer on <em>South of Midnight</em>, told me.</p><p>Lanier spoke of the reference trips the development team took to Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Mississippi. She and the other members of the narrative team drew on their own experiences growing up in the American South and consulted with experts versed in Black southern traditions, like award-winning children’s author and storyteller Donna Washington. They applied this principle not just to the game’s narrative, but elsewhere as well.</p><p>“Same thing with the music, our audio director and our composer, we went straight to the source,” Lanier said. She explained how the team consulted with blues and other southern artists and told me that the performance that ultimately caused my joyful breakdown was a Nashville gospel children’s choir.</p><p>Voice and motion capture performance also benefited from Compulsion’s quest for authenticity. “The thing that I really love about Compulsion ... is the fact that they were like, ‘we know what we don’t know,’” said Ahmed Best, director of <em>South of Midnight</em>’s voice and motion capture performance. Best is most known for his role as Jar Jar Binks in the<em> Star Wars </em>prequel trilogy but has spent decades directing films and teaching directing at the University of Southern California. <em>South of Midnight</em> is his first time in the director’s chair for a video game. </p><p>“I was very happy that they were looking for African American voices and direction,” Best said. </p><p>But hiring Black voice performers, as Compulsion did for a lot of the cast — including Hazel and her mother, with Best lending his voice to the project as well — is only half of the equation.</p><p>“Physical behavior is just as much of a storytelling tool as the script,” Best said. He spoke about working on bringing Hazel to life through her movements, right down to the specific way she stands. Nailing something as simple as how an actor stands is a detail most players will likely miss, but for Best, that’s okay. “That’s kind of the point,” he said. “The point is for it to kind of be invisible to everybody else. It’s the subtleties that you capture in motion capture, and it’s the subtleties you capture in voices that really put the authenticity over the top,” Best explained.</p><p>The reason Compulsion’s quest for authenticity comes off so well is a curious mix of humility and ambition. In my conversations with Lanier and Best, they each expressed the sentiment, “we don’t know what we don’t know,” regarding the team’s approach to <em>South of Midnight</em>’s storytelling. Compulsion is headquartered in Montreal, Canada — an area not particularly known for its gumbo, if you know what I mean.</p><p><em>South of Midnight</em> could have been about anything, but its team chose to tell a story rooted in a culture not often depicted in video games. Then, rather than relying on personal anecdotes and generalities to tell that story, Compulsion empowered its developers to go find and heed the subject matter experts. That effort shines so brightly and thoroughly that it got me sobbing on the strength of its 90-minute preview alone — I can’t wait for the full game to utterly destroy me.</p><p><sub><em>South of Midnight</em> launches on Xbox, Game Pass, and PC on April 8th.</sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. While there are plenty of reasons to worry here, the fact of the matter is that there are already spinoff books, games, comics, etc, etc, not to mention the original novels by Ian Fleming. Dozens of writers, actors, artists, and more have tackled James Bond and his extended cast. And with Amazon’s <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/james-bond-amazon-mgm-studios-deal-1236296104/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reported ambitions</u></a> to turn James Bond into a “universe,” a la Marvel and Star Wars, and billions of dollars at stake, the Bond franchise has no time to die.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, this was one of Broccoli’s concerns in giving up the rights, that Amazon MGM would try to expand too quickly or cast a name actor in the role of the secret agent. Will Amazon hold true to these ideals, or are we about to get Timothée Chalamet as the next 007? Likely not the latter (all apologies to Chalamet), but Amazon has already tried to create their own spy franchise with the Russo Brothers produced Citadel, and international spinoffs Citadel: Diana and Citadel: Honey Bunny. Those have generally lacked critical acclaim (except for Honey Bunny), and at least domestically haven’t really broken through to audiences in the same way as other Amazon hits like The Boys.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">…Or more to the point, Amazon’s dudes with guns shows like Reacher, Jack Ryan, and Bosch. In fact, one could posit this is a large part of the reasoning behind Amazon shelling out a billion dollars more to own Bond: some of their most successful series have already been white men, with guns, their names in the title, based on book series. Unlike the money Amazon plunked down for Lord of the Rings (your mileage may vary on how successful Rings of Power has been), buying James Bond outright based on the data available is one of the safest purchases Amazon could make. Prime Video audiences already flock to shows about guys <em>like</em> James Bond, so why not James Bond himself?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One other detail you might not be aware of: Amazon already made a James Bond TV show. Seriously. Titled 007: Road to a Million, the reality game show streamed in 2023, was hosted by Brian Cox, and was picked up for a second season before the first even hit Prime Video. Only tangentially related to Bond by the idea that Cox is playing a pseudo-Bond villain while contestants race to win one million pounds, the series wasn’t a big hit but it does show that Amazon has already played in the TV space with 007. And as just one extra funny tidbit, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/brian-cox-joined-007-road-to-a-million-next-james-bond-movie-1235640137/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Cox thought he was signing up for the next Bond movie</u></a>. He was not, so maybe Amazon could do right by him in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But wait, there’s more! Back in 1954, an anthology series titled Climax! aired the first-ever adaptation of “Casino Royale,” the Ian Fleming novel, before it was later committed to film multiple times. Point being, there’s not <em>much</em> of a history of TV for James Bond, but just as the franchise has had some of its most lauded installments in video games (have you ever played GoldenEye for the N64?), comics, and more, James Bond isn’t quite the sacred cow we think of, when it comes to adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mind you, there have been no announcements that Amazon is forgoing film entirely, and likely they won’t. MGM isn’t the studio it once was, but for every Red One that hits theaters, they still have the Oscar-nominated Nickel Boys. There’s plenty of reason to believe that even without the Broccolis, Amazon MGM will aim to do right by the Bond franchise.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Spy Movies</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And frankly, is there anything that is out of left field about the idea of a franchise extension? While perhaps cutting Bond theatrically entirely and instead doing a TV streaming version of Bond might be the ultimate nightmare of cinephiles, there is a wealth of fascinating characters who revolve around Bond that often have far more chance of character growth than the main character himself. Bond, over decades, has remained relatively static – the recent Craig movies aside – while Q, M, Moneypenny, and even Felix Leiter always seem to have a lot more going on between the scene or two Bond spends checking in with them per film.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Would a series where Q has to go out of the lab and use his own gadgets be so terrible? How about Felix having to deal with the fallout of Bond blowing up the latest supervillain plot on the American side? And given the wealth of villains and henchmen in the Bond universe who have inspired dozens of fanfics, tributes, and knockoffs, an anthology series that gave them each more time in the sun could be a lot of fun. Who hasn’t wondered how Jaws got those jaws?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also an opportunity here to flesh out the character of James Bond through a serialized TV show in a way that has not, for the most part, been afforded the character on the big screen. Aside from the rare instance where Bond suffers a sprained ankle at the beginning of the movie, the character has been functionally immortal, down to switching his face like a Time Lord. It wasn’t until the recent Daniel Craig films that Bond was allowed to have some sort of growth, though even then it was relegated to “bummed about the death of his girlfriend” for the majority of the Craig movies, and “old” in the last one.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/10/07/36190303jamesbond-lasttimeblogroll-1633478033903-1633635928198.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The lone exception is Skyfall, arguably the best Bond movie of all time… Because it truly challenged James emotionally and moved the series forward to almost a logical conclusion. The next movie reset things in many ways, but imagine being able to see that kind of arc over 10, 20, or even 30 episodes (we’re not going to go crazy and suggest a streaming show go a full 22 episodes a season or anything like that)? You likely won’t get 10 Skyfalls in a row, but if you can get some nods to the ambition of that film in there, viewers could be in for something truly special.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The flip side is that Amazon could not look to the obvious – i.e. their dudes with guns shows – and instead take the route of Lord of the Rings, and deliver a prequel all leading up to the birth of James Bond. To that, perhaps they need look no further than Pennyworth, a goofy show with a host of loyal fans that nevertheless confused casual viewers as to why we were getting a show about Batman’s future butler. Or, for example, The Rings of Power, a show with a hot Sauron and virtually no rings in the first season that tested the patience of even the most loyal fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the potential nightmare scenario, that Amazon will think with their algorithm instead of their heart. Even at their worst, there’s a charm the Broccoli family and others managed to bring to the Bond franchise, with the same rhythms, the same big explosion, the same good girl gone bad and bad girl gone good, time and again. In the streaming era, we’re far from the place where you could deliver the poetry of a Bond movie on an episodic basis. To turn it into yet another serialized spy drama (or worse, a serialized prequel spy drama) risks making it lose that specialness and instead slot in with Netflix’s The Night Agent, The Diplomat, and The Recruit, or god help us Citadel, instead of being its own, unique thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the trick, really, and it is with any potential cinematic universe: what makes it different? In Bond’s case, up until now, it was that it existed mostly on the big screen, every few years, and delivered a level of action spectacle and plot comfort that TV has been creeping on for decades. If Amazon does want to turn the house Ian Fleming built into a multi-platform franchise, then they need to reckon with what makes Bond so unique. If they can figure that formula out, and perhaps build out that supporting cast, too (Ben Whishaw in a Q series? Come on!), then rather than the death sentence some fans have called this deal, the Bond franchise will die another day.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

But a new report suggests that NetEase CEO and founder William Ding nearly canceled the game due to a reluctance to use licensed IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/netease-s-billionaire-ceo-slashes-jobs-and-games-in-profit-push" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comes from Bloomberg</a>, and describes the current situation at NetEase: Ding is actively cutting jobs, closing studios, and withdrawing from investment overseas. The goal, per the report, is a smaller, tighter portfolio that can stave off a recent growth decline and compete with rivals Tencent and MiHoYo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of that shrinking, Bloomberg reports, almost included canceling Marvel Rivals. According to one source, Ding didn't want to pay for the use of licensed Marvel characters, and tried to persuade artists to use original designs instead. An attempted cancelation allegedly cost NetEase millions, but the game released anyway to its current success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the shrinking continues. Just earlier this week, we learned that the Marvel Rivals Seattle team <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-director-and-entire-seattle-design-team-laid-off-netease-tells-fans-not-to-worry-about-the-game">was laid off</a>, with the company claiming this was for "organizational reasons." And over the last year, Ding has ceased investment in overseas projects, having previously invested heavily in Japanese and Western studios like Bungie, Devolver Digital, and Blizzard Entertainment. The report suggests that Ding believes games that won't generate hundreds of millions per year are not worth the company's time, though a company spokesperson told Bloomberg that NetEase doesn’t set "arbitrary blanket numbers for determining the viability of a new game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Workers speaking to Bloomberg also painted a portrait of trouble internally at NetEase, centered around Ding's volatility as a leader. Per this account, Ding is quick to make decisions and changes his mind often, has pressured staff to work late, recently hired a number of recent graduates into prominent leadership roles, and has allegedly shut down so many projects that NetEase may not release any games in China next year at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase's withdrawal from games investment comes at a time of ongoing uncertainty in the games industry, especially in the West. <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2023" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple</a> <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">years</a> <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">running</a> have seen mass layoffs, cancellations, and studio shut downs, alongside a number of expensive and high-profile games flopping despite high company expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

While this change didn't end up happening, the wasted effort reportedly cost millions of dollars. However, a NetEase spokesperson denied this account, explaining that the company and Marvel have had a close relationship since 2017.</p><p>The sudden layoff of US-based Marvel Rivals developers despite the game's massive success raised questions among fans.
