<p>Larian has revealed that the long-awaited seventh patch for Baldur’s Gate 3 will start rolling out next week. It’ll be deployed first on PC, with the team stressing that ‘it’ll take a little longer’ to apply the update on console. Patch 7 has been talked about for a few months, but now that it’s finally here, it’s about to bring countless changes and additions to the game.</p>

<h2 id="h-supporting-mods">Supporting Mods</h2>



<p>Larian confirmed several weeks ago that ‘Patch 7’ will contain official mod support, which is a boon for PC players worldwide. This includes support and various tools for modders to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the more dastardly players out there will be pleased to learn that Patch 7 introduces fresh cinematics and tweaks for the game’s ‘evil’ endings. </p>



<p>As you might expect, Patch 7 will also deliver a host of quality-of-life changes and some optimisations on the companion front. It’s believed that this could be one of the final few major updates for Baldur’s Gate 3, especially as Larian is now done with the series. It was confirmed a while ago that the studio won’t release any expansions or DLC for the award-winning game.</p>



<p>While Larian’s Swen Vincke confirmed Patch 7 will be released ‘next week’, he neglected to provide a more specific date, but we should have that information very soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24232337/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-nintendo-switch-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sure, it’s not straight-up horror as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/10/24195658/close-enough-welcome-back-slenderman">the early teasers suggested</a>, but even still, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24195883/emio-nintendo-smiling-man-switch-famicom-detective-club-date"><em>Emio — The Smiling Man</em></a> is among the darkest games Nintendo has ever made. It’s a murder mystery that doesn’t skimp on the murder and throws in an unsettling urban legend for good measure. More than that, though, it’s just a really great mystery on a platform that has steadily become an ideal home for them.</p><p><em>Emio</em> is actually the continuation of a decades-old franchise from Nintendo called <em>Famicom Detective Club</em>. Created by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22536783/metroid-dread-yoshio-sakamoto-nintendo-switch-e3-2021"><em>Metroid</em> designer Yoshio Sakamoto</a>, the games originally never launched outside of Japan, until <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435952/famicom-detective-club-review-nintendo-switch">a pair of surprise remakes hit the Switch in 2021</a>. <em>Emio</em> is the first entirely new entry in the franchise since the late ’80s — but even still, not a lot has changed.</p><p>As with its predecessors, <em>Emio</em> plays out like a visual novel, where your actions are determined by a series of verbs on a menu. This is how you “look” at a crime scene or “ask” a witness questions or “review” your notes. Sometimes, the actions are contextual — you can’t talk to someone if there’s no one there — but there are almost always a few things you can do at any given moment. If not, you can always “think.”</p><p>It’s not the most elegant way to engage with the world, but it is functional. It also necessitates a lot of reading and repetition. You often have to press witnesses by asking the same questions over and over, and the only way to learn what happened is to listen to people. That combination is something of an acquired taste, and also one that only really works with the right narrative — which is where <em>Emio</em> shines.</p><p>The game tells the story of a series of murders involving a killer who both wears a paper bag with a creepy smiley face and also puts one on his victims. At the outset of the game, a recent killing appears to connect to a series of murders 18 years prior and also possibly ties into an urban legend about a person named Emio who kills with nearly identical methods. You play as a young assistant of a private investigator, working alongside the police to put the various pieces together.</p><p>Because there are so many moving parts and — at first — only loose theories holding them together, I had a lot of fun doing all of the asking, looking, and reviewing. It’s very satisfying when things click into place. There are plentiful threads to pull on, which shift the story into even darker and more disturbing directions as the scope becomes clear. Even without the horror element, there’s plenty to be creeped out about in <em>Emio</em>.</p><p>The game also joins a sizable lineup of similar mysteries on the Switch, which feel right at home due to its portable nature, like the video game equivalent of a good book. Outside of <em>Famicom Detective Club</em>, there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22597736/the-great-ace-attorney-chronicles-review-switch-ps4-steam"><em>Ace Attorney</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21166865/murder-by-numbers-review-nitendo-switch-steam"><em>Murder by Numbers</em></a>, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23689348/coffee-talk-episode-2-review-ps5-xbox-switch-steam"><em>Coffee Talk</em></a>, to name a few. <em>Emio</em>’s gameplay might feel a touch dated in comparison, but its core mystery carries it through.</p><p><small>Emio — The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club <em>is available now on the Nintendo Switch.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Discord's activity tracker now displays not only the games you've been playing over the last 30 days, but also long you've been playing them, too.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you've returned to a game after a hiatus, your tracker will indicate to your pals that you've made a comeback.</p>

<p>For those less keen to share - or perhaps have their boss on their Discord friends list - you can turn the activity log off by going to Activity Settings &gt; Activity Privacy &gt; Activity Status, and turn off "share your detected activities with others" and "share your activity status by default when joining large servers".</p>
<p>Discord has also partnered with Amazon Music Unlimited to launch a new Amazon Music Listening Party activity, with a free three-month trial (availability will vary, though, I'm afraid). You can also proudly link your RPG Roll20 accounts, too.</p>
<p>At the end of last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-latest-discord-feature-update-brings-direct-friend-calling-and-more">Microsoft confirmed it was expanding Discord support on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One</a> with a number of new features, including a consolidated Xbox and Discord friends list.</p>
<p>Furthermore, once the update is available, it'll be possible to initiate a Discord call, jump straight into a voice channel, or watch a friend streaming directly from the Xbox Friends list.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Alternatively, a few of these are available on Game Pass but, in my opinion, the last year has borne out that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">subscriptions are theft and ownership is the way forward</a></span>.

<p>In recent hours, news regarding mass layoffs at OpTic Gaming has started to surface on social media. While the organisation has yet to confirm how many employees have been impacted by the action, some have claimed that it impacts merchandising, graphic design, and e-commerce teams.</p>



<p>On Twitter, event management staff working at ‘ESA’, the Esports Stadium Arlington, have also reported being laid off from their jobs at OpTic Gaming.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-round">Another Round</h2>



<p>When 2023 kicked off, OpTic Gaming let go of several staff members, following a trend that had surfaced at the time that was seeing thousands of esports and gaming industry employees laid off from their jobs. Back then, it wasn’t confirmed by the company how many people were dismissed, and it looks like the same operating model is being deployed this time.</p>



<p>On social media, several former OpTic Gaming employees have posted heartfelt messages following their dismissal from the company:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Guess today makes it official. It's my last with OpTic. I hope I inspired at least one person during this historic run. </p><p>It's been 2 years full of blood, sweat, tears, and laughter. </p><p>Taking the week to get things sorted and then we're back better than ever. </p><p>Love y'all, it was… <a href="https://t.co/JKYGASuBGN">pic.twitter.com/JKYGASuBGN</a></p></div>— Gerbz (@CallmeGerbz) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallmeGerbz/status/1830014999986663780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Some fans have been quick to criticise OpTic Gaming, with claims of mismanagement flying around on social platforms. It has been claimed that one of the heaviest hit teams is the staff at the Esports Stadium Arlington, the largest esports facility in North America. In 2022, OpTic Gaming secured the management of the stadium, and in 2023, it served as the site for a COD League Major.</p>



<p>On Twitter, Jacob Hale suggested that the layoffs have hit ‘mainly talent, upper management, and some production staff’.</p>



<p>We’ve reached out to representatives of OpTic Gaming for comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-great-deku-tree<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>At last. The LEGO Great Deku Tree, available exclusively at the <a href="https://zdcs.link/NMKGY?object_uuid=93316706-e5a7-40b0-8ea1-3a6b7dc896b2&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>LEGO Store</u></a>, is the first of its kind – a Nintendo-themed set that doesn't concern a certain turtle-stomping, mustachioed plumber. Instead, we're transported to a medieval land ruled by prophecy, fate, and magic. For thousands of years, our heroes, Link and Zelda, have saved Hyrule from the forces of evil. </p><div catalogid="a354f9e4-c347-41a8-9501-e2ef3cec9a91" id="201337"><div id="201337" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>LEGO Great Deku Tree Set</h3></p><div><p>With this 2-in-1 set, you can build the Great Deku Tree in the style of Ocarina of Time or Breath of the Wild with the same pieces.</p></div></div><p>The Great Deku Tree was a key ally in four of their most acclaimed adventures: <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a> (1998), <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker">The Wind Waker</a> (2003), <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a> (2017), and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> (2023). And accordingly, this set includes Easter eggs from across the franchise. It would appeal to any 3D Zelda fan, regardless of which series entry they grew up exploring.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>We Build LEGO The Legend of Zelda Great Deku Tree - Part 1</h3></div></output></p><p>The LEGO Great Deku Tree gives you two build options. In the first option, you build the Tree as it appeared in Ocarina of Time, where, in its dying moments, it summoned Link and sent him on his quest to defeat Ganon. The first boss battle, against the Queen Gohma, takes place inside the Tree.</p><p>In the second option, you build the Tree as it appeared in Breath of the Wild, standing watch over the Master Sword. This iteration of the Great Deku Tree is covered in pink leaves rather than green, and its root structure is more extensive and tangled, although its base is less solid and stout, like a swamp tree that's evolved to survive in water. Perhaps over thousands of years, the ecosystem of the forest changed, even as the characters that inhabited it recurred.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>We Build LEGO The Legend of Zelda Great Deku Tree - Part 2</h3></div></output></p><p>The two builds are split into 22 bags. You cannot build both trees at the same time; there is extensive overlap, especially in the beginning and middle portions of each build, that prevent this from happening. You get a single, thick instruction book for both builds. There are no stickers in this build; all illustrations are printed directly onto the bricks themselves.</p><p>The two Great Deku Trees are not, canonically speaking, the same character; each new iteration of the Deku Tree grows from a seed and sprout of the prior one. They are all descended from one another, and thus, it is fitting that the first halves of both builds are identical. You start by laying down the forest floor and the base of the tree. </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>We Build LEGO The Legend of Zelda Great Deku Tree - Part 3</h3></div></output></p><p>You also build two miniature builds separate from the main tree, and no matter which tree iteration you decide to go with, you will not have to 'recycle' them; these two miniatures will accompany the final build regardless. The first miniature is Link's forest house from Ocarina of Time, which contains a box to store his supplies, including a hookshot, a bomb, red and blue potions, and a compass. It also comes with Navi the Fairy, which you can swap to be green, blue, or yellow, depending on whether Link is talking, searching, or fighting enemies. </p><p>The second miniature is of the pedestal in Breath of the Wild, where Link finds the Master Sword in Korok Forest. You also build Hestu (complete with his maracas) and Korok creatures that dot the forest floor.</p><p>The Great Deku Tree set comes with a total of four minifigures. You get a Breath of the Wild Link and a Breath of the Wild Zelda in their signature teal tunics, and you get two iterations of Ocarina Link – Young Link, whose tunic comes with a skirt piece around its waist, and Adult Link, who you can display with the titular Ocarina. </p><p>The minifigures come with numerous weapon accessories. In addition to the supplies in the various trunks and boxes, you have three options for swords – a short sword, the Kokiri sword, and the Master Sword – and three options for shields – the Traveler's Shield, the Deku Shield, and the Hylian Shield with its signature crest.</p><p>After the first nine bags, you're directed to branch off and choose either the Breath of the Wild build or the Ocarina build. If you decide to go with the former, you proceed right on to Bag 10, and you continue building up through Bag 19, in linear order. The final Breath of the Wild tree contains two remote Bomb Rune and a Sheikah Slate in hidden compartments along the tree's base. There's a tribute to the Riddles of Hyrule sidequest in the tree's head. At the bottom of the tree is the Navel, which includes the General Shoppe, Spore Store, and Inn. The tree itself is rigged so that when you push down on a lever at the back, its eyebrows and mouth move. Lastly, you build four smaller trees that decorate the surrounding area.</p><p>If you decide on the Ocarina build, you take a more circuitous route to the end result. After Bag 19, you open Bags 10, 14, and 23 at the same time. Then Bag 13. Then Bag 16. Then Bags 17, 20, and 21. And then lastly, Bag 22. </p><p>The Ocarina tree comes with its own set of game-specific Easter eggs. The tree's hidden compartments contain a fairy bow and a staff notes musical representation of "Saria's Song." The bottom of the tree is a dungeon, with a treasure chest that holds a Fairy Slingshot and a massive Skulltula that drops from the ceiling via a catch-and-release mechanism. </p><p>Outside, instead of additional trees, there's a Gossip Stone and two carnivorous Deku Babas to eat Link if he gets too close. Lastly, the tree's mouth opens into a doorway so that Link can crawl inside and explore.</p><p>If there is a drawback to this set, it's that once you build one version of the set, you will feel hard-pressed to build the other. For the sake of this review, I managed it, but it required me to exercise foresight; I got a bunch of Zip-Loc bags and address labels to keep track of what went where. </p><p>So right now, I have the leftover pieces from Bags 10, 14, and 23 in a single bag. If I take apart the current tree, I'll have to match up my tree with the instruction booklet's tree to figure out what went there, and then rebag and regroup them. But even that doesn't completely solve the problem, unless I separate everything into three piles, piece by piece. It'll be a slow go, and that's if I don't lose a couple of pieces in the transition. So I probably won't. Doing it once was enough.</p><p>If I had to choose which was the "better" build, it's the Breath of the Wild tree. It's more colorful and detailed, and its facial expressions are more animated. But that said, both trees are an impressive sight. And if you grew up with Ocarina of Time, then that's the tree you're building. Your nostalgia will make the final decision for you.</p><p>LEGO Great Deku Tree 2-in-1, Set #77092, retails for $299.99, and it is composed of 2500 pieces. It is available exclusively at the <a href="https://zdcs.link/NMKGY?object_uuid=93316706-e5a7-40b0-8ea1-3a6b7dc896b2&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>LEGO Store</u></a>.

        <p>That's Monday. Space Monday.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Another week, another Steam Fest looms. From September 2st until the 9rd you'll be able to find intergalactic discounts and demos in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/space_exploration/">Steam Space Exploration Fest</a>.

<p>The sale isn't live yet, but the trailer above provides a glimpse of some of the games featured. I highly recommend the awkward-to-type ΔV: Rings Of Saturn, a physics-based 2D space mining sim about venturing ever further into an asteroid field. Sin adored it in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/v-rings-of-saturn-review">ΔV: Review Of Saturn</a>, and Sin is never wrong.
</p>
<p>I am often wrong, so you may disagree with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/exo-one-review-a-gorgeous-sci-fi-marble-run-that-lacks-pace-or-friction">my negative assessment of interplanetary marble run Exo One</a>, also featured above. I thought it was an impressive screensaver.
</p>
<p>There are many more games in the trailer that I haven't played. For example, I did a double take and had to rewind a bit when The Invincible showed up at the end. That looks fancy, doesn't it? How will I know the cadence of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-invincible-review">how often Julian is wrong</a> if I don't give it a go myself?
</p>
<p>This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/space_exploration/">page on Steam</a> will be the home of the sale once it goes live on Monday. I'm telling you this now because otherwise we'll forget and not write about it again until the sale is half over, and because maybe this way you'll save your pennies tomorrow rather than blowing them all on riding the Peppa Pig car at the local garden centre. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/this-new-mechanic-is-magic-gathering-duskmourns-ultimate-weapon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're the kind of person who prepares for spooky season the same day the pumpkin spice latte hits cafes, you probably want to have <em>Magic: The Gathering Duskmourn</em> on your radar--and it's nothing like the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/cutest-cards-we-pulled-from-magic-gathering-bloomburrow">super cute <em>Bloomburrow </em>set</a>.</p>
<p><em>Duskmourn </em>is the upcoming spooky set for Wizards of the Coast's biggest trading card game, and it's inspired by modern horror from the '80s and beyond. While that's obvious in its art and card frames, arguably my favorite thematic element is one of its new mechanics: Manifest Dread.</p>
<p>There are a few other mechanics and details that Wizards revealed today at a PAX West panel, and I'll go over some of those details here as well. But first, let's manifest some dread.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hauntwoods-shrieker-magic-the-gathering-duskmourn.jpg?itok=dZidHRfp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hauntwoods-shrieker-magic-the-gathering-duskmourn.jpg?itok=rWBIbgHy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bonus: Certain cards have a Monstrous Reflection alternate, where the art is from the monster's point of view.</figcaption></figure><h2>Manifest Dread Is a Tricker's Dream</h2>
<p>Longtime <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> players might remember the Manifest mechanic, which also appeared recently in <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>. Manifest Dread is a variant that will be introduced in <em>Duskmourn</em>.</p>
<p>Manifest Dread lets you take the top two cards of your deck and choose one to put face down as a 2/2 colorless, typeless creature. The other gets put face up in your graveyard. That face-down card can be revealed by paying its mana cost, if it's a creature.</p>
<p>It's simple on its face, but the beauty is in the mystery it creates. If I pull a 6/6 creature and a land, I'd probably put the 6/6 creature face down to reveal it later. That seems like the easy answer for maximum viability.</p>
<p>But what if I put that 6/6 creature in the graveyard face up? Obviously, that face down card has to be something insane, right? And to my opponent, that's a scary move--one that might manifest some dread, even.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/razorkin-needlehead-magic-the-gathering-duskmourn.jpg?itok=hOaln1xt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/razorkin-needlehead-magic-the-gathering-duskmourn.jpg?itok=ZdnSAHK9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Another card with a Monstrous Reflection variant.</figcaption></figure><p>I love this mechanic because of how much it plays into the horror tropes that <em>Duskmourn </em>is all about. It builds anticipation and tension for your opponents, who have no idea if you're bluffing or getting ready for a game-winning move.</p>
<p>Previously, Wizards shared the Impending mechanic that's part of <em>Duskmourn</em>, which similarly ties into the theme. You can play a card at a lower cost, but it won't really be active until a certain number of turns have passed.</p>
<p>It's another way to build anticipation, but it's the fear of something the opponent knows. A spell cast with Impending is cast face up. But when it comes in face down? I mean, every horror fan knows how terrifying the fear of the unknown is.</p>

<p>In the first look article that Wizards posted, they revealed that the House of Horror is indeed just one house--a house that spans the entire plane. To bring that house to life, a new Enchantment type is coming to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>: Rooms.</p>
<p>Room cards are split cards (the ones that are horizontal and feature two cards in one), and when you cast it, you choose which side to pay for. Then when it enters on the field, the other side is "locked." You can open the door by paying the other side's mana cost (as a sorcery).</p>
<p>Room cards provide ongoing effects and practically act as two enchantments in one. The art on them is also pretty scary, with the "split" promising to feature some scary hidden easter eggs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/enduring-innocence-enduring-curiosity-magic-the-gathering-duskmourn.jpg?itok=betuDV9m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/enduring-innocence-enduring-curiosity-magic-the-gathering-duskmourn.jpg?itok=O-2OseQf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other Enchantments play a big role in&nbsp;<em>Duskmourn</em>. Additionally, certain cards, like Enduring Innocence and Enduring Curiosity, have alternate art from a Japanese artist.</figcaption></figure><p>Enchantments were a big idea in Duskmourn, according to Head Designer Mark Rosewater. It just felt thematically on point to focus on them, creating a sort of "enchanted," spooky theme. There are even more Enchantment Creatures, too.</p>
<p>To add to the atmosphere, Eerie is a new effect coming to some cards, which trigger whenever an Enchantment enters the field. This includes Enchantment Creatures, typical Enchantments, and even Rooms--which can trigger twice.</p>

<p>Enchantment Creatures play another big role, synergizing with the return of the Delirium mechanic. Delirium triggers when you have four or more card types in your graveyard, which will likely happen pretty quickly with the <em>Duskmourn </em>cards.</p>
<p>And finally, a new mechanic that's coming to this set is Survival, which triggers when a card is tapped during your second main phase. Again, much like most of what's in Duskmourn, it's a thematically relevant mechanic that especially matches the characters who are trying to survive in the haunted plane.</p>

<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Duskmourn</em>'s Commanders Revealed</h2>
<p>We also have new details on the four pre-constructed Commander decks in&nbsp;<em>Duskmourn</em>. The Commander leads are:</p>
<ul><li>Amanatou, Veil Piercer (White-Blue-Black)</li>
<li>Valgavoth, Harrower of Souls (Black-Red)</li>
<li>Winter, Cynical Opportunist (Black-Green)</li>
<li>Zimone, Mystery Unraveler (Green-Blue)</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, Zimone is probably the one I'll have my eye on the most, with her ability synergizing very strongly with the Manifest Dread mechanic. However, my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review">Asterion-loving heart</a> has a real soft spot for Winter's whole vibe.</p>
<p>The last thing I did want to share with you, as a final hurrah, is the Double Exposure cards Wizards shared with us. Kaito, who you might remember from&nbsp;<em>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty</em>, returns as a Planeswalker, but his Double Exposure treatment looks beautiful.</p>

<p>That's all we have to share about&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering Duskmourn</em>&nbsp;from today's panel, but stay tuned here for more about the upcoming horror-inspired set!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/against-the-storm-review">Against The Storm</a> already contains a zoo's-worth of animal-people to order around as you attempt to build a town that can survive the perma-rain of the Blightstorm. That doesn't stop new expansion Keepers Of The Stone from adding one more. Come September 26th, you'll be able to welcome the frog people as you venture into a new biome.

<p>The new expansion takes place in the Coastal Groves, where settlements are built - you guessed it - along the water. You'll be able to construct the new Strider Ports and set off on water-based expeditions on the backs of water striders.
</p>
<p>The expansion also adds new buildings such as the Pantry, Cannery, and the Frog House. The latter are what frogs live in rather than the normal shelters, and they can be upgraded several times to keep frogs happy, with "unique benefits" chosen at each level <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/4614588176974421592">according to the feature list</a>.
</p>
<p>September 26th will also be the release date of Against The Storm's update 1.4, which adds a new fishing system alongside new requirements, new goods and other changes for free. If you want the frogs and the new biome and so on, however, you'll need to cough up for the DLC. There's no listed price on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3075500/Against_the_Storm__Keepers_of_the_Stone/">Steam page</a> yet.
</p>
<p>I've not found the time to go back to Against the Storm since it hit 1.0, but it was already a banger in Early Access, and apparently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/against-the-storm-review">a mega-banger upon its full release</a>. I'd trust Eremite Games to do something good with an expansion.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Todd Howard recently said that he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-expect-fallout-1-and-2-remakes-from-bethesda-any-time-soon-todd-wouldnt-want-to-paste-over-their-charm">wanted people to experience Fallout 1 and 2 as they were</a>, rather than remake them. Well, this'll make things easier: both games are currently free to keep as part of the Fallout Classic Collection over on the Epic Games Store.
</p>
<p>Fallout Tactics is free, too, but I don't know whether Todd's cruel enough to want people to experience that one as it was.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can head to the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/bundles/fallout-classic-collection">Fallout Classic Collection store page</a> anytime between now and September 5th at 4pm to add the set to your account. Which means that you'll need an Epic account, of course.
</p>
<p>I'm a Fallout 3-and-after heathen, so I can only turn to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-25-favourite-rpgs-of-all-time">your own picks for the best RPGs</a> to tell me that Fallout places at 13 and Fallout 2 at 21. Those are respectable positions for two games that are, frankly, ancient. (Fallout Tactics didn't place.)
</p>
<p>Or perhaps I should look to Edwin, who revisited <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-fallout-is-the-perfect-antidote-to-fallout-fever">the original Fallout and found it the perfect antidote</a> to the fever around the Fallout TV series. He also found it "the hardest to get into", all these years later.
</p>
<p>My parents have been staying with me for the past week and we didn't Fallout even once. On the other hand, I discovered recently that my dog has fleas, so if someone wants to nuke my entire flat, that's fine with me.
</p>
<p>There's a second game currently free over on Epic, and it's Wild Card Football, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/wild-card-football">which you can grab here</a>. It's a knockabout 7-aside arcade American football game, where 150 'Wild Cards' remix the rules with invisibility, stat boosts, flying saucers, and the like. Shades of Brutal Sports Football, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutal_Sports_Football">maybe</a>? Or perhaps that's just me longing for hyperviolence.</p>

To talk more about these changes, <a title="Companies > Gematsu" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gematsu">Gematsu</a> spoke to Marvelous USA and XSEED Games executive vice president Kenji Hosoi at PAX West 2024, where both brands are showcasing a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/08/marvelous-usa-and-xseed-games-announce-pax-west-2024-lineup">diverse lineup</a>. <span id="more-911433"></span></p><p>Get the full interview below.</p><p><strong>First thing’s first—what was the reasoning behind separating XSEED Games and Marvelous USA into distinct publishing labels?</strong></p><p><strong>Kenji Hosoi, Executive Vice President, Marvelous USA / XSEED Games:</strong> “I think it’s always been slightly confusing for our fans since we were both XSEED Games, as well as Marvelous USA. Even in online comments, sometimes people would refer to us by both names in one sentence, so the brand separation was to mainly clarify which titles fall in the Marvelous category and which ones are XSEED’s. The Marvelous side will consist of titles that are internally developed by our Marvelous dev team—like the <em><a title="Series > Story of Seasons [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/story-of-seasons">Story of Seasons</a></em> and <em><a title="Series > Rune Factory [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/rune-factory">Rune Factory</a></em> series, as well as <em><a title="Games > Daemon X Machina [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/daemon-x-machina">Daemon X Machina</a></em> and others. The titles that we license from external developers and publishers, such as the indie titles <em><a title="Games > Potionomics [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/potionomics">Potionomics</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/sakuna-of-rice-and-ruin">Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin</a></em>, and <em>Freedom Planet</em>, would fall into the XSEED category.”</p><p><strong>I understand differentiating Marvelous content from third-party content, but then you have <a title="Companies > Marvelous Europe [141 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/marvelous/marvelous-europe">Marvelous Europe</a> who is still publishing that third-party content in Europe, and Marvelous the parent company still publishing in Japan. So why is there only that separate in North America, as opposed to just publishing everything as Marvelous USA going forward?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “Unlike Marvelous Europe and Marvelous Japan, our company originated as XSEED Games, and many of our fans have been with us throughout our decades long journey of bringing games from Japan to a western audience from before we teamed up with Marvelous. Many people still think of us as XSEED, so we figured the easiest way to represent both sides of our business was to separate the brand name based on the two types of titles (external or internal dev) we handle.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/XSEED-Games-Interview_08-31-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>So what opportunities do these changes present for XSEED Games in terms of expanding your games lineup? Will we see more third-<a title="Genres > Party [72 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">party game</a> announcements from XSEED Games than usual as a result?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “The brand separation is specifically to clarify which titles will fall under which brand name, so aside from that, our operation itself will not change. As each game we consider for a publishing deal is different, we’ll continue to pick up third-party titles that fit our target audience, expected game quality, and how it performs in our internal title evaluation process. If we get lucky and receive a wave of titles that fits with the XSEED brand, then we’ll have more to publish, but the same logic applies if we are not as lucky in any given year.”</p><p><strong>XSEED Games already has quite the number of upcoming third-party projects. Will these changes affect the way the company approaches partnerships going forward?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “No, not at all. As mentioned previously, there really are no operational changes and we’ll continue doing everything we’ve been doing for the last decade.”</p><p><strong>XSEED Games has published third-party projects from developers big and small. What’s the brand’s process when it comes to actually discovering these games?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “There are multiple avenues by which we discover titles. Sometimes we get direct emails or introductions from industry friends, which is the usual process for many third-party titles developed by bigger companies. Sometimes we’ll receive pitches through our website, though we haven’t had one that’s come through that we’ve actually ended up publishing. Other times, we’d find potential titles at game shows like PAX, Gamescom, Tokyo Game Show, and BitSummit. <em><a title="Games > Cuisineer [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/cuisineer">Cuisineer</a></em>, one of our indie darlings, was actually discovered by our president Ken Berry when he visited PAX East, and then later introduced to our Marvelous Europe office for publishing. Ken meeting the developers <a title="Companies > Edelweiss [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/edelweiss">Edelweiss</a> at BitSummit was also the start of our partnership on <em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin</em>.”</p><p><strong>Does fan demand or feedback play any part in determining which projects XSEED Games decides to sign?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “100 times yes! Like many things in our lives, feedback is some of the most valuable info we get. The more fan love there is for a title, the easier it becomes to make a decision. If there’s a big demand that’s easily measurable like Steam Wishlists, social media follows, Kickstarter pledges, the first step of quantifying market demand is that much easier to do. And if proving market demand is easy, then it becomes easier to prove to decision makers why a game is ‘good.’ The process of convincing someone that a game is good enough to merit the risks inherent in publishing is actually quite hard, and fan feedback brings a very important piece to the table that’s easy to digest for everyone involved.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/XSEED-Games-Interview_08-31-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Can you talk about how your PAX West 2024 lineup is different from previous events with this new distinction between Marvelous USA and XSEED Games?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “On a fan / attendee level, the booth experience will be the same except that we have a massive lineup this time around! From the publishing side it’s helping us to bring more titles than we’ve historically taken, including creating booth experiences for upcoming Marvelous USA titles <em><a title="Games > Farmagia [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/farmagia">Farmagia</a></em> and <em><a title="Games > Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a></em>, as well as a playable demo for <em><a title="Games > Death the Guitar [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/death-the-guitar">Death the Guitar</a></em>. These combined with our big lineup of playable XSEED Games-published titles including <em><a title="Games > Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/corpse-party-ii-darkness-distortion">Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion</a></em>, <em>Cuisineer</em>, <em><a title="Games > Moonlight Peaks [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moonlight-peaks">Moonlight Peaks</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Potionomics: Masterwork Edition [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/potionomics-masterwork-edition">Potionomics: Masterwork Edition</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Slitterhead [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/slitterhead">Slitterhead</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > The Big Catch [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-big-catch">The Big Catch</a></em>, and <em><a title="Games > Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ys-memoire-the-oath-in-felghana">Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</a></em> has made it a bit of a challenge to fit all in one booth, but it’s one we were eager to take on to make sure fans have the best possible experience when they stop by.”</p><p><strong>XSEED Games once dipped its toes into the <a title="Genres > Visual Novel [450 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a> genre with <em>London Detective Mysteria</em>, but we haven’t seen any visual novel releases since. Would XSEED Games ever consider localizing more visual novels in the future?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “As someone who was really pushing to pick up the <a title="Platforms > PS3 [15,621 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps3">PlayStation 3</a> version of <em>428: Shibuya Scramble</em> back in the day, personally, I wish we could do more visual novels. Unfortunately, that genre of games is very text heavy obviously, and they take a long time to localize. We work on a lot of text heavy games like the <em>Story of Seasons</em> and <em>Rune Factory</em> series, and we just don’t have enough resources at the moment to pick up visual novel titles on a regular basis. If we exponentially grow our localization team in the near future, then it’s definitely possible, but I don’t see how we can handle frequent visual novel releases at this time.”</p><p><strong>With the popularity of <a title="Companies > Vanillaware [192 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/vanillaware">Vanillaware</a> titles, would XSEED Games ever consider remastering <em>Muramasa: The Demon Blade</em> or <em>Grand Knights History</em> for current-generation platforms?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “This is a question we get asked quite frequently at game shows. All I can really say is I wish we could! We’re all fans of Vanillaware, as everyone should be, and both titles mentioned would be a great addition. If we’re ever given the opportunity, it’d be a fun party for us!”</p><p><strong>Are there any plans to localize future projects in more languages such as Brazilian Portuguese and LATAM Spanish?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “Brazilian Portuguese is definitely a language we get asked about once in a while. Given the massive amount of text in some of our games, I’m not sure if it’s cost effective enough for us to keep BP as a default language for all of our games just yet, but we’ve had a few titles we’ve included BP as a localized language, so we’ll definitely be looking more into the LATAM languages as our next expansion in our localization process.”</p><p><strong>It looks like we’re out of time. Thanks so much for talking to us, and enjoy the rest of PAX West!</strong></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-big-games-like-concord-aren%E2%80%99t-surefire-successes-anymore.969294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-concord-failure-sony-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony, a pillar of the video game industry, recently released a big new multiplayer tentpole game, but you wouldn’t know it based on buzz. <em>Concord</em>, which iterates on the team shooter styles of games like <em>Overwatch </em>and the attitude of <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, is struggling to <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/2443720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attract even just a couple hundred players</a> at any given moment on Steam, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales estimates</a> on PC and PS5 aren’t great. What happened? And why can a by most measures solid game with a big marketing budget<em> </em>flop during a year that has produced <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-palworld-helldivers-manor-lords-aaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several surprise hits from much smaller studios</a>? On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we discuss that.</p><p>We begin by talking about the first big game of the “fall” video game season:<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>. Despite an enormous budget and a four-year development cycle, reviewers were given just a week to play the gargantuan game <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1828072104350146837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before embargo</a>. Not ideal! We discuss how that impacts the way reviewers play and perceive games.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to <em>Concord</em>, Sony’s new team-based hero shooter that generated more buzz by flopping than by existing in the first place. Why are people so gleeful about tallying up its commercial failings, though? What about the modern internet has broken our brains in this specific way?</p><p>Lastly, on a happier note, we discuss <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em>, the <a href="https://aftermath.site/tactical-breach-wizards-pc-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brilliant not-quite-<em>XCOM</em>-alike</a> that recently rocketed to the top of our game of the year lists. We also pitch several compelling get-rich-quick schemes, including my personal favorite: Replace all executives with babies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can create our own middle-of-the-road triple-A game that chases trends from several years ago. Ours will succeed, though, because we’re built different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>These [kinds of games] are usually somebody’s game. People who play <em>Overwatch </em>play a lot of – if not exclusively – <em>Overwatch</em>. It’s the same with <em>League</em>. It’s the same with <em>Valorant</em>. People play that game. People aren’t gonna leave those other, better games for <em>Concord</em>. It’s not a 20-hour single player game that people can stack up at sale time or put on their pile of shame and come back to later. If you’re not playing this game, this game’s fucked.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> This is also why, if you look at Sony’s stable, its other live service multiplayer game this year was <em>Helldivers</em>. There wasn’t really an analogous experience for that, so people were more willing to hop in and give it a try. Whereas with <em>Concord</em>, you can point to several other, pretty similar games, so people are like “Well yeah, I’m just gonna keep playing those” or move onto playing another of those because they already have player bases, they already have a lot of content, they’re better known, or their friends might already be playing them. In other words, the reasons people check out games.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah, my favorite team shooter to play is <em>Apex Legends</em>, because I cannot get enough of that Respawn gunplay. But I play <em>Overwatch </em>because my friends play <em>Overwatch</em>. We have a group call every Thursday night where we play games together, and we usually end with <em>Overwatch</em>. That’s why I’m an <em>Overwatch </em>player. In the darkest time of my life, I played so much <em>Overwatch </em>that it’s now deeply embedded in my brain. I don’t think I could play another team shooter – at least, not seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>I tried <em>Helldivers</em>, and I had fun, but as the bloom came off the rose and people stopped playing it, I eventually uninstalled it from my PC. That’s just what happens: These games are seasonal. If you want the money faucet to turn on and stay on forever, you have to be something that’s a little different from what’s out there. <em>Overwatch </em>couldn’t sustain itself being Blizzard’s flagship moneymaker product because it couldn’t keep up with the novelty of new games that were coming out. I also have really intense opinions about how they do character balance; I don’t think they do a very good job. But that’s a story for a different time.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> You were talking about having a game night with friends, and I think recent multiplayer hits – like last year’s big example, <em>Lethal Company</em> – show that the meta for how multiplayer games blow up now is word of mouth. And I think it’s sort of been that way since covid [lockdowns in 2020]. <em>Among Us</em> was the canary in the coal mine. It came out before 2020 but had this big surge because of word of mouth and became one of the most popular games out there at that time. <em>Lethal Company</em> was the beneficiary of a similar phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Now it’s just sort of how multiplayer games get big. Friend groups move from one game to another, and they’ll say “Hey, everybody else, come join me on this!” Then that game gets really big for a minute. That happened to <em>Helldivers </em>earlier this year. The problem for companies is, it’s really hard to manufacture that, especially when a game is just not demonstrating anything super new or interesting. <em>Concord</em>, again, isn’t. So it didn’t generate that groundswell of interest. It didn’t have people being like “Me and my friends have to check this out. We’ve gotta switch over to this one for a little bit.”</p><p>Without that, I think the floor for how a big-budget multiplayer game can perform – as opposed to the ceiling – is really low now. Even for a game with the marketing power of Sony behind it. You can still wind up with less than a thousand concurrent players on Steam during your launch week, which I think in another era of games would be unheard of. But the way people find out about games and move between them now is so rooted in their friend groups and Steam and Discord that a tiny game can become huge, and a huge game can be tiny, depending on the circumstance.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>That’s such an interesting way to put it, but it’s really true. What I’ve heard from people who work in game development – from all levels of game development, but especially the indies, where you’re responsible for so much more – is that measuring the success of a game or predicting the success of a game is just… nobody knows! Nobody knows what makes a game a hit or not a hit or makes people grab onto an idea or not. Marketing budget certainly has something to do with it. I don’t think <em>Cyberpunk </em>would have gotten to the place where even my husband was like “I think I might check out <em>Cyberpunk</em>” [without it]. And then I had to be like “Homie, I heard some bad stuff about <em>Cyberpunk</em>. I’m so sorry.” I had to sit him down.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> With his fist on his knees, he’s so excited. “I’m sorry, baby. It sucks.”</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>“No, it can’t suck!” But there were billboards everywhere, on the side of every bus and every subway station we went to. We were flying back and forth from LA a lot at the time, and we were seeing <em>Cyberpunk </em>everywhere. Advertising works! But it’s not everything. Word of mouth counts for so much.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>STALKER 2 has a final release date of November 20, after many delays. The development team at GSC Game World is currently polishing the game as much as possible ahead of that date, but they also have a plan for post-launch support that includes free updates and the announced story DLCs.</p>
<p>Moreover, three major features will be introduced to STALKER 2 after launch. The first is a technical one, hardware ray tracing, which Lead Producer Slava Lukyanenka <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gamescom-qa-gsc-game-world-talks-about-the-final-rush-to-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told me</a> is unlikely to be ready for November 20.</p>
<p><em><strong>Slava Lukyanenka:&nbsp;</strong>We are going to have software ray tracing. As for hardware ray tracing, it's too early for us, but we are experimenting with that. We are trying to have it on the release date, but it is highly unlikely you will have it at launch. But NVIDIA DLSS will be there.</em></p>
<p>Lukyanenka is likely referring to Unreal Engine 5's Lumen here, which uses a software ray tracing technique that can optionally be augmented by hardware.</p>
<p>Two more features coming to STALKER 2 with post-launch updates are cross-platform mods and multiplayer. Lukyanenka and PR Specialist Zakhar Bocharov spoke at length about mods, hinting it won't be long until players get this functionality.</p>
<p><em><strong>Slava Lukyanenka:&nbsp;</strong>STALKER is a known franchise not only because of the games but also because of the support from the mod community, which has thrived for the last 15 years, and we don't really want to abandon these people. So, after the release, I can't say when exactly, but we want to do it as close as possible to the release date, we will have the official mod support. We are cooking up some new, interesting initiatives for next year. We are striving to support both PC and console.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, we're actually already supporting them with&nbsp;<span>Mod.io</span>&nbsp;in the original trilogy. I can't confirm whether it's going to be&nbsp;<span>Mod.io</span>&nbsp;or something else for STALKER 2. But the thing is, the modding scene is a little bit of a Wild West right now where you need to download files, replace files, et cetera, so we want to make it structured. There are certain ways on the market to make it structured: Steamworks,&nbsp;<span>Mod.io</span>, and others. We're exploring, we're playing for that, and we want to do it as close to release as possible, but we cannot just guarantee it's going to be on the release, but we are doing our best efforts to be there on time.</em></p>
<p>I got a lot less about multiplayer. GSC Game World always said it would add multiplayer post-launch, and that's still where they're at, it seems.</p>
<p><em><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is supposed to be an update after the release. But for now, we're making the single player as polished as possible. Everything connected to multiplayer probably belongs to our post-launch phase, so we just don't have an update on that right now.</em></p>
<p>Further details will have to wait. From the sound of it, though, it's not coming soon after the launch of STALKER 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-beta-zombies/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>As someone who spent countless hours playing through the round-based Zombies game mode in past Call of Duty titles, learning about its return in Black Ops 6 had me more excited than the campaign and multiplayer combined. Like many of you, I was ecstatic to hop in and play Zombies, first and foremost, but is it available? Does the Black Ops 6 beta have Zombies?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-zombies-mode-in-the-black-ops-6-beta">Is Zombies Mode in the Black Ops 6 Beta?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately,<strong> the Black Ops 6 beta does not include Zombies</strong>. The beta period—Early Access and Open Beta—will only feature the competitive multiplayer mode. That means anyone most excited about playing the co-op Zombies mode or the single-player campaign must wait until the game’s official launch in October.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s always a chance that Activision runs a Zombies beta, but that seems unlikely. Its primary focus is most definitely on the multiplayer side of things.</p>



<p>That said, there were rumors not too long ago—nothing we can corroborate—that Zombies would launch a week early. If that happens, you’ll know where to find me in mid-October!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-modes-does-the-black-ops-6-beta-offer">What Modes Does the Black Ops 6 Beta Offer?</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 beta proves somewhat limited. It features only a handful of maps, with many fan favorites, such as Skyline, taking center stage. But regarding the beta’s multiplayer modes, you can play:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Team Deathmatch</strong></li>



<li><strong>Domination</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hardpoint</strong></li>



<li><strong>Faceoff</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kill Order</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>From firsthand experience with the beta, I can say that all the sweatiest players wind up in Domination or Hardpoint. I had the most fun playing Team Deathmatch.</p>

<p>After spending some time in the game’s competitive multiplayer modes, I can safely say the XM4 is one of my all-time favorite weapons in modern Call of Duty. Here’s a look at all of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xm4-unlocks-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4 unlocks</a>!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Can You Play the Black Ops 6 Beta With Game Pass?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-beta-with-game-pass/</link>

<p>There are numerous questions surrounding access to the Black Ops 6 beta, as Activision and Microsoft somehow made the entire event somewhat confusing and convoluted. You can pre-order the game to gain access, but there are other ways to play in the multiplayer beta. So, can you play the Black Ops 6 beta with Xbox Game Pass?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-xbox-game-pass-give-you-access-to-the-black-ops-6-beta">Does Xbox Game Pass Give You Access to the Black Ops 6 Beta?</h2>



<p><strong>If you subscribe to Xbox Game Pass, you’re in luck because you can access the Black Ops 6 beta</strong>. Three specific monthly plans offer access: Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass PC, and Game Pass Console. If you subscribe to any of these monthly plans, you’ll immediately receive access to the multiplayer beta, which you can download from the Game Pass App.</p>



<p>Oh, and yes, this includes early beta access, not just the Black Ops 6 open beta. With Game Pass, you’ll get the opportunity to play alongside everyone who received a code through giveaways and those who pre-ordered the game, starting on August 30!</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-black-ops-6-open-beta">When is the Black Ops 6 Open Beta?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, the Early Access beta period runs from Friday, August 30, to Wednesday, September 4. After that, the multiplayer servers will close down briefly, allowing for maintenance and whatever else Activision must complete before the open beta begins. The open beta runs from <strong>Friday, September 6, to Monday, September 9</strong>. It’s a short beta period, running the span of a single weekend, but that should offer everyone a chance to test out the game’s competitive multiplayer modes in earnest.</p>

<p>We’re having a fantastic time with the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta so far, though <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/use-your-knife-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wielding a knife</a> is proving troublesome to many players who want to race about the arena with a melee weapon!</p>
