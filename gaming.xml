<p>It's only two months away</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Universal Pictures and Illumination have just dropped a brand new teaser for the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, which comes to cinemas across North America and Europe on 1st April 2026.</p>
<p>The Level Up teaser gives us another look at the mix of Mario worlds and inspirations, but there's a few more Galaxy nods in this trailer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-galaxy-movies-new-trailer-shares-a-first-look-at-yoshi">than the last</a>. Namely, you might notice Megaleg, an iconic boss from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>.</p>
<p>Rosalina makes a brief appearance once again, while Bowser Jr. gets up to plenty of no good. Yoshi also gets plenty of time in the spotlight in the 19-second trailer, including the appearance of his trademark spotted eggs and that unique tongue of his.</p>
<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is apparently going to get a commercial during this weekend's Super Bowl, so we'll probably be seeing more of Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, and co. pretty soon. So keep an eye out for that.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/drugs-magic-guns-and-the-egyptian-god-of-death-make-for-one-hell-of-a-great-game-2000666462</link>
            <guid>1428478</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A maze of hotel rooms stands in front of me. I have nothing but my sunglasses and my fists. I slide into the nearest door, slam a thug to the ground, take his baseball bat, and chuck it at another baddie on the other side of the seedy bedroom. Before the first thug can get back up, I execute him real fast, hop over the bed, and do the same to the other knocked-down enemy. This thrilling sequence happens in less than five seconds. Later, when I walk by the carnage on my way out, I see my partner in crime, Anubis, the Egyptian god of death, clad in a slick purple suit, weighing the souls of those dead losers. He’s a weirdo like that.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124230/Jackal/"><em>Jackal,</em> out now on Steam</a>, is a new top-down indie shooter that is clearly inspired by <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-hotline-miami-is-all-about-5955899"><em>Hotline Miami</em>‘s fast-paced one-shot-and-your-toast action</a>. But where <em>Hotline Miami</em> emulated the look of retro games,<em> Jackal</em> is a stylized 3D adventure that mixes realism with psychedelic art, Egyptian magic, lots of guns, and <em>Max Payne-</em>like noir voiceovers from the game’s coked-up “hero.”</p>

  <p>In <em>Jackal</em>, you have Anubis by your side. He’s a bit stoic and quick to criticize the main character, but does offer up spells that can be used during levels. These can stop time, blind enemies, or make you move really fast. Popping one of these during an ambush is a great way to get out of trouble, but you can only use a spell once during a mission, so knowing when to use it becomes part of the deadly puzzle-solving.</p> <p>Anubis and his magic aren’t the only strange parts of <em>Jackal</em>. It’s clear that this version of 1970s Las Vegas is oozing otherworldly vibes. The game’s cutscenes reinforce this with some truly trippy and wonderful uses of color, lighting, and sound. Of course, the main character is also fucked up on 20 different kinds of drugs and pills. So, how much of this is real and how much is in his rotting mind is an interesting question to ponder as you murder every gangster and cop in Vegas.</p>

 <h2>Yeah, Yeah, But What About The Killing?</h2> <p>As with any <em>Hotline Miami</em>-like game, what matters more than anything else is the movement and combat. Sure, the aesthetics and atmosphere are great in <em>Jackal</em>. But in these kinds of games, death must come swiftly, as well as the reloads. Likewise, action needs to move fast, but you should always feel like you have at least one option to get out of the chaos alive. <em>Jackal</em> nails all of this.</p>

 <p>Combat in this new indie shooter is all about being smart but relentless. Kick a guy down, grab his gun from the air, and shoot the other folks nearby; then, as he stands up, toss the gun back at his face, knocking him down again and letting you finish him with a quick execution.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666480" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666480"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666480">©Transhuman Design / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>A lot of time in <em>Jackal</em> is spent tossing knives, bats, swords, guns, and more at enemies to stun them, and it always feels good. There’s also a lot of focus on making sure that you always know what’s going on. Enemies are pointed out via visual cues, guns are highlighted red so you know who to focus on, and when they run low on ammo, they go yellow. Smart choices like this help combat feel chaotic, sometimes out of control, but never messily or frustratingly so. And unlike in <em>Hotline Miami,</em> you can kick tables, chairs, and other items at enemies, which<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->along with the spells<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->adds a lot of useful options during fights.</p>

 <p>After about an hour and a half of playing <em>Jackal</em>, it looks like I’m about halfway through the game’s levels. So it doesn’t seem like this is a long experience, but there are many difficulty options, and nearly every level can be replayed with a new random layout of enemies, rooms, and weapons. That should offer a lot of replayability, especially for those chasing perfection. Just remember, someone is judging all those corpses you leave behind. And one day, will judge yours, too.</p>

<p>The Daily Mail has shared new looks at Sophie Turner in the role of Lara Croft in the upcoming Tomb Raider series for Prime Video.</p>



<p>On February 6, 2026, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15534645/Sophie-Turner-stunts-set-Tomb-Raider.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Daily Mail </a>shared photos of Lara Croft in action, showing Sophie Turner parachuting over a lake and running through the woods. Instead of Croft’s signature green top and shorts, she wore athletic wear and cargo pants for the scene, which was filmed in the rain in Surrey.</p>



<p>As of yet, there’s no release date for the upcoming series, which will also feature Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs, and began filming in January. However, Sophie has already encountered some challenges while filming the role. She stated on the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSLuQpWjlj4&amp;pp=ygUeanVsaWEgY3VubmluZ2hhbSBzb3BoaWUgdHVybmVy"> Julia Cunningham Show</a> that she’d become aware of back issues during Tomb Raider training.</p>



<p>“I’ve learned I have a perpetual back problem, but I also realised that it’s much easier to kind of build muscle if you’ve ever worked out before in your life, which I never had,” she said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>This week, a peculiar rumor picked up steam: Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced sex trafficker with <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"><u>connections</u></a> to a plethora of the world’s most powerful men, is still alive. Why? It appears that a <em>Fortnite </em>account believed to be his was <a href="https://x.com/DissidentMedia/status/2019520779550122024?ref=aftermath.site"><u>online as recently as last year</u></a>. Today, because we live in a world gone mad, an official Epic account let conspiracy-addled X The Everything App users know that, no, this is not the case.</p><p>"This was a ruse by a <em>Fortnite </em>player,” <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2019817972831780952?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>said the official Fortnite Status account</u></a> in response to a since-deleted tweet echoing the conspiracy theory. “A few days ago, an existing <em>Fortnite </em>account owner changed their username from something totally unrelated to littlestjeff1, following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube. These Fortnite trackers only display your current name, not any prior changes to it."</p><p>“Littlestjeff1” is a handle that appears over 20 times in the Epstein files, albeit largely <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00629064.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>in association with Epstein’s YouTube account</u></a>. Additionally, at one point in 2019 Epstein appears to have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02286126.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>purchased</u></a> $25 worth of <em>Fortnite </em>V-Bucks. This, plus an Israeli flag next to a correspondingly named player’s profile pic on unofficial <em>Fortnite </em>stat site <a href="https://fortnitetracker.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Fortnite Tracker</u></a>, was enough to convince many that Epstein was alive, well, and farming victory royales in Tel Aviv – confirming, in their minds, heaps of other rumors that Epstein never actually died. (Officially, Epstein <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Jeffrey_Epstein?ref=aftermath.site"><u>died by suicide in 2019</u></a>. Unofficially, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/flash-orange-caught-video-sparks-161703143.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALyLP-k-f8z1fQKIAqK6Qn6GIqwI_0c3p7frrz64laYitqq04Lzklf2h9fArvxMvMEEJhSk8OEsXL_PZAdZGH-RretfZoznN5kdmFCPZFS8_3iUb7VJs9nM_gPICtCElS9HeqMGK2AU8BicZPBj0W-SB7fzkyJLws3p4vGFfTQde&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>well…</u></a>)&nbsp;</p><p>“We have no record of the subject's email addresses referenced in the public document existing in the Epic account system,” the Fortnite Status account added. “Since the public document releases, people have created <em>Fortnite </em>accounts with similar-looking email addresses and user names.”</p><p>Epic CEO and <a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-x-ai-csam-epic-games-fortnite/"><u>prolific poster</u></a> Tim Sweeney also weighed in.</p><p>“Someone's been having fun renaming their <em>Fortnite </em>account,” he <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2019819940753379740?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>wrote</u></a>, “but it's recent and not connected to the email addresses in the archive.”</p><p>Extremely cool living in a society where public trust has eroded to the point that an official account of a video game for kids needs to wash its hands of a mess made by the massively corrupt oligarchy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Epic Games shot down rumors that a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>account sharing the same username as a YouTube account owned by Jeffrey Epstein belonged to the deceased financier.&nbsp; The company called it a “ruse” apparently orchestrated by random <em>Fortnite</em> players attempting to spoof the alias leaked in last week’s trove of Epstein files.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span> The clarification followed several viral conspiratorial posts online alleging Epstein was still alive because of a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>account thought to be linked to him appearing to be active following his death back on August 10, 2019. </span><span>The most popular post regarding the littlestjeff1 </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>account came from user </span><a href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2019449522460541048?s=20"><span>Pirat_Nation on X</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666479" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666479"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666479">DOJ</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The post in question featured several screenshots of documents from the 3 million new Epstein files released by the Department of Justice on January 30 arranged in a pinboard-like fashion to claim something wasn’t adding up about the convicted felon’s death.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>One file revealed that Jeffrey Epstein had a YouTube account under the username littlestjeff1, and had purchased a film titled<em> Frenzy</em> using the account on October 25, 2014. Another file includes a $25.95 receipt for </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>V-Bucks on May 7, 2019 (although said receipt makes no mention of the littlestjeff1 username).</span></p>

 <h2>The littlestjeff1 <em>Fortnite</em> account was spoofed</h2> <p><span>A </span><i>Fortnite </i><span>account registered under the name littlestjeff1 was discovered using the website Fortnite Tracker. The account was in use during </span><i>Fortnite’s </i><span>Chapter 5, Season 1, which began on December 3, 2023. This led to the conspiracy that Epstein’s death was somehow faked and he was holed up somewhere in the world playing </span><i>Fortnite</i><span>. Suggestions that the account was active in Israel, leaning into speculation about whether Epstein at one point worked as a spy for the Israeli government, only added to the online drama.</span></p>

  <p><span>Things spread far and wide enough that the official <em>Fortnite</em> Status X account addressed Pirat_Nation’s post directly to </span><a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2019817972831780952?s=20"><span>refuted the theory</span></a>. <span>“A few days ago, an existing <em>Fortnite</em> account owner changed their username from something totally unrelated to littlestjeff1, following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube,” the company wrote on February 6. “These<em> Fortnite</em> trackers only display your current name, not any prior changes to it.”</span></p> <p><span>The company also clarified that it has “no record of the subject’s email addresses referenced in the public document existing in the Epic account system.” According to Epic, since the public document listing the littlestjeff1 account was released, several people have “created<em> Fortnite</em> accounts with similar-looking email addresses and user names.”</span></p>

 <p>While it’s still not clear who the <em>Fortnite </em>V-Bucks purchase in the Epstein files refers to, he did have an Xbox account. The Microsoft platform <a href="https://kotaku.com/emails-reveal-jeffrey-epstein-was-banned-from-xbox-live-2000664660">ended up banning him</a> after he became a registered sex offender.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Video game adaptations are all the rage these days — so why not add another cool one to the list? The Last of Us and Alien: Romulus star Isabela Merced <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/isabela-merced-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation-last-of-us-1236711085/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is set to star</a> in an upcoming film adaptation of the hit Sega franchise <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-house-of-the-dead">The House of the Dead</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The adaptation was previously announced with Paul W.S. Anderson at the helm, which is definitely a good sign for any video game adaptation. Anderson is responsible for the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/mortal-kombat">Mortal Kombat</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a> films, as well as the fourth, fifth, and sixth installments in the Resident Evil franchise — so it makes a lot of sense that he would want to delve into the 1997 game and bring it to life on screen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The House of the Dead is a game I have loved for many years, and I’m beyond thrilled to be bringing this to the big screen with such an exciting talent as Isabela at its heart,” Anderson said in a statement. “We envisage this as the start of a tentpole franchise which can explore <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/house-of-the-dead">the rich world</a> and lore that Sega has created over a whole series of films.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/gettyimages-2249071240-1770397427545.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Isabela Merced. Image credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The House of the Dead is particularly noteworthy as a horror shooter game because of one special detail: it basically pioneered the concept of zombies running fast in video games, which obviously continued to inspire other games and films alike over the years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are no exact details on Merced’s character just yet, but considering players would take on the role of AMS agents, employees of an agency that handles world-ending conspiracies, it appears she might be playing one of those folks. That said, time will tell.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anderson is also producing this “fresh take” on the series alongside Sega exec and producer Toru Nakahara, and Dmitri M. Johnson, Michael Lawrence Goldberg, and Timothy I. Stevenson of Story Kitchen. Jeremy Bolt, one of the producers on Anderson’s first Resident Evil film, will also produce, with Merced herself serving as an executive producer. The project is set to go up for international sale at the upcoming European Film Market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Working with Isabela is a thrilling opportunity as she embodies the heroine character perfectly, bringing dynamic energy to the production,” Nakahara also noted in a statement. “We’re dedicated to crafting a visually striking and immersive experience by introducing compelling actors and terrifying creatures that will bring the House of the Dead universe to life on the big screen. With our deep understanding of video game adaptations, we’re eager to deliver an electrifying cinematic journey for the franchise’s fans.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lex Briscuso is a film and television critic and a freelance entertainment writer for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Neverness to Everness Launches New Closed Beta with Latest Improvements]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/neverness-to-everness-launches-new-closed-beta-with-latest-improvements</link>
            <guid>1428421</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Free-to-play open-world RPG Neverness to Everness (NTE) just launched a new closed beta test, called the Co-Ex Test, that’s playable on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile. It showcases the improvements developer Hotta Studio has made in the months since the last closed beta, including vehicle updates, new minigames, and gameplay tweaks. And alongside the beta, they announced that <a href="https://pwgam.es/3G4LuoG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>pre-registration is available now</u></a> on the App Store and Google Play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Containment Test beta in July added a requisition system that allows you to commandeer vehicles across Hethereau, the giant metropolis where NTE takes place. And now, that system has been refined. New types of vehicles have been added, including muscle cars, supercars, and sportbikes, and the physics of all vehicles have been improved. Handling is tighter, while collisions and the exterior damage they cause are more realistic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also a lot more ways to interact with vehicles. Characters can join you as passengers, and they’ve gotten new riding animations. And you can honk the horn and jump out of a vehicle before it’s come to a stop. You can also pop tires, knock out windows, and damage vehicles to the point where they explode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can requisition vehicles whenever you want, but causing excessive damage or disturbing public order will activate NTE’s multi-level wanted system, which has also seen some changes. As your wanted level rises, there will be escalating consequences. Police officers and bots will pursue you, and they’ll get more aggressive as your wanted level increases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Previously, if you were apprehended by police officers, you simply paid a fine and were immediately let out. Now, you’ll be sent to a detention facility, where you have more options for how to get out. You can still pay the fine to leave immediately, but now you also can try to stage a jail break, which obviously comes with some risk. Or you can work off what you owe, which basically amounts to cleaning up the facility. It’s the slowest option, but it costs no money and comes with no danger. So you’ll need to weigh what’s most important to you: speed, danger, or cost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hethereau is almost constantly plagued by reality-defying anomalies, and the main story will see you working as an unlicensed Anomaly Hunter to investigate these weird occurrences and figure out how to stop them. But in between these story beats, you’ll be able to take part in leisure activities and hobbies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can buy a home to return to after a long day, or you can buy and customize a car and race against street crews or against other players in multiplayer. The Co-Ex Test added new activities and hobbies too, including fishing, games of Mahjong, a musical rhythm game called Super Sound (which you can see below), and a shop management sim mode.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fishing is the most in-depth addition, with a total of 76 different types of fish spread across designated fishing spots in the city. Each district of Hethereau has its own spots, and different fish are located in different bodies of water. So you’ll need to venture across the city if you want to catch them all. Whatever you catch can be sold for tokens, which can then be traded for fishing-related items or fons (the in-game currency). And as you catch different fish, you’ll earn additional rewards for filling up your fishing log.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like being able to take over a shop and manage its day-to-day operations to improve it, then Owner’s Selection is the mode for you. You can find shops in the open world available for purchase. Once you buy one, you’re in charge of improving its popularity and business level. You do this by hiring staff, decorating the shop, and stocking products. As the shop’s popularity grows, its level will rise and you’ll earn increased profits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a new dungeon-style extraction mode called Pink Paws Heist that you can access at any time once you’ve unlocked it at Tycoon Level 18. In it, you’ll gather resources and either fight or avoid patrolling anomalies to find your way to an exit. You’ll get points based on which resources you successfully extract with, and those points can be traded for currency, upgrade materials, and other goodies.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Co-Ex Test will last until February 20, and public signups are closed, but you still have the chance to win access. Go to <a href="https://nte.perfectworld.com/net/260206twitch/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>this site</u></a> before February 13 and link your PWG account, then tune in for Twitch Drops livestreams that will run until February 13 at 10:59 p.m. Eastern. During the livestream, you’ll have the chance to directly receive access to the beta. Good luck!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the beta test ends, Hotta Studio will take player feedback and implement it into later versions. A final release date for the full version of NTE has not been announced yet, but we do know it will be available for free on PC, console, iOS, and Android with cross-progression across all platforms. For the latest news and info, you can follow NTE on <a href="https://x.com/intent/user?screen_name=NTE_GL&amp;utm=officialEN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Twitter</u></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ntegame.official/?utm=officialEN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Instagram</u></a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ntegame.official?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc?utm=officialEN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>TikTok</u></a>, or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/DfCgSpc8ez?utm=officialEN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Discord</u></a>.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/neverness-to-everness-launches-new-closed-beta-with-latest-improvements]]></content:encoded>

What's that, some kind of fancy lawyer lingo?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The line is a fun pun on Wolverine's blades, and the kind of clause a lawyer might include in a legal contract — but which lawyer? Well, Marvel fans will know there's only one legal representative who'd likely seek out Wolverine when he's in another one of his moods.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">"Claws"? What's that, some kind of fancy lawyer lingo? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WolverinePS5?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#WolverinePS5</a> <a href="https://t.co/vgw9Od8jHO" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/vgw9Od8jHO</a></p>— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/2019492430597202093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 5, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, fans have immediately taken the tease to be a nod at the appearance of Daredevil, otherwise known as Matt Murdock, as played by Charlie Cox in the Daredevil TV series and a swathe of other projects in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have long been expecting Daredevil to make an appearance in one of Insomniac's Marvel games, too, after numerous references to the character in the developer's Spider-Man titles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A sign outside Nelson &amp; Murdock's office appeared in Spider-Man 1, and was noted by fans as having been removed in Spider-Man 2 and replaced by an eviction notice. A post-launch Spider-Man 2 patch then re-added the Nelson &amp; Murdock sign, hinting at some kind of story for the character being in the offing — something the game's director Bryan Intihar even <a href="https://x.com/SpiderManCD/status/1720233692407148815" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a> on in late 2023, teasing: "Stay tuned."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Further references to the character have teased Murdock and Jennifer Walters apparently starting a legal firm together, and included other Daredevil-themed locations such as Josie's Bar and Fogwell's Gym. Clearly, the character has been on Insomniac's mind for some time — perhaps Wolverine is where we'll finally see him?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you would expect, replies to Insomniac's latest post have immediately picked up on the studio's apparent Daredevil hint, and responded with numerous gifs of Charlie Cox in his iconic red suit.

<figure data-uuid="f8804591966af"><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f8804591966af/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, Team Cherry surprised us all with the shadow drop release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (at least, it would have been a surprise if its PEGI rating hadn't cropped up online before), and the studio snuck out a new update to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>The ver. 1.5.12459 update isn't packed with game-changing additions, but it's always nice to see Team Cherry fine-tuning the experience. Alongside new screen resolution support for PC players, the patch also introduces "many under-the-hood improvements brought over from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> to the original game," Team Cherry said in a <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollowknightupgraded">blog post</a>. And yes, this update is available on both Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared in an announcement on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/367520/view/526493182068785899">Steam</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Hollow Knight ver. 1.5.12459 (Released 5th Feb 2026)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>- Added support for 21:9 &amp; 16:10 resolutions.<br>
- Game now pauses while in inventory menus.<br>
- Upgraded to Unity Input System for broader controller support (original input system is still available, if preferred, via Options&gt;Controller&gt;Advanced Settings)<br>
- Added dithering effect, and dithering options, to reduce colour banding.<br>
- Fixed a softlock in City of Tears Grub room.<br>
- Reduced Grey Prince Zote's stagger bounce height.<br>
- Updated Sly's Great Slash collider to closer match visual.<br>
- Salubra's Blessing now deactivates after reaching max Soul.<br>
- Map panning is now smoother.<br>

- Various smaller fixes and tweaks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new Switch 2 version of Hollow Knight boasts improved resolution, frame rate, and a handful of additional effects, with a new 120fps option to boot.

            <guid>1428388</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>MindsEye</strong> was the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/">worst game of 2025 by Metacritic's standards</a>. While developer <strong>Build a Rocket Boy</strong> has made significant strides to work on and improve the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mindseye-update-is-a-big-step-forward-for-both-build-a-rocket-boy-and-mindseye-new-content-is-in-development/">including a major update that was released earlier this week</a>, the studio's co-chief executive officer, <strong>Mark Gerhard</strong>, reportedly believes the game's issues stem from more than just Build a Rocket Boy (BaRB) failing to deliver a solid product.</p>



<p>In a new report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/">Insider-Gaming</a>, the studio claims to have obtained <strong>evidence</strong> of a "<em><strong>coordinated campaign</strong> to <strong>purposefully and maliciously damage Build a Rocket Boy's reputation and undermine confidence in MindsEye</strong>. We are working with our legal team and taking steps to address this</em>."</p>



<p>That comes from a statement BaRB sent to Insider-Gaming, after the publication requested a comment on information it had obtained from an internal meeting, where Gerhard not only claimed that the studio had "<em>caught the guys who've been sabotaging MindsEye</em>," but that the alleged sabotage campaign involved the perpetrators spending upwards of <strong></strong><strong>€</strong>1 million (approximately <strong>$1.1 million USD</strong>).</p>



<p>So who are the alleged devils behind the sabotage campaign? According to Insider-Gaming's report, it stemmed from a company based in the UK called <strong><a href="https://www.ritualnetwork.com/">Ritual Network</a></strong>, and video network, influencer management and advertising company. Allegedly working with Ritual Network in this claimed smear campaign includes a number of influencers, three journalists, and some internal employees at BaRB.</p>



<p>Gerhard reportedly added that the individuals accused of carrying out the alleged sabotage campaign "<em>will all be served in person, criminal complaints, shortly</em>," with the specific charges being <em>"espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference</em>." He added, "<em>Everyone who's involved has real problems, including the company behind it. This is the start of our comeback</em>."</p>



<p>A statement from Ritual Network denies the allegations, saying, "<em>Ritual Network is a creator support platform and is not involved in the matter you referenced. We are not aware of any legitimate legal action involving Ritual Network and have not been provided with any evidence supporting these claims. Any suggestion that Ritual Network is connected to these allegations is incorrect.</em>"</p>



<p>Later in the meeting, Gerhard also reportedly added that the studio will "<em>use these people, these names and these facts for our own fun</em>," confirming that his intention is to "<em>put some of these names into our upcoming spy mission</em>." This spy mission is also reportedly the one that was supposed to include <strong>Hitman's Agent 47</strong>, though that collaboration is no longer in the works <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-said-to-have-ended-publishing-deal-with-io-interactive-after-last-years-mindseye-bomb/">since BaRB and <strong>IO Interactive</strong> ended their publishing agreement</a>. Instead, it'll be reshaped to include the alleged perpetrators.</p>



<p>"<em>Let's tell the community the story before it even plays out in court</em>," Gerhard reportedly added. "<em>So, you know, I think this is not us being the victim. We've taken a couple of punches. We've kept turning the other cheek while we got our house in order. And now it's time to start judoing this right back at them. And, you know, so let's have some fun with it. At the end of the day, we're storytellers, we're game makers</em>."</p>



<p>Last year, when MindsEye launched in an undeniably broken state, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">with players asking for refunds</a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">reports of mass layoffs</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/"> (that were later confirmed)</a> coming less than a month after its launch, the studio said it was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">"<em>heartbroken</em>"</a></strong> with how things had gone, and vowed to keep working on the game to make it up to players and realize the vision it always had for MindsEye.</p>



<p>At the same time, Gerhard and his fellow co-chief executive officer, <strong>Leslie Benzies</strong>, who you might also recognize as a former long-time producer at <strong>Rockstar</strong> who worked on several games in the <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> series and both <strong>Red Dead Redemption </strong>titles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-ceo-blames-saboteurs-mindseye-struggles/">also blamed internal and external "<em><strong>saboteurs</strong></em>" for the game and the studio's woes</a>. </p>



<p>But while BaRB leadership was busy pointing fingers, developers at the studio pointed them right back at Gerhard and Benzies. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developers-call-out-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-build-a-rocket-boy/">93 BaRB developers called out Gerhard and Benzies in an open letter</a></strong> last October for "<em>longstanding disrespect and mistreatment of your staff</em>."</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>For years, you have expected them to adapt to your every whim, with those in disagreement being shut down or cast aside. We estimate a UK-majority of the 250-300 workers across the company have now lost their livelihoods. These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce's years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade</em>," the letter reads.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into. BaRB needs to change. CEOs need to take a backseat and allow the skilled people who remain at the company to forge the path ahead</em>."</p>



<p>A little more than a week after the open letter was published, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-report-details-how-leslie-benzies-leadership-failed-staff/">a report from the BBC also pointed to the studio's internal issues stemming from its leadership,</a> with Benzies and Gerhard cited as the problem once again. "<em>Leslie never decided on what game he wanted to make. There was no coherent direction</em>," one BaRB developer told the BBC. The report added that when employees would bring their concerns to Benzies and Gerhard, they were "<em>just ignored</em>" and even "<em>laughed at</em>."</p>



<p>It's important to remember all of this when looking at the last major point of Insider-Gaming's report, which is that BaRB leadership had an employee monitoring and cybersecurity software called <strong>Teramind</strong> installed to track employee behaviour, <strong>without employees' knowledge</strong>.</p>



<p>The report adds that Gerhard took "<em>full responsibility</em>" for the poor way the software was rolled out and that he hopes to have it removed in three months' time. That said, Gerhard also reportedly stipulated, "<em>I think it goes without saying that we can trust 99.9% of this business. The problem is it's the one. It's the 1%. That is the problem, and, you know, the next 90 days for this business are absolutely critical</em>."</p>



<p>If Gerhard and BaRB actually do have the evidence to prove that there has been a sabotage campaign rolled out against BaRB and MindsEye, then that drastically changes the story around this game and adds credence to why BaRB leadership would spy on its employees without telling its staff. </p>



<p>If not, then what we're more likely seeing is another video game industry story where poor leadership and mismanagement have led to those in charge pointing their finger everywhere but at themselves, with hundreds of developers losing their livelihoods in the process, and players who, unfortunately, spent their hard-earned money on an unfinished product that may remain in that state forever.</p>



<p>If you're wondering what players think of MindsEye after all this time and all of its patches, some of its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/#app_reviews_hash">user reviews on Steam</a> in the last 30 days are positive, noting improvements to AI-controlled characters and the introduction of new missions. However, there are still several negative reviews citing technical issues that have not been fixed, and perhaps more importantly, those negative reviews are citing more than just technical problems, like the game's writing, pacing, lack of gameplay variety, and other problems, which show MindsEye's issues go far beyond a few bugs and meme-worthy screenshots.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>This week saw the early access launch of turn-based tactics game Menace, created by the piss-swigging misanthropes behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-brothers">Battle Brothers</a>. Julian has been having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jetpacking-space-pirates-taught-me-a-painful-lesson-in-punishing-strategy-game-menace">a wonderful time</a> playing it and learning about the importance of spare ammo and adequate reconnaissance. It could have been worse, Julian. Your antivirus software could have deleted some of the game’s files. This being one of the currently known issues listed in the patch notes for the game’s first proper update.</p><!--more-->
<p>“Some antivirus programs incorrectly classify the 'GameAssembly.dll' file as malware and delete it, making the game unplayable,” explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2432860/view/540003980950897283?l=english">the Steam post in question</a>. “If that happens please whitelist the ‘GameAssembly.dll’ and ‘Menace.exe’.” A simple-enough fix, then.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why, exactly, some antivirus programs have a bone to pick with Menace, and I have to say, I am a little suspicious. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/streamer-raising-funds-for-cancer-care-loses-32000-to-steam-game-malware-thanks-to-appalling-levels-of-vetting">It’s not like Steam games are malware-proof</a>. The other way of looking at it, of course, is that your antivirus is trying gallantly to spare you the humiliation of being pinned down and bombarded by some entry-level space pirates. You, the pride and flower of the Terran Congressional Republic Navy!</p>
<p>As if there weren’t already pirates enough, the update adds a few more: "pirate veteran scavengers”, "pirate veteran scavenger armor", and the fearsome-sounding "pirate heavy machinegun truck". Julian! Stop sobbing into your Space Weetabix and help me make sense of these miscellaneous game tweaks. They’ve adjusted the splash screen for ultra wide monitors, which sounds positive, but I’m not sure what to make of “anti-tank mines now also trigger for especially large units other than vehicles”. Are you a mine-layer, Julian, or do you tend to be the one triggering them?</p><p>There are some hefty balancing tweaks in here too. They’ve added a heat mechanic to laser rifles and plasma rifles, instead of regular ammunition, and given pirate EMP units a motion scanner accessory. That’s going to ruin somebody’s day (Julian's). Are you playing Menace? Seems like it’s a sturdy bit of turn-based brain-o-war, whatever your antivirus provider may determine.</p>

Lara Croft’s iconic dual pistols are strapped to her thighs, and she dons her classic small knapsack in green canvas with brown leather straps. The fit is tied together with a forearm brace, fingerless leather gloves, a belt outfitted with grenades, and, of course, Lara’s signature braid.

<p>Fortnite loves a good collab. miHoYo and Honkai: Star Rail are joining forces with the Fortnite goliath to create epic content for all players to experience through skins and more, and a release date is available.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/honkai-star-rail/" id="3565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honkai: Star Rail</a> is another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/hoyoverse/" id="95199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HoYoverse</a> success, with the free-to-play title continuing to dominate the scene over two years after its explosion into the universe. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/epic-games/" id="87655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games</a> smells success from a mile away, which is why a Honkai: Star Rail and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> collab makes too much sense NOT to do.</p>







<h2 id="h-honkai-star-rail-amp-fortnite-collab-release-date">Honkai: Star Rail &amp; Fortnite Collab Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll be a star. Credit to Epic</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Fortnite and Honkai: Star Rail collab goes live on February 26.</strong></p>



<p>This isn’t a collab weeks away or months down the pipeline; the official announcement was revealed on February 6. In the same statement, ‘February 26’ was outed, and arrives one week after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-2-delayed-by-over-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now-delayed Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2</a>.</p>

</ul>



<p>It’s not an extensive crossover, but fans of both franchises will be pleased with the upcoming content.</p>



<p>You can look forward to “A brand-new UEFN island and kick off a creator-involved collaboration tournament,” to celebrate the occasion.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-honkai-star-rail-amp-fortnite-content-amp-skins">All Honkai: Star Rail &amp; Fortnite Content &amp; Skins</h2>



<p><strong>Kafka and Blade are the headline additions in the Honkai: Star Rail and Fortnite collab, debuting with cool character outfits, and there will also be the usual array of content: Back Bling, Pickaxe, and more.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s everything that’s been revealed so far, along with the expected content arriving:</p>



<ul>
<li>Stellaron Hunter Kafka skin (compatible with LEGO styles).</li>



<li>Stellaron Hunter Blade skin (compatible with LEGO styles).</li>



<li>Back Bling.</li>



<li>Pick Axe.</li>



<li>Additional crossover content.</li>



<li>Emote (Unconfirmed).</li>



<li>Glider (Unconfirmed).</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s what’s been said about the crossover so far:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The collaboration introduces Outfits (compatible with LEGO styles) for Kafka and Blade into the Fortnite Shop, each featuring a distinctive visual design drawn from their in-game identities in Honkai: Star Rail. Players will also be able to obtain a Back Bling, a Pickaxe, and access additional crossover content, including LEGO Styles for use in LEGO Fortnite.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-free-blade-character-outfit-in-fortnite">How To Get Free Blade Character Outfit In Fortnite</h2>



<p><strong>You need to download Honkai: Star Rail from the Epic Games Store during the outlined Fortnite collab period, and “participate in designated activities” to receive a free “Blade” character outfit.</strong></p>

<p>The activities have yet to be defined, so you’ll have to hang fire until the collab is out first. The skin itself and the design are also unconfirmed, but if you love Honkai: Star Rail, it will be a must-complete challenge(s).</p>

That streak continues today with the release of Episode 2, which adds a heavily requested Ranked Mode, the game's first new warden, a new map, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Episode 2 is live in the game already, and those who boot up the gamewill meet Ekon, a "legendary monster-slayer who shapeshifts into a powerful direwolf to track and hunt his prey." Ekon, who is pictured below, has a passive ability called Dread that reveals the heartbeat of wounded enemies, a tactical ability called Wolf Spirit that let him unleash a spirit wolf to hunt the nearest enemy and apply Dread to them, and an ultimate called Fearsome Howl, where Ekon applies Dread to all enemies across the map and increases his movement speed – it can be cast in human and wolf form (yes, Ekon can transform into a wolf).&nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of today's update, developer Wildlight Entertainment has released a new story cinematic called "Skydrift" centered on Ekon and his place amongst the other Highguard wardens. Launching alongside Ekon is Skydrift, a new map for the game's 3v3 and now-permanent 5v5 raid modes.&nbsp;</p><p>You can check out a look at Skydrift in the image at the top of this story, and you can watch the Skydrift cinematic story trailer below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fYgZOD7FMU4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fYgZOD7FMU4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Perhaps the biggest addition to Highguard with the Episode 2 update is Ranked Mode, which allows players to earn Ranked Points, point modifiers, and more as they climb the ranks to gain unique rewards. You can go from bronze (Hare) to grandmaster (Leviathan) if you're good enough. Ranked Mode will be available only in a 3v3 format, as Wildlight believes "3v3 is the more tactical structure of the game and fits best for comp," according to its <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2019456108734324869">update on X</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>All players will start at bronze 3 rank, and each rank has three divisions to climb through: bronze (Hare), silver (Goat), gold (Ape), platinum (Dire Wolf), diamond (Gryphon), master (Manticore), and grandmaster (Leviathan). At the end of each Episode, you will be rewarded based on your final rank achieved. You can also de-rank within a division during a Split, so be careful. More details about how this Ranked Mode works can be found <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2019456108734324869">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Wolf mount has been added to the game as a rideable beast as part of Episode 2, and is free to all players. If you play 10 matches of Ranked Mode, you will earn the Shadow Wolf skin, which is pictured below.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Square Enix have announced Paranormasight: The Mermaid’s Curse, a summery sequel to horror mystery visual novel Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo. The original game earned itself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paranormasight-the-seven-mysteries-of-honjo-review">a double thumbs-up</a> from former RPS reviews editor Rachel Watts, shortly before she vanished while gathering blood-stained stones one moonlit night. (I am just joshing with you – Rachel is alive and well over at <a href="https://thinkygames.com/">Thinky Games</a>. Remember, there's no such thing as ghosts and there definitely isn't one hovering behind you right now.)</p>
<p>The Mermaid’s Curse should be good, then. It trades the first game’s gloomy streets for the coast of Japan, where young pearl diver Yuza Minakuchi discovers another version of himself at the bottom of the ocean. I routinely discover other versions of myself at the bottom of a bottle of Tuppersmith's Old Peculiar, but nobody's making any dang visual novels about me. Anyway, here’s a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701440/PARANORMASIGHT_The_Mermaids_Curse/">the Steam page</a>, you can expect another multiple-perspective story featuring “a girl of unknown origins, a treasure hunter from a foreign land and a mysterious housewife investigating a drowning”.</p>
<p>You’ll once again be combing 360 degree backgrounds for clues, but there are also new systems and mechanics, including a diving minigame. The backgrounds are “faithful reproductions of real locations and vistas in collaboration with Mie prefecture”. Imagine partnering with horror storytellers to boost tourism. I guess it worked out pretty well for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDHGwnVWpJA">Saga prefecture</a>.</p>
<p>The Mermaid’s Curse is out… remarkably soon! 19th February, in fact. If you missed the first, I will risk being torn apart by Rock Paper Shotgun’s ancestral spirits and point out that it’s currently <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/PARANORMASIGHT-The-Seven-Mysteries-of-Honjo-2340650.html?srsltid=AfmBOopt8WmjdkgwIpfCvBn3ZRNdizrJFDhAljLl-bxGADlIGb0waspF">heavily discounted on Nintendo’s Switch</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This week’s partner-focused Nintendo Direct did not set the world on fire. In fact, it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-games-fallout-elder-scrolls-2000666038">damningly unimpressive</a>. Unless you love Japanese role-playing games, in which case boy, oh boy, even in its first year the Switch 2 is already shaping up to be the console of your dreams. A flood of recent JRPGs and a ton of new ones on the horizon have paved the way for an unprecedented run of turn-based mechanics, epic boss fights, and rewarding grind marathons on Nintendo’s new hardware. If that sounds horrifying, god bless. For all my other sickos out there, hell yeah!</p> <p>A bust for general audiences, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999">this week’s Switch 2 showcase</a> was a surprise coup for JRPG lovers. It confirmed a whopping nine games in the genre coming to the portable platform between now and the summer, including some really interesting deep cuts that will make a few niche fanbases extra excited. Here’s the list along with release dates:</p>

 <ul> <li><em><strong>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</strong></em> – March 13</li> <li><em><strong>Tales of Arise – Beyond the Dawn Edition</strong></em> – May 22</li> <li><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong></em> – June 3</li> <li><strong>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</strong><em> – &nbsp;June 18</em></li> <li><em><strong>Granblue Fantasy: Relink – Endless Ragnarok</strong></em> – July 9</li> <li><strong><em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em></strong> – July 10</li> <li><em><strong>Culdcept Begins </strong></em>– July 16</li> <li><em><strong>Another Eden Begins </strong></em>– Summer</li> <li><em><strong>Kyoto Xanadu</strong></em> – Summer</li> </ul> <p>Okay, let’s dig into a few of these. <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</em> is a turn-based spin-off in which you hatch, raise, and ride monsters (“Monsties,” lol) instead of fighting them. It’s got a pretty generous free demo out already. The <em>Adventures of Elliot</em> is an HD-2D <em>Zelda</em>-like from the makers of <em>Octopath Traveler</em>. And <em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> is a streamlined action-RPG in which you travel the skies in an airship doing multiplayer <em>Monster Hunter</em>-like raids with really fun combat. It’s coming to Switch 2 for the first time with cross-play and <em>Endless Ragnarok</em>, a new story DLC fans have been hoping for since launch.</p> <h2><em>Culdcept</em> and more make an unexpected comeback</h2> <p>Now for the deep cuts. <em>Culdcept Begin</em>s is a surprise new entry in the long-running, incredibly obscure and esoteric card-based board game series that began on the Sega Saturn. It’s been almost a decade since the last entry came to 3DS, which despite its flaws and rough edges <a href="https://kotaku.com/culdcept-revolt-proves-once-more-how-great-monopoly-an-1819229743">proved that JRPG Monopoly</a> is still a winning formula (with the right people). <em>Kyoto Xanadu</em> is the latest in a series of action-RPG dungeon crawlers from Nihon Falcom. I’ve never played them but it’s a cult favorite.</p>

 <p>Finally we have <em>Another Eden Begins</em>, a mobile game that players have been waiting almost a decade to get a proper console port for. Why do people care? Well, its script was written by Masato Kato who worked on <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. The theme music is by Yasunori Mitsuda, who made the music for <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. And overall the game plays like an old-school turn-based RPG with time-traveling hijinks and a literal frog knight so, yeah. The mobile version was free-to-play and had microtransactions. Hopefully the new port feels more like a proper paid release. We’ll see.</p>

 <p>That’s a good haul of popular ports and more niche releases, but it’s not coming in a vacuum. This trove of 2026 JRPG riches comes after players got <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> and <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> last fall. Earlier this year, we got&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> and&nbsp;<i>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</i>. Switch players who upgrade to Switch 2 finally got to play <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, with the sequel coming in just a few months. In the meantime, February has both <em>Ys X: Proud Nordics</em> and <em>Tales of Berseria Remastered</em>. And later this year there’s <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave</em> and <em>Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter</em>.</p> <p>It’s a wild time. Genre fans are eating well. There’s not enough hours in the day to play even half of these games in 2026, and that’s before we find out about the third <em>FFVII</em> remake game and whatever Monolith Soft is cooking up for the <em>Xenoblade</em> series. Nintendo should probably announce a killer first-party blockbuster for Switch 2 soon, but in the meantime it’s already a JRPG lover’s paradise.</p>

Just like clockwork, one day on, the company has shared an infographic summarising every game that featured.</p>
<p>While it might not have been a presentation of wall-to-wall bangers, there is something quite nice about seeing every game in one image, no? Sure, the biggies like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> immediately draw the eye, but a closer look reminds us that the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/scott-pilgrim-ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/valheim">Valheim</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a> also made an appearance.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rilqwy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Nintendo shared the image across its social channels, helpfully splitting the announcements up into Switch 2, Switch 2 / 1 and Switch 1 releases, so you can see what's coming up, regardless of which console you own. Here's a closer look at the graphic itself:</p>
<figure data-uuid="f74f5d9845519"><a title="Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase - Feb 2026" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f74f5d9845519/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-feb-2026.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DUajL7qjgI5/">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We'd say that it's not a bad line-up, all in all. Perhaps not the most surprise-packed Direct in recent memory, but there's no denying that the 2026 release calendar is looking particularly stacked for Switch 2.</p>
