<p>With a particularly spooky reveal</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company has revealed yet another new Mega Evolution that will make its debut in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, and it's Victreebel being put in the limelight this time.</p>
<p>This classic Grass / Poison Type has been a series mainstay throughout the generations, and its new Mega design looks particularly... sweet (<em>heh</em>).</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Mega-Evolution-of-the-Flycatcher-Pokemon-VictreebelMega-VictreebelAppe">The Pokémon Company</a>, Mega Victreel stands at 14'9" (4.5 m) and weighs in at 276.7 lbs. (125.5 kg). Yep, he <em>big</em>. The official description reads, "The volume of this Pokémon’s acid has increased due to Mega Evolution, filling its mouth. If it’s not careful, the acid will overflow and spill out". <em>Yikes</em>.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at Mega Victreel in-game. Relish in its goofy-smile glory:</p>

<p>The Mega was revealed in a particularly spooky little clip on TPC's official YouTube channel, titled 'The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident'. It shows two trainers making their way through a creepy house, following a trail of mysterious, sweet-smelling purple goo.</p>
<p>It might have given us our first look at Victreebell's new Mega form (not our first pick, but a nice addition), but our biggest takeaway is just how much a Pokémon horror game would <em>slap</em>.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for similar reveals in the coming months before Pokémon Legends: Z-A arrives on Switch 1 and 2 on 16th October.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/kill-the-brickman-poncle-launch-vampire-survivors-gamescom-2025/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Poncle, the team behind the hit and <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-dominates-bafta-games-awards-2023-with-five-wins/">award-winning auto-shooter</a> Vampire Survivors, has announced its next published title, Kill the Brickman, developed by Doonutsaur at Gamescom 2025, and it has also launched it on PC and Xbox at the same time.</p>



<p>The one-minute announcement and release trailer for Kill the Brickman mostly showed off gameplay of this Brick-Breaker-like game, before ending the presentation with a slew of Steam codes that, as far as we can tell, were quickly snatched up by anyone who was fast enough while watching the live stream.</p>



<p>Though, even if you missed grabbing a free code, Kill the Brickman is not an expensive game, and at the time of this writing you can grab it for only $4.49 USD with a 10% off launch sale that will end on August 28, 2025. It'll be back to $4.99 USD / EUR4.99 / £3.99 after the 28th.</p>

<iframe title="poncle presents | Kill the Brickman - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8NHXV2qa9jE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>More than just a brick-breaker game, Kill the Brickman is described as a "<em>turn-based, rogue-like bullet builder from outer space</em>."</p>



<p>The collaboration between Poncle and Doonutsaur began when the game was sent to Poncle over email, and the studio's director, Luca Galante, became immediately enamored with it. "<em>Yes, this is true. I love Bricks</em>," Galante said in a press release. </p>



<p>"<em>Kill the Brickman is not only a brilliant deckbuilder, it's also one of the strangest ones I've ever played. And that's a good thing</em>."</p>



<p>Galante is right in that Kill the Brickman seems like a strange game in a positive way. And there's no waiting to test that theory, since for the price of an expensive coffee, you can play Kill the Brickman on your PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S console, right now. There was no mention of a PlayStation or Nintendo version, though there's always a possibility those could be added down the road. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mega Victreebel Revealed for Pokemon Legends: Z-A]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-victreebel-revealed-pokemon-legends-za</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mega-victreebel-revealed-for-pokemon-legends-z-a.1276935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed a brand new Mega Evolution for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>in the form of Mega Victreebel, and if you've ever felt like&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>could stand a little more horror in its diet, then the new trailer is for you.</p>

<p>Two new videos have appeared on The Pokemon Company's official YouTube channel. The first is a fairly whimsical introduction to Mega Victreebel that shows off the 'mon's design in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, as well as some of its combat moves.</p>

<p>It's the second, however, that sparked my interest. "The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident" is an honest-to-god found-footage horror video in which Mega Victreebel plays a role, and I don't want to spoil it, but it's well worth a watch if you're into the creepier side of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mega-victreebel-pokemon-legends-z-a-the-case-of-the-sweet-scent-incident.jpg?itok=KI6-3B6N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mega-victreebel-pokemon-legends-z-a-the-case-of-the-sweet-scent-incident.jpg?itok=saskKvDp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, this still is from a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>video.</figcaption></figure><p>In essence, the new video short from the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>folks marries the warring worlds of the creature-collecting franchise and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 7</em>, as two urban explorers investigate a building that's been giving off a sweet scent at night.</p>

<p>The conceit of the video is that the footage was discovered "on a video sharing website", so the creators are really leaning into the&nbsp;<em>Blair Witch</em>-style trappings of the genre. It's well worth a watch; you can check it out right here.</p>




<p>This has all been set up ahead of the launch of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which is set for release on both Nintendo Switch 2 and the original Switch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">in October</a>.</p>

<p>Being set in the Kalos region's Lumiose City, the game will heavily feature Mega Evolution as a mechanic, and it'll introduce new Mega Evolved forms of existing Pokemon like Dragonite and Victreebel, as well as existing Mega Evolutions originally introduced back in Gen 6.</p>

<p>You'll be able to pick up&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>on the Switch family of consoles on October 16th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is adding several new </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolution-timeline-hurts-houndoom-scizor-1850870401"><span>Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> when it comes to the Switch systems on October 16. We already knew Dragonite was getting one of these powerful alternate forms, and now another monster from the series’ first generation is getting an upgrade almost 30 years later. However, while Dragonite is a long-time favorite from the </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>games, Victreebel, the pitcher plant Pokémon, is a much more surprising pick.</span></p> <p><span>Mega Victreebel was first teased on Tuesday, August 19, through </span><a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1957790171216158990"><span>a social media post</span></a><span> on the official </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>social channels which showed a hand gripping onto a rusted gate, presumably somewhere in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s Lumiose City where the game takes place. The image looks pretty ominous, and if it weren’t posted by the official </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>account, you probably wouldn’t have known it was about </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. The text even says “Viewer discretion advised,” probably so parents don’t show it to their young children. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is no stranger to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-teal-mask-poltchageist-dlc-new-1850761666"><span>dark stories</span></a><span> in its promo material, and even the last </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game had </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-arceus-ghostly-new-pokemon-belong-to-a-special-1847938579"><span>some pretty spooky shit in its trailers</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The video is presented as found footage, showing two unsuspecting characters searching an abandoned building and finding a toxic purple substance and a bunch of scary Pokémon. At the end we see Mega Victreebel, whose destructive power scares the humans off. However, its trainer calms it down, and it turns out it’s not a terrifying monster; it’s just a goofy guy who doesn’t know its own strength. The official description on the <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/mega-victreebel">Pokémon website</a> says that it uses its own vines to keep all the acid it accumulates in its body by wrapping them around its throat. Mega Evolutions remain brutal.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="375" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NyfDz36JkkU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Notably, Victreebel and Dragonite were both on the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521"><span>list of leaked Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> from back in March.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Once Human’s next big update lands next week, it was announced at Gamescom, as the title continues to grow with more features and experiences.</p>



<p>First released in July 2024, Once Human has grown in the year since, including the launch of a PvP spin-off, RaidZone. Now, the base game itself is getting a big update.</p>



<p>Stellar Resonance is a new gameplay mode that lands in Once Human next week, introducing Gravity Integrators and a host of rewards.</p>



<h2 id="h-once-human-stellar-resonance-releases-august-28">Once Human Stellar Resonance Releases August 28</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Defend mode. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a press release sent to Insider Gaming, the Stellar Resonance update is said to “drastically change” gameplay and offer “all-new challenges” for players.</p>



<p>Further details were shared on the <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20250821/40780_1255304.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, with the event period beginning August 28 and running to September 25. After the update is live, players will receive a Gravity Integrator blueprint when a Star Advent Loot Crate is opened for the first time, which can be used at an Intermediate or Advanced Supplies Workbench.</p>



<p>Once placed and activated, the Gravity Integrator will begin to ascend, constantly accumulating Stellar Core Gravity Samples and unlocking tiered rewards the higher it ascends. However, it will also attract Deviants and must be defended.</p>



<p>Global Research is also available in the update, with progress shared across all servers for the same region, unlocking new bonuses and additional reward claim chances. However, the mission is “extremely urgent”, and, if a new research phase is not within five days, bonuses will be lost and attacking Deviants will be stronger.</p>



<p>Additional optimizations were also deployed, including increased gliding and descending speed, improved airbone mechanics, and the ability to cancel aiming when performing a plunging melee attack.</p>



<p>Are far have you gotten in Once Human? Are you excited for the update? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>This week Steam made a small change to how it displays reviews and will now show a score for reviews in your language instead of an "all reviews" score. One game that has benefited from the change is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a>, which now shows Overwhelmingly Positive for all English reviews.</p><p>Palworld has been the source of some controversy since it first came to the public's attention, with some claiming the monster-collecting title is a direct rip-off of Pokemon--an opinion that seems to be shared by Nintendo, who eventually sued developer Pocketpair for patent infringement. The game has still proven popular with players, reaching <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-reaches-25-million-players-in-one-month/1100-6521294/" data-ref-id="1100-6521294">huge player numbers</a> in its first month of release.</p><p>While Palworld used to show an all-time review rating of Very Positive on Steam, the reviews update has given the game a small boost in English, granting it the coveted Overwhelmingly Positive rating. The upgrade was celebrated by Pocketpair's communications director and publishing manager John "Bucky" Buckley, who posted to X about the milestone. Bucky clarified in the comments that Palworld isn't rated particularly low in any language--it "just happens to be higher in English," he said in a <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1958048265720524913" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reply</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/bucky_cm/status/1958045103588569460?s=46" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Due to the Steam review change (it now shows the overall score in your language), Palworld is Overwhelmingly Positive! <br>Thank you so much to our overseas fans who continue to support us and enjoy the game! ❤️<br>As always, we’re so incredibly grateful for your continued support!🙇 <a href="https://t.co/GswoERWfan" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/GswoERWfan</a></p>  — Bucky | Palworld (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1958045103588569460?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Looking through the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Palworld reviews</a> by language, the survival-crafting game has by far the most reviews in English, which average out to Overwhelmingly Positive. The language with the second-largest number of reviews is Simplified Chinese, which have rated Palworld Very Positive -- making it likely that the Chinese reviews were dragging down the average when all review scores were collated. English and Chinese together make up over half of Palworld's total reviews, with all other languages also sporting a Very Positive or Overwhelmingly Positive score.</p><p>Palworld is well into its second year of early access, and continues to receive major updates.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158178/large.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>This review was originally published in November 2009. We're updating and republishing it in honour of the game's arrival on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> as part of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-online-games-list-every-nintendo-classics-retro-game-on-nso-plus-expansion-pack#nintendo-switch-online-switch-2-gamecube-games-3">the Nintendo Classics GameCube lineup</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Meet the Sandersons, your atypical, dysfunctional American family.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanderson is an out-of-work engineer-cum-manchild who lives on the lounge sofa playing with action figures and watching his favourite superhero program Space Ranger Drake Redcrest™ (apologies if that hits too close to the bone for some readers).</p>
<p>Mrs. Sanderson is trying to keep everything together in the wake of her husband's apparent disinterest in finding gainful employment and his habit of spending their meagre funds on toys.</p>
<p>And their daughter, Jenny, wears a frog costume and refuses to communicate in anything but frog language. She worries about her family's future now that Mom won't let Dad sleep in their bedroom, instead locking herself up at night to go over the family finances.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158169/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>In a move that infuriates Mrs. Sanderson, Mr. Sanderson brings home yet another new toy in the form of Chibi-Robo, a tiny robot whose mission in life is to become the number one Chibi-Robo in the world by giving happiness to the people in his new home. Thus is the stage set for one of the most charming and endearing games ever to grace a console as players assume the robotic role in order to restore harmony and happiness to the Sanderson home.</p>
<p>The game's sights and sounds are an immediate draw: the house is a bright and colourful mix of different eras, with a TV that looks vintage 1960s set amidst a timeless household decor filled with all manner of odd and lovable characters. The music is simple and light, punctuated by musical notes that play in time to Chibi-Robo's footsteps and change depending upon the surface he's walking on. The speech is an appealing musical gibberish that is commonplace nowadays, though the English subtitles are well-translated, conveying each character's own unique personality. Whilst this mid-2000s classic deals with serious issues like death and divorce, it doesn't get too heavy and being an active participant in the story's unfolding is one of the great joys of playing the game.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158170/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>It's a bit difficult to describe what kind of game Chibi-Robo! is. It's not really an action game, although Chibi-Robo can obtain a weapon (the Sonic Blaster) and destroy little enemy robots called Spydorz. It's not really an RPG, though he does gain larger battery capacity as he rises through the global Chibi-Robo rankings and you advance the story by talking with other characters. It's not really a platform game, either, though the game's setting in the Sanderson's family home does have ample platforms to traverse in Chibi's travels. Whatever the genre, it's definitely a fun game and that's what counts!</p>
<p>Chibi-Robo lives in a plugged-in house on the living room floor with his companion robo ("manager") Telly-Vision, who floats about giving advice and taking him home when the day is done, or if he fails to get to a plug in time and collapses on the floor with a spent battery. Initially, Chibi-Robo's out-and-about times last for 5 minutes, but this can be quickly upgraded to 10 or 15 minutes. You may also use Moolah to buy upgrades or other items. If you fight Spydorz and destroy them, you can pick up pieces of scrap metal for making Utility Bots that act as ladders or bridges in various rooms to reach high places.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158175/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Chibi-Robo's activities alternate between day and night periods. During the day the Sandersons are active and can be chatted to, whereas toys are inert. Everybody loves Chibi: Mr. Sanderson bought you and he likes gadgets, so he just thinks you're the best (changing the TV channel to his favourite show gets you some bonus Happy Points, although given that his slovenly behaviour is a big cause of strife in the house, this might not be the best choice); Jenny likes drawing pictures of you and if you bring her frog rings found scattered about the house she'll bestow you with kisses; Mrs. Sanderson enjoys having tea and being able to discuss her problems with you (though she hasn't gotten your name right and insists upon calling you "Cheebo"); and their dog, Tao, just growls at you (it's a shame you can't speak dog - yet).</p>
<p>At night, the Sanderson house takes a darker turn and not just because the lights are out. Mr. Sanderson sleeps on the sofa with the dog and can be heard muttering "Sorry, dear" in his sleep. You'll find Jenny outside of her mother's bedroom with a sorrowful look on her face, while mother herself can be heard inside the bedroom telling everyone outside to be quiet and muttering about the finances.</p>
<p>The household toys all come to life at night and they all have their own dramas to entangle Chibi-Robo in and provide windows into how the Sandersons got where they are now. Of course, with drama and strife comes the opportunity to make people happy - whether that person is a Sanderson, a doll, an action figure, or one of those novelty musical dancing flowerpot things.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158173/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The active inhabitants of the Sanderson house may be different day or night, but one thing never changes: the house is a mess. Chibi-Robo! is a great way to work out your obsessive-compulsive disorder as the start of every active period reveals more rubbish to pick up and stains to clean off the floors and carpets. This ends up being rather satisfying and a good way to ensure a steady flow of Happy Points and Moolah for your coffers.</p>
<p>Whilst Mrs. Sanderson may have opposed your presence initially, your helping out around the house is greatly appreciated, so she gives you a bonus of both Happy Points and Moolah after a certain number of stains are cleaned or bits of rubbish collected. You never know when these bonuses are assigned, so it pays to never leave a pawprint unscrubbed or crumpled paper uncollected.</p>
<p>This game was absolutely made for anyone who enjoys exploring virtual worlds. Chibi-Robo is less than 10 centimetres tall (much like a certain diminutive plant-loving space traveller), so the Sandersons' modest two-bedroom home is a massive world to navigate. The genius of the game's design is shown by the many ways this world can be navigated, not all of which are immediately apparent. Part of the fun is simply looking around for objects of note and then figuring out how to reach them using stacks of books or shimmying up shoelaces, electrical cables or purse straps.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158172/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Chibi-Vision gives you a first-person view through the robot's eyes, highlighting special items and enabling full camera control beyond what's present in the normal third-person view. Items for Chibi-Robo's use in cleaning make themselves known immediately, but the function of other items won't be clear until a conversation or some other event takes place.</p>
<p>If there's a criticism to be made, it's that the automatic camera will sometimes allow objects to block your view of Chibi or have trouble changing perspective when navigating a corner of the room. Thankfully, manual control with the C-stick is available and does a good job of moving around obstacles, though the camera won't pass through walls, so sometimes it can only be moved in one direction. That this minor issue is the only serious complaint shows how well-crafted this game truly is.</p>
<p>Throughout, you get the sense that developer Skip really did its best to bring this world to life and let players have fun exploring it. Rather than using a mission structure or outright telling you what to do, you're given the tools and then enticed into moving the central story along by dropping hints that something interesting could happen if you go somewhere or take a certain action. At any given time you can have multiple avenues of exploration open, with different storylines happening, so if you run into a dead end with one, you can focus on another.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158176/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The bite-sized gaming portions and ability to save anywhere you can plug in to recharge batteries also makes Chibi-Robo! well-suited if you don't have time for lengthy play sessions. Best of all, after the credits roll, the game doesn't stop; you can choose to continue and tie up loose ends or find more secrets.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Chibi-Robo is an oddity: a game with a simple goal but a great deal of freedom in making the journey. It's a game about tiny altruistic robots helping humans with real problems, told in a light-hearted manner that will appeal to a wide audience. This is a game that really defines where Nintendo is coming from as a company: focusing on making people happy and doing good deeds; on helping people rather than shooting them in the face.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rue-valley-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/time-loop-rpg-rue-valley-set-for-november-release-date.1276887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Owlcat Games and developer Emotion Spark Studio have announced the release date for their time loop RPG&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>, and it's hitting PC and consoles in just a couple of months.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>will be arriving on November 11th. It'll serve as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/owlcat-publishing-rpgs" rel="nofollow">inaugural publishing project</a> for Owlcat; the studio is mainly known for developing CRPGs like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pathfinder-wrath-of-righteous" rel="nofollow">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>is one of two publishing projects currently in the works at Owlcat; the other,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, is a "turn-based RPG where feudal Japan meets magic and machine", although unfortunately, it doesn't have a release window yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rue-valley-release-date-corkboard.jpg?itok=AU3lrV79 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rue-valley-release-date-corkboard.jpg?itok=m1waU7zw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time loop RPG&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>arrives in November.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>, it's a time loop RPG heavily inspired by&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>(and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/longdue-hopetown-kickstarter-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">far</a> from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">only game</a> for which that description feels <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">appropriate</a>).</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>takes place during a time loop, you'll have the opportunity to shape the protagonist's personality as you see fit. You can, as Emotion Spark puts it, "be a cold-hearted loner who overthinks everything or a melodramatic loudmouth who always trusts their gut instinct".</p>

<p>As you play, you'll store your memories in a special graph, and you'll use those memories to inform your personality and skills. Just like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>de-emphasizes traditional combat in favor of a more psychological approach to the genre.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>, which gives you a sense of what you're in for if you decide to pick it up in November, right here.</p>




<p>While Owlcat may be moving into publishing with&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, that doesn't mean the studio is abandoning development; it's currently hard at work on <i>Warhammer 40k: Dark Heresy</i>, another turn-based RPG set in the grim darkness of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p><em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126190/Rue_Valley/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/rue_valley" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/rue-valley-48a101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Store</a>, as well as <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014770/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/rue-valley/9pjmhlrct0j2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch, on November 11th.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/vampire-survivors-balatro-kill-the-brickman-poncle-roguelike-2000619132</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-survivors-dev-publishes-surreal-roguelike-about-shooting-human-brick-heads-you-can-play-right-now.1276878/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Kill the Brickman</em> takes the basic premise of the arcade classic <em>Breakout</em> and adapts it to a <em>Balatro</em>-style deckbuilder roguelike in which you shoot custom bullets to break bricks, win cash, collect upgrades, and extend your run. So far, so neat. But no small part of <em>Kill the Brickman</em>‘s staying power is in its surreal presentation that puts Blendo Games-looking faces on all the violence. The bricks you kill? Human. The bullets you shoot? Human. It all adds up to a punchy bite-sized arcade experience published by <em>Vampire Survivors</em> dev Poncle that’s just weird enough to keep me coming back.</p> <p>Revealed during the Microsoft Gamescom showcase on Thursday, <em>Kill the Brickman</em> is out August 21 on Xbox and PC. In keeping with its publishing partner’s tradition, the game is only $5. It’s made by Doonutsaur, a small U.S.-based team whose only other project on Steam is a similarly offbeat roguelike called <em>Meow Legion</em>. Poncle director&nbsp;Luca Galante apparently got an email about the game, immediately fell in love, and signed it just a few days later. “Imagine <em>Tetris</em>, but if the bricks had anger issues and a taste for human flesh,” reads the tagline in the press release.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="poncle presents | Kill the Brickman - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8NHXV2qa9jE?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Kill the Brickman</em> has you control a revolver at the bottom of the screen that you load custom bullets into. Some do more damage. Some have more bounces. Others can deal corrosive damage, and so on. Think the original <em>Breakout</em>, or one of its many clones, but instead of bouncing a ball to break bricks like a spin-off of <em>Pong</em>, you’re playing a turn-based puzzle shooter infused with light <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> RPG elements.</p>

 <p>Why are you killing the Brickman? Well, if they get to close they will hurt you and deplete your health. Once all your hearts are gone the run is over. But like in any good roguelike, skill and intuition will only get you so far. You try to complete mini-objectives in each level to score extra cash, which compounds interest just like in <em>Balatro</em>, to purchase the sorts of upgrades that will make or break your run later on. There are relics to collect that provide special bonuses, and different gun chambers that will augment bullet effects based on the pattern you reload them in.</p> <p>I’ve only played a couple hours (Poncle provided <em>Kotaku</em> with access to an advance copy), but it’s one of those games I’ve been trying to make 10-15 minutes for at the end of each day and end up playing way longer than I expected. <em>Kill the Brickman</em> is a tight set of gameplay concepts wrapped up in a cool CRT pixel art aesthetic and a bizarre sense of humor, or is it horror? I’m excited to keep playing and see where it goes.</p>

The publisher has issued a takedown notice to Nexus Mods to remove a pair of custom nude mods that left the game's lead female character, Isabella Torrisi, without anything to wear.</p><p>Nexus Mods <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13520836-takedown-request-issued-by-take-two-interactive-software-inc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">acknowledged the request from Take-Two</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/take-two-lawyers-give-mafia-nude-mods-the-cement-shoes-treatment-dmca-projects-that-had-the-dons-daughter-parading-in-the-buff/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), and complied by removing the Nude Isabella mod and the Extended Textures for Nude Isabella mod, both of which were created by a user known as <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/norskpl/mods" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">norskpl</a>. PC Gamer speculates norskpl may have used Isabella's model from her love scenes in the game. Norskpl's non-nude mods created for The Old Country appear to have been left intact. That includes a few mods that let players assume the role of other characters from the Mafia franchise.</p><p>In the context of the game, Isabella is the daughter of Don Torrisi, the boss of the player's character, Enzo Favara. Although the Don is fiercely protective of Isabella and has his own ideas about who she should marry, she and Enzo have a clandestine affair behind his back. That's the primary romantic relationship in the game, and the source of inevitable conflict.</p><p>Getting rid of the nude mods may keep them off of Nexus Mods, but there's always the possibility that someone can create new mods and post them somewhere else. This may only be a temporary solution for Take-Two, and it only brought the issue to the forefront.</p><p>The Old Country developer Hanger 13 recently stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-will-expand-with-free-ride-mode-in-future-update/1100-6533987/" data-ref-id="1100-6533987">a future update will introduce a Free Ride mode</a> that will let players escape from the linear narrative of the primary story and allow them to explore the countryside around them. The game already has a free-roam mode through the Chapter Replay menu, but the background characters and their surroundings aren't as compelling to see in that mode.</p><p>Mafia: The Old Country is out now for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, 2K Games acknowledged <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-studio-laying-off-devs-as-diablo-boss-takes-over/1100-6534080/" data-ref-id="1100-6534080">a shake-up at Cloud Chamber</a>--the studio behind BioShock 4--following reports that the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-remake-cancelled-as-bioshock-4-reportedly-fails-a-review/1100-6533650/" data-ref-id="1100-6533650">failed an internal review</a>. Now, a new report suggests that the game could have come out as soon as next year if BioShock 4 had been more favorably received by the company.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, BioShock 4 was planned for a debut in either late 2026 or early 2027. However, the subsequent layoffs at Cloud Chamber will likely delay the next BioShock game even further. Bloomberg notes that 80 employees from Cloud Chamber were let go, leaving approximately 170 people remaining at the studio.</p><p>Studio head Kelley Gilmore was ousted from Cloud Chamber after the game's internal review, according to the report. In his place, 2K Games has hired Rod Fergusson to take over the studio following his own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-boss-departs-blizzard-after-five-years/1100-6533809/" data-ref-id="1100-6533809">departure from Blizzard</a>. In addition to leading the Diablo franchise for Blizzard, Fergusson previously worked on BioShock Infinite and helped get that game's production on track.</p><p>The initial reports about BioShock 4's status suggested that 2K Games was unsatisfied by the narrative. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-studio-laying-off-devs-as-diablo-boss-takes-over/1100-6534080/" data-ref-id="1100-6534080">a memo shared with GameSpot</a> by 2K Games, president David Ismaile said, "While we're excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we've made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game."</p><p>For now, there's no word about the release window of BioShock 4. Francis Lawrence is slated to direct a live-action BioShock movie at Netflix, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-tricky-bioshock-movie-is-not-dead-brings-on-a-new-writer/1100-6531560/" data-ref-id="1100-6531560">a new draft of the film has been written</a> by Terminator: Dark Fate scribe Justin Rhodes.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.analogue.co/announcements/analogue3d-shipping-in-q4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on its official website, Analogue says the new Q4 2025 release window has been "intentionally set conservatively", presumably so that no further delays happen and consumers aren't disappointed again.</p>

<p>The company says that the Analogue 3D is currently "at 99%", and that the project's "hardware, system, [and] packaging" have all been "set for months". It's "the last 1%" on which Analogue is currently "focused", although the company stops short of explaining exactly what that 1% constitutes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-q4-2025-white.jpg?itok=rgc8Xjt5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-q4-2025-white.jpg?itok=FjGFjwCz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's going to take a little longer for you to get your Analogue 3D, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p>Analogue closes its statement by saying it's "pushing without pause and appreciate[s] everyone’s patience and trust", promising to "deliver — delays or not". It seems the company is still confident you're going to get your Analogue 3D, although we don't know exactly when yet.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time the Analogue 3D has been delayed. The console, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-announced-and-its-4k-nintendo-64" rel="nofollow">first revealed back in 2023</a>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">pushed back to 2025 in late 2024</a>. The release date was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-july" rel="nofollow">moved once again back in March</a>, with Analogue pledging to ship the machine by July, although that's obviously a goal the company was unable to meet.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what the Analogue 64 is, it's a retro "reimagining" of the Nintendo 64; it plays real N64 cartridges and apes the original aesthetic of Nintendo's console, although mercifully, the controller with which Analogue recommends you play is a little more ergonomic.</p>

<p>Rather than using emulation, the Analogue 3D uses FPGA, which the company says effectively eliminates "incompatibilities found in software emulation like input lag, graphic/audio inaccuracies, timing/frame rate issues and more".</p>

<p>The catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> was one of our favourite announcements out of the Switch 2 reveal Direct back in April. A lot of us missed the original remake when it arrived on beefier consoles back in 2020, and even those who did manage to get around to it were excited by the prospect of playing it on the go.</p>
<p>Nintendo and Square Enix have kept quiet on any further information about the game in the months since (come on, we want a release date!), so we were pleased to see it join the third-party lineup in Nintendo's Switch 2 booth at Gamescom this year. With its 40+ hour campaign, this has the potential to be a pretty hefty port, so would the new hardware be able to keep up?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the lovely Felix was on hand in Cologne to blast through a 15-minute FFVII preview and fill us in on what we can expect. In short, it's looking really rather good.</p>
<p>Mr. Felix was happy to report that the portion of the game he got to sample ran super smoothly, with a frame rate that he put somewhere between 30 and 60fps. The accompanying over-the-shoulder footage shows it in action, and we have to agree, that smoothness is a welcome sight (particularly after the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">worrying stories</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, he only got the opportunity to see the early introduction in this preview, so there's no guarantee that things will be quite so strong as the game opens up, but it looks promising so far! You can check out Felix's thoughts in full in the above discussion with the wonderful Zion.</p>
<p>Now then, how about we go more specific on that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-scores-switch-2-release-window">'Winter' release window</a>, eh?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This week was a big one for Activision and all the studios that work on the popular <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-call-of-duty-games-from-worst-to-best-1844765026"><em>Call of Duty</em> franchise</a>. At Gamescom, devs took to the stage of Opening Night Live to show off our first real look at <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-opening-night-live-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trailer-2000618479"><em>Black Ops 7</em></a>, the new main entry in the franchise. But due to various reasons, including hype for EA’s <em>Battlefield 6</em> and fans feeling burned out, the vibes are all off, and for the first time in years, it feels like the <em>Call of Duty</em> empire is shaking.</p> <p>Even before <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s big gameplay reveal at Gamescom, the upcoming shooter was being targeted online by fans and critics who loved the <a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797"><em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta</a>. Players, myself included, praised <em>BF6</em>‘s gritty combat, boots-on-the-ground action, sharp visuals, squad gameplay, and snappy shooting. For many players online, it felt like a return to the realistic military sims that once dominated the industry back in the early to mid aughts. I’m talkin’ games like <em>Battlefield 3</em>, <em>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</em>, <em>Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter</em>, and<em> Rainbow Six Vegas.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><em>BF6′</em>s beta, its popularity, and the reaction to it led to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/former-blizzard-president-predicts-battlefield-6-is-going-to-boot-stomp-black-ops-7-because-call-of-duty-has-become-lazy/">former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra tweeting</a>: “<em>Battlefield</em> [6] will boot stomp <em>CoD</em> this year. But the real win here is <em>CoD</em> won’t be lazy anymore, and we’ll all get better FPS games for it.” It didn’t help that during the <em>BF6</em> beta, <a href="https://x.com/CallofDutyWire/status/1954624776921894980">a <em>Call of Dut</em>y rollercoaster gun went viral</a> for all the wrong reasons. And before that, players were upset over expensive crossover skins, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmvByyks-Fc">including<em> American Dad</em> and <em>Beavis &amp; Butthead c</em>osmetics</a>, that some felt were turning<em> Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Warzone</em> into <em>Fortnite</em>, a game famous for its wild IP sandbox that features Goku, Batman, and more.</p>

 <p>This all led to Tuesday, when <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s first gameplay trailer premiered at Gamescom. It did so under a lot of scrutiny and in an atmosphere where even longtime vets of the series weren’t happy about the state of the game. So when the trailer showed off wild, trippy gameplay involving dream worlds and robots and strange sci-fi tech, it went over very, very poorly online. On Reddit, you can find fans saying they are done.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9txkGBj_trg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Another indicator that this new <em>Black Ops 7</em> reveal isn’t landing with fans is how poorly it has been received on YouTube. The comments below the trailer are filled with players claiming they are going to pre-order <em>BF6</em> instead and wondering what happened to <em>Call of Duty.</em> <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1958183849877201177">As reported by <em>CharlieIntel</em></a>, the <em>Black Ops 7</em> reveal trailer has only around 36k likes. That makes it one of the least liked trailers in the franchise’s history.</p> <p>Things only got worse when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-paying-attention-to-community-feedback-on-goofy-skins"><em>IGN</em> asked Miles Leslie</a>, associate creative director on the game, if<em> Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;was going to feature silly crossover skins. Leslie claimed that the devs were “always looking at community feedback” and then proceeded to offer up a nothingburger answer about trying to “calibrate” future skins based on “feedback” and making sure “all fans feel represented.”&nbsp; This answer didn’t go over well with players, especially when <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/it-has-to-be-grounded-battlefield-6-devs-say-cosmetics-wont-be-as-goofy-as-call-of-duty-but-that-sounds-almost-too-good-to-be-true/">compared to the response given by <em>BF6</em>‘s design director Shashank Uchil</a> when asked a similar question about cosmetics.</p>

 <p>“It has to be grounded. That is what <em>BF3</em> and <em>BF4</em> was—it was all soldiers, on the ground,” said Uchil. “It’s going to be like this. I don’t think it needs&nbsp;Nicki Minaj. Let’s keep it real, keep it grounded.”</p> <p>It would be foolish to count <em>Call of Duty</em> out in 2025. The franchise is still incredibly popular, especially with people who aren’t online every day, posting on Reddit and Discord. In 2024, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2djbq4c2n"><em>Black Ops 6</em> was still the best-selling premium video game of the year</a>, and the overall franchise sold more games last year than any other series. I would be shocked if <em>Battlefield 6</em> outsells<em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> this holiday season. Still, it’s clear that the vibes are rotten with this year’s <em>Call of Duty.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>It feels like fans are getting burned out on back-to-back direct sequels (something the franchise avoided for nearly 20 years), expensive cosmetics, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">AI-produced slop</a>, the series getting wackier and weirder, and a sense that the people making the games aren’t listening to the people playing the games. This isn’t entirely new. For as long as<em> Call of Duty</em> has been popular, people have been hating on it. But this year, grumpy fans and tired vets have<em> Battlefield 6</em> to rally around, an FPS that feels like it was designed in a lab to recreate the experience of playing those old Xbox 360-era military shooters people loved so much. In a way, it almost feels like <em>CoD</em> fans are hoping for <em>BF6</em> to punish<em> Black Ops 7</em>, and they seem willing to pay money to help kick Activision in the gut.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>TT Games is back with a bang with the upcoming release of LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, telling the story of decades of the Caped Crusader’s history, and multiplayer details have already been announced.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Revealed at Gamescom</a> with a 2026 release window, eyebrows have been raised following news that LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight seemingly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-will-feature-only-7-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only has seven playable characters</a>, which would be a huge change given previous titles have featured hundreds of minifigures to choose from.</p>



<p>Multiplayer has been a core feature in TT Games’ LEGO franchise for years, with no major changes to the format so far. Here, we’ve got all the details on whether that approach is being adjusted with the new LEGO Batman title.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-have-online-multiplayer">Will LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight Have Online Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Switch up. Image via TT Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will not support online multiplayer or co-op, it has been confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>In an <a href="https://legogamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/43979623023123-LEGO-Batman-Legacy-of-the-Dark-Knight-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ post</a> about the game, it was announced that online co-op will not be available, continuing the trend from other LEGO titles from TT Games.</p>



<p>The most recent release, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, also did not feature online co-op. While there has been a desire from players for the feature to be added, it will not be available in LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight.</p>



<p>It remains be seen whether any future LEGO games from TT Games change this trend, though it doesn’t seem likely currently.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-have-split-screen-co-op">Will LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight Have Split-Screen Co-Op?</h2>



<p><strong>While LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight does not have online co-op support, two-player couch co-op has been confirmed as a feature.</strong></p>



<p>Couch co-op is a staple of TT Games’ LEGO titles, and, while couch co-op is becoming increasingly rarer in modern gaming, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will not be removing the feature.</p>



<p>Only two players are supported at a single time, however, which makes sense given that a fair amount of screen space is required to truly enjoy the LEGO experience.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for the next couch co-op title to play with a friend, partner, or other relative, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight could tick the boxes.</p>

            <p>
John Carpenter's Halloween is the latest horror movie classic to get the multiplayer treatment, and it's coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in 2026.
</p>
<p>
Halloween is being developed by Illfonic, the studio behind the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/friday-the-13th-the-game">Friday the 13th: The Game</a>, Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game, and Predator Hunting Grounds. And like those movie adaptations, Halloween is also being designed as a "one-versus-many" asymmetrical horror affair as the iconic Michael Myers pursues the residents of Haddonfield.
</p>

"In dynamic and ever-changing 1v4 asymmetrical multiplayer matches, hero players must arm themselves with everyday household items, weapons, and knowledge to combat an unpredictable and unkillable enemy," Illfonic explains. "Convincing townsfolk and contacting the police will lead to increasingly powerful and thorough neighbourhood patrols. To even the odds, you can command and equip NPCs with weapons to outsmart or even overpower The Shape, providing precious windows for escape."

<p>
Illfonic reckons its take on Halloween "masterfully recreates" the ambience of the original 1978 movie, with talk of multiple maps set across "authentic" Haddonfield locations, and a soundtrack inspired by John Carpenter's classic score. Notably too, its familiar asymmetrical multiplayer mode will be accompanied by an offline single-player story mode featuring bots.
</p>
<p>
There's no word of a release date for Halloween beyond its "2026" arrival on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but there's a mood-setting trailer above.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Excitement levels continue to rise for Hollow Knight: Silksong ahead of release, and a flood of new gameplay from a demo has made its way online, leading to the question of whether it can be downloaded.</p>



<p>In our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/">hands-on preview</a>, we made it clear that the hype for Hollow Knight: Silksong is well placed, and the assessment from others who have gotten a chance to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play at Gamescom</a> is similar. Now, though, players around the world want their own chance to play.</p>



<p>The guide below details everything we know about the Hollow Knight: Silksong demo, including whether you can add it to your library to try out.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-available-to-download">Is The Hollow Knight: Silksong Demo Available to Download?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Worth the wait. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is not currently a Hollow Knight: Silksong demo available to download, and all gameplay footage currently emerging is from Gamescom.</strong></p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is playable on both Xbox and Nintendo Switch platforms at Gamescom in Cologne, but it is exclusively available at the event for the time being. Therefore, it cannot be downloaded.</p>



<p>The demo is also the same stage of the game that was first playable at E3 2019 six years ago, which, though it may be surprising, could mean it takes place very early in the game.</p>



<p>Fans around the world will need to wait at least a little while longer to get a taste of the game, as currently the only details we know about the playable demo is it’s availability at Gamescom. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-a-hollow-knight-silksong-demo">Will There Be A Hollow Knight: Silksong Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>No announcements have been made regarding a Hollow Knight: Silksong demo, but there could be one provided before launch.</strong></p>



<p>A big Hollow Knight: Silksong announcement is coming today via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGeJwsUP9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, which could reveal the release date or details about a demo, early access, or other details.</p>



<p>If there is a demo, expect it to be available across all platforms, though given the hype for the game, it could release without one. </p>



<p>For now, though, there isn’t a way to play Hollow Knight: Silksong early, but keep an eye on Insider Gaming for more coverage and news as it breaks.</p>



<p>Is Hollow Knight: Silksong going to be a Game of the Year contender? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. </p>

Oi oi, where my Janeway fans at? Where my Parisians and my Torresians? Can I get a whoop, whoop for Chakotay? A high five for Seven of Nine? Daedalic have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a>, a "story-based survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game" adaptation of the loneliest of the classic Treks. Created by developers gameXcite, who I may yet forgive for capitalising their name that way, it asks you to "manage systems and crew, engage in diplomacy, navigate difficult moral decisions, and face the unknown". It's got a cutaway dollhouse spaceship and a HUD made up to resemble a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a> bridge display. Also, Ensign Harry Kim is here! He wants orders. Kim, your orders are to roll that trailer.

<p>
Here's some blurb from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">the Steam page</a>: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Set aboard the U.S.S. Voyager and deep in the unexplored reaches of the Delta Quadrant, Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown invites players to relive--and redefine--the legendary starship's journey back to earth. The game blends exploration, ship &amp; resource management, roguelite elements, and meaningful choices. Experience crew dynamics and a fresh take on a beloved sci-fi universe -- with what-if scenarios that open up new possibilities. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
If you're like me, you are presently being torn in half by the contrast between your apathy for yet another set of "roguelike elements", and your enthusiasm for the what-if scenarios. Maybe an episode where Janeway becomes the Borg Queen? Maybe the Doctor gets to be captain? Maybe Neelix undergoes some kind of Garrus-style reinvention as a badass with hairy ears? All that may have actually happened, I can't remember. Some more from the Steam page: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Take a risky approach or play it safe. Be diplomatic or let phasers do the talking. Research technologies that were shunned by the crew. But: Be prepared to deal with the consequences of your actions! The game features rogue-like elements, so in each run you will encounter different situations and even iconic characters might meet an early end if you don't react accordingly. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
There's a base-building component: you'll add facilities to Voyager's innards as you go, in the manner popularised by XCOM: Enemy Unknown. I'm less sold on the tiddly, top-down spaceship movement within solar systems, which recalls <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> at its dinkiest and makes the Delta <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quadrant">Quadrant</a> seem as strange and enveloping as Center Parcs. But I do like the sound of the away missions, in which you get to handpick a team of named faces and redshirts.</p><p>"A team with skills that complement each other might be best suited for the task, but it is up to you to call the shots," the developers comment. "Minimize the risk for the team's members, rush headlong into danger, or take a scientific approach - you decide." All this and, of course, ship-to-ship combat, in which you'll assign crews to stations and target individual systems.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date. In case it wasn't obvious already, my excitement about this game is at least 80% nostalgia spike, with another 5% consisting of furtive teenage memories of certain saucy fan fiction websites. Finally, we can make Paris and Chakotay bone. The developers don't have much form for space sims: going by their website, they have hitherto specialised exclusively in Asterix comic adaptations. I guess a starship is a kind of Gallic village? Let's finish off by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMHx7fiLEow">watching the original Voyager intro</a> again.
