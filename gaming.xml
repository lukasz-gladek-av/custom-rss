			<p>We’re living through a veritable golden age of fighting games right now. It feels like you can’t go more than a couple of months without a new feature-rich, mechanically dense and utterly addicting fighter coming out, and with the hefty amount of DLC support modern fighting games get, even the ones that are a bit long in the tooth still feel fresh years after release. There’s a new wave of gamers taking to these games and entrenching themselves in the fighting game community (FGC). Despite flourishing modern releases, though, so many of the older iconic staples haven’t been easily playable or accessible in ages. Enter Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics to right some of these wrongs.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection Title Showcase Trailer: MARVEL SUPER HEROES vs. STREET FIGHTER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjgLcjbytGU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is arguably the game that kicked off the culture and energy that we’ve associated with the FGC for so long. Now, thanks to Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, everyone and anyone can be taken for a ride in this all-time classic – as well as play the six other games that helped form the history and backbone that would ultimately lead to this all-star fighting game’s birth.</p>


<p>I can’t imagine there’s an equal amount of fever and hype around all of the games in this collection. Obviously, the star of the show is Marvel vs. Capcom 2 – the 3v3 crossover fighter from 2000 that is pretty undeniably one of the best fighting games of all time for multiple reasons and across numerous categories. It’s a game full of boisterous style and campy, flashy vibes that you can’t help but smile at. Sure, back when it first came out, people hated the soundtrack so much that you couldn’t go to a single FGC meetup without seeing someone rocking a custom MvC2 mixtape full of Ricky Martin and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony tracks. Nowadays, there’s as much of a charm to the goofy character-select music as there is to the beautifully rendered character portraits, the overwhelming stage animations, and the feverishly fluid sprite animations.</p>

<p>What I had never a strong finger on until now, though, was just how many games Capcom made as part of their partnership with Marvel, which ultimately brought them to the iconic character-stuffed tag fighter we all know and love. MvC2 is actually the fourth game in a series of Capcom x Marvel crossover fighters – and there were two Marvel-only fighting games based on Street Fighter 2 that came before that. Plus a Punisher beat-em-up!</p>

<p>All of those games make up this collection, and I wish the game itself did a better job of presenting that history and chronology. In-game, none of these titles get blurbs or descriptions explaining their historical context – you can’t even see what year they were released. I had a sneaking suspicion that X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes were made during the Street Fighter 2 era, but I couldn’t confirm that theory until I went to the official website for this compilation.</p>
<p>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics isn’t entirely lacking in archival-focused features, though. There’s a Museum mode that provides dedicated art galleries and music players for each game in the pack. The art galleries are astounding, providing not just high-quality scans of every playable character portrait, but even arcade-ending sketches, design document pages, stage concepts, original arcade marquee images, and more. There should be a more structured way to sift through all of these, though – each image is numbered and vaguely titled, but you need to scroll through each one manually in full-screen. The music player is a little more robust, although you can’t customise any of the music played within the actual games.</p>

<p>Each entry in the pack has also been updated to be the most feature-rich version of each game. Every hidden character and unlockable/secret color palette is available, but you can decide to disable them or require their original unlock requirements if you so choose. Part of me wishes the game did a better job at providing documentation on how to access some of these secrets or what they specifically are, but it’s also kind of fun that you get to emulate that old-school vibe of frantically asking friends <em>“Is Akuma in Marvel Super Heroes???”</em> to seek the truth.</p>
<p>Each game also provides a new training-mode, letting you freely select your characters and stage on top of enabling access to frame data and extensive training CPU options. For a game like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, it’s a game-changer that makes competitive play more accessible than ever. And when you’re ready to compete, each game offers casual, lobby, and ranked online play for you to test your skills.</p>

<p>I’m honestly blown away by this release – in an era where Capcom has been pushing so many of their legacy franchises forward with high-budget, modernised sequels and follow-ups, seeing them concurrently respect their past and make it all so accessible is a standard that I wish every game publisher of their scale would follow. For this pack to not only exist, but be as feature-rich as it is, makes my heart soar.</p>

			<p>The wait is finally over. The PlayStation 5 Pro is getting revealed tomorrow in a new technical presentation hosted by March Cerny.</p>
<p>The technical presentation, which will be around 9 minutes long, will be <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1833158510030516386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1833158510030516386%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">streamed</a> tomorrow, September 10th, at 8:00 a.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. CET. While the announcement makes no mention of the PlayStation 5 Pro, the presentation will undoubtedly focus on Sony's long-rumored hardware refresh.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro reveal finally happening this week is not surprising for all those who have been following all the rumors regarding the soon-to-be-announced system, as a well-known insider proved to be correct once again by confirming that the reveal would be happening <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-announced-state-of-play/">early this week.</a> The fact that the reveal was also around the corner was essentially confirmed by another well-known insider who managed to get an early look at the system's packaging late last month, providing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/">sketch</a> that confirmed how the new system's design won't be that much different from that of the base model.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is said to be a considerable step up from the base model. It features a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-4x-performance-ray-tracing-path-tracing/">45% more powerful GPU</a> compared to the base model, which will offer up to 4x ray tracing performance. In addition, the console will support the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, which will make the system feel <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-100-faster-upscaling-epic-settings/">100% faster than the base model.</a></p>

							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S (2025)</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM series is a fighting game franchise that needs to introduction. It was the culmination of a long collaboration between the two companies which began back in 1994 with X-Men: Children of the Atom and continued with Marvel Super Heroes the following year. With the release in 1996 of X-Men vs. Street Fighter, the world of fighting games changed forever, thanks to the game's tag system, which allowed players to swap between two different characters at almost any time during a fight and unleash super moves together, a system that was further refined in Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter, paving the way for the proper MARVEL vs. CAPCOM series in 1998. The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics celebrates this fruitful collaboration by including every game mentioned above alongside the side-scrolling beat'em up The Punisher and what many still consider the very best entry in the series, MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 2: New Age of Heroes.</p>
<p>As every game included in the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics collection is not available on modern gaming platforms, even their barebones release would have been welcome. CAPCOM, however, went the extra mile and provided some additional goodies that die-hard fans of the series will appreciate, such as the artwork included in the Gallery, which lets them delve deeper into the history of the franchise and its creation and the ability to listen to the entirety of the soundtrack of each game. Each title also sports its marquee card, including the basic controls for each game, for an authentic recreation of the arcade experience. Those who prefer a more modern touch can bring up the command list in any game to learn every unique normal and special move their characters can perform.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240905233150_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Like in previous CAPCOM fighting game collections, such as the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/capcom-fighting-collection-you-must-defeat-sheng-long-to-stand-a-chance/">Fighting Collection</a>, the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics lets players pick which version of the game they want to play, set the difficulty, attack power and timer speed, unlock secret characters and colors and so on. Every game also features a training mode that covers all basics, with the exception of frame data, different wallpapers, display filters, and the ability to change the display size between different options. As such, when it comes to new options and additions, the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics definitely does things right.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the same hasn't happened with online play. Due to the limited player population during the review period, I wasn't able to find a single online match in any of the games, so the review will be updated once the collection is officially released and more players are around. Even like this, however, I have no doubt that, at least on PC, online play will be far from being optimal due to the lack of cross-platform play, which feels like a major oversight. Many of these games, MARVEL vs CAPCOM 2 above all, aren't exactly dead games on PC, thanks to Fightcade, which allowed the communities of many classic fighting games to continue enjoying them online with an excellent implementation of rollback netcode. As such, I really don't see many of the players who already play these games daily on Fightcade make the switch, as the ranking system, which employs the same League system seen in Street Fighter V and<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/"> Street Fighter 6</a>, is not a very good incentive to do so. On consoles, on the other hand, I expect things to be slightly different, given there's no other way to play these games, either offline or online. Even so, the lack of cross-platform play is a major issue that will inevitably impact the popularity of the collection in the long term, diminishing the collection's appeal. Speaking on PC, the collection also has a small issue that prevents the correct saving of resolution settings upon quitting, which is, honestly, a minor problem, given that these settings only affect the menus.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240905235755_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>No matter the online play issues, if you have never played any of the games in the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics and are a fighting game fan, you are in for a threat. While the games have aged differently, and some of them don't feel as good to play in 2024 as they did back when they were released, X-Men: Children of the Atom chief among them, they can still be a ton of fun. Having been developed back when CAPCOM was working on the Street Fighter Alpha series, all of the Marvel licensed games in the collection, with the exception of The Punisher, share a lot of similarities with the series, such as the anime aesthetics, the flashy super moves, the ability to block attacks in the air and so on. Things started going wild with MARVEL Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, which expanded the tag system introduced in X-Men vs Street Fighter with the introduction of assist attacks that opened up some new combo possibilities, culminating in MARVEL vs CAPCOM 2: New Age of Heroes.</p>
<p>The second entry in the series is undeniably the best game included in the collection, thanks to its massive character roster including 56 characters, the three-character teams, the ability to pick between three different Assist Types, the unique visuals combining masterfully designed sprites and 3D backgrounds and the amazing soundtrack. While the game retains many of the features that made the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM tag fighting games unique, such as the flashy moves and combo system, which allow players to chain together normals of increasing strength and perform aerial combos that often lead to touch of death situations and infinite, it's also the game that plays the most differently, as the traditional six-button control scheme of CAPCOM's fighting games was changed to allow for quicker access to assist attacks, which are more important than in any other game that came before it. Needless to say, it's the game that aged best and feels as great to play now as it did 24 years ago.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240906000030_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Among the games included in MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, The Punisher is the one that stands out the most, as it is, as already mentioned, a side-scrolling beat'em up in the vein of Final Fight and Captain Commando. While fun for a short while, the game is obviously very dated for today's standards and gets a little repetitive after a short while, mostly due to the game featuring a single playable character since both The Punisher himself, Frank Castle, and Nick Fury have the same moveset, but its inclusion in the collection is wholly deserved, given its cult status and its popularity in arcades back in 1993.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, despite the lack of cross-platform play that is inevitably going to impact the collection's popularity, the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a worthwhile purchase for most fighting games players, especially if they are console players. All the included games play like their arcade counterparts, and the fact alone that CAPCOM released it confirms the publisher hasn't abandoned the series after the disastrous Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite. The release of a proper fourth entry in the series is not a guarantee, but for the time being, the community can finally say the sentence it has wanted to say for a long time: Mahvel's back!</p>

<p>The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a fantastic celebration of the series, showcasing some of the best fighting games released by the Japanese publisher in the late '90s and early 2000s. Although the lack of cross-platform play reduces the collection's appeal, the additional options and extras are welcome enhancements that make playing these timeless classics on modern hardware even more enticing, especially on consoles.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/rugrats-adventures-in-gameland-review-babyface-enthusiasm</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rugrats-adventures-in-gameland-review-babyface-enthusiasm.975876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/rugrats-adventures-in-gameland-review-babyface-enthusiasm<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve periodically been a defender of the movie or TV show tie-in game experience. As someone whose younger years were largely dedicated to playing the Game Boy Advance version of <em>Monsters Inc. </em>whenever my 7-year-old brain got confused by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/wheres-wario-unrealized-potential-of-wario-land"><em>Wario Land</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/metroid-samus-returns-review-in-her-prime"><em>Metroid 2: Return of Samus</em></a>, I understand and respect their place in the gaming atmosphere. It’s by that extension I look at <em>Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland</em> with a hopeful smile.</p>
<p>This is the latest release from developers Wallride Games, developed in collaboration with Media Indie Exchange (Stylized as The MIX Games), and is an all-new story in the <em>Rugrats </em>universe. After Tommy, Chuckie, Phil &amp; Lil watch an advert for a new Reptar game on the TV, through the power of imagination, they transform the house into a video game they can play themselves. Together, they collect coins and defeat familiar foes from the TV show in order to finally face Reptar.</p>
<p>There’s a certain vision <em>Adventures in Gameland</em> presents from the get-go, and indeed, even with its marketing. It’s not just aiming to be a nostalgic return to form for one of Nickelodeon’s flagship shows, but also a return to simpler times, emulating the efforts of other movie and TV show tie-in titles. As such, the game aims to evoke nostalgia, whilst claiming to learn lessons from their predecessors.</p>

<p>Other titles in the fray would stick to being an honest-to-god platformer, left-to-right until you recreate the ending of whatever work it’s based on, but here? We’ve got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mega-man-11"><em>Mega Man</em></a> level structure that allows you to tackle stages whenever and however you want, and <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em>-esque mechanics in regards to what the titular Rugrats can offer.</p>
<p>With that said, <em>Adventures in Gameland</em> actually has a one-up on <em>Mario Bros 2</em> by allowing you to swap characters during gameplay. As for how they play, it’s pretty much a 1:1 recreation of the <em>Doki Doki Panic</em> reskin - Tommy’s your Mario counterpart, Chuckie kicks his feet in the air for extra height and has trouble lifting objects up like Luigi, and Lil can float for a short time, not unlike Princess Peach.</p>
<p>There’s one small issue, however, and that’s telegraphing. There’s a hard mode on offer that disables being able to swap characters during gameplay, with your only option being that you choose one of the four babies before a level starts, and stick with them. If you chose someone like, say, Phil, who has the lowest jump out of all 4 Rugrats, there’s a good chance you can get stuck with some of the more frankly awful level design this game possesses.</p>

<p>The key is consistency, and <em>Adventures in Gameland</em> knows no concept of the word. The game can’t decide whether it wants to provide straightforward platforming challenges, or intricate maze-like designs where you’re running around headless looking for Reptar coins. Neither option provides many avenues for interesting or involving gameplay, as levels tend to end far too quickly for anything remotely engaging to come to fruition.</p>
<p>The controls are also awful, heavily delayed for you to make any action, which is made all the more fun once <em>Adventures in Gameland</em> starts introducing more pressing hazards. Conveyor belts and icy platforms can be an absolute nightmare to navigate due to how much momentum these babies need to build up before they can react appropriately to any dangers. It’s simply not fun to play, it’s more like a <em>Mega Man</em> fan game without intuition of what makes <em>Mega Man</em> so appropriately challenging.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that the visual design doesn’t want to cooperate with communicating hazards and objects.<em> Adventures in Gameland</em> offers 2 modes of graphic fidelity; HD and 8-bit. The latter is cute and well-executed alongside its sound design, which can range from warbly earworms to frenetic and unnecessary screeches. The HD option? Almost completely irredeemable.</p>

<p>This may be a nostalgia thing, but <em>Rugrats </em>as a show always felt approachable because of its animation style: squiggly and childish lining with that 90s color palette worked wonders on an old CRT TV, or even as a memory. Transplanting it to a 3D space, or HD in this instance, detracts so much of the magic from it to the point where I’d say <em>Adventures in Gameland </em>in its HD format is one of the most visually unappealing experiences I’ve had in a while.</p>
<p>It also detracts from the gameplay. When the HD filter is used, the screen zooms in far too much for you to be able to react appropriately to any threat or obstacle. It feels like a flash game from yesteryear, plastered on the front of a Nickelodeon website to be played once, and never again. Even then, it doesn’t feel formative to the experience, it’s not enough of an emulation of <em>Rugrats </em>to be meaningful, bar some quick references to stuff like “Angelica’s Worst Nightmare” and Reptar.</p>
<p>In its 8-bit format, the game is tolerable, but only just. Threats and actual navigation fail to be hampered, bar some rather awkward pathfinding the player has to commit to. Sometimes the screen wraps around, sometimes it doesn’t. A doorway may be accentuated as such, or sometimes you’ll have to find the right spot on the platform to appropriately transition.</p>

<p>These examples can be brought down to the handful, but given how little there is on display, a handful becomes half the plate. All of this to serve a game that doesn't feel like it appeals to any demographic, whether it's the young'ins looking to see what they missed out on with <em>Rugrats</em>, or the nostalgia-fueled adults who remember watching <em>Rugrats </em>as a kid. It's a truly bizarre artifact of befuddled intention.</p>
<h2><em>Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>
<p>When <em>Adventures in Gameland </em>says that it wants to be an emulation of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/shovelware-importance-games-industry">licensed game experience we all know and love</a>, or begrudgingly acknowledge, it’s easy to be sucked in given years of knowledge. Indeed, it takes some bold strides, but fails at nearly every conceivable angle, and spectacularly so. As a celebration, it passes the mark, but don’t let that fool you for this being a remotely fun time.</p>
<hr><p><strong><em>Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland </em></strong><em>was reviewed on Xbox Series S using a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 6 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activist-ubisoft-investor-calls-for-strategic-and-structural-change.975873/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A company that serves as a "significant minority shareholder" in Ubisoft has called for major structural and strategic change at the studio and has expressed "deep dissatisfaction" with Ubisoft's current direction.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an open letter</a> to Ubisoft's board of directors, which CCs CEO Yves Guillemot and stakeholder Tencent, investment company AJ Investments criticizes Ubisoft's "current performance and strategic direction".</p>
<p>AJ Investments says Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delays-rainbow-six-mobile-and-the-division-resurgence-beyond-march-2025" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent quarterly results</a>, which saw upcoming releases&nbsp;<em>The Division Resurgence&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Mobile&nbsp;</em>pushed back beyond March next year, have "heightened" its concerns about management's ability to deliver results for shareholders.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-investors-letter-skull-and-bones.jpg?itok=zB6lAOYP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-investors-letter-skull-and-bones.jpg?itok=1_H6YRgh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>AJ Investments criticizes the launch of games like&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones</em>, which it says was "not a success".</figcaption></figure><p>The investor sets out four proposals to "increase [the] value of Ubisoft for all stakeholders". They include allowing Ubisoft to go private, selling the company, changing current management and ousting Guillemot as CEO, or starting a "proxy fight" via French minority law.</p>
<p>As for its reasoning, AJ Investors says that Ubisoft is being "mismanaged", and that shareholders are currently "hostages of Guillemot family members and Tencent who take advantages of them".</p>
<p>The company goes on to say that it "cannot understand" Ubisoft's management strategy, and that the studio seems more focused on "pleasing investors" rather than providing an "exceptional experience" for its fans.</p>
<p>AJ Investors claims that many of the studio's IPs, including&nbsp;<em>Rayman</em>,&nbsp;<em>Watch Dogs</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell</em>, are being underutilized, and that recent releases are underwhelming.</p>
<p>The company does, however, say that&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/prince-of-persia-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>&nbsp;</em>was merely "okay", but that "nobody talks about the game anymore". That's...probably because it's a single-player game everyone's finished, guys. Not every game needs to be headline news every day of the week.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-ubisoft.jpg?itok=n-mlEHuD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-ubisoft.jpg?itok=gHECorhP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>was merely "okay", according to AJ Investors.</figcaption></figure><p>Further on into the letter, AJ Investors proposes several ways by which Ubisoft could improve its performance and its standing with shareholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They include taking the company private for a "fair price", as well as laying off staff, a procedure AJ Investors rather callously refers to as "optimiz[ing] staff levels". Other recommendations include refocusing on core IPs and another call for changes in management.</p>
<p>This letter comes after industry analyst Serkan Toto <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1830972799634284971" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed out last week</a> that investors seem "very disappointed" about the sales of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, with shares dipping 10% in just two days. Toto followed this up with <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1833067702019313773" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another post today</a> noting that stocks had fallen another 9% in Paris.</p>
<p>AJ Investors does note that the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>Metacritic score currently sits at 76, a score the company says is "quite good in our view" (despite stating earlier that the game was "not 100% ready to release"). For what it's worth, our own reviewer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review">rather liked it as well</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see how Ubisoft responds to AJ Investors' call for change, if indeed it responds at all. Stay tuned for more.</p>

I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236967/sony-ps5-pro-design-leak-image">recently heard</a> that developers need to make any games released on or after September 16th compatible with the PS5 Pro.</p><p>Codenamed Trinity, the PlayStation 5 Pro model will include a more powerful GPU and a slightly faster CPU mode, according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24130716/sony-ps5-pro-specs-release-date-rumors">Sony documents seen by <em>The Verge</em></a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-strips-vulkan-api-from-rainbow-six-siege.975858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/vulkan-api-rainbow-six-removed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft recently revealed that Vulkan API has been removed from Rainbow Six Siege, and many users are still discovering this for the first time when they try booting the game on PC. This change came with the delivery of Operation Twin Shells (Y9S3) but it was only referenced in <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/seasons/twinshells" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the patch notes</a> with a few basic words and no context.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-vulkan-in-rainbow-six">What is Vulkan in Rainbow Six?</h2>



<p>It’s more like what <strong>was </strong>Vulkan in Rainbow Six Siege…</p>



<p>The Vulkan API was a graphics-based API that provided various visual enhancements to PC players, especially those utilising multi-core processors. It promoted smoother frame rates and helped those using lower-end gaming rigs, and it had been in the game since 2020 – until it was unceremoniously removed by Ubisoft.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/1faj5dd/y9s3_api_updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Reddit</a>, representatives of Ubisoft provided more context:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;As listed in our Patch Notes, DX11 will be available as an optional way to run the game for the moment. We know that these changes have led to a few questions from some of you out there, so we wanted to give some insight into why this choice was made.</p>



<p>At its core, this is a tech decision, and it’s been made to better position Siege for the future, while also ensuring that the Siege tech aligns with others inside and outside of Ubisoft. The bonus is an optimization of resources that allows us to put more focus on the game itself.</p>



<p>Given the wide variety of possible PC system configurations, we will review any issues raised by the community as our work is ongoing to ensure the best possible experience. Note that due to the API changes, if you currently launch the game directly via a shortcut, we recommend that you create new desktop shortcuts of the DirectX12 or DirectX11 executables.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, many users started complaining about performance issues in the comments on this post. One player wrote, ‘With the current bugs regarding crashes and black loading screens with the DX11 version, among the plethora of other bugs like the AC causing BSoDs. I don’t think this is a very smart decision.’</p>



<p>To many, it’s a huge downgrade – the consensus seems to be leaning towards this being an enormous L from Ubisoft.</p>



<p>Have you tried playing Rainbow Six Siege since this change was deployed?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-learns-the-right-lessons-from-superstars<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When you walk into a party, it doesn’t take long to figure out if you’re going to stick around for a while or call it an early night. Who’s on the guest list? How’s the venue? What are the activities? The same can be said about booting up a new Mario Party for the first time, and after spending roughly an hour with Super Mario Party Jamboree, I’m confident saying I’ll probably hang out until the house lights come on at last call.</p><p>It feels good to say that, because Mario Party’s quality has been all over the board since franchise developer Nintendo Cube (recently rebranded from NDcube) took over party planning duties over a decade ago. They threw all four players together in a car for some reason, had us face off against a giant Bowser who used the Wii U GamePad, and developed a few middling 3DS entries that tried – but ultimately failed – to refresh the Mario Party formula.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Super Mario Party Jamboree Screenshots - Nintendo Direct June 2024</h3></div></output><p>But things started to turn around with 2018’s Super Mario Party, which took us out of the car and put us back on the board in a game that was definitely a step in the right direction. Nintendo Cube followed that up with 2021’s Mario Party Superstars, a brilliant prance through past parties that reminded us of the series’ glory days back on Nintendo 64 and GameCube.</p><p>Now, this entry looks to combine all the learnings from both Super and Superstars into one new ultimate party package, and based on my time with it so far, Super Mario Party Jamboree has the potential to be the best <em>original</em> Mario Party game in over 15 years.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Super Mario Party Jamboree has the potential to be the best <em>original</em> Mario Party game in over 15 years.</p></div><p>First off, the guest list is on point. Jamboree features 22 playable characters (that we know of so far), already the largest roster the series has ever seen. The classics are all here – for years the Mario Party series toyed with characters like Donkey Kong, Toad, and Toadette, relegating them to hosting duties or minigame side modes, but they’re all back on the roster. Newcomers Pauline and Ninji are welcome additions, and I was personally thrilled to see my beloved Boo make a comeback, and I didn’t hesitate to pick him for my first jamboree.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Our party planners also picked a great venue. There are seven boards in Jamboree, and I got to take a few turns on Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, a beautiful forest-themed map with a giant Wiggler in the center that rotated positions if someone landed on a specific space, unlocking alternate paths and faster routes to the Star. This mechanic led to that perfect mixture of Mario Party luck and strategy where you can try to outline out your next few turns to make sure you get to the Star first, but something is bound to come up that will throw a banana peel in those plans.</p><p>I had a blast playing classic Mario Party rules on a brand new board for the first time since Mario Party 8 and Mario Party DS in 2007. Stars cost 20 coins as they should, and there were no character-specific dice blocks that made things feel unnecessarily unbalanced in Super Mario Party. The board was also big, which is a relief after Super Mario Party’s tiny locations that were so small you could barely justify a 10-turn game on them. But in Jamboree, it’s looking like you’ll be able to get a lot of mileage out of the boards, and I was told you can party for up to 30 turns if you want.</p><p>On my first turn, I swung by the item shop to buy something from Koopa Troopa. While browsing the wares, I noticed a few new items, like a Shop Hop Box that warps you right to a random shop, which could get interesting if the shops stock powerful items like Golden Pipes in the latter half of each game. And, board-specific items have made a comeback, with a Wiggler Bell that gives you the power to change the position of the Mega Wiggler sleeping in the middle of the map. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Thanks to some lucky high rolls and a strategic item purchase of some Double Dice, I snagged the first Star of the game on Turn 2. This is definitely a nitpick, but I was disappointed to see that no one was there to sell me the star as in previous Mario Party games, and instead it felt like I completed my transaction at self checkout, but that’s probably only going to bother the most diehard of Mario Party fans. </p><p>Speaking of things you’ll only notice if you’ve played hundreds of Mario Party games, the UI has seen a major revamp when characters are exploring the board. Instead of the standings occupying the screen’s four corners, your coins, Stars, and item inventory are all lined up on the bottom screen in such a way where you can see who is up next and how long until the next minigame. Stickers make a return from Superstars, and this UI change benefits that as well, because players can still taunt each other endlessly without rudely blocking important options, like when a player is trying to buy a Star. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don’t know why the Mario Party series has built a reputation for having amazing-looking steak, but I’m happy it’s back.</p></div><p>No Mario Party is complete without a great collection of minigames, and I was impressed with virtually every competition I played. Prime Cut was a great two-vs-two minigame where I had to work with my partner to cut a steak perfectly in half. I don’t know why the Mario Party series has built a reputation for having amazing-looking steak, but I’m happy it’s back.</p><p>The best new minigame I saw, though, was Sandwiched, which was reminiscent of Mario Party 4’s Booksquirm, where we were standing in a picnic basket and had to avoid getting crushed by a downpour of endless finger sandwiches until only one of us was left. I narrowly got second place, and it left me wanting to get right back in for another round.</p><p>Meanwhile, Granite Getaway returns from Mario Party 6, where I frantically ran (or in Boo’s case, floated?) away from a giant boulder, Indiana Jones-style. Much like the set of seven boards in Jamboree, it’s fun to see the series combine old and new with the minigame selection. Because even though new minigames always have the chance to be great, let’s face it, you just can’t beat the classics.</p><p>We didn’t get to finish our game of Mario Party before moving on, but I did squeeze in a couple more classic moments, like passing another Boo who stole coins from an opponent for me, or unfortunately landing on a space that moved the Wiggler, allowing Goomba to scamper by and steal the next Star from right under my nose. </p><p>Next, I said goodbye to Boo and hello to Goomba as I transitioned to see Jamboree’s new 20-player online multiplayer modes. Nintendo is leaning hard into Jamboree’s online offerings, proven by the fact that it’s bundling Jamboree with a three-month individual membership for Nintendo Switch Online.</p><p>The first mode I tried was Koopathlon, where you race 19 other players to be the first to complete five laps around a long track. I was only playing against three other people and 16 NPCs, but when Jamboree goes online at launch it’s designed to be played with 19 other real people. You progress along the track by collecting coins in various single-player minigames that everyone competes in simultaneously. This included tasks like collecting as many coins as possible while running up a sandy hill, a bread-baking challenge where I had to watch seven different pastries cook and remove them from the oven before they burned, and a whack-a-mole contest where I had to hit the Monty Moles and pass over the Bob-ombs. I had a great time with all of these, as the right side of the screen showed an up-to-date map of the race track, so I could see how I was faring against my human competitors on the overall leaderboard. </p><p>After three rounds of minigames, we were faced with a Bowser minigame where we had to survive as long as we could or risk losing serious progress on the track. Seeing my Goomba run for dear life while Bowser chased us down across a collapsing bridge surrounded by lava was memorable, intense, and very reminiscent of the GameCube days of Mario Party, where losing a Bowser minigame could throw you completely off the rails. The Koopathlon was fun, but to be honest I don’t see myself ever picking it over either the classic Mario Party experience or the myriad of other online battle royales that are out there.</p><p>Finally, Kaboom Squad is Jamboree’s cooperative mode, and it was the last thing I got to try out. Twenty players had to work together to load bombs into a cannon to take down a giant Bowser that was stomping around doing his best Godzilla impression. After the clock runs out each round, we would play a cooperative minigame to earn power-ups for the next bout against the King of the Koopas. The power-ups allowed us to carry more bombs or drop boost pads on the map to get to and from the cannon faster. The cooperative minigames were fine, like a tower defense game where we had to defend a gate from Bob-ombs swarming us from all directions, but I don’t play Mario Party to work together, I play it to ruin friendships like everyone else. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don’t play Mario Party to work together, I play it to ruin friendships like everyone else. </p></div><p>It took us about 15 minutes to take Bowser down, and it just felt a little too long. With how many other choices there are at the Super Mario Party Jamboree buffet, I’m not sure how often I’ll go back for seconds in this mode. Finally defeating Bowser was satisfying enough, but certainly didn’t provide the same rush as outlasting my opponents in a minigame or being the first to buy a Star on the board.</p><p>Apart from the 20-player modes that didn’t leave a huge impression, Super Mario Party Jamboree is shaping up to be an excellent return to form for the series. After Superstars successfully returned to the franchise’s greatest hits, I’ve been hopeful that the next new entry would be a worthy followup to the classics. And so far, the time I spent rolling dice, buying Stars, and betraying friends on Jamboree’s opening board has me convinced that it has a strong understanding of what longtime Mario Party fans want. While I’ve only seen a handful of Jamboree’s enormous lineup of 110+ minigames, I was genuinely impressed with the ones I played, and I’m thrilled some of the classic minigames are coming back to accompany the new ones. We’ll have to wait and see if the rest of the boards can stay away from some of the unwelcome gimmicks that have plagued the series in recent years, but for now I’m optimistic that Jamboree is the party I’ve been waiting for an invitation to.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Astro Bot will receive free DLC later this year that focuses on speedruns. More VIP bot cameos will also be added for players to rescue.</p><p>"You know it’s not going to be like, you know, a huge, huge amount, but it will be focusing on one of the features that people enjoyed in Astro's Playroom. That was the speedruns," said game director Nicholas Doucet in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQIqH3c3Agw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with Quest Daily</a>. "You know, there were some speedruns, and the levels were quite short, but it was the fact that you could replay and keep shaving time off with some new VIP bots to rescue, so some characters we didn’t include yet will appear."</p><p>He also confirmed that the speedrun content will also include leaderboards. Additionally, the team is creating more challenging levels as well as considering content that feels more "toy-like" and can be experienced by players at any skill level.</p><p>There has been speculation about what other cameos could make it into Astro Bot in the future. The game's credits <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/astro-bot-credits-point-to-potential-dlc-cameo-bots/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thanked third-party developers</a> who let their characters appear, including ones that aren't currently seen. This includes Ubisoft, which Astro Bot thanks three times for Assassin's Creed, Beyond Good &amp; Evil, and Rayman. Croc and Worms, Stellar Blade, and Rise of the Ronin were also mentioned in the credits. None of these games' characters appear in the base game, so it's possible that Team Asobi is saving them for the DLC.</p><p>Astro Bot was released on September 6 for PS5. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/" data-ref-id="1900-6418277">Astro Bot review</a>, we said, "This is a grand re-opening for Astro Bot, and it surely marks the start of what is destined to be a beloved series shooting for the moon."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remakes-first-90-minutes-are-online-a-month-before-its-official-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Can't wait until 8th October to revisit Silent Hill? Here's a free visit to everyone's special place courtesy of a Japanese content creator who has streamed the first 90 minutes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> to YouTube.</p>
<p>The hugely popular 兄者弟者 (Siblings) YouTube channel has seemingly shared the footage by official sanction from Konami, which suggests this shouldn't get struck or pulled down by a pesky copyright notice. Which is just as well, as the video's only been out a few days, and it's already clocked up over half a million views.</p>
<p>Consider this your warning to read no further and be aware of video clips online if you're looking to avoid spoilers altogether ahead of release.</p>

<p>Not only do we get a peek at the opening section - more on that in a bit - but we also get to see the menu and inventory screens as well as hear Akira Yamaoka's reimagining of the seminal horror game's signature themes.</p>
<p>It's unclear if the YouTube team has possession of the full game or merely a vertical slice, but for fans desperate for a sneaky peek ahead of release, the footage is entirely uncut and gives away all the secrets revealed in the first 90 minutes, including our introduction to James, Angela, an enemy or two in combat, and a handful of in-town locations.</p>
<p>Although both the text and voices are in Japanese, it's nonetheless packed with spoilers, so it's probably best avoided if you'd prefer not to spoil the surprise(s).</p>
<p>There's also a very cute nod to the original game right at the beginning - James' dusty footprints move across the screen before you're prompted to "press any button to play".</p>
<p>ICYMI, Silent Hill 2 Remake will feature the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2001-survival-horror-silent-hill-remake-has-1990s-filter">option to remove all UI elements and add on a "90s filter"</a>.</p>
<p>Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> confirmed the news in a recent X/Twitter post, revealing that the 90s filter includes grain effect, colour correction, and screen adjustments for that "old-school experience"... even though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> released in 2001.</p>
<p>Bloober Team creative director and lead designer for Silent Hill 2 Remake, Mateusz Lenart, recently confirmed the psychological horror game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-will-take-more-than-20-hours-for-silent-hill-2-remake-completionists-to-find-everything-hidden-for-you">will take 16-18 hours to complete on average</a>, but teased that it will take "more than 20 hours" for players to find "everything that [the team] put into the game and things we've hidden for you".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Embracer-owned studio Lost Boys Interactive is facing another round of layoffs.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lost-boys-interactive_friday-september-6th-lost-boys-interactive-activity-7237875363832324096-h6ci/">LinkedIn</a>, the studio said it had "made the very difficult decision to reduce our overall headcount in accordance with local laws and consultation processes".  It noted Lost Boys needed to "adapt to shifting market conditions" within the video game industry, which has seen multiple layoffs and studio closures in recent years.</p>
<p>Lost Boys said it is "committed to supporting our affected staff in finding new positions as quickly as possible". Additionally, Lost Boys will "collaborate with other studios and recruiters to help connect them with job opportunities" (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/embracer-studio-lost-boys-interactive-has-made-another-round-of-layoffs/">VGC</a>).</p>

<p>"Today is a challenging day for Lost Boys Interactive as we face the difficult decision to reduce our workforce," says Shaun Nivens, CEO of Lost Boys Interactive.</p>
<p>"We recognize the impact of this decision on our team members, who have contributed greatly to our success. Decisions involving staff reductions are never made lightly, and this action was taken only after considering all other options. We are committed to supporting them in every way we can during this transition."</p>
<p>The studio was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-developer-gearbox-continues-to-grow-following-lost-boys-acquisition">acquired by Gearbox in 2022</a>, which at the time was a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-studio-gearbox-bought-by-thq-nordic-parent-company">subsidiary of Swedish conglomerate Embracer</a>. Prior to its acquisition by Gearbox, Lost Boys contributed to the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> (pictured above), Visual Concepts' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wwe-2k22">WWE 2K22</a> and PUBG.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-owned-studio-lost-boys-interactive-hit-by-sizable-layoffs">January of this year</a>, Lost Boys confirmed it had made a number of reductions in its staff. Then, in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-acquires-borderlands-studio-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460m">Embracer entered an agreement to sell Gearbox Interactive to Take-Two</a>. However, Embracer retained Lost Boys following this deal.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>During the weekend, rumors started circulating online that Grand Theft Auto VI would be delayed to 2026, but it seems like they were not true, as confirmed today by an extremely reliable source.</p>
<p>Bloomberg's <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Schreier</a> provided on X some additional information on the potential delay for Rockstar Games' highly anticipated open-world title, saying that six different Rockstar employees told him they haven't heard anything about a delay. However, it is too early to celebrate, as Grand Theft Auto VI is a big and ambitious game that could very well slip into 2026.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The internet (and my DMs) blew up this weekend over a rumor that GTA VI is delayed. Good news is that six Rockstar employees all told me they have not heard of any delay. Bad news: it's a big, ambitious game and could very well slip! Too much time left to say anything definitive</p>
<p>— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1833152426989191400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Back in May, Take-Two Interactive confirmed Grand Theft Auto VI would be released sometime during Fall 2025, but, just from the only trailer released so far and the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-document/"> information</a> that was gleaned from leaks and other sources, it's clear how the game is a very ambitious title that may require more development time than anticipated. No matter when it releases, however, the game is expected to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, so it wouldn't be surprising for Rockstar Games to take more time to make sure the sixth entry in one of the most popular gaming series ever still active today will meet fans expectations to the fullest.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is now in development for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>Pearl Abyss, the developers of the long-running MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-desert-online-announces-mass-pvp-event-war-of-the-roses/">Black Desert Online</a>, have started building up the hype for the upcoming expansion to the game Land of the Morning Light: Seoul. The expansion will be released on September 12 on PC via their client and Steam.</p>
<p>These videos will dive into the details of the expansion, such as the upcoming boss fights, the characters you will encounter, and the mythology of the expansion. In total, twelve videos will be released throughout the week, with some being before the official launch and some of them after. Currently, a video showcases some of the characters players can expect to see in Black Desert Online's new expansion.&nbsp; It's only 50 seconds long but introduces players to some beneficial characters they'll encounter.</p>
<p><iframe title="Meet the Cast of Seoul | New Region Update | Black Desert" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5XCaC3yUDdY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The following videos will be released throughout the release week. They will showcase raids, boss fights, and essential locations that players can explore in Seoul.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sovereign Weapon Preview: September 9</li>
<li>GM'S Gyeongbokgung Palace Tour: September 10</li>
<li>Land of the Morning Light: Seoul Official Boss Combat Trailer: September 12</li>
<li>Hwanghae &amp; Donghae Province Preview: September 14</li>
<li>Boss Battle Trailer - Party Raid: September 15</li>
<li>Sovereign Weapon Deep Dive: September 16</li>
<li>Gyeongbokgung Palace in Black Desert: September 17</li>
<li>Black Desert x Korean National Gugak Center (Donghae Province BGM): September 18</li>
<li>Black Desert x Korean National Gugak Center (City of Virtue BGM): September 18</li>
</ul>
<p>Although they all have their allocated dates, it has been noted that the video release schedule may be subject to change.</p>
<p>Land of the Morning Light: Seoul is a sequel to Land of the Morning Light Part 1. The new expansion offers new storylines and adventures for players to explore while experiencing the stunning backdrop of medieval Seoul, Korea.</p>
<p>On the official Black Desert Online website, you can find a banner that showcases the September 2024 roadmap. Currently, a Berserk collaboration with the game allows players to get the same armor as iconic characters from the manga and anime.</p>
<p>In addition to Land of the Morning Light - Seoul being released on September 12, players will also experience the addition of Sovereign Weapons, which releases on the same day. Past that, the Dosa Awakening will also be added to the game, marked as "Coming Soon."</p>
<p>The website also has a <a href="https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/News/Detail?groupContentNo=7477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> explaining what steps players need to take to prepare for the new Black Desert Online expansion, such as accepting and completing the preliminary quests that will take them to Seoul when the expansion releases.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-level-editor-new-mod<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>mod has been released that grants access to the game's level editor and save editor functions, among other things, via the new modding toolkit provided as part of Patch 7.</p>
<p>The seventh major patch for Larian's critically-acclaimed RPG was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-patch-notes">released last week</a>, and one of its major new features is a modding toolkit that lets you create your own spells, classes, and cosmetics, among other things.</p>
<p>Now, however, modder Siegfre has created a mod by the name of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12021?tab=description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"BG3 Toolkit Unlocked"</a>, which, in Siegfre's own words, "unlocks all the disabled features and enables write permissions" for Larian's official&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-september">modding toolkit</a>.</p>

It's probably a good idea not to tinker with this stuff unless you're sure you know what you're doing, though.</p>
<p>All you'll need to install BG3 Toolkit Unlocked is a full install of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, as well as "a working installation" of the game's mod toolkit. From there, here's a set of instructions to install and run the mod, courtesy of Siegfre themselves.</p>
<ul><li>Backup your "EditorFramework.dll" in "SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Baldurs Gate 3 Toolkit".</li>
<li>Download "EditorFramework.dll".</li>
<li>Move the new "EditorFramework.dll" in to "SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Baldurs Gate 3 Toolkit".</li>
<li>Start the toolkit.</li>
<li>If successful you should see (Dev) at the top of the toolkit window.</li>
</ul><p>The mod folder also contains detailed instructions on how to make changes, including "the exact code changes" you'll need, so you shouldn't struggle too much with using BG3 Toolkit Unlocked.</p>

Well, now you can.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>likely needs no introduction, but just in case, it's a fantasy RPG that serves as the third mainline entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate&nbsp;</em>series.</p>
<p>Developed by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/divinity-original-sin-ii">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>&nbsp;</em>studio Larian, this third game takes place over a hundred years after the events of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 2&nbsp;</em>and follows a group of people attempting to rid themselves of a mind flayer parasite infection.</p>

<p>Fallout is officially an Emmy Award-winning series after securing the award for Outstanding Music Supervision. Out of 16 nominations, including Outstanding Picture Editing and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, Fallout secured just one, which some feel isn’t representative of how perfectly pieced together the Amazon series is.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-didn-t-set-the-world-on-fire">It Didn’t Set The World on Fire</h2>



<p>Since airing in April 2024, the Fallout TV series has been branded one of the best live-action adaptations ever made, rivalling the likes of The Last of Us. It might seem bizarre that the series only won a single Emmy Award, given how overwhelmingly popular it was and how much of an impact it had on the game series.</p>



<p>The team at Kilter Films and Amazon MGM Studios <a href="https://www.emmys.com/shows/fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picked up an award</a> for ‘outstanding’ music, with the prize focusing specifically on The End, the opening episode of the post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<p>As one of the best opening episodes of a show in years, ‘The End’ perfectly portrayed the nuclear annihilation that wiped out much of the planet’s population. It showed some of the instant degradation of society in the wake of a world blitzed by atomic power, and it perfectly highlighted some of the black humour and violence present in the Fallout franchise.</p>



<p>And of course, it offered a masterclass in the type of music that fans of the series have come to know and love over the last 25 years.</p>

            <p>Sony has quietly increased the price of a DualSense controller for its PlayStation 5 console.</p>
<p>As spotted by social media account Wario64, the price of various DualSense colour models has increased by $5 in multiple US retailers, but more importantly on Sony's official store PlayStation Direct.</p>
<p>The basic white DualSense controller has increased from $69.99 to $74.99. Over on the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/buy-accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller">UK PlayStation Direct site</a>, the same controller costs £64.99 - up from £59.99 previously.</p>

<p>Other colours are pricier. The Volcanic Red model, for instance, is now £69.99 from £64.99; Sterling Silver is priced the same. The black, pink, and blue models are the same price as the white model.</p>
<p>It's unclear why this price increase has taken effect, though it's not something Sony will officially announce. Could it perhaps be in advance of the rumoured PS5 Pro? Or has the price of manufacture increased?</p>

<p>The change comes shortly after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-gets-another-price-rise-in-japan-meaning-it-now-costs-170-more-than-at-launch">PS5 received a price hike in Japan</a>, which now costs around £170 more than it did at launch. The DualSense controller and PlayStation VR2 are also more expensive in Japan.</p>
<p>Sony is soon set to celebrate the 30th anniversary of PlayStation, yet its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-playstation-5-pro-design-seemingly-confirmed-by-sonys-official-30th-anniversary-art">marketing artwork appears to include a PS5 Pro ahead of its announcement</a>, as per leaked images of the console.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oxenfree-to-be-removed-from-digital-storefront-next-month.975768/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-removed-itch-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Night School Studio has announced that its horror-inflected narrative adventure&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>will be delisted from a major digital storefront next month, and we're not entirely sure why it's happening.</p>
<p>In an email, Night School says that&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>will no longer be available to download on Itch.io starting from October 1st. This isn't one of those delistings where you can still download the game if you've bought it, either; on October 1st,&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>is gone for good from Itch.io.</p>
<p>Naturally, if you've already downloaded the game files from Itch.io prior to that point, you will still be able to play the game; Itch.io isn't going to hack into your storage drive and delete the game, so don't worry on that front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oxenfree-delisted-itch.io-boat.jpg?itok=ficruoH0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oxenfree-delisted-itch.io-boat.jpg?itok=meUjgbpS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>won't be available on Itch.io come October.</figcaption></figure><p>Night School says it "deeply appreciates" the support from everyone who's played&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>over the years, and that it hopes to "see you on another service or timeline soon".</p>
<p>Presumably, that means&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>isn't about to be delisted from other platforms on which it's currently available, like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/388880/Oxenfree/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/oxenfree" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, not to mention console storefronts like the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0962-CUSA04950_00-OXENBASEENUS0000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a> or the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/oxenfree-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that if&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>was about to get delisted elsewhere, Night School would have been a bit more forthcoming about that, but it might just have slipped the studio's mind. You never know!</p>
<p>In any case, we've reached out to Night School for clarification on this issue and will report back as soon as we hear anything.</p>

<p>Light on gameplay and heavy on story,&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>is all about making branching narrative decisions, uncovering the relationships between its characters, and generally vibing with the atmosphere.</p>
<p><em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>is currently available on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, and it's also playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S via backwards compatibility. The sequel,&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree 2</em>, is also available on PC, PlayStation, and Switch, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/oxenfree-ii-lost-signals-review">read our review of it here</a>.</p>

        <ul><li>Each time you dive into the depths, you choose a second hero to accompany you. As a companion, each hero brings eight unique powers. With dozens of possible duos you can develop your own playstyle or try improbable duos. Do you need an expert against boss fights or a proto-blacksmith that enhances your card upgrades?</li><li>Position on the battlefield has never been more important! Line up enemies for super attacks, move to a different zone to avoid being hit, or position enemies to knock into each other.</li><li>Cards don’t just get better. Each card upgrade comes with a difficult strategic choice between two upgrades. Choose wisely, depending on your deck and playstyle. A powerful bonus but only for the round?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-developer-mode-already-unlocked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s latest and much-anticipated seventh patch is here, and we're already making the most of it. As announced by Larian Studios' Swen Vincke, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modding-is-pretty-big-says-baldurs-gate-3-director-as-over-1m-mods-are-installed-in-less-than-24-hours">"modding is pretty big - we had more than a million mods installed in less than 24 hours</a>".</p>
<p>Fans have taken it even further, though, with one uploading a mod that "unlocks all the disabled features and enables writer permissions for the Baldur's Gate 3 toolkit", which includes level editing, save editing, "and more".</p>

<p>The BG3 Toolkit Unlocked mod - now available over at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12021?tab=stats">NexusMods</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/it-only-took-two-days-for-someone-to-unlock-a-developer-mode-in-baldur-s-gate-3-s-mod-toolset-opening-up-the-possibility-of-custom-levels-and-campaigns/">PC Gamer</a>) - is especially exciting because it essentially gives Baldur's Gate 3's own community the ability to develop and add whole new areas, quests, and campaigns.</p>
<p>It also gives fans the power to poke around behind the scenes and potentially restore lost or cut content.</p>
<p>This should be particularly exciting for some given mods are big business right now, with the volunteer-made and free-to-play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> becoming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-is-now-the-fastest-redeemed-game-of-all-time-on-gog">"fastest-redeemed" game of all time on GOG</a>. The fan-made mod - which is being distributed for free via GOG's platform, hence why the digital games distributor can't use terms like "fastest-selling" - was redeemed more than 500,000 times in its first 24 hours.</p>

<p>According to Tears of the Kingdom's producer Eiji Aonuma, the team was once thinking about calling the game Tears of the Dragon. However, there was concern this would put too much emphasis on some key plot points within the game.</p>
<p>"Letting it slip that the Light Dragon is Zelda would have been a problem, and this had an effect on the title too. One of the candidates for the title that made it to end was 'Tears of the Dragon'," Aonuma explained in Tears of the Kingdom's newly-released art book (as translated by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-almost-called-tears-of-the-dragon/">Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>"But it would be a bad idea to have the keyword 'Dragon' in the title, and we wanted to have dragon patterns in the logo, but decided otherwise. It'd emphasise the Light Dragon, after all (laughs). But nothing else good was coming to mind, and we were running out of development time..."</p>
<p>Aonuma said the team "went through many words" before landing on Kingdom. "With 'Tears of the Kingdom', it felt like the phrase could connect to the Light Dragon to us, and we could use dragons in the logo," the Zelda producer said, adding: "With the title decided, the logo finally became what it is now."</p>
<p>That logo, which you can see below, shows two dragons in an almost Ouroboros formation. And as those who have played and finished Tears of the Kingdom know, towards the end of the game both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-destroy-ganondorf-how-beat-demon-king-9343#section-5">Zelda and Ganon make their way above Hyrule in dragon form</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/reynatis-preview-shibuya-showdown</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reynatis-preview-shibuya-showdown.975738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/reynatis-preview-shibuya-showdown<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Reynatis</em> is an action RPG set in Japan, mostly around Shibuya, which is faithfully recreated to stunning detail. Even knowing this, I did a double-take when I found out Burger King was in this game.</p>
<p>Burger King being in <em>Reynatis</em> is completely inconsequential to the plot or gameplay, but I can't get over cool that is. The main thing here is, there's a lot of Shibuya to see in <em>Reynatis</em>, and that's what impressed me most with an otherwise adequate action title.</p>
<p>Developed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/furyu-corporation">Furyu Corporation</a> and published by <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nis-america/news">NIS America</a>, <em>Reynatis </em>is coming out later this month, and we had a chance to play it at PAX West 2024. While the aesthetic of Shibuya and <em>Reynatis</em>' characters are appealing to look at, gameplay didn't quite hit the mark.</p>

<h2>Wizards, Shibuya, Oh My! Reynatis' World is Intriguing</h2>
<p>In a world where magic is controlled by an oppressive government, being a wizard is dangerous, especially if you're not a part of the regime. Sorcery and modern times collide in <em>Reynatis</em>, not unlike, say, <em>Jujutsu Kaisen.</em></p>
<p>Something about magic colliding with a high tech, bustling city is super fun as a concept, and <em>Reynatis</em> nails that. Developer Furyu Corporation worked with hundreds of real-life shops in Shibuya in order to create the most authentic feeling city possible.</p>

<p>This creates an immersive environment through which the story takes place. How the city plays a role in <em>Reynatis</em> is still up in the air, but to put so much effort into creating iconic buildings like Shibuya 109 and, well, Burger King, I'm sure players such as myself will greatly appreciate that attention to detail.</p>
<p>And while graphically, it's not the most advanced game I've seen, it has a very appealing aesthetic that balances realistic with anime. It's a lot like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astral-chain-review-awesome-anime-action">Astral Chain</a>,</em> a game with stunning colors and oozing with style, but is limited by the Switch's hardware.</p>

<h2><em>Reynatis</em>' Combat Conundrum</h2>
<p>And like <em>Astral Chain</em>, this is a flashy, game with tons of action thrown into the mix. As a user of Wizarts, you can shift into Liberated mode -- this outfits you with magical weapons and some wicked new attire. Combat takes place in these rifts found across Shibuya -- which seem like some sort of alternate dimension -- and also in the streets themselves.</p>
<p>Rifts comprise linear fights against monsters, and battles are fren, though pretty derivative, amounting to mostly button mashing with a few special abilities thrown into the mix. <em>Reynatis</em> is fun in Liberated mode, if anything because you feel like a powerful badass. It's when you expend all that magical energy, things slow down a bit</p>
<p>Using up your magic in Liberated mode shifts players back into their normal, everyday clothes -- this is called Suppressed mode. You can't attack while Suppressed and have to dodge attacks with a certain precision to restore energy.</p>

<p>Suppressed mode in <em>Reynatis</em> feels a bit like whiplash -- you have this super fast, flashy combat that suddenly shifts into something much slower. Having this handicap hindered my enjoyment overall, and since it's such a pivotal part of the gameplay, I'm not sure if much will change.</p>
<p>There <em>will</em> be multiple party members with various abilities in <em>Reynatis</em>, so I'm hoping things feel a bit better once players get a full party. The demo didn't give a super clear look at how this works, but I was able to play characters with various weapons, from guns to swords.</p>
<p>I'm a bit lukewarm on <em>Reynatis</em>. Sure, the world is beautiful, but the combat didn't satisfy me as much as I'd hoped.

Monica Harrington isn't one of Valve's official co-founders, but she was heavily involved in its formation and initial success - working by day as a marketing manager at Microsoft with responsibility for the games division, while helping her partner, Mike Harrington, and Gabe Newell get the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> studio off the ground. In a lengthy post on <a href="https://medium.com/@monicah428/the-early-days-of-valve-from-a-woman-inside-bf80c6b47961">Medium</a> - which Nic has already covered in the most recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-734">Sunday Papers</a>, but which I think deserves a piece of its own - Harrington takes us through those heady early days. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Amongst many other things, Harrington discusses how she and her husband poured their own money into Valve, and how she walked the complicated line of drawing upon her Microsoft experience to shape Valve's approach with Half-Life, without developing an actual conflict of interest. When the line became impossible to walk, she resigned from Microsoft, becoming chief marketing officer at Valve from 1996 to 2000.</p>
<p>There are intriguing memories aplenty - how Valve and Sierra fell out over the marketing of Half-Life after release, and how concerns about CD burners led to the implementation of an authentication scheme which accidentally gave Valve a direct line to their first players. Harrington also treats us to a marketing-eye picture of the industry during the 1990s and the balance of clout between developers, publishers, press, pirates and players, drawing comparisons with music and film.
</p>
<p>
There are insights upon the development of Half-Life - how it looked after its first triumphant E3 showing versus how it was shaping up internally - and to a lesser extent, Team Fortress. But I think the most interesting part is Harrington's account of a pitch she made, shortly after Half-Life's release, to set up a digital games store and community platform in partnership with... Amazon. Had that gone all the way, industry history might have been very different. Here's the excerpt in full:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
In a nine-page document, I proposed that Valve and Amazon team up to create a new online entertainment platform. I scaled the business opportunity within four years at $500 million dollars. The gist of the idea was to create a made-for-the-medium platform that would bring users together in a sticky, compelling entertainment experience, with digital and offline content sales. I wanted Amazon's financial backing as a way to gain first mover advantage against Microsoft and Electronic Arts, then the major PC games players. I didn't see a role for Sierra. If pushed, we wouldn't create any new games ourselves, and instead would team with outside developers so that they could distribute content not subject to an 85% publishing fee. At the time, I considered it an act of rebellion against the traditional publishing dynamic where independent developers took on huge risk, and the big publishing houses reaped the rewards. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
According to Harrington, Amazon offered to buy a minority stake in Valve a few weeks later. You can obviously see the bones of Steam in that proposal, though Harrington appears to have conceived of it mostly to get a valuation for Valve, to help her and her partner when they eventually sold their share of the business to Newell.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, Harrington's motivation for writing the post is partly that she has been left out of Valve's history - including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-of-half-lifes-textures-were-created-by-a-single-person-new-making-of-documentary-explains">Valve's own 2023 Half-Life making-of documentary</a> - despite being so heavily involved with the company during its first few years. Harrington attributes this partly to her consciously stepping back to avoid interfering in her husband's partnership with Gabe Newell, and partly to "bro culture" and sexist practices in the tech biz at large. Here's that part in full:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
As I look back on the huge success Valve has become, I'm proud of what the team accomplished. I'm also proud of the work I did while recognizing that my biggest contributions to Valve's business went largely unnoticed and unrecognized within the industry. Part of that was due to the bro culture of the software business, part of it was that I receded to support my husband in a partnership where he was effectively the lesser partner, and part of it was that women, especially in tech, often seem to disappear when the story gets told.
</p>
<p>
I was hugely disappointed when Valve released a video in 2023 about the creation of Half-Life where one of the people interviewed, Karen Laur, a wonderfully talented texture artist, talked about the isolating experience of being a woman at Valve and essentially said that the only other woman during her tenure there was an office manager. I understood why she felt as she did, but the senior Valve team knows better. Watching the video, I felt like my place in Valve's history had been completely erased.
</p>
<p>
I know that Valve wouldn't have been successful without Mike. It wouldn't have been successful without Gabe. And it wouldn't have been successful without me. A friend of mine who knows the full story once said to me, "you were a founding partner" and in hindsight, I agree. From the beginning, I invested time, treasure and industry expertise to make the company a huge success.
</p>
<p>
And it is.
</p></blockquote>

Harrington has done a variety of things since leaving Valve in 2000, from getting into whale conservation to a job at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. She and Mike Harrington broke up and divorced in 2016. <a href="https://medium.com/@monicah428/the-early-days-of-valve-from-a-woman-inside-bf80c6b47961">The full post is worth a read.</a> As it happens, I've recently been trawling back through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-secret-history-of-rps">the ancient annals of Rock Paper Shotgun</a> and learning about the site's formative early interactions with Valve, while thinking about RPS's future under Ian Games of the Ian Games Network. It's useful to get some perspective on one of today's weather-makers from the other side of the aisle.
