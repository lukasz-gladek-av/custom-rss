			<p>There is only one thing truly certain about life, and that is death. One day we will pass on from this world, and we cannot know the day it will come for us. Accompanying death is grief – grief from the ones who love us and care about us. Grief does shatter you, remoulding you, and changing you. Sometimes that change is small and other times it is so significant, those around you do not recognise the person you have become. Afterlove EP is a game that explores grief following the death of a loved one, and how it can grip you.</p>
<p><iframe title="Afterlove EP - Date Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/76BGWySi0C0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Afterlove EP has two central characters, though only one interacts with the wider world. Rama is a singer, songwriter, and guitarist for the band Sigmund Feud. He is also the character experiencing grief after the unexpected death of his girlfriend, Cinta. Cinta is not completely gone, however, and is the other central character. Her voice and memory is lodged inside Rama’s head, making comments and holding conversations with Rama. Rama can’t let Cinta’s voice go, having a knock on effect on his relationships with his friends. Sometimes Rama will have a conversation with Cinta, speaking his responses out loud which leads to confusion with his friends, adding to the strain as they struggle to follow what Rama is talking about.</p>


<p>The game is structured around choosing how Rama spends his day. There is an overarching time limit as Sigmund Feud has a gig at the end of the month, which could make or break them. The events of the game take place a year after Cinta’s death, and it is only now Rama is reaching out to his friends and bandmates, who have continued to live their own lives while Rama stayed in place. During the day, Rama can meet with people, do some busking, attend therapy, go to band practice. and wander around. To be honest, aside from finding photo locations to trigger memories, there isn’t much to do in this version of Jakarta when wandering about.</p>


<p>The band practice and therapy happen on specific days. You will get reminders for band practice, but for therapy you need to check the map and see if your therapist’s icon is showing up. The game is very much about people’s mental health and wellbeing, and not just Rama’s, though you will have the most insight with his. Going to therapy lets him unburden, while the therapist listens and helps him to process. Handily, I’m married to a therapist and asked to get her view on these interactions. Her verdict is that she would not have been so direct as Rama’s therapist is, but generally the representation was good but more counselling heavy.</p>
<p>Who Rama chooses to spend time also impacts the activities he takes part in. There is Regina, your friend Adit’s girlfriend, Mira who is Regina’s friend and a poet, and Satria who is works in the record store. Hanging out with Regina will focus on her life as a model, and the issues she is facing there. Mira will recommend you books and ask for help with a poetry show, while Satria jams out with friends in the park and invites you. All three are romance options too, though it seems very strange to have a friend’s girlfriend as an option as a love interest. Mira and Satria both have their own qualities, if you want to pursue those romances.</p>

<p>There has been an artistic decision in Afterlove EP to have Cinta as the only voiced character, outside moments when Rama is singing. This has the effect of making Cinta’s views much more prominent, even if she is a figment of Rama’s memories, drowning out the other characters. The voice acting is fine, though it can be a little too doting toward Rama.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, music is a major part of Afterlove EP too. There is a rhythm based game tucked in here, as well as a minigame where you choose lyrics while busking. The rhythm game is fine, though it is not always obvious which notes your inputs are corresponding to, and sometimes inputs will keep coming along the track even though the song has stopped.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Afterlove EP has bugs and I was even softlocked out of continuing when getting close to the end. First, on a lot of scenes Cinta’s lines would flash up on screen, she would start to speak, and then the line would just auto skip so quickly that her voice would cut out and you wouldn’t have time to read it. Considering how the core focus of the game is about relationships and impact of choices, this is not a great thing as you lose context.</p>
<p>Additionally, you are presented with the purpose of managing relationships, but outside of a few conversations, you are a passenger as Rama gives his own responses. More player input to explore different ways the story could go would have been welcome. The softlock came when I had to have an important conversation with Mira. This task flagged up during the morning period of the day, but I couldn’t progress because I had nothing to do that could advance time. You can only speak to Mira in the evening at the bookshop, and I could not talk to anyone else, busk or do anything to move time forward to have this conversation. I searched high and low for Mira to no avail. I had to stop the game there as my last manual save was a couple of hours back, and the autosave loaded into this task with the same result.</p>

            <p>How long do you tend to spend creating a character in a video game? The correct answer is three hours. Four hours if it's a Bethesda game, because creating a character in a Bethesda game is like rewinding the Raiders Of The Lost Ark face-melting scene while shooting at your TV with Homer Simpson's Make-Up Gun. It takes patience to extract beauty or even just plain inoffensiveness from the Creation Engine's sticky coils.</p>
<p>Hang on, why am I being mean to Bethesda? I should be directing my snide remarks at Capcom. It turns out the scalliwags want you to pay a small fee to edit your <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> character's voice, face and body structure more than once - so if you're buying today, you might want to spend a few more hours perfecting that Hunter physique at start-up.</p><!--more-->
<p>All this comes care of <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/monster-hunter-wilds-locks-character-editing-behind-microtransactions/">VGC</a>, who've spotted a Monster Hunter Wilds - Character Edit Voucher: Three-Voucher Pack <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3289620/Monster_Hunter_Wilds__Character_Edit_Voucher_ThreeVoucher_Pack/?curator_clanid=44795648">on Steam</a>, currently priced at £5.49, €6.99 or $6.99. Each voucher lets you "redo your character creation and debut a new look". The base game includes access to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3289630/Monster_Hunter_Wilds__Character_Edit_Voucher_Single_Voucher_Free_Trial_Version/?curator_clanid=4777282">one of these vouchers for free</a>. There's a similar DLC voucher pack for your Palico, a catlike helper that accompanies you through the wastes.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of nickel-and-diming I wouldn't call this abysmal, because I seldom feel the need to fundamentally redesign my character more than once. My current Monster Hunter Wilds character looks like an ailing prog rock musician, and I'm confident that's a vibe that'll carry me to the credits. Besides which, you can still give your Hunter a <em>cosmetic</em> makeover without handing over your lunch money to Capcom: the base game lets you "edit hair, eyebrow color, facial hair, makeup and clothing from the Appearance Menu in tent without using a voucher".</p>
<p>Still, it's a bit cheeky. A reminder that somewhere above the artwork you're enjoying sit a bunch of salivating men in bow ties and tophats, holding comically oversized knives and forks.</p>
<p>Capcom have form for this kind of thing. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragons-dogma-2">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> came <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/critically-acclaimed-dragons-dogma-2-hits-mostly-negative-on-steam-after-players-raze-it-for-microtransactions">garlanded</a> with 21 pieces of DLC at launch, offering optional paid access to items used for fast travel, self-revival and hiring allies. It's more thematically appropriate to Monster Hunter, perhaps, in that Monster Hunter is a game about carving things up into sellable commodities and raw materials. Wilds has been on sale for a few hours and already has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/2246340/">40 items of DLC</a> - I'd say they're flogging every part of the pig except the squeal, but there's probably a Squeal Voucher in the works.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I have been using it ever since, and love how heavy it feels and seeing those big damage numbers it puts up with each hit. But you might hate it. There are 14 weapons and it’s worth playing around with a few of them to see which actually feels best for you and your playstyle. </p><p>Each weapon is its own character in Monster Hunter Wilds, and learning all of its advantages, weaknesses, and quirks is a massive part of the game, like the difference between picking Ryu or Blanka in <em>Street Fighter</em>. I recommend against the Sword and Shield because blocking is boring. The Dual Blades, on the other hand, are lightning-quick and make fights feel like you’re shredding cabbage. Plus, they have a really cool Focus Strike animation. </p><h2 id="h203441"><a id=""></a>Make your secondary weapon a long-range one to start</h2><p>You can equip a second weapon and pull it out of your saddlebag mid-fight whenever you want. While the sky’s the limit for what kind of synergies come from this in the end game, it never hurts to make your secondary weapon long-range in case you need to shift up tactics or play more conservatively late into a fight. I like the Heavy Bowgun. It’s like shooting a rifle and has a nice burst option. </p><h2 id="h203442"><a id=""></a>Never hunt on an empty stomach</h2><p>Meals in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> don’t give you bonuses so much as necessary buffs that become the foundation for each hunt you go on. There’s a handy list that will show you what stats your current ingredients will give you, with the main ones being health and stamina recovery. The great thing about cooking in the latest entry is that you can do it wherever you want, including right next to other monsters. Buy ingredients from vendors in your camp or pick them up on your way to the next hunt. </p><figure id="" data-id="d987fa326fd570000e625a1906bf8a02" data-recommend-id="image://d987fa326fd570000e625a1906bf8a02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1900" data-height="1068" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A village gives a gift to a Palico.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h203443"><a id=""></a>Don’t worry too much about exploring until you’ve rolled credits</h2><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is one of those games that doesn’t really get started until after it’s over. “Rolling credits” will happen at the end of the main campaign, but there are still more story quests that follow after that. This is the “late game,” which includes high-rank monsters and gear. This is when the game really opens up and exploration feels more natural and rewarding. Plus, all the rewards you get for your troubles are much more worthwhile. And personally, I think <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ base campaign is best played in as much of a straight shot as possible. The pacing is pretty breakneck with one big fight after another, culminating in some neat narrative reveals and a cool “final” boss fight. </p><h2 id="h203444"><a id=""></a>Make the SOS flare automatic if you’re tired of fighting alone</h2><p>SOS flares are what let other characters join your hunt. Shooting one up can either be manual or you can change the settings in the multiplayer menu to make it automatic at the start of each new hunt. While it can be fun and challenging to fight alone, it’s also good, and often much faster, to fight with a full squad of four. And if you don’t want to play with other humans, you can keep that party solely consisting of AI-controlled NPCs from the main story. They’ll heal you and do a decent job of taking aggro from monsters. </p><h2 id="h203445"><a id=""></a>Your  Seikret is you most powerful secret weapon</h2><p>The new mounts in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> are called Seikrets. They don’t fight, but they will rapidly autopilot you through dense and confusing environments by simply pressing up on the D-pad. Normally, the end destination is whatever monster you’re hunting, but you can also select icons from the map and set them as waypoints to give the Seikret new directions. </p><p>They’re also extremely useful in fights. You can whistle for them to pick you up after getting knocked down. They’re a great way to build distance between you and a monster, or get out of the way of a big attack. Their saddlebags are also full of items to restock your supplies (left on the D-pad), including your secondary weapon (right on the D-pad). Most importantly, you can spring and then lunge off their back and press your heavy attack to hit monsters with aerial attacks, which is super fun. </p><figure id="" data-id="66916293bd220b2f52152f2b707d0f72" data-recommend-id="image://66916293bd220b2f52152f2b707d0f72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1900" data-height="1068" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two hunters ride their mounts.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h203446"><a id=""></a>Make inventory shortcuts for potions and traps</h2><p>One of the biggest pitfalls of Monster Hunter remains its cumbersome item menus. There’s nothing like getting stomped while trying to tab over from your first aid kids to your antidotes. Luckily, you can pick a handful of the most useful items, like your whetstone (gotta keep those weapons sharp!), electric traps, and potions, to equip as shortcuts in a radial menu. It’s still not the best, but a heck of a lot faster and easier than the regular inventory menu. </p><h2 id="h203447"><a id=""></a>Focus your attacks and pop wounds for maximum damage</h2><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> introduces a system called Focus that lets you hold down the left trigger to aim attacks or stab wounds to initiate Focus Strikes. These do lots of damage and are really satisfying to watch. They all break off extra monster parts for crafting that immediate get added to your inventory. To open up wounds you need to hit the same spots on a monster repeatedly. Once open, don’t waste time closing ’em up. The resulting Focus Strikes also knock the monster off balance, turning the best offense into a great defense as well. </p><h2 id="h203448"><a id=""></a>Always be climbing on those monsters’ backs</h2><p>Jumping off a higher platform or lunging from your Seikret and doing an aerial attack will occasionally pop you onto a monster’s back. Once there, you can stab to open a wound and move up and down its back to avoid being shaken off as your stamina depletes. When the screen starts to go dark you should hold the right trigger to hold on. Once you’ve got a few wounds opened up you can do a Focus Strike before getting thrown off. You’ll have to keep doing more aerial attacks to build up an invisible gauge before you can hop back on again. </p><h2 id="h203449"><a id=""></a>Don’t bother with crafting low ranking armor and weapons</h2><p>The natural loop of <em>Monster Hunter</em> is kill stuff to make stuff, and the pull of crafting new gear is strong. However, the actual stuff you can craft early on in <em>Wilds</em> is not. You can get through much of the first 15 hours of the game with just a couple sets of new armor and one or two upgrades to your main weapon. I’d recommend saving the rest of your resources for crafting high-rank gear once you’re in the late game. But definitely treat yourself once or twice over the main campaign to some cool looking armor which will then make you look extra ridiculous in all of the bespoke cutscenes.</p><figure id="" data-id="6c4be19b8cd169c6a09d0d8c8a2b5398" data-recommend-id="image://6c4be19b8cd169c6a09d0d8c8a2b5398" data-format="jpg" data-width="1900" data-height="1068" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sandworms attack a hunter.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h203450"><a id=""></a>Capturing monsters instead of killing them can save time</h2><p>You don’t actually have to kill everything in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. You can capture your quarry instead. You’ll get basically the same items for doing so and while more complex, it can actually save time. That’s because you can capture a monster and subdue long before it’s actually dead. To do that, you just have to wait until it’s damaged enough that a skull icon appears next to it, at which point you can temporarily disable it with a shock or pitfall trap and then put it to sleep with a couple of tranquilizer bombs. This can be especially useful if you’ve already died a few times and are at risk of losing the entire hunt. </p><h2 id="h203451"><a id=""></a>Learn how to pause the game</h2><p>Hitting the options button doesn’t pause <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, but that doesn’t mean the game can’t be paused. Instead, the pause button is hidden on a separate set of menus. Fortunately, you can select it and equip it to your quick action radial menu making it easy to pause without your character being left vulnerable. And don’t worry if you have to leave the game for a while. Instead of kicking you back to the main menu, you’ll simply be taken offline but your game will remain uninterrupted (which is great for suspended games and quick resume). What a novel idea!</p><h2 id="h203452"><a id=""></a>That glowing red line means the monster is about to kill you</h2><p>You might notice that when you’re health gets low a bright red glowing line appears between you and the monster that you’re hunting. That’s the game’s way of telling you that it’s next attack, if it hits, will “cart you,” i.e. sent you back to camp. When this happens you should a) get the hell out of the way, and b) heal up as fast as possible. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/whens-the-right-time-for-diablo-5-blizzards-rod-fergusson-wants-diablo-4-to-be-around-for-years-i-dont-know-if-its-eternal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo general manager Rod Fergusson opens his talk at DICE Summit 2025 by talking not about success, but about one of Diablo’s most high-profile failures: Error 37.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Error 37 was an error that appeared to players at the launch of Diablo 3, preventing them from accessing the game due to extremely high numbers of players all trying to join at once. The issue, which impacted massive amounts of players, resulted in widespread criticism of Blizzard’s handling of the launch, and <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/diablo-iii-error-37-memes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even became meme-ified</u></a>. Blizzard eventually fixed the error and Diablo 3 was ultimately (with a lot of time and work) a success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But understandably, Blizzard and Fergusson have been eager to avoid anything like that ever happening again, especially as Diablo evolves into a more complex live service endeavor than it’s ever been before, with frequent small updates, ongoing seasons, and major expansions planned at regular intervals. Diablo 4, moreso than any of its numbered predecessors, has embraced live service.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Error 37, or something like it, would be catastrophic. Especially if Blizzard wants Diablo 4 to persist beyond its major content releases: a true live service juggernaut.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Diablo, Immortal</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">At DICE Summit 2025 in Las Vegas, I spoke with series general manager Rod Fergusson following his talk entitled: “Evolving Sanctuary: Building a Resilient Live-Service Game in Diablo IV.” On stage, Fergusson covered four key components to ensuring the resilience of Diablo 4: successfully scaling the game, keeping the content flowing, not getting too attached to purity of design, and keeping players updated on what’s coming at the expense of surprising them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout his talk, Fergusson reiterated the team’s goals of keeping players around regularly, consistently, and for the long haul. His descriptions of content roadmaps and seasons-ahead planning is a stark contrast to past numbered Diablo games - while the series is certainly no stranger to expansions and updates, Diablo appears to be committing to a live service trend that’s seeing massive AAA games stick around for much longer and change more rapidly and significantly than they ever have before, rather than leaning on new, numbered releases every few years.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So I asked him what the plan was: is Diablo 4 eternal, or rather, <em>immortal</em>? Is there a marker Fergusson is looking for to know when it’s time to move on to Diablo 5, or will Diablo 4 simply be <em>the</em> Diablo forever, similar to Blizzard’s endlessly popular MMO World of Warcraft?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe not forever, Fergusson replied. But certainly for a very long time, if he has his way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want it to be around for years,” he said. “I don't know if it's eternal. I think Destiny tried and did that like, ‘This is a ten-year game,’ and then they quickly were not. We want people to see the road ahead, because we know that, to play a Diablo game, you're probably putting hundreds of hours in and we want people to know that we're respecting their time and that we're not just here and gone.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fergusson reminds me that there was over a decade between the release of Diablo 2 and 3, and another decade between Diablo 3 and 4. Granted, neither of these games had anything near the aggressive update cadence that Diablo 4 is planning. But they also didn’t have Fergusson at the helm, as he joined in 2020 after years of leading the Gears franchise. And Fergusson, for his part, believes in looking ahead…but not too far ahead.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I learned my lesson about calling the shot too early.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, Fergusson announced in that same DICE Summit talk that Diablo 4’s second expansion <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4s-next-expansion-after-vessel-of-hatred-wont-come-until-2026"><u>would not be arriving until 2026</u></a>. Despite originally planning for an expansion a year, the team’s timeline for Vessel of Hatred was extended when they moved staff working on the expansion onto necessary, immediate updates to the live game when Diablo 4 launched, and again when the first season dropped. There were 18 months between the launch of Diablo 4 and Vessel of Hatred, not 12 as planned. But when I ask Fergusson if 18 months is the new normal for expansions, he’s not willing to commit to a specific time frame. He knows better now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I learned my lesson about calling the shot too early. So I think giving, ‘Hey, you can relax for the next 11 months,’ is about as far as I want to go in this right now…We're not at a place where we want to put a stake in the ground and call it. Because we're still building it and learning from it…Our process is generally that we get internally to a place where we have the certainty to make a call, and then you get to a place where you publicly want to make that call. We're not at the public part yet.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ruining the Surprise…on Purpose</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Fergusson’s caution is warranted here, especially as his team prepares to be more transparent than ever before about their future plans. Part of that is the aforementioned content roadmap, due to be shown off in April. Another element is the Public Test Realm, or PTR, where players who opt in can play through a version of upcoming patches before it’s pushed live to the wider public. Fergusson says in his talk that the team initially struggled with the decision to use features like a PTR or content roadmaps, for fear of spoiling the surprise for players. But he’s overcome that fear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You just realize that it's better to ruin the surprise for 10,000 people so that millions of people have a great season,” he said during his talk. “And even if you mess up PTR, even if whatever you're offering to them in the mechanics is bad, I would much rather have a bad week of a PTR than a bad three months trying to recover from putting in something that we were surprising players with and it turned out to be wrong.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can get really spun up on it,” he added to me later in our conversation. “And we've had it in the early days. We're like, ‘Oh, this got data mined, people know this.’ Okay, how many people saw it? And it’s on this Reddit thread, and there’s probably 8,000 people there. But we are going to have millions of people. So at the end of the day, it’s okay. We haven’t ruined the surprise for everybody.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's better to ruin the surprise for 10,000 people so that millions of people have a great season.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One challenge Fergusson’s facing now is that he wants to offer the PTR to more people, via consoles. Right now, players can only access the PTR via Battle.net on PC, which Fergusson says is due to certification challenges and the general difficulty of releasing new builds on consoles. But he says it’s something Blizzard is investing in, now with the support of parent company Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another perk of Xbox, he says, is Diablo 4’s presence on Game Pass. Put simply, it lets Diablo amass as many players as possible. He compares it to why Blizzard decided to release Diablo 4 on Steam in addition to Battle.net - it was simply a matter of reaching more people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the things that's different from when you think of a live service that's behind a pay gate, like a premium live server, which is what Diablo is, versus a free-to-play live service like Diablo Immortal is, there's an opportunity easier to grow Immortal because there's no barriers to entry, right? Whereas, buying the boxed product or buying the main game is a barrier for some. So that's what Game Pass gets rid of, that barrier. You have this opportunity where you can see new Game Pass players coming in all the time, because they're just like, ‘Oh, I just got Game Pass. Oh, cool, that's in there?’ And off they go. So it is interesting in terms of sustaining continued new players.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">All Hours Diablo</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As we wrap up our conversation, I ask Fergusson about what he’s been playing lately, in hopes of getting a grip on what he’s inspired by. I ask if he’s picked up Path of Exile 2, and how he feels about people comparing it to Diablo 4. Fergusson disagrees with the comparison. “They’re very different games,” he says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But he’s still trying to keep folks who love both games in mind for future updates. “A lot of people actually tell us, ‘do what you're going to do, but just do us a favor and don't line up your seasons over top of each other. Let me play one season for three weeks and let me play another season for three weeks. Don't make me have to pick and choose.’ So I get that. As a person who plays lots of games, I totally understand that.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what <em>is</em> Fergusson playing right now? He tells me his top three games of 2024 by playtime. In third place, NHL 24. In second, Destiny 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in first, no surprises here, it’s Diablo 4. He has 650 hours of Diablo 4 playtime on his home retail account alone, not counting work time. He tells me he’s currently playing Companion Druid, but he also just rolled a Dance of Knives Rogue. He just loves Diablo that much. Always has.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's something about the habit of the game,” he says. “I get interrupted from- I'm halfway through Cyberpunk, I'm halfway through Witcher 3, I'm halfway through Space Marines 2000. I get to these points where I am into a non-service game, then I get distracted by something shiny. But I have this habit of, I got to go do my daily in NHL to go open my free pack of cards, and I have to go play with my brother in Destiny 2 because this is what the game we play together on. And then I just...The reason I came to Diablo five years ago was because it was my favorite game to play. So just because I work and I work doesn't stop me from going home and playing it for hours and hours too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The suggestion with these sorts of events is that if players do not obtain the items while they’re available now, then they will lose the chance forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This practice is often criticized for creating an unhealthy relationship between a video game and its community. In 2021, <a href="https://www.begambleaware.org/sites/default/files/2021-03/Gaming_and_Gambling_Report_Final.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>new research</u></a> commissioned by the UK’s GambleAware charity said many games use a "psychological nudge" to encourage people to buy loot boxes - such as the fear of missing out on limited-time items or special deals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 does not contain loot boxes, of course, but it does have community events that were recently introduced as a way to unlock coveted cosmetics. And it’s these community events that have triggered a backlash, with some applying the dreaded “live service” label to Space Marine 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post addressing the complaints</a>, Space Marine 2 publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Saber Interactive admitted the community events had received “cold feedback” since their introduction, and “we saw that many of you mentioned FOMO generated by the events.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the companies promised all the items made available in these events will be released again later, for everyone. Here’s the statement:</p><blockquote>We have noted that the Community Events have received cold feedback since we introduced them as an additional way to unlock cosmetic items. We saw that many of you mentioned FOMO generated by the events. Rest assured, we are not looking to transform Space Marine 2 into a full live service game. The items available through events WILL be available later, for everyone. We want Community Events to be a way to unlock the items in advance, for the most dedicated players, and not to be a source of frustration and stress for everyone. </blockquote><blockquote>However, that means we must provide a smooth experience in unlocking said items, which has not been the case so far. We deeply apologize for the trouble, and are currently working on a simplified process to unlock the items, to make the experience less constraining.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Focus Entertainment is giving away the much-wanted emblem-less Mk VIII Errant Helmet for free to all who link their PROS account (Focus Entertainment’s account system) to Space Marine 2. This helmet is a part of the Imperial Vigil community event that ends on March 3, and was previously only available to those who achieved a victory with each of six classes in Operations Mode by the end date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 players are currently awaiting its 7.0 update, which is set to add a new weapon, a new Operations map, and PvE Prestige Ranks. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-publisher-addresses-community-complaints-about-a-lack-of-content-reveals-whats-coming-down-the-line">Focus and Saber addressed growing frustration over a lack of content and outlined what players can expect from Space Marine 2 in the coming months</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 enjoyed a record-breaking launch late last year, eventually shifting 5 million copies while becoming the fastest-selling Warhammer video game of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Nintendo Switch Online subscribers have enjoyed re-released games for a variety of retro consoles for years now, but it seems that the titles on the service are not necessarily permanent. That's because Nintendo has announced that it will remove the Super Famicom sports game Super Formation Soccer on March 28, better known as Super Soccer in the US. However, this removal only applies to Switch Online in Japan.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYVI2FDfvMI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vYVI2FDfvMI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/for-the-first-time-nintendo-is-delisting-a-game-from-the-switch-online-retro-library/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, this will be the first time that a game has been removed from the Switch Online retro library. However, it's worth noting that Nintendo has not announced plans to remove Super Soccer from the European or North American versions of the retro library, so you can still play it for now in those regions.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not immediately clear why the Japanese version of the game is getting removed from the service, or whether it's a sign of more delistings to come. However, it's worth noting that the Super Formation Soccer IP appears to be owned by Spike Chunsoft, whereas Super Soccer was published by Nintendo, indicating that there's likely a rights ownership disparity by region. In today's digital gaming climate, games are often delisted for a variety of reasons.</p><p dir="ltr">Legendary game designer Hideki Kamiya panned the move in <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1895296236019962064" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent tweet</a>. "Hey hey hey... I guess subscriptions are no good after all," he wrote, according to a machine translation. "Seriously, bring back the Virtual Console." Though the Wii, Wii U, and 3DS Virtual Console service had its own delistings over the years, those who bought those removed games (like Street Fighter 2) still had access to them afterward.</p>

<p>"Things are about to get weirder than the 4th of July at Rick James' place! Everyone's favorite tail-whipping, channel-surfing gecko is back in a collection that features all of his best-selling adventures!" Limited Run teased.</p>
<p>Whilst there's no firm release date as yet, Gex Trilogy is expected to release in summer/Q3 2025 for Nintendo Switch, PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>ICYMI, previously unseen footage from a demo for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-20-years-later-footage-from-an-unreleased-gex-demo-has-shown-up-online">an unannounced Gex sequel made the rounds back in 2022</a>. The footage showed a character named Gex Jr. making his way through what appears to be a cinema.</p>
<p>Gex Jr. jumps from screen to popcorn machine and on to yet another screen (one of which appears to show Gex from Crystal Dynamics' original games), all while chugging down cans of fizzy soda and making some pretty dated references.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>In a roadmap update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a>, 11 bit studios has revealed that the console port of their post-apocalyptic city builder is planned for release this summer.</p>
<p>The Frostpunk 2 roadmap now has three major landmarks on it with fairly well defined time windows. 8th May will see the first free major content update that will make adjustments to the City’s management, before the console port arrives at some point in the summer. There’s then an autumn target for the Spectrum DLC.</p>


<p>Further away is two more DLC packs. The Aurora DLC is still expected this year, while the untitled DLC 3 is coming in 2026.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown from 11 bit:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>May 8th</b> – A day to be remembered: a <b>Free Major Content Update</b> that will adjust the City’s management, paying homage to the order established by the first New Londoners.</li>
<li><b>Summer</b> – A grand undertaking: the <b>Console Port</b>.</li>
<li><b>Autumn</b> – Reaching the <b>Spectrum DLC</b>, which may help us learn more about ourselves and the people of our great city in more ways than one…</li>
</ul>
<p>They also hint that fans of these gritty city builders should keep an eye out for a seventh anniversary celebration of the original game on 24th April.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While Monster Hunter Wilds is a more than worthy new entry in the series, the game leaves a lot to be desired in terms of image quality and performance on all platforms, and the massive performance issues many are experiencing on PC may be caused by how the game handles streaming data to the GPU.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> released their first look at the PC version of the game, highlighting how the positive first impressions one may get from the detailed graphics settings are soon turned around by bad image quality, low-quality textures that likely suffer from texture decompression issues, and subpar performance. From the testing conducted by the tech experts, there's a very good chance the performance issues are caused by how the game handles data streaming data to the GPU, as it has been noted that frametime gets really bad on mid and low-range GPUs by turning the camera around quickly, whereas frametime remains acceptable without moving the camera or turning it slowly in the same identical scenario with very little going on. The same issue is found on more powerful GPUs, although it is more mitigated and slightly less of an issue.&nbsp; Given how the same issue still happens with low texture quality, Digital Foundry surmises that these Monster Hunter Wilds performance issues may not be caused by VRAM usage but by data streaming to the GPU, as there's the chance that the game could still be streaming things in and maybe decompressing textures in an unnecessarily aggressive manner.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds PC - Profound Perf Problems Must Be Addressed" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0yhacyXcizA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's not just mid- and low-range GPUs that cannot run Monster Hunter Wilds with decent performance, but also more powerful high-end GPUs like the recently released RTX 5080. A new video put together by MxBenchmarkPC highlights how the second most powerful GPU currently available on the market can barely hit the 60 FPS mark at 4K resolution, highest setting, which is truly baffling, considering the game doesn't push visual quality boundaries in any way.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds on the RTX 5080 - A Solid Candidate for the Most Unoptimized Game of 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kUsLUP4tsSw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance issues outlined above align with my experience, as the game is not running smoothly at all on my RTX 4080. It is a shame that the game's launch is marred by these issues, as it is a very solid game.

            <p>Playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>'s Kislev campaign on release was one of the best storified strategy game times I've had in years, launch issues be thrice-damned, triple cooked, and three times a lady. But the Slavic bulwark against stinky, angry, tricksy and horny invaders has lost some lustre since. The details in <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/67">Creative Assembly's latest blog</a> are still a work in progress, but give a solid idea of how Kislev as a faction are changing in a patch due mid-March.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Creative Assembly said a while back that they'd be tweaking the pricing structure for the Shadows Of Change DLC to bring it in line with the a la carte factions from other recent expansions. The Kislev-Cathay-Tzeentch expansion was beefed up post-release with new units, and now it's getting some more love: joining Kislev, Now It's Ursunal are toys for Kairos Fateweaver, and suprise new units for Cathay and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ogre">Ogre</a> Kingdoms.</p>

<p>The biggest news here is that they've axed the supporter race between Katarin and Assputin completely. You'll instead "curry favour with the Orthodoxy to improve your common line troops, strengthen your economy and improve your invocations. And support the Ice court in order to improve your elite infantry, spellcasting and hero usage."</p>
<p>This isn't a race, but there'll apparently be consequences ("unrest") if you focus too much on one side over the other. I'm torn over this. I'm up for regular buffs and army theming all day long, but it sounds like there's already a single correct way to play baked in to the system, with perhaps just a little leeway to make choices if you don't want to suffer penalties. I'd say I'd withhold judgement but the judgement has clearly already wriggled out from  my grasp and made itself known, in print no less.</p>
<p>Also dead is the ubiquitous province control system, replaced with an updated version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a>. "It acts much like Control, but can be spent on local invocations to temporarily boost the local province, or to empower an army temporarily".</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Total-Warhammer-kislev-rework-2.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Creative Assembly</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The tech tree is getting an overhaul ("no longer locked behind owning the Kislev capitals"!) as is the Attamans system. They're getting their own unique skill trees, plus the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Atamans now enable a new feature for settlements, tentatively called “Garrison Sally Attack” where you can command settlements managed by them to engage enemies within a limited distance, as if the settlements themselves were armies. Of course, the capital of the province is lead by the Ataman himself, who takes the field with the garrison during this attack."</p></blockquote>
<p>This is exciting because it a) just sounds very useful and b) opens up the possibility of Wood Elf tree settlements being able to uproot themselves and branch batter invaders somewhere down the line.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Total-Warhammer-kairos-rework-1.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Creative Assembly</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For fate-weaving failbird Kairos, there's a whole pick n' mix lore system:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The core promise of the fragments of sorcery feature was versatility to build your own composite lore. And the design quickly narrowed in on a true “any combination you want” feature that completely did away with the idea of an ancillary slot, and moved the decision making to its own tab of the character detail panel."</p></blockquote>
<p>Do pop over to the blog for some more detailed visuals, but it basically looks like you'll be able to slot in what spells you want and switch between heads to access more than usual. It's a touch vague at the moment though.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two new units: grenadiers for Cathay and Gnoblar slingers for the Ogre Kingdoms. The grenadiers are vulnerable but powerful bomb hurlers with a debuff stun grenade, and the slingers look like Skavenslave slingers but less perfect, beautiful, graceful, and valiant.</p>
<p>I do enjoy all the work in progress art for its transparency in revealing that videogames look mostly awful for 95% of their development. I once played a grey box version of a game where all the characters in cutscenes had their faces replaced by real time clips of the actors doing mocap. Deeply disconcerting stuff.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>AMD have finally confirmed pricing, dating, and specs-ing for their first RDNA 4 graphics cards. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amds-ces-2025-announcements-include-what-will-probably-be-yet-another-worlds-fastest-cpu">Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT</a> will be out on March 6th, and start from $549 and $599 respectively. While these are still relatively fat stacks o' cash, AMD say they’ll compete with Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-1999-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-makes-the-rest-of-the-rtx-50-series-look-suspiciously-sensible">RTX 5070</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review">RTX 5070 Ti</a> – and considering the latter is supposed to start at $749, with most models currently going for above $800, that could make for a tasty undercutting.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The RTX 5070 hasn’t launched yet and its $549 MSRP is dead even with that of the RX 9070, though the Radeon does have an edge in the VRAM department, with 16GB to the GeForce’s 12GB. The RX 9070 XT shares this spec, while upping boost clock speeds from 2.54GHz to 2.97GHz and adding a few more RDNA Compute Units (64 to 56 on the RX 9070). Its RT Accelerator count also comes in at 64 to the RX 9070’s 56, so expect superior ray tracing performance as well.</p>
<p>Obviously, in the absence of reliable benchmarks, we can’t say for now which will be best for that crucial GPU workload of Making Numbers Go Bigger. Still, I’d argue that Nvidia and AMD haven’t so much been competing on framerates these last few years as they have on those secondary technologies: DLSS, FSR, frame generation and so on. And here, the Radeon versions have been hopelessly outmatched, be it on visual quality, general performance, or even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/confirmed-ray-tracing-and-dlss-games">breadth of support among games</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT are, in some ways, most RTX-like than any Radeon GPU has been for ages. By embracing a similar flavour of AI and machine learning, they’ll be the first (and, for a while, only) cards to support FSR 4, which itself is abandoning the GPU-agnostic rule of previous versions by basing its upscaling and anti-aliasing on that very same robot brain tech. In other words, FSR is becoming much more DLSS-y. This won’t extend to copying the Multi Frame Generation component of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4</a>, but FSR 4’s standard 2x frame gen is supposedly much sharper than stabler than that of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-3-demystified-how-the-next-gen-upscaler-could-upgrade-performance-on-any-gpu">FSR 3</a>, while the upscaling component aims to make drastic improvements to image quality. FSR 4 will also have over 30 compatible games at launch, dozens more than FSR 3 did, and rising to 75 by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>Given DLSS 4 has only just launched, I think it’s probably fine if FSR 4 simply plays catch-up to DLSS on picture quality, rather than surpassing it – and for $200 less, the RX 9070 XT could be one compelling card if it can simultaneously match the RTX 5070 Ti’s core performance. Of course, GPUs are in high demand right now, and it would be unsurprising (if deeply unfortunate) for these RDNA 4 cards to suffer the same problem of price-hiked and under-stocked partner models that the RTX 50 series is buckling under. AMD, one suspects, will be crossing their fingers that the eBay reseller crowd already has their hands full with garages of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080s</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sure, it might seem like the most counter-cultural act imaginable amidst these late-stage capitalism end-of-days horrors, but the very internet on which you’re reading these words wouldn’t exist without it. The games you play depend on it. It’s the very core of art itself. So, it’s generally a pretty good thing when games industry people remember this. Speaking of which, EA just made the code for the first four <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> games officially open source.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,196663,194143" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>You may, as someone possibly young enough to have been untroubled by the <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> games in their heyday, see this as a relatively minor act. It’s really, <em>really</em> not. And if we’re going to be fiercely critical of EA when it does horrible things, it’s also crucial that we celebrate when the publisher does something this important.</p><p>Two primers. <strong>Firstly, <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em></strong>, or <em>C&amp;C</em> as it’s mostly known to its adoring fanbase. These were a series of utterly superb real-time strategy games, sometimes the best in the medium,  gloriously loved in part for their kitschy full-motion video cutscenes. The first game, in 1995, sold <em>three million copies </em>in a time before games really did that, and that was despite its FMV sequences starring members of the development team in the lowest-budget way imaginable.</p><p>As the series went on, these cutscenes began to star some really big names, the likes of James Earl Jones, J.K. Simmons, George Takei, Tim Curry, Jonathan Pryce, and—uh-oh—Gina Carano. The release of a new entry was always a big deal, with gaming magazines inevitably plastering them over front pages and  reviews so frequently glowing. So while the name “<em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>” may not mean so much in 2025, 17 years after the last decent game in the series—<em>Red Alert 3</em>—it remains one of the most significant franchises in gaming history.</p><p><strong>Secondly, source codes.</strong> Any game being made publicly available for free (as in: yours to keep, copy, share forever) is to be celebrated, in an industry that usually so spitefully clings on to long-dead IPs that it refuses to sell, but still employs lawyers to prevent being accessible. But releasing a game’s source code is next level. This is not the game itself, as in a thing to boot up and play, but rather the flesh and bones that makes the game exist. It’s <em>all the secrets</em>. It offers developers the ability to see exactly how a game was put together, read all the hilariously botched bits of code the devs strung together in desperation to get a game out the door, and learn how the best in the business constructed their games.</p><p>Very few games publishers ever allow access to a game’s source code, even if they’re willing to let a game be freely shared. It’s not always possible—code is lost or difficult to put all in one place, and licenses can be nightmarish. But even when it is easily doable, it’s still a rarity. Often this is simply because developers are desperately embarrassed, horrified at the idea of their peers learning just how precariously held together their code proves to be, even though that’s the case for absolutely everyone else’s work too! Also, people are shitty, and there’s always grim hostility as code is judged by people who couldn’t do better. Sometimes it’s because sharing source code can give people the impression that you’re also now available for tech support, there to answer every question about every detail, and no one wants or needs that. But too often it’s because of a belief that these are industry secrets, precious treasures that must be sat upon for all of time lest a rival do something so inhumanly awful as <em>copy</em>.</p><p>So, given all this context, this move by EA is really significant, and incredibly welcome. Because going “open source” is even bigger than has already been suggested. Publishing the code under <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GPL license</a></span> means that absolutely anybody is now allowed to take that code, make even minor changes to it, and then sell it for profit! Clearly, not many would pay for such low-effort output, but that’s the core of the principle here. It’s the same basis on which Linux distributions are published, along with all the free software that runs on it. It’s free, open code, there for the wider public to learn from, adapt, and reinterpret.</p><p>The four games now having their code published under the GPL are <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>, <em>C&amp;C: Red Alert</em>, <em>C&amp;C: Renegade</em> (a first-person shooter!), and <em>C&amp;C: Generals</em>.</p><p>EA isn’t alone here, of course. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://github.com/id-software&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://github.com/id-software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">id Software was known for many years</a></span> for publishing the source code for its games a few years after release. (Unfortunately  id, now owned by Microsoft, doesn’t seem to have any interest in continuing the trend.) Epic, another company built in the ‘90s on principles of shareware and shared code, also releases <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://github.com/RedPandaProjects/UnrealEngine&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://github.com/RedPandaProjects/UnrealEngine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">older versions of the Unreal Engine</a></span>, as well as games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/unreal-engine-epic-free-internet-archive-fortnite-1851698320&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/unreal-engine-epic-free-internet-archive-fortnite-1851698320"><em>Unreal </em>and <em>Unreal Tournament</em></a></span>.</p><p>What makes this <em>Command &amp; Conquer </em>move quite so striking is that it’s EA doing it. They’re not exactly a company known for, let’s say, loving acts of kindness. In more recent years, the publisher has become synonymous with the lowest aspects of video gaming, from forcing its games to be played with an internet connection before the era of widely-available broadband, to gacha awfulness with its gambling-adjacent loot boxes. In fact, the <em>C&amp;C</em> name itself was run into the ground until it was all but worthless after EA forced in always-on DRM to hastily made sequels and released terrible free-to-play mobile versions. </p><figure id="" data-id="153d4b128504c7b43e0f0a231c9a3b46" data-recommend-id="image://153d4b128504c7b43e0f0a231c9a3b46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1022" data-height="575" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The battle map, covered in fire, from C&amp;C Generals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The battle map, covered in fire, from C&amp;C Generals." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Mobygames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="153d4b128504c7b43e0f0a231c9a3b46" data-recommend-id="image://153d4b128504c7b43e0f0a231c9a3b46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1022" data-height="575" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The battle map, covered in fire, from C&amp;C Generals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? Is this a crack in their tough, outer veneer? A sign of a future EA that is interested in games preservation, and the open and free sharing of intellectual property from which it no longer has a means to meaningfully profit? Because dear God, I hope so.</p><p>And I hope other publishers sit up and take notice about how we’re all now making cooing noises and scratching EA under its chin, rather than simply scowling at it. This should be normal! It’s essentially free to a publisher—you just stick the source code on Github and eat your lumps. Somehow one of the most controversial things I ever wrote was suggesting that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">games should go into the public domain a full 20 years after their first release</a></span>, despite this seeming like the most sensible, industry-boosting action possible, at a point when publishers are no longer making real money from the original versions. OK, so in the case of most the games being made available here, we’re talking closer to 30 years. But I’ll take it!</p><p>So come on, everyone! A revolution! EA, give us the source code for <em>Sim City 2000</em>! LucasFilm, hand over <em>Day of the Tentacle</em>! Activision, share <em>MechWarrior 2</em> with everyone! Just imagine the learning resources that could be out there, the archive of code for the most important games of past generations, and the absolute assurance of their preservation for the future.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sequels are hallmark of the video game industry, but no one should expect Diablo 5 anytime soon.

                <p> Over a decade ago, Skype was one of the big features that Microsoft boasted about for Xbox One--which the company coined the "all in one experience." Today, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/02/28/the-next-chapter-moving-from-skype-to-microsoft-teams/">Microsoft has announced plans</a> to shut down the video-conferencing app entirely in May, with the ability to transfer data over to Teams.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2013, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2013/05/22/xbox-reveal-skype-blog/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Skype was going to be one of the ways the Xbox One stood out</a> in the gaming industry, letting you video chat while playing Titanfall and watching TV with Snap. Remember Snap? It was the feature that put secondary applications on the right side of the screen for Xbox One.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Skype worked with voice controls, as Microsoft touted saying things like, "Hey Xbox, Skype Mom!" This was possible as the system was initially bundled with Kinect for Xbox One. On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk-a_Pj4uHM">YouTube</a>, Skype even marketed the features with a silly promo video featuring comedian Bobby Lee.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk-a_Pj4uHM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lk-a_Pj4uHM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Since then, Xbox head honcho Phil Spencer has admitted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-reflects-on-what-went-wrong-with-the-/1100-6468802/">the entertainment-focused approach to Xbox One was a mistake</a> and ultimately led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-xbox-one-sales-were-less-than-half-of-the-ps4/1100-6506476/">PS4 dominating Xbox One last generation in hardware sales</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It seems as though a Skype app was available on Xbox Series X|S but pulled from the Xbox Store in the past couple of years, per <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/13vwz5c/did_they_remove_skype_from_xbox/?rdt=47026" rel="nofollow ">this Reddit post</a>. Keep in mind Kinect doesn't work in any capacity with Xbox Series X|S, either.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-to-acquire-skype-for-85-billion/1100-6312959/" data-ref-id="1100-6312959">Microsoft acquired Skype for $8.5 billion</a> in early 2013.

At a glance, those picks aren’t that odd. <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>had starters that originated in regions different from the Sinnoh one it was set in. However, given two of them are from Gen II’s Johto region, fans are wondering why Cyndaquil, the fire-type porcupine-ish little guy who also debuted in <em>Gold </em>and <em>Silver</em>, wasn’t part of the starting roster alongside Chikorita and Totodile. The most plausible reasons for the omission aren’t that interesting, but the more outlandish conspiracy theories forming around it are very funny.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195519,195905" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you somehow missed it last year, <em>Pokémon </em>developer Game Freak was subject to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688">a massive leak in October</a></span>.

The internet had a field day with it and the fire starter’s reputation hasn’t recovered from the scandal. Now, fans are spinning tales that the reason Cyndaquil isn’t joining its Johto starters in <em>Legends: Z-A </em>is that Game Freak may have thought it was too soon to put it back in the spotlight. The more likely explanation is that Cyndaquil was a starter in <em>Legends: Arceus</em>, and Game Freak probably didn’t want to double-dip in the same subseries. But nevertheless, fans are running with the theory, and while some think the Typhlosion jokes are dead, I am still laughing.</p><p>Typhlosion has gotten some recent love, so it’s not like Cyndaquil fans are starving. The Pokémon got a brand new Hisuian form in <em>Legends: Arceus</em> that is arguably even cooler than its Johto region variant. But even if he’s not a starter this time, hopefully the little guy still shows up in <em>Legends: Z-A</em> as an obtainable Pokémon when the game launches later this year.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-reveal-trailer-shows-ciri-and-mioni-are-mirrors-of-each-other/1100-6529728/" data-ref-id="1100-6529728">behind-the-scenes video</a> about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>'s impressive announcement trailer came together featured footage of the character Ciri sporting a different look--or at least that's what some fans thought they saw in the footage. The game's director has now responded, saying the studio has not modified Ciri's look and attempted to explain why her character model in the behind-the-scenes video may appear to look different from the trailer itself.</p><p>"The behind-the-scenes video features the same in-game model of Ciri as seen in the original trailer. We have not modified it," <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1895148428176375925" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sebastian Kalemba said</a>. "What you're seeing is raw footage--without facial animation, lighting, or virtual camera lenses."</p><p>Kalemba also assured fans that the newly released footage in the behind-the-scenes video represents a "work-in-progress snapshot" of Ciri's look.</p><p>"This variation is a natural part of the game development process. At this point, any character's appearance may vary depending on the medium--whether it's in a trailer, a 3D model, or in-game," he said.</p><p>After the original Witcher trilogy focused on Geralt, The Witcher 4 tells its story from the perspective of Ciri. Kalemba previously talked about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-explains-why-ciris-the-star-this-time-confirms-geralt-will-appear/1100-6528460/" data-ref-id="1100-6528460">Ciri was a "natural choice" for The Witcher 4.</a></p><p>"There's plenty of room for her and for us, also, to build on top of [her]. There's so much room for exploration, and because she's such a nuanced character, the beginning of her journey gives us freedom and so many opportunities to be able to dig in and use [that] for good," he said.</p><p>The Witcher 4 kicks off a new trilogy of Witcher games, which are in development alongside CD Projekt's other games, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">Witcher remake.</a> The Witcher 4, like CD Projekt's other games, is being made using Epic's Unreal Engine 5 following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-explains-why-its-using-unreal-engine-5/1100-6502196/" data-ref-id="1100-6502196">CD Projekt and Epic striking a major development deal. </a></p>

            <p>A new Witcher novel is due out later this year, from original author Andrzej Sapkowski, which will follow a teen Geralt.</p>
<p>The prequel will be called Crossroads of Ravens in English (Rozdroże Kruków in Polish) and focus on an 18-year-old Geralt setting out from Kaer Morhen on his first mission where he'll "discover monsters, traitors, some new friends and some familiar faces, and just how deeply feared and despised Witchers can be".</p>
<p>Yes, Sapkowski stated he'd finished the Witcher saga back in 1999, but he returned in 2013 with Season of Storms, and now will return once again.</p>

<p>"In Rozdroże Kruków I return to the roots of Geralt's journey - not the fearless monster slayer we know, but a young Witcher just beginning to understand the burden of his destiny," said Sapkowski.</p>
<p>"Imagine Geralt, but younger, with fewer scars and a bit more haughtiness. This is a story of growth, of idealism meeting harsh reality, and of choices that forge a legend. It's about finding your place in a world that's constantly challenging you to be more than you thought you could be. As this new story finds its way to readers across the globe this year, I can't wait for them to walk alongside a younger Geralt - experiencing the trials that forged him and the journey that set him on the road to his destiny."</p>
<p>The novel will be released on 30th September in an English translation by David French, responsible for translating 6 of the last 8 Witcher books. For non-English speakers, it will be translated into more than 19 other languages.</p>
<p>The novel will differ from CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">recently revealed The Witcher 4</a>. Instead of going backwards, the next game will follow the previous games as sequels to the books and has Ciri as its protagonist instead of Geralt.</p>
<p>Don't worry gruff hero fans, Geralt will still make an appearance in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">will he be playable? The developers remain coy</a>.</p>
<p>Witcher 4 will compete with The Blood of Dawnwalker, a new game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz's new studio Rebel Wolves. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-directors-dark-fantasy-rpg-the-blood-of-the-dawnwalker-gets-first-trailer">game received its first trailer</a> at the start of the year.</p>
<p>The studio is supported by NetEase and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-next-game-still-on-track-studio-says-despite-netease-funding-fears">recently confirmed it hasn't been affected by the Chinese conglomerate pulling funding</a>.</p>
<p>It also won't be the first time we see a young Geralt, as he features in Netflix anime Nightmare of the Wolf.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
