		<p>Pathologic 3 has been revealed by Ice-Pick Lodge and HypeTrain Digital, with this being a follow up to Pathologic 2 which was released in 2019. Pathologic 2 was actually a reboot of the original Pathologic that was released in 2005. That had three characters who were the Changeling, the Haruspex, and the Bachelor. The 2019 reboot focused solely on the Haruspex, while Pathologic 3 will focus on the Bachelor.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pathologic 3 Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zb0C2WYUjkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Pathologic 3, The Bachelor is a doctor who has come to the small town in an attempt to find an immortal man, and defeat death. The Bachelor only has 12 days to complete this impossible mission, but he has an advantage as he access to a time travel mechanic. While trying to defeat death, players will also be influencing events in the town, and trying to help the townspeople as an epidemic sweeps through the population.</p>
<p><span>Ice Pick Lodge founder Nikolay Dybowski, said, “<em>We are making a game about how a person develops their mind to learn how to work with things they previously couldn’t or didn’t know how to notice. Our goal is to understand what this means for the player. Right now, the most pressing issue for me seems to be rethinking our habitual understanding of how our mind works—how to use it without getting into trouble or losing ourselves. That’s why I want to create gameplay that touches on this theme. The Bachelor sees himself as a man of intellect. We can describe the concept of this mechanic as surrealist time management. Our goal is to give the player a sense that time is more complex than we typically perceive it—as a linear path. We want to show the player the possibility of existing in a world that is disassembled and functions in a way quite different from what we’re used to expecting.”</em></span></p>

<p>Pathologic 3 is due to release in 2025 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-director-says-the-remakes-differences-are-mediocre-save-for-the-camera/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Silent Hill 2 director Masashi Tsuboyama <a href="https://x.com/tsuboyama2024/status/1842185991496614263" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took to X</a> to talk about his feelings on the remake that's due to launch tomorrow. Tsuboyama-san, who has since worked in the art department of a few Nintendo games (most recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yoshis-crafted-world-crafty-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoshi's Crafted World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/princess-peach-showtime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a>), criticized differences like 4K, 'photorealism', and the bonus headgear, labeling as mediocre. However, he praised the camera change as a major improvement for the remake.</p>
<p><em>I think the value of the Silent Hill 2 remake is that a new generation can play it. As a creator, I'm very happy about it. It's been 23 years! Even if you don't know the original, you can just enjoy the remake as it is. Whether it's good or bad doesn't affect the original.</em></p>
<p><em>The differences between the original and the remake, 4K, Photorealism, the bonus headgear, etc. are all mediocre. Who is this promotion going to appeal to? It seems like they're not doing enough to convey the appeal of the work to the generation that doesn't know Silent Hill.</em></p>
<p><em>The thing to note is the change in camera (perspective). The change in playable camera has a significant impact on many aspects, combat, level design, art creation, etc. While the impact on the story may be relatively small, it brings a big change to the playfeel of the game. To be honest, I'm not satisfied with the playable camera from 23 years ago. Depth and angle were limited by the processing load. It was a continuous process of hard work that was not rewarded. But that was the limit. </em><em>The over-the-shoulder view definitely adds to the sense of realism. In other words, it makes me want to try playing the even more immersive remake of Silent Hill 2.</em></p>
<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake officially launches tomorrow, although pre-orders of the digital deluxe already have access to the game, and user reviews on Steam are already overwhelmingly positive (96%). This lines up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our own review of the game</a>, where Chris Wray wrote:</p>
<p><em>So, shall I succinctly finish this? Silent Hill 2 is scary, atmospheric, polished, and fun (or as fun as a game like this can be). It is great, the best game by the Bloober Team, and proof that, somewhere in the organisation, someone in Konami knows what needs to be done, and they must be nurtured.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dragori-games-announces-tanares-expeditions-epic-pirate-adventure-board-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dragori Games has announced a new board game coming to Gamefound. The game is <em>Tanares Expeditions: Central Sea</em>, a swashbuckling pirate adventure set in the studio's original fantasy setting.</p>
<h2>The Tanares Expeditions Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, <em>Tanares Expeditions: Central Sea</em> is a board game designed for 1-4 players. It is a standalone experience where players take on the role of pirate heroes as they attempt to stop something from drowning the world of Tanares in corruption and despair. The game will feature four brand-new heroes, with more to come in the future.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tanares-expeditions-dragon-miniature.jpg?itok=4zjjvn1R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tanares-expeditions-dragon-miniature.jpg?itok=3De-FjXb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The gameplay of <em>Tanares Expeditions</em> is a blend of a classic dungeon-crawler and a roguelite. Through quests, characters will grow stronger, allowing them to develop powerful combos. Combos are a staple of Tanares' series gameplay, allowing you to engage in combat even when it isn't your turn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While designing the mechanics and pace of Expeditions, I aimed to capture what fans truly love about Tanares while introducing something fresh and exciting," explains Alexandre Aboud, lead game designer for Expeditions. "Inspired by the fantastic Slay the Spire, players can expect constant adaptation and growth with the new roguelite-inspired mechanics we're bringing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Tanares Expeditions: Central Sea</em> is the latest entry in the Tanares adventure series. It began in 2018 with Dragori's first game, <em>Arena: The Contest</em> in 2018. Since then, the studio has expanded the series through several successfully crowdfunded board games.</p>
<p>These projects include <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/dragori-games/tanares-adventures-ultimate-edition"><em>Tanares Adventures</em></a>, a co-op adventure that garnered critical acclaim, and over $2.8 million during its initial campaign, and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragorigames/tanares-rpg"><em>Tanares RPG</em></a>, a TTRPG using the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>D&amp;D</em></a> 5e ruleset set in the world of high fantasy, political intrigue, and eldritch horror.</p>
<p>At time of writing, details are scarce on Tanares Expeditions: Central Sea. Its Gamefound campaign is currently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragorigames/tanares-rpg">in preview</a>, but will officially launch November 19.</p>

And that makes sense. The OG <em>Silent Hill 2,</em> which released on PS2 back in 2001, is still considered by many to be the best horror game ever made. But some of these fans aren’t happy about changes made in the remake, like the new over-the-shoulder camera. The original game used <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/hSvs_7JkLUA?si=t6QF5F8GOmTtVQXP&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/hSvs_7JkLUA?si=t6QF5F8GOmTtVQXP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a somewhat static camera</a></span> that roughly followed the player as they moved around.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/7-best-strikers-for-ea-sports-fc-25-career-mode.1003101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-strikers-ea-sports-fc-25-career-mode/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Strikers get the job done at the end – be it a last-minute goal or outrunning the defenders using their sheer speed, they can turn the tide of a match at any moment. However, having the best strikers early on in EA Sports FC 25 Career Mode can be a challenge.</p>



<p>First of all, you have to take three factors into consideration – Age, Cost, and Pace. The younger, faster, and cheaper the players are, the better their chances will be to shine during the later stages of their careers when the stakes are higher and the competition is fiercer.</p>



<p>Let’s now take a look at seven of the best Strikers you can sign in EA Sports FC 25 Career Mode.</p>



<h2 id="h-paris-brunner">Paris Brunner</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pace</strong>: 68</li>



<li><strong>Shooting</strong>: 66</li>



<li><strong>Passing</strong>: 51</li>



<li><strong>Dribbling</strong>: 67</li>



<li><strong>Defending</strong>: 27</li>



<li><strong>Physical</strong>: 59</li>



<li><strong>Skill</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Weak Foot</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Potential</strong>: 87</li>
</ul>



<p>Paris Josua Brunner is the youngest forward on our list who is currently aged 18 and plays for the Belgian Pro League club Cercle Brugge. His overall stats make him a good choice for your Career Mode as he has the potential to reach an 87 rating after a few years.</p>



<p>His wages and transfer budget are lower than all the players we’ve mentioned here and that makes him an underrated choice for your Club.</p>



<h2 id="h-semih-kilicsoy">Semih Kılıçsoy</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pace</strong>: 78</li>



<li><strong>Shooting</strong>: 74</li>



<li><strong>Passing</strong>: 60</li>



<li><strong>Dribbling</strong>: 75</li>



<li><strong>Defending</strong>: 31</li>



<li><strong>Physical</strong>: 71</li>



<li><strong>Skill</strong>: 3 Star</li>



<li><strong>Weak Foot</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Potential</strong>: 88</li>
</ul>



<p>Semih Kılıçsoy, currently 19 years old, plays as a forward for Beşiktaş and Turkey. He is a right-footed player and could be one of the top picks for Career Mode in EA Sports FC 25.</p>



<p>His market value won’t be too high which means you can nurture this young talent to prepare for your club’s future. This Turkish forward’s stats are pretty balanced, with a 79 sprint speed and 77 finishing means you can use him as a substitute during the first few years at your club.</p>



<h2 id="h-karim-konate">Karim Konaté</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pace</strong>: 86</li>



<li><strong>Shooting</strong>: 70</li>



<li><strong>Passing</strong>: 56</li>



<li><strong>Dribbling</strong>: 76</li>



<li><strong>Defending</strong>: 40</li>



<li><strong>Physical</strong>: 65</li>



<li><strong>Skill</strong>: 3 Star</li>



<li><strong>Weak Foot</strong>: 3 Star</li>



<li><strong>Potential</strong>: 87</li>
</ul>



<p>Karim Konaté is another right-footed footballer from Ivory Coast who can reach great heights in the coming years. His pace is already stellar at 86 and can potentially reach a rating of 87, which could make him a well-rounded forward for your Career Mode.</p>



<p>Semih Kılıçsoy, Karim Konaté, and Paris Brunner are three great striker options if your club has a lower transfer budget.</p>



<h2 id="h-mathys-tel">Mathys Tel</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pace</strong>: 86</li>



<li><strong>Shooting</strong>: 80</li>



<li><strong>Passing</strong>: 64</li>



<li><strong>Dribbling</strong>: 77</li>



<li><strong>Defending</strong>: 29</li>



<li><strong>Physical</strong>: 64</li>



<li><strong>Skill</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Weak Foot</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Potential</strong>: 88</li>
</ul>



<p>Mathys Tel is another young French talent currently playing for Bayern Munich. His insane stats at just 19 years old make him one of the top contenders for Career Mode in EA Sports FC 25.</p>



<p>An 86 Pace and 80 Shooting should be enough for him to be an impactful substitute to outrun the defenders and get away with last-minute goals for your club.</p>



<h2 id="h-benjamin-sesko">Benjamin Šeško</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pace</strong>: 85</li>



<li><strong>Shooting</strong>: 78</li>



<li><strong>Passing</strong>: 63</li>



<li><strong>Dribbling</strong>: 77</li>



<li><strong>Defending</strong>: 46</li>



<li><strong>Physical</strong>: 78</li>



<li><strong>Skill</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Weak Foot</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Potential</strong>: 88</li>
</ul>



<p>Benjamin Šeško is a 21-year-old Slovenian forward currently playing for RB Leipzig. His stats are as good as Mathys Tel’s but with a better heading accuracy. This could make him a perfect substitute during late matches.</p>



<h2 id="h-vitor-roque">Vitor Roque</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pace</strong>: 85</li>



<li><strong>Shooting</strong>: 79</li>



<li><strong>Passing</strong>: 59</li>



<li><strong>Dribbling</strong>: 80</li>



<li><strong>Defending</strong>: 20</li>



<li><strong>Physical</strong>: 64</li>



<li><strong>Skill</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Weak Foot</strong>: 3 Star</li>



<li><strong>Potential</strong>: 87</li>
</ul>



<p>Vitor Hugo Roque Ferreira is currently aged 19 and playing for Real Betis on loan from Barcelona. His stats are great – 85 Pace and 79 Shooting means he can be a super sub for your team during the initial years and a star in the future.</p>



<p>Unlike Endrick, his transfer budget is not that high but could end up being one of the best forwards down the line.</p>



<h2 id="h-endrick">Endrick</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pace</strong>: 89</li>



<li><strong>Shooting</strong>: 76</li>



<li><strong>Passing</strong>: 61</li>



<li><strong>Dribbling</strong>: 78</li>



<li><strong>Defending</strong>: 30</li>



<li><strong>Physical</strong>: 64</li>



<li><strong>Skill</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Weak Foot</strong>: 3 Star</li>



<li><strong>Potential</strong>: 91</li>
</ul>



<p>Endrick is surely an upcoming star and is currently playing for Real Madrid. This Brazilian forward is 18 years old at the time of writing and is already competing at the highest level in La Liga.</p>



<p>Endrick already has 89 Pace at such a young age and he will only get better with age. His transfer budget is higher than all other players on this list as he can reach a potential rating of 91 down the line, but it could be well worth the investment for your club’s future in Career Mode.</p>

Zero (our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-review">review is currently in progress</a>, but we feel like it's a labor of love). That's on top of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</a>, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, and more.</p><p>Here are some of the biggest games coming out this week</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S) - October 8 (though it's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-global-release-times-confirmed">available in some regions today</a>)</li><li>Silent Hill 2 Remake (PC, PS5) - October 8</li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/destiny-2-revenant-official-launch-trailer">Destiny 2: Revenant</a> (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S) - October 8</li><li>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-issues-response-to-rumors-regarding-tencent%E2%80%99s-potential-buyout.1003074/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-issues-response-to-rumors-regarding-tencents-potential-buyout/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has officially <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/zAyDQducoGatn4IydphOy/dcdb9b3c9f3ce53112b358890acd1196/PR_Company_statement_07102024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to come forward</a> and address the rumors of Tencent exploring the option to buy out the French game publisher, although the statement right now is very vague. It's been <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-planning-ubisoft-buyout/">rumored that Tencent is teaming up with the Guillemot Family</a> to buy out Ubisoft to take the company private, but it has not officially been confirmed. According to sources close to the scene, Tencent and the Guillemot Family are speaking to advisors. In a statement released on Monday, Ubisoft said that they "regularly reviews all its strategic options in the interest of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-small-investor-pushes-hard-for-the-companys-sale/">stakeholders</a> and will inform the market if and when appropriate."</p>
<p>Additionally, the statement goes on to mention that "the Company reiterates that management is currently focused on executing its strategy, centered on two core verticals - Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences." This is as far as the statement goes, with the statement being just a couple of sentences long.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be too shocking for the Guillemot Family to team up with Tencent to purchase Ubisoft, as the Guillemot Family founded Ubisoft, with Yves Guillemot being the current CEO of the company. It's said that Tencent wants to look into ways to "stabilize Ubisoft and bolster its value." At the moment, Ubisoft isn't having the best time, as its shares were driven down 19% last month, especially with Ubisoft making the decision to delay the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, with Star Wars Outlaws sales being much lower than they initially thought.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws has been a huge point of contention for both Ubisoft and the audience, with Ubisoft funneling as much money as possible into the game and its promotion, for it to only sell a million copies in the month of its release.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, Ubisoft is considering taking the company private. Tencent has a 10% stake in Ubisoft, but also owns 49.9% of Guillemot Brothers Ltd. If Tencent did take the company private, it's a move that wouldn't surprise many in the slightest. However, if they were to take the company private, there would also be a push for huge reconstructions, including a new CEO and many new layoffs. Ubisoft has already laid off quite a few workers from their team, with the IT team and special effects studio being at the forefront of the layoffs.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has now been delayed until next year, so it remains to be seen if Ubisoft will make any decisions before that point or if they are waiting to see whether this game will fix their finances.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Google’s Android app store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play">is an illegal monopoly</a> — and now it will have to change. </p></div><p>Today, Judge James Donato issued his final ruling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23945184/epic-v-google-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-trial-updates">in <em>Epic v. Google</em></a>, ordering Google to effectively open up the Google Play app store to competition for three whole years. Google will have to distribute rival third-party app stores<em> within </em>Google Play, and it must give rival third-party app stores access to the full catalog of Google Play apps, unless developers opt out individually. </p><p>These were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128531/epic-google-proposed-injunction-remedies">Epic’s biggest asks</a>, and they might change the Android app marketplace forever — if they aren’t immediately paused or blocked on appeal. </p><p>And they’re not all that Epic has won today.</p><p>Starting November 1st, 2024, and ending November 1st, 2027, Google must also:</p><div><ul><li>Stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps distributed on the Google Play Store (the jury found that Google had illegally tied its payment system to its app store)</li><li>Let Android developers tell users about other ways to pay from within the Play Store</li><li>Let Android developers link to ways to download their apps outside of the Play Store</li><li>Let Android developers set their own prices for apps irrespective of Play Billing</li></ul></div><p>Google also can’t: </p><div><ul><li>Share app revenue “with any person or entity that distributes Android apps” or plans to launch an app store or app platform</li><li>Offer developers money or perks to launch their apps on the Play Store exclusively or first</li><li>Offer developers money or perks <strong>not</strong> to launch their apps on rival stores</li><li>Offer device makers or carriers money or perks to preinstall the Play Store</li><li>Offer device makers or carriers money or perks <strong>not </strong>to preinstall rival stores</li></ul></div><p>In <em>Epic v. Google</em>,<em> </em>Epic successfully argued that Google had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap">created such a substantial array of deals with developers, carriers, and device makers</a> that it was nigh-impossible for rival stores to spring up. By blocking those sorts of deals, and proactively helping rival app stores, it’s possible some real competition to Google’s monopoly could now arrive.</p><p>Google will still have some control over safety and security as it opens up the Google Play Store to rival stores. The injunction says that Google can “take reasonable measures” that are “strictly necessary and narrowly tailored” and are “comparable” to how it currently polices the Google Play Store. Google will be able to charge a fee for that policing, too. Epic has repeatedly argued that Google should not be able to deter third-party app stores through policing, so it’s likely Epic and Google will keep butting heads over this.</p><p>Judge Donato is giving Google eight months from now to come up with a system, with a three-person technical committee jointly chosen by Epic and Google reviewing any disputes. That system will also come with a way for developers to opt out of being listed in rival Android app stores.</p><p>Epic didn’t quite get everything it asked for: it wanted the judge to crack open Google Play for six years, not three; allow users to sideload apps with a single tap; and for Google to stop being able to tie Android APIs to Google Play. </p><p>Why not six years? “The provisions are designed to level the playing field for the entry and growth of rivals, without burdening Google excessively,” writes Donato in his order. “As competition comes into play and the network effects that Google Play unfairly enjoys are abated, Google should not be unduly constrained as a competitor.”</p><p>Yet Amazon, of all companies, convinced Judge Donato that Google’s rivals need a helping hand. “Even a corporate behemoth like Amazon could not compete with the Google Play Store due to network effects,” writes Donato, citing a key piece of evidence from the trial: an internal Google presentation that suggested Amazon would struggle with the chicken-and-egg problem of attracting both users and apps. To date, the Amazon Appstore has not become a substantial competitor.</p><p>But with access to the Google Play catalog of apps, Donato argues, rival app stores will now have “a fighting chance of getting off the ground”.</p><p>Epic Games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal">originally sued Google</a> on August 13th, 2020 — the very same day it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief">sued Apple, too</a>. The game developer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments">sprung a premeditated trap</a> on both tech giants by attempting to bypass their 30 percent fee on in-app purchases with a surprise update to its mega-popular game <em>Fortnite. </em>Both tech companies retaliated by kicking <em>Fortnite</em> off their app stores, only to be met by a coordinated #FreeFortnite action campaign and a pair of lawsuits accusing each of creating illegal monopolies.</p><p>The Apple case is already over, and Apple mostly won: the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24039983/supreme-court-epic-apple-antitrust-case-rejected">Supreme Court rejected Epic’s final appeal</a> this January. The only thing Epic legally achieved there was an order dismantling Apple’s “anti-steering rules,” theoretically letting developers freely tell their customers how to bypass Apple’s payment systems. (I won’t discuss the Apple case more than this brief outline since I’m&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister/archives/38#:~:text=Ethics%20statement%2C%20June%202023%3A">ethically bound</a>.)</p><p>But the Google case took far longer to kick off, and it went very differently. I spent 15 days reporting live from the courtroom, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap">I saw Epic show time and again</a> that Google was running scared, didn’t treat developers equally, and had something to hide. </p><p>The jury in <em>Epic v. Google</em> was thoroughly convinced: last December, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play">it reached the unanimous verdict</a> that the Google Play app store and Google Play Billing service were an illegal monopoly and that many of the special deals it made with game developers and phone manufacturers were anticompetitive behavior.</p><div><p>“We’re going to tear the barriers down”</p></div><p>In August, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220491/epic-google-android-app-store-monopoly-remedies-hearing">Judge Donato warned</a> that Google would pay for its behavior. “We’re going to tear the barriers down, it’s just the way it’s going to happen,” he said. In remedy hearings, he rejected Google’s suggestions that meeting Epic’s demands would take too much work, cost too much money, or were impossible to arrange without taking substantial time.</p><p>It’s not yet clear whether Google will have to immediately follow the court’s demands, even though the permanent injunction will take effect November 1st. Google already promised to appeal the verdict, and it’s now apparently looking for an immediate stay — Google says it will ask to “<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/">pause Epic’s requested changes” in this new blog post today</a>. </p><p>Like Apple, Google now hopes the appeals court will press pause on Judge Donato’s order while it tries its luck again. Apple spent years <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23826043/epic-apple-app-store-supreme-court-petition">delaying the anti-steering rules change</a> with its legal appeals.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/9/30/24256395/epic-sues-google-samsung-antitrust-auto-blocker">Epic filed a second lawsuit against Google (and Samsung)</a> one week ago, arguing the companies were already attempting to sidestep this upcoming injunction by adding additional friction for third-party app stores. Since that case is now officially related to this one, Judge Donato will be hearing it as well.</p><p>Epic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the <em>Persona</em>-like fantasy game out this week has the benefit of building on the past work the team has done for the series, creating those menus is still a very involved process. </p><p>“In general, the way most game developers make UI is very simple,” Hashino said. “That’s what we try to do as well—we try to keep things simple, practical, and usable. But maybe the reason that we’ve achieved both [functionality and beauty] is that we have unique designs that we make for each and every menu. This is actually really annoying to do.”</p><p> Hashino said there are separate programs running for each of the game’s menus, presumably to help with keeping the interface snappy and the action moving. “Whether it’s the shop menu or the main menu, when you open them up there’s a whole separate program running and a separate design that goes into making it,” he explained. “It takes a lot of time.”</p><p>Maybe that’s why so few other games take UI from merely being elegant and functional to being a spectacle in and of itself. Flashy menus can also present new problems, like being really hard to read. Apparently that was an issue with <em>Persona 5 </em>until the team did a lot of iteration and refinement on the angular black, red, and white text boxes. In my opinion at least, it was totally worth it. </p><p>  <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>is out October 11 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and it’s already getting positive reviews, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-review-pc-ps5-xbox-persona-atlus-1851665876?_gl=1*bqseqw*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyODMyNTcyNi4xMzguMS4xNzI4MzI2MTk2LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-review-pc-ps5-xbox-persona-atlus-1851665876?_gl=1*bqseqw*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyODMyNTcyNi4xMzguMS4xNzI4MzI2MTk2LjYwLjAuMA..">including from<em> Kotaku</em>’s own Kenneth Shepard</a></span>. “<em>Metaphor </em>takes the foundations of Atlus’ beloved life sim RPGs and manages to do and say almost everything it sets out to more eloquently than the games it builds upon,” he wrote. “It’s not flawless like the utopia in [a prominent in-game novel], but it’s a relief to get a game from Atlus that I can recommend without the same caveats I typically have to attach to <em>Persona </em>games, which gives me hope for the company’s future projects, both in and out of this new, rich world it’s created.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Developer 4J Studios has shared the first gameplay trailer of Reforj, an open-world sandbox being developed by the Minecraft co-developer. The people in charge of porting Minecraft to consoles, as well as content packs are now working on their own iteration of the genre, presenting a voxel-crafted world to build, explore, and survive within.</p><p>The gameplay might seem familiar at first glance if you're a Minecraft fan, but there are some subtleties that are already teasing some different novelties. The character has the ability to glide, both outside and inside dungeons, making for a more fast-paced way of traversal. There are first and third-person cameras for gliding, too.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DQVVG7DoTM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9DQVVG7DoTM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The usual resource-gathering actions present some novelty, too. The gameplay showcases being able to manipulate objects and their shapes at a distance while building. You can pick up items quite quickly by destroying an entire tree just by destroying one block near the root, as well as taking down three blocks simultaneously in one go. Crucially, there aren't any specific tools on display while doing these tasks.</p><p>4J Studios formally announced Reforj back in <a href="https://x.com/4JStudios/status/1833899148644659443" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">September</a> for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5. The engine powering the game, called Elements Engine, was first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wa7rTm56bw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown</a> back on May 22. According to an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-minecraft-studio-and-minecraft-youtuber-looking-to-transform-sandbox-gaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, the team has around 50 employees, and not all of them are working on the game yet. Among them is Joseph Garrett, known as a Minecraft YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/stampylonghead" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stampy</a>.</p><p>While Reforj is still in its early days, 4J Studios is adamant on clarifying that the intention isn't to make Minecraft 2. "Everyone has to have a frame of reference," 4J founder and chairman Chris van der Kuyl told GI.Biz. "But it will be a very different gameplay experience, That doesn't mean they will still play the games they play and love every day. They will. That's something we revel in. We still have a marketplace in Minecraft. This is just something brand new for people who love the genre, and we don't think they've had anything new for quite a long time."</p>

			<p>Detroit: Become Human was a game created by Quantic Dream that took the world by storm. This game was released in 2018 and covered some political topics under the guise of a robot vs. humanity-type storyline, which seemed to be a very thinly veiled allegory for real-life issues. Over the years, Quantic Dream has made some very well-known games, such as Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. However, this is most likely the most popular game they've made, boasting beautiful graphics and a star-studded cast. Today, Guillaume de Fondumiere, the CEO of Quantic Dream, <a href="https://x.com/GdeFondaumiere/status/1843335782947532811?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1843335782947532811%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on X</a> that Detroit: Become Human has officially hit 10 million units sold on PlayStation <a href="https://wccftech.com/detroit-become-human-sold-over-3-2-million-on-ps4-will-soon-launch-on-pc/">and PC</a>.</p>
<p>Detroit: Become Human was a huge hit for Quantic Dream, with the game originally releasing as a PlayStation exclusive before the game was ported over to PC in 2019, providing the title with even more success.</p>
<p>The game is available via PlayStation 4 and PC, with the ability to play it via PlayStation 5 due to backward compatibility with the disc as well as being able to purchase it from the PlayStation Store. Some are hoping that with the success of Detroit: Become Human, the game will receive a PS5 Pro update, which could do wonders to make the graphics even better. They were never bad to begin with, but they could give the game a whole new level of polish with the use of the new technology on the upcoming PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>With Detroit: Become Human being so popular and overall having an open-ended conclusion, players are hoping that this will lead to a sequel. There are plenty of ways the story can go depending on who lived and who died in your playthrough, with the game having plenty of replayability and opportunities to do 'good' and 'evil' endings. It's possible that there would be some form of a sequel to this game, but considering how much it relies on the choices you make throughout the title. Although it's predominantly open-ended, it seems that it would be unlikely that a sequel could be made, especially if you are someone who kills off all of the main cast. Much like Alien: Isolation receiving an announcement today about a sequel, it's possible that Detroit: Become Human will get one in the future. No one can say for certain right now, though.</p>
<p>Currently, Quantic Dream are working on Star Wars Eclipse, but there are no new details about this title, what platforms it will be on or any form of development details.</p>

But while most dungeons and boss fights are a breeze as long as you've been keeping your collection of Echoes up to date, there's one ultra-challenging roadblock that more and more players are reporting is stumping them. No, it's not a super-hard enemy...it's a horse race.</p><p>Over the last week, player after player has posted on the Echoes of Wisdom and Zelda subreddits complaining about the game's horse races, and specifically the "short race" in particular. The short race, which Zelda can enter once she passes a point in the game where she gets her own horse (as opposed to a rental) is supposed to be simple. Ride the horse around a circular track exactly one time, and do it in under 17 seconds. Basic stuff.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But for some reason, this particular horse race is a nightmare to do in that amount of time. The track is littered with crates (which Zelda's horse can jump) and trees (which it cannot jump) to trip you up, making it hard to gain and maintain speed. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/echoesofwisdom/comments/1fxjds1/this_minigame_is_the_bane_of_my_existence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Post</a> after <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/echoesofwisdom/comments/1fx6z3a/there_is_always_this_one_mini_game_in_a_zelda_game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> has appeared with players finishing the race in just over 17 seconds or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/echoesofwisdom/comments/1fwptdq/u_gotta_be_kidding_me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even 17 exactly</a>...but needing under 17 to win. Even players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/echoesofwisdom/comments/1foatlp/help_with_a_certain_mini_game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who have passed the other horse races with flying colors</a> are struggling with the short race.</p><p>Fortunately, some players are finding creative solutions. One player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/echoesofwisdom/comments/1fxqor5/another_trick_for_the_short_race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a clip</a> of Zelda using Echoes of lava rocks to build little staircases allowing the horse to jump over the tree obstacles, meaning they could get past them without swerving and losing speed. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/echoesofwisdom/comments/1fxo2so/for_those_struggling_hope_this_helps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another popular tactic</a> was even simpler: just use Tri to move the trees out of the way as you ride past, avoiding them entirely. That method in particular is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1fxxl9p/eow_i_was_about_ready_to_shove_her_carrot_in_an/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saving other players already</a>:</p><p>If you need more tips to beat the horse races yourself, we've got a <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/Horse_Race_Guide:_How_to_Win,_Tips,_and_Rewards">guide to all horse races in Echoes of Wisdom right here</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Treyarch's Black Ops campaigns are known for having storylines that stray from reality and get a bit weird, and the latest marketing trailer shows <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> will likely continue the tradition this year.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Black Ops 6 trailer showcases in-game footage and cinematics from the upcoming campaign. The action featured looks very much like the expected over-the-top Call of Duty experience, but you can blink and almost miss one of the most interesting moments revealed.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Global Launch Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The trailer includes a brief POV of a character falling from the sky, who watches broken bits of land and flying palm trees circle above them. The scene looks like some kind of impossible storm, and it's quite possibly part of some twisty, mind-bending moment of the story.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, we know that the narrative takes place years after the events of Black Ops Cold War, with the Black Ops 6 campaign set in the 1990s during the Gulf War. The trailer footage also showcases political leaders like Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and Saddam Hussein, and it includes familiar Call of Duty faces with Frank Woods and Russell Adler both present. More details about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/">Black Ops 6 campaign can be found here</a>, which also includes multiplayer and Zombies announcements.</p><p dir="ltr">Marketing for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is ramping up as the game launches worldwide on October 25 across Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. A leak from <a href="https://x.com/ForwardLeaksAlt/status/1842888780354666883" rel="nofollow ">ForwardLeaks</a> also suggests that Call of Duty is teaming up with Little Caesars for an upcoming promotion that offers pizza-themed Black Ops 6 rewards, including an operator skin, calling card, and XP tokens.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision hasn't confirmed this potential promotion yet, but <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1843329258359492713" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Treyarch did confirm</a> that a "wealth of information" regarding Black Ops 6 will arrive in these upcoming weeks leading to the game's launch.</p>
