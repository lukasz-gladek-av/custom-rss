		<p>Amongst the amazing titles we’ve seen during the Day of the Devs stream, Battle Vision Network stands out as one to watch. It’s coming from Capybara Games, one of the best indie developers out there, creators of the iconic Might and Magic: Clash of Heroes and their most recent, and undeniably fantastic, offering, Grindstone. If you’re a fan of their previous works, it looks like Battle Vision Network is going to be right up your tactical, strategic, and characterful street.</p>



<p>Battle Vision Network is an online PvP Puzzle Battler fusing cozy color-matching puzzle gameplay with deep turn-based tactics. If you’ve played Might and Magic: Clash of Heroes this might sound familiar, and there’s definitely a real taste of that classic gameplay here. Set in a futuristic arena, where players set out to be the best in the galaxy while showcasing their amazing tactical skills,</p>
<p>Going head to head with other players looks like it’s going to be seriously compelling, and I can’t wait to pit my brain against those of my space-faring rivals. As a Netflix game, it’s coming to both mobile and PC, meaning you can get your strategic fix (nearly) wherever you game. If it’s anything like Grindstone, I can see myself spending a lot of time attached to my iPad in the search for galactic superiority.</p>


<p>Battle Vision Network is all set to be a live service game, so it will continue to be updated with new seasonal twists, fresh characters, ranking leaderboards and ongoing challenges. It looks as though it’ll be a game you can keep returning to day in, and day out, but the tactical gameplay that lies at the centre of it all will have to keep you coming back. With Capybara Games at the helm there’s every chance that it can, and will, do.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24171651/day-of-the-devs-showcase-summer-game-fest-2024-best<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The <a href="https://www.dayofthedevs.com/">Day of the Devs</a> showcase hosted by iam8bit is, to me, far more exciting than the main Summer Game Fest presentation. While it is fun to get hyped for the big releases, Day of the Devs represents something more concrete. The games featured get their own mini-spotlights with developer commentary and gameplay videos. It gives viewers a clearer picture of what these games are about, especially compared to the seconds-long (and <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-summer-games-fest-trailers-can-cost-devs-up-to-550k">apparently exorbitantly expensive</a>) sizzle reels or teaser trailers shown during the Keigh-3 keynote. My only problem, though, is that there are <em>a lot</em> of games to get excited about, making it hard to narrow it down to the 10 best.</p><p><h3><em>Cairn</em></h3></p><p>Rock climbing isn’t my thing. In fact, it looks terrifying, and that terror is what makes <em>Cairn </em>look so interesting. In <em>Cairn</em>, you must reach the summit of Mount Kami one piton at a time. You can climb anywhere, but just like in real mountain climbing, you’ll often face sheer walls and unpassable overhangs that force you to find another way up. One of the things I was immediately drawn to was the way the character’s legs shake as they climb, giving the game an air of urgency and danger that I want to experience for myself.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1376200%2FKARMA_The_Dark_World%2F"><em>Karma: The Dark World</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Karma: The Dark World</em> is a disturbing-looking game from Pollard Studio. It’s a psychological horror game in which you must investigate the mysteries of the dystopian real world and uncover truths in the gross, wet, and slimy world of people’s minds. It looks freaky in that <em>Silent Hill</em> kind of way, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say the horror hottie looking in the mirror is one of the things that really piqued my interest.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1147860%2FUFO_50%2F"><em>UFO50</em></a></h3></p><p>Getting introduced to quirky lil’ games is one of my favorite things about Day of the Devs. Last time, it was <em>Time Flies</em>; this time, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/7/16107594/ufo-50-retro-game-collection-spelunk-downwell">it’s <em>UFO50</em></a>. I love the premise of this game — you play through an assortment of 50 games to see the evolution of a fictional video game developer throughout the 1980s. Each game is complete and unique, and you’ll be able to see graphical and technical improvements in the games as the decade wears on.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1626620%2FKoira%2F"><em>Koira</em></a></h3></p><p>With cats overtaking the cute animal video game meta, I’m glad for games like <em>Koira</em> that reassert the supremacy of man’s best friend. I also love how <em>Koira </em>uses music and sound to communicate instead of dialogue or text.</p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2596420%2FArranger_A_RolePuzzling_Adventure%2F"><em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em></a></h3></p><p>Can’t have a best-of list without at least one puzzle game. In <em>Arranger</em>, you... well, <em>rearrange </em>tiles to get around the world with every row and column moving when you do. Shuffle your environment around to bring a key to a locked door or get around a barrier by using the end of a row to warp around to the beginning. The game reminds me of <em>Carto</em>, another puzzle game that I loved, which is apt considering one of the developers on that game is working on <em>Arranger</em>. </p><div><p><cite>Image: Crescent Moon Games; Those Dang Games</cite></p></div><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2805070%2FScreenbound%2F"><em>Screenbound</em></a></h3></p><p><em>Screenbound</em> is one of those games where you look at a short clip and immediately <em>get it. </em>It’s a platforming game in which you use a 2D gaming handheld to navigate a 3D space. Defeat enemies in the 3D world that you can only see on the 2D handheld and use objects from the 3D world to solve 2D platforming puzzles. </p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2458560%2FZoochosis%2F"><em>Zoochosis</em></a></h3></p><p>In <em>Zoochosis</em>, you’re a rookie zookeeper tasked with taking care of all of the animals.

Fix something like a messy stack of books the simple way by putting them back on the shelves or go for one of the less obvious solutions by arranging them via color or alphabetically. </p><p><h3><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2449160%2FWhile_Waiting%2F"><em>While Waiting</em></a></h3></p><p><em>While Waiting</em> is another one of those games where I’m immediately charmed by the premise.

Capcom's series about big beasts and the clothes you can skin/steal from them continues in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which looked as great as ever in its newest trailer from tonight's Summer Game Fest show. We get new peeks at some lovely dunes, reptile-chicken mounts and bulky weapons. Oh, and some monsters ripe for huntin', presumably.

<p>
I've plopped Monster Hunter Wilds' second proper trailer above for you, dear reader. I haven't jumped into Monster Hunter in years, but those cutscenes are certainly more lavish and involved than I remember the series caring for.
</p>
<p>
The dunes above are, I'm guessing, the same Windward Plains area that housed the "sandy deserts, swaying grasslands, and twisting rock formations" seen in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-trailer-shows-off-horrible-lions-and-mounted-monster-bashing">last week's trailer</a>, only this time with a hell of a lot more scaly sandworms called glops chasing our party. It's a bad sign that I saw the glops and immediately dreamed about the leathery pants I could craft with their skin, right?
</p>
<p>
There are also fresh looks at the cursed lion Doshaguma and the new mount Seikret, which lets you gather materials and sharpen weapons while still on its back, helpfully cutting back on the tedium of dismounting. I'm particularly in love with how the creatures interact with the environment this time, from the way glops dig through the dunes to the spontaneous sinking sand holes they create.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds is said to bring back fourteen returning weapons while introducing a new Focus Mode to grant "more precise control" over how we guard against, aim at, and kill the poor dinosaurs on display. I almost feel bad, but I just can't... resist... the lizard pants... set to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">Steam</a> sometime in 2025.

            <p>Enough moons ago to qualify as quite a lot of moons but not so much for me to categorise them as ‘many’, Alice Bee <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/1997-simpsons-joke-about-kevin-costners-waterworld-now-an-elaborate-freeware-game">wrote</a> about an Itch game called Kevin Costner’s Waterworld - a fully playable extrapolation of a Simpsons’ joke from three decades ago. Simpsons jokes from three decades making up most of my sense of humour, I of course thought it was brilliant. And yet, I couldn’t shake a singular, burning question: What if this, but not joke? Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tides-of-tomorrow">Tides Of Tomorrow</a>. Ok, so I actually don't know if it has anything in common with Waterworld aside from having lots of water everywhere. Still, I'll never pass up an opportunity for a crispy Simpsons reference.</p>

<p>Tides Of Tomorrow is from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/road-96">Road 96</a> developers Digixart. It’s a first person joint, and a lot of the action looks to take place in a floating crime-berg called Pleasureland. At the start of the trailer, the protagonist huffs a canister of gas, which might be responsible for the rainbow-hued spirits they see flickering around the place as they progress.</p>

<p>You soon get put in a big sack and dragged in front of a large crime man. This is to answer for your crimes, which apparently interfered with his crimes. Behind him, you see more of the spectral figures, this time with some button prompts - which suggests to me that some sort of time fudgery might be involved. One of the time ghosts pops a knife in front you, which then becomes real, letting you grab it. This is all still a cutscene, mind. As nice as Tides Of Tomorrow looks, it’s the Day Of The Devs announcement that struck me as having picked up the most bad habits from AAA. Very flashy, but very little information on how the thing actually plays. I'm not even sure what genre it is, honestly. Is 'water' a genre? Water is important. Maybe it should be a genre?</p>
<p>We do at least know they’ll be some sort of choice system. Here, it’s the winning conundrum “kill dude with knife” or “do not do that”. I don’t care all that much about this, but a few seconds later, we’re shown the protagonist getting to speed about a bright blue ocean on a little boat, which I do care about. Fast boats are neat, providing they offer more freedom than just that to stab or not stab dudes. If I sound vaguely cynical, it's because I sort of am, but only because I think this game probably deserved a better presentation. Either way, it should be available to wishlist on Steam right this moment.</p>

			<p>This year’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> show may not have had as many big reveals as some past iterations (although there was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-annonounced-release-date-pc-ps5-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notable reveal</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vii-announced-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two</a>) but the show did culminate in a pretty impressive trailer for the upcoming PS5 console exclusive <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/phantom-blade-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phantom Blade Zero</a>. The trailer features some eye-popping Unreal Engine 5 visuals, big, bad bosses, and some downright-frantic action – the swords are flying fast and furious in the one. Check the Phantom Blade Zero trailer for yourself, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Blade Zero - &quot;The Blade is Drawn&quot; Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b68WE-eZ-Cc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking pretty damn good, if a bit familiar in terms of style. Need to know more about Phantom Blade Zero? Do check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-qa-dev-says-bosses-are-the-games-highlights-confirms-hardware-ray-tracing-ps5-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech’s interview with the game’s developers from last year</a>, and the following official description…</p>
<p><em>“In Phantom Blade Zero, you play as Soul, an elite assassin serving an elusive but powerful organization known simply as “The Order.” Soul is framed for the murder of The Order’s patriarch, gravely injured in the ensuing manhunt, and, though his life is saved by a mystic healer, the makeshift cure will only last for 66 days. Now, he must fight against powerful foes and inhuman monstrosities, all while seeking out the mastermind behind it all before his time runs out.</em></p>
<p><em>From Louis Cha’s Wuxia stories and Bruce Lee’s films to Michelle Yeoh in Everything Everywhere All at Once and Donnie Yen in John Wick: Chapter 4, Phantom Blade Zero draws on a wide range of martial arts icons, but with a twist of its own. What we call “Kung-Fu Punk” instills a heavy dose of punk spirit and our unique visual aesthetic.</em></p>
<p><em>Phantom Blade Zero unfolds in a semi-open world, consisting of multiple large maps filled with diverse, handcrafted activities. This world of Phantom Blade Zero is bleak and punishing, a constant reminder to never let your guard down. Seeking out the game’s many challenges and power foes will reward you with weapons, armor, artifacts, skills, and other ways to customize or progress your character.”</em></p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero is coming to PC and PS5. A release window has yet to be specified. Opportunities to go hands-on with the game will available at various venues this summer, including Gamescom.</p>

We expect preorders will open at more online retailers soon. Though the Xbox disc will grant access to both the Series X and Xbox One versions of the game, on the PlayStation side it seems only the PS5 version is available in physical format. The preorder bonus image above does not show a PS4 case, and Best Buy does not have a listing for PS4. It would appear PS4 owners will need to opt for the digital edition, which also includes the PS5 version, should you choose to upgrade to new hardware in the future.</p></div>

            <p>The main showcase at Summer Game Fest is a nonstop barrage of huge trailers for massive games, but despite its two-hour runtime, there are plenty of upcoming games it doesn't have time to feature. Luckily, the Day of the Devs showcase, which aired immediately after, is around to shine a spotlight on a promising batch of incoming indies. From new reveals like Battle Vision Network to the release date reveal of the long-awaited UFO50, here's everything featured in today's showcase in order of appearance.</p>

<p data-characters="239" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s summertime, and the game showcases are out in full force. Geoff Keighley’s SGF kick-off show aired earlier, but following it, we also got another look at some exciting indies thanks to the 2024 Day of the Devs SGF Edition.</p> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">Put on by several companies in games to spotlight up-and-coming independent developers, Day of the Devs has traditionally been a showcase full of fresh and vibrant ideas in the space. This year’s SGF Day of the Devs was no different; in fact, I’d venture to say this is one of the better ones in recent memory.</p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="471" data-injectable="true">From competitive match-3 puzzling to horror, mountains, and more, there is a <em>lot </em>here. Here’s all you need to know from today’s showcase.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Day of the Devs</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">First up is <strong><em>Battle Vision Network</em></strong> from Capybara Games a1v1 puzzle battler that might look familiar to <em>Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes </em>fans. Capybara made that game, and now they’re doing their own original take on the formula, with an evolving narrative to spur on the scrapping. It’s aiming for PC and console in 2025, and is made in partnership with Netflix.</p>
 <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">The Game Bakers, makers of <em>Furi </em>and <em>Haven</em>, are here with another entry in their “freedom trilogy.” Revealed during Keighley’s showcase, <em><strong>Cairn </strong></em>is a game about climbing a mountain no one’s summited. It’s got some <em>Jusant </em>vibes, but given their past work, I expect Game Bakers’ <em>Cairn </em>to be emotional, beautiful, and one to watch.</p> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true"><strong><em>Petal Runner</em></strong> from Nano Park Studios and iam8bitpresents is a retro-flavored slice-of-life RPG where you play a motorbike courier delivering flower-powered digital pets. Complete minigames, venture around, and uncover the mystery behind these cute lil’ pets. It’s got <em>Pokémon </em>vibes for sure.</p>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false"><strong><em>Karma: The Dark World</em></strong> from Pollard Studio, based in Shanghai, China, looks super scary. Dive into people’s minds to uncover the truth behind events, while keeping “the company is above all else.” Or at least, until you learn a little more about what the company has in store for you.</p> <figure data-current-count="589" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Day of the Devs</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Ever feel nostalgia for something that doesn’t exist? <strong><em>UFO 50 </em></strong>from Mossmouth is that: 50 games in a collection, from a non-existent retro system spanning the ’80s and into the ’90s. A loose framework connects them all, but Mossmouth and its collaborators are advertising quite the variety of experiences, including some local multiplayer in both co-op and versus. Look for it September 18 on Steam.</p>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">The grove gets a little ghost-y with <strong><em>Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</em></strong> from Spry Fox. It’s a chill camping life game, where you craft, gather, build hearts, upgrade, etc., for phones through Netflix. And that does mean no extra fees, no ads or in-app purchases. Just chill vibes and spirits.</p> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true"><strong><em>Koira </em></strong>from Studio Tolima, published by Dontnod, is a stylistic isometric adventure game. You have a dog pal who helps you out, and you can play music as well. I love the hand-drawn art and frame-by-frame animation, plus a sweet soundtrack. Seems neat! A demo is on the way.</p>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Ever move things around in your mind? Move a little different? <em><strong>Arranger</strong></em> from Furniture and Mattress has a hero who does just that, navigating the world by shifting rows and columns. The team has the <em>Braid</em> artist and <em>Carto</em> writer on board, so the presentation is bound to be top-notch too. <em>Arranger </em>arrives on July 25 for PS5, Switch, Netflix, and PC.</p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">Following the big Blumhouse Games lineup reveal at the Summer Game Fest stream, Cozy Game Pals is showing off <em><strong>Fear the Spotlight</strong></em>, which gives me some <em>Life is Strange</em> meets lo-fi horror vibes. Solve puzzles, avoid scary monsters, and maybe figure out why your friend is acting so strange.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Day of the Devs</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">You might recognize Crescent Moon Games and Those Dang Games’ <strong><em>Screenbound: A Game</em></strong> by its main concept alone: you walk around in 3D while holding a Game Boy game, which also displays enemies and objects in 2D. This looks so cool! The way the 2D and 3D environments link up is fascinating. I’m very excited to see more of this.</p>
 <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false"><strong><em>Zoochosis </em></strong>from Clapperheads<strong><em> </em></strong>gives me new scares I didn’t know I could have. A giraffe just turns into a spider monster. Kangaroos with giant mouth-bellies. And you’re their zookeeper, learning the ropes from a strange senior. Seems frightening!</p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true"><strong><em>While Waiting </em></strong>from Optillusion Games is about what happens while you’re waiting. That’s it. Everything in life has some waiting, and you’re about to experience all the ways in which waiting happens. It’s a really unique concept that seems simple but expands fast.</p>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false"><strong><em>Tom the Postgirl</em></strong> from Oopsie Daisies Studio is a different kind of creepy. Play as a postgirl delivering mail who can’t resist peeking on people during her route. Then, discover things about the locals who all seem creepy as heck. There are some wild sights, but also a cowboy worm!</p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true">Rocket Adrift’s <strong><em>Psychorama </em></strong>is a cyberpunk horror point-and-click adventure. You’ve got amnesia and have to deal with a loose sense of self, while also handling the tech around you. The devs plan on exploring ideas of identity through a character that is both biracial and non-binary, a really interesting viewpoint for this tale.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Day of the Devs</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true">Not to hand out awards, but <strong><em>Building Relationships</em></strong> from Tan Ant Games is a fantastic trailer. You play as a house, meeting other houses. You can dash, fish, and hang out with other buildings. You can even fish for cars. And there are some <em>light </em>dating elements. It’s like <em>A Short Hike</em>, but for houses.</p>
 <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="226" data-injectable="false"><em>A Little to the Left</em> is getting some DLC in <strong><em>Seeing Stars</em></strong>. 33 new levels and five additional bonus levels, with 100 stars to discover. There are interactive items that can unfold or unravel. Also, more cats! It arrives June 25.</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">Soup Island is making the world’s coziest time loop in <strong><em>Hello Again</em></strong>. A postal worker, you, is designated to deliver a package to a remote island. Only, you get caught in a time loop. What do you do next? Explore, discover, and try to figure out what’s going on.</p>
 <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true"><strong><em>After Love EP</em></strong> from Pikselnesia is a really neat game with a sad story behind it. The game’s story follows a musician who hears the voice of his girlfriend after she’s passed. And the studio, Pikselnesia, is developing the game after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/coffee-talk-creator-mohammad-fahmi-afterlove-what-comes-1848716627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">death of its creator</a>, <em>Coffe Talk</em>‘s Mohammad Fahmi. It seems like heavy stuff, but it’s really something beautiful to see this vision realized, and coming together so well too. <em>After Love EP </em>is aiming for a Q3 window, and there’s a demo out now.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Day of the Devs</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="788" data-injectable="true">For another game that won me over in a single trailer, here’s <strong><em>Phoenix Springs</em></strong> from Calligram Studio. You’re a reporter searching for her brother, eventually leading to Phoenix Springs. It’s a “modern” point-and-click game with a striking art style, and no objects in your inventory. Instead, you have thoughts, concepts, and ideas, and you use them to progress. It’s been in development for seven years, and now it’s aiming for September 16 on Steam.</p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false"><em>Road 96</em> studio Digix Art is here with <em><strong>Tides of Tomorrow</strong></em>. The super trippy art style and direction leads into what looks like a time loop, where you can set things up for others. Potentially you, or maybe for others? Is this a strand game? I’m not sure, but I’m definitely curious.</p> <hr data-injectable="false"> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="false">That’s all for today’s showcase, but as always, follow and wishlist the games you dig from this stream! Even just a little support can go a long way, and this showcase was stuffed with neat indie projects that deserve your attention.</p>

            <p>
Palworld will receive a major Sakurajima update later this month, adding a new island, dedicated Xbox servers, and more.
</p>
<p>
As announced at tonight's Summer Game Fest, the island has a distinct Japanese feel complete with cherry blossom trees and torii gates. Of course, a new island also means new pals: a purple-clawed creature, a cute walking treasure chest, a ghostly apparition, and a twirling armoured knight.
</p>
<p>
Xbox players will be pleased to know the update will also add dedicated servers, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-xbox-and-steam-parity-at-the-mercy-of-certification-developer-says">issues at launch</a> when compared to the Steam version.

<p>
The update will also add new buildings and level cap, new subspecies, a new raid, a new oil rig stronghold, and a new faction with boss. 
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the arena mode will be added, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-best-of-the-triple-i-showcase">previously teased at the Triple-i showcase</a>. It looks a bit like Pokémon Stadium. 
</p>
<p>All of this will arrive on 27th June.</p>
<p>
Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-to-announce-long-awaited-features-next-month">Pocketpair stated last month</a> that long-awaited features would be arriving in the game in June, with the announcement at Summer Game Fest highly-anticipated by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-reaches-25m-players-in-first-month">millions of Palworld players</a>.
</p>
<p>
The update follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-pals-coming-to-palworld-include-a-frog-with-a-stick-and-a-mushroom-head">reveal of four Pals arriving this summer</a>, including a cute frog with a stick and a mushroom-headed little guy.

            <p>
Before we get to the latest trailer for S-Game's soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phantom-blade-zero">Phantom Blade Zero</a> I have a couple of complaints to lodge about the title. Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it's out to eat Sekiro's lunch.

<p>
To phrase things in more clinical terms, Phantom Blade Zero is a "semi open-world" action-RPG with artifacts to find, skills to unlock and a broody, feudal-yet-mechanical "kungfupunk" setting. It's a spiritual follow-up of sorts to the developer's 2010 turn-based RPG Rainblood for mobile. 
</p>
<p>
Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/phantom-blade-zero-is-a-kung-fu-punk-soulslike-with-surprising-mobile-origins">liked the cut of last year's announcement trailer</a>, but was a shade ambivalent about the shortage of in-game footage. The new trailer seeks to lay Ed's fears to rest with a montage of combos, parries, stealthy executions and bosses with names such as Commander Cleave. There's at least one highly Soulsy ambush in which the player has to dodge an exploding bear hug, and a Jade Dancer who reminds me of any number of very annoying, Malenia-adjacent high agility bosses. But this is being framed as more of a power fantasy than Souls - the trailer shows you staggering larger opponents with relative ease and hurling projectiles back to sender like something out of God Of War.
</p>
<p>
I'll be seeing a new 30 minute demo of Phantom Blade Zero up close at Summer Game Fest over the weekend. I have reasonably high hopes for it, though I must acknowledge the eternally ominous presence of QTEs in the footage above. Do you have any thoughts I can steal and turn into interview questions?

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars: Hunters Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-hunters-review-in-progress.893919/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>What matters most to any given shooter can vary wildly. Sometimes it’s the hardcore tactical play of games like Hell Let Loose, or the careful competitive balance in options like Counter-Strike. Other times it’s the rich world and lovable characters that help <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-review">Overwatch</a> shine. For Star Wars: Hunters, a free-to-play hero shooter from developer Zynga, its main focus seems to be on having fun in the Star Wars universe. I still have more of it to play before my final review, but so far Star Wars: Hunters is an enjoyable way to pass time with friends, but potentially too shallow to hold my interest for the long haul.</p><p>Star Wars: Hunters doesn’t have the over-the-top destructibility of The Finals, nor the high speed parkour of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-review-2">Apex Legends</a> – it's a much more conventional hero shooter in the vein of Team Fortress 2, where two teams of bespoke characters (in this case called Hunters) participate in pure player-versus-player shootouts. The most notable way it sets itself apart from other shooters is its Star Wars coat of paint, which it puts to good use. Classic Star Wars music is equal parts nostalgic and exciting, while familiar locations like an Ewok Village or Imperial Starship do a great job of placing the action a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, especially when the blasters start flying and the Wookies start howling.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Star Wars: Hunters Characters</h3></div></output><p>It feels like the philosophy behind the character designs and writing was “just have fun with it.” For example, one of my favorite heroes is Utooni, who is literally just two Jawa’s in a trenchcoat. Another is J-3DI, a droid simulating the combat style of a Jedi by wielding a lightsaber and using a grappling hook to faux force pull enemies closer. Even the play-by-play announcers contribute to that lighthearted Star Wars vibe – one hilarious bit of commentary talks about the action being sponsored by a new TV series on remembering Alderaan, but makes sure to remind any comedians watching at home that it is always too soon for Alderean jokes. </p><p>There are 13 playable characters at launch, with a good mix of unique personalities and abilities across them. Imara Vex, for instance, is a classic Star Wars bounty hunter with skills that focus on mobility and firepower, while Grozz is a massive club-wielding Wookie that lacks range but has an enormous amount of health. That variety of weapons and powers is effective at making each character unique in how they play, which also makes it fun to swap between them and learn their differences. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Hunters manages to be fun by still having nuance where it counts.</p></div><p>Matches, on the other hand, are pretty simple, coming off a bit straightforward and shallow in the 10 hours I’ve played so far. There are four game types, including a simple team deathmatch option called Squad Battle and a basic point-capture mode called Power Control, and they will all be very familiar to anyone who has played a PvP shooter before. Matches are short, roughly five minutes each, which makes sense since Hunters is only currently available on Nintendo Switch and mobile devices – but that also means they rarely have room for a lot of back and forth swings or come from behind drama. You can still be strategic and do things like hide healers behind tankier units, but there simply isn’t a lot of time for counter-strategies to play out. This is speed checkers, not chess. </p><p>That may sound overly simplistic, but Hunters manages to be a lot of fun by still having nuance where it counts. Each character generally falls into a Tank, Damage, or Support archetype – they are more effective when used in their assigned roles, but anyone can start blasting (or smashing) and knock out some opponents. That strikes a great middle ground of being balanced enough that skilled play will win most fights, but loose enough with abilities and supers that anyone can rack up kills in quick bursts of chaos. </p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Justin's favorite multiplayer shooters</h3><p>Fragging is better with friends, and these are the best games for it.</p></div><p>Because Hunters is free-to-play, as is often the case, it has a mix of free and premium currencies that dictate a lot of the progress you’ll make towards unlockables and vanity items. New characters are unlocked using Crystals, which are earned in small amounts after each match, but you can (of course) expedite the process by buying them outright for real money. In the early going, new Hunters seem to become available at a reasonable clip, but it does slow down each time. I can’t tell quite yet if it slows down <em>too </em>much, but so far I haven’t felt like I’ve been forced into buying anything to succeed. </p><p>Meanwhile, Credits are used on cosmetic items and are exclusively free, earned by playing matches and completing additional challenges. I appreciate the way your list of challenges is constantly being pecked away at in the background, giving me some added incentive to mix up who I played as since many of them focus on dealing damage with specific characters. But it’s too bad there are so few things you can actually buy with Credits – as I write this, of the dozens of items for sale on the front page of the shop, only two can be purchased with Credits as opposed to Crystals, which makes them a bit pointless in practice. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Lastly, there’s Fame, Hunters’ answer to XP. Like Credits, playing matches and checking off challenges adds Fame to a specific character, and every level up brings with it a reward. Some are purely cosmetic, like weapon skins and stickers. Others upgrade skills in small but meaningful ways: When Diago the Sharpshooter hits Fame level 2, for example, the damage to his proximity mines increases. The amount is small enough to not make higher level characters outright overpowered, but still substantial enough that leveling up feels exciting. It seems like a good mix from what I’ve seen, and having a path for each Hunter to climb feels like a solid overall goal to work on for now. </p><p>In the early going, Star Wars: Hunters has been a simple but fun hero shooter. The Star Wars infused presentation is well executed, striking the right over-the-top tone without tipping into obnoxious. The action finds a good balance as well, tight enough for skilled players to rise above the pack, but with room for anyone to have some success without needing to sweat. I don’t know quite yet if the fun will hold up over the long term, particularly as I climb the ranked playlist, and if the currency and character progression is properly tuned is also not clear yet. A final verdict will have to wait until I’ve played more – but for now, I’m looking forward to jumping back in and smashing folks with a rampaging Wookie. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s described as an “enhanced experience” that includes all the content from New World on PC, including the full base game and all past updates such as the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion, as well as new content.</p><p>New features include New World’s first-ever large-scale player vs. player zone, a challenging 10-player raid, end-game solo trials, an upgraded leveling experience, new character archetypes, and a revamped dialogue system. Amazon said players can now experience Aeternum entirely on their own or with other players through competitive and cooperative online cross-platform play.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>New World: Aeternum Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>New World launched in 2021 on Steam and became a rare video game hit for Amazon. The MMO set in an alternate 1600s America saw huge player numbers on Steam, and is currently the eighth most-played game on Valve’s platform all-time with a whopping 913,634 peak concurrents. Player numbers have declined since that peak, however, with Steam concurrents hovering around the 10,000 mark in recent weeks.</p><p>Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>In New World: Aeternum, shipwrecked explorers wash ashore and set out to forge their destiny on the supernatural island of Aeternum, a world filled with danger and opportunity. Combat in New World: Aeternum is skill-based and dynamic, incorporating swords, guns, and magic for a complex and satisfying experience, whether in head-to-head fights against the cursed creatures of Aeternum, or large-scale player vs. player battles. Players can fully customize the look, skills, and abilities of their character, as each gathered plant, tanned hide, slain foe, or completed quest shapes their journey and increases their character’s power and skill. The vibrant world, compelling narrative, rich crafting mechanics, classless character development, and real-time action-combat system in New World: Aeternum can provide hundreds of hours of play for solo and multiplayer adventurers alike.</blockquote><p>Amazon insisted New World: Aeternum “has been specifically designed for consoles” with complete feature parity for PC players. Enhancements include target locking and aim assist, virtual cursor, controller navigation, and accessibility features.</p><p>New World: Aeternum will be available digitally on PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and Steam for $59.99. The Deluxe Edition, available for $79.99, includes a Bear mount and armor skin. PC players who have already bought New World and the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion get access to all that New World: Aeternum offers on PC at no extra cost, starting at launch on October 15.</p><p>Other upcoming Amazon Games titles include the next major entry in the Tomb Raider series, developed by Crystal Dynamics, and Throne and Liberty, developed by NCSoft. Amazon also signed a deal to publish <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-lands-open-world-driving-game-from-ex-forza-horizon-devs">a new AAA driving game</a> developed by a team led by the former Forza Horizon 5 creative director.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/slitterhead-exclusive-preview-a-combination-of-silent-hill-siren-and-gravity-rush</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/slitterhead-exclusive-preview-a-combination-of-silent-hill-siren-and-gravity-rush.893904/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/slitterhead-exclusive-preview-a-combination-of-silent-hill-siren-and-gravity-rush<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>My time with Slitterhead started with roaming the narrow alleyways of a fictional Asian city as a stray dog. I was instructed to follow red swishes on-screen that visualize a trail of scent to get to the next destination, but I preferred to just look around and savor every detail of this masterfully crafted urban environment.</p><p>Hailing from the creator of the original Silent HiIll, Siren and Gravity Rush games, in many ways Slitterhead feels like a culmination of legendary developer Keiichiro Toyama’s legacy. While going back to Toyama’s horror roots and implementing an Asian setting once again, Slitterhead also succeeds in portraying a city that – while much more grounded – feels just as inspiring as Gravity Rush’s Hekseville. The dirty alleyways of Kowlong are so detailed and realistic that it was easy for me to believe that I was actually wandering through a foreign city, yet so eerie that if a scary creature would suddenly appear I would have totally believed it. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Slitterhead Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Slitterhead is an action adventure game with a horror setting that involves possessing victims as its key gameplay mechanic. Before playing, I was told that the game is focused mainly on action. While indeed most of my playtime involved melee combat, I found Slitterhead’s environments so appealing that I often ended up just aimlessly wandering the city.</p><p>The dreamy Cantonese pop song that plays during the game’s opening scene invited me straight into Slitterhead’s setting, and Cantonese chatter on the streets makes the city feel even more lived in, but it is the attention to the environment’s details that really did it for me. Bright neon sign boards, graffiti, signs and flyers on the wall, dirty air conditioner outlets, laundry hanging on balconies, local eateries serving fried noodles or hotpot, cozy mom-and-pop stores – you name it. Everything I saw made the city feel believable and lived in. It reminded me of walking Tokyo’s famous Shibuya scramble crossing in Ghostwire: Tokyo for the first time. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That said, Slitterhead is not an open world game; it unfolds in stages, with the early stages I played feeling spacious enough to be considered a wide-linear area. Above all, though, the streets of Slitterhead’s city prove that density can be more important than scale when it comes to delivering a believable environment.</p><p>In 2020, Toyama left Sony’s now defunct Japan Studio to become independent, opening Bokeh Game Studio. Now, four years later, Slitterhead is set for release in November as the studio’s first title. As an independent game, Slitterhead may have a smaller budget when compared with Toyama’s previous games, but clever choices have allowed his team to deliver a game that looks impressive nonetheless.</p><p>Similar to Ghostwire: Tokyo, Slitterhead plays out entirely in the nighttime, a great match for the game’s horror setting that simultaneously allowed the team to skip the hassle of also creating daytime environments. While the same craftsmanship as Gravity Rush can be felt when it comes to designing a believable cityscape, Slitterhead is a more focused experience that mostly skips side quests and other arbitrary activities.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One area in which the development team have gone full-on is Slitterhead’s NPCs. The city’s streets are constantly filled with detailed characters that perfectly match the Asian cityscape. A city without people could have worked for a game with a horror setting, but the city’s people play a key role in Slitterhead’s game design.</p><p>After wandering the streets as a stray dog for some time, a tall fence was now blocking my way. However, I could see a person standing on the other side of the fence. At this point, the ability to possess other characters was unlocked, which is Slitterhead’s key mechanic. After moving the camera with the right analog stick to find a target, you can possess a different character with the press of a button. No longer confined to the body of a stray dog, now I was walking the streets as a human inhabitant of the city. </p><p>However, at the next corner a woman who appeared to be a sex worker was standing in front of me. She seemed to be trying to seduce me, but I soon realized something was off. By the time she had transformed into a worm-like monster, it was already too late. Before I could run away, she had knocked me to the ground. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But while in most games that would mean game over, Slitterhead allowed me to find a new target to possess while lying on the ground. I quickly realized that serially possessing far-off targets was a more effective strategy than running with my own feet, and I transferred myself from one body to the next. From a young guy with bleached hair to a middle-aged lady with an off-trend blouse and then a topless pot-bellied man, each of the bodies I possessed on the way became prey for the creature that was hunting me. But as long as my spirit was safe, their individual lives didn’t seem to matter.</p><p>This escape sequence functions as a tutorial for quickly switching from one body to another. Later I would learn that this skill can be applied to both Slitterhead’s combat and exploration.</p><p>During exploration, possessing a fresh body can be used as a way to pass through walls, gates or fences, and also to reach higher places. You could for example possess someone standing on a balcony, transfer to someone walking the corridor of a high-rise apartment building, then switch to someone standing on the roof of a skyscraper. With Slitterhead’s possession mechanic, you’ll be looking down at the bustling city in no time. This vertical exploration again reminded me of Ghostwire: Tokyo, which has you reach the top of Tokyo’s skyscrapers by grappling the claws of flying Tengu demons.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Slitterhead - June 2024 Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Possessing and walking the city as different people is even fun when there’s no real purpose to it. Anyone who has played Watch Dogs: Legion probably remembers how funny it can be to run around as an old lady or any other type of character that normally wouldn’t be the most obvious pick for a playable character in a videogame. Movement and control feels different from character to character, too. I was also surprised that when a cut scene began mid-level, it would show whichever random dude you just happened to be possessing at that point in the game.</p><p>Not every single character walking the streets can be possessed, though. Targets who can be possessed are indicated by a blue light. The amount of characters you can possess is still staggering, though, especially in more crowded areas. Sometimes, it can actually become a bit difficult to choose which character you want to become next. Luckily, while you hold down the possession button, everything slows down, giving you time to choose. While holding down the button, you can leave the body you’re currently possessing and freely move around in first person to look for a new target. This feature not only allows you to choose at ease, but also makes it possible to find targets that were out of sight from where you were standing. It also comes in handy when you have to jump off a skyscraper, giving you time to find a new target to possess before your previous possessed body splats on the ground. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Possessing and walking the city as different people is even fun when there’s no real purpose to it.</p></div><p>As someone who enjoys observing environment details in games, I also found myself using the feature to zoom in on objects, to read the menu of a restaurant, or to take a better look at the Kowlong souvenir T-shirts for sale on a market stall.</p><p>With the necessary tools to observe things from a closer angle, exploring this Asian urban environment became even more rewarding for me. That being said, there’s not really a whole lot to do when it comes to Slitterhead’s exploration. In the beginning of the game, I was tasked to find memories of my spirit that were scattered throughout the city, but there were no side objectives to enjoy along the way. While there are some hidden secrets, Slitterhead has no side quests, no shops that allow you to purchase items and no characters to engage in conversation. Unless simply observing the environment is enough for you, you might find this action adventure game leans more toward action than adventure. I found Slitterhead enjoyable as it is, but its environments are so well crafted that I couldn’t help but hope that Bokeh Game Studio will someday reuse the city to create a game with more adventure elements.</p><p>While horror games traditionally have you shoot at enemies from a distance, Slitterhead incorporates a melee combat system. You can attack, block, dodge and deflect, covering all the standard bases for a modern action game. It has a weapon durability system that reminded me of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, while the heavy emphasis on deflecting is something many games have done since Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Deflecting is made a bit more interesting by demanding the player flick the right analog stick up, down, left or right to match the direction of an incoming attack. This system as well as the UI that indicates the direction of enemy attacks reminded me of Ubisoft’s For Honor. </p><p>For the rest, most of Slitterhead’s combat itself felt pretty standard. There’s not a wide array of attack patterns to choose from, and while it gets the job done, there are plenty of action games that feel smoother.</p><p>Luckily, the possession mechanic brings something unique to Slitterhead’s combat as well. You can freely possess nearby bodies during battle, and choosing when to switch to what body makes battles more strategically interesting. For example, it is probably for the better to quickly transfer to a different body when an enemy is about to unleash a heavy attack or when you’re cornered against a wall. If the body you switch to happens to be just behind your enemy, you can quickly attack from behind. While Slitterhead’s enemy variety and attack patterns might be pretty standard, creating a favorable situation by possessing the right body makes Slitterhead’s battles feel interesting nonetheless.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Switching bodies puts the player in a more advantageous position, but leaving a body unattended in a dangerous situation often means sacrificing it.</p></div><p>Switching bodies puts the player in a more advantageous position, but leaving a body unattended in a dangerous situation often means sacrificing it. This makes switching bodies during battle a high-risk high-return strategy, although it has to be said that continuously swapping bodies almost always felt safer than facing an enemy head-on while trying to evade or deflect its attacks. Possessing bodies during battle does feel a bit chaotic at times, especially in confined spaces. The body you switch to might not be facing the enemy you are fighting, and the camera can get in the way when you switch to a body close to the wall. But even with those inconveniences, the possession mechanic makes Slitterhead’s combat feel more unique.</p><p>Each character you can possess has their own health bar. It is nearly impossible to remember the remaining health of every single body laying around, so sometimes it may happen that you accidentally switch to a character that is almost out of health. If a character you’re not currently controlling is killed, there is no penalty except for the fact that there’s one less body to transfer to. However, if the character you are currently controlling gets killed it’s game over, no matter how many possessable bodies were left. </p><p>During the early sections of the game I played, there were always plenty of bodies to switch to. It seemed that the game expected me to continuously possess new bodies and sacrifice the old ones instead, rather than taking the life of each individual seriously.</p><p>Once you’ve eliminated the enemies in an area, you can regain health by standing on the pool of blood they left behind. But keeping the characters you possess alive isn’t all that important. Slitterhead’s gameplay loop of possessing and mercilessly sacrificing people delivers the message that human lives don’t mean much anyway. When the game design itself tells a creepier story than most horror game narratives, you must be doing something right as a developer. However, from a gameplay standpoint it remains to be seen if the possession mechanic can actually provide enough depth and variety throughout the campaign.</p><p>Skills allow you to heal nearby characters or even summon new bodies to possess, but at least during the beginning of the game I never felt the need to do so. I was instructed to play the game on Easy mode (there are four difficulty modes in total to choose from). I played through the beginning of the game and one other stage without ever being at a serious risk. By exploring, I found a shrine that led me to an optional boss challenge. I was killed once during this challenge, but I managed to overcome it during my second try without much trouble. As long as you keep swapping bodies, it seems that Slitterhead won’t challenge you too much in Easy mode. According to the developers, the other difficulty modes aren’t overly challenging either, as they see Slitterhead as an action adventure game that can be casually enjoyed by a wide array of players. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Slitterhead is a game that masterfully sets the mood.</p></div><p>What makes Slitterhead more interesting as a casual action game is the wide variety of skills and hero characters you get to control. Hero characters are a lot stronger than normal characters, and each has unique movesets and skills. During my time with the game, I got to play as a female character equipped with Wolverine-like claws as well as a character with a kickboxer-like moveset.</p><p>The second stage I got to play was set inside a condominium building. While not quite as exciting as walking around in the city itself, the dim rooms of the building are always moody and atmospheric, decorated with mahjong tables and cigarette packs. I advanced by taking the stairs and elevators while eliminating enemies along the way to ultimately make it to the top floor, where of course a boss was awaiting me. </p><p>At this point I had already mastered the art of switching bodies, so the boss fight itself wasn’t much of a challenge. However, after receiving a certain amount of damage the boss started to flee in a similar vein as prey in Monster Hunter games, over the rooftops of the city. I was now climbing air conditioner outlets and bamboo scaffoldings as I tried to catch the boss hopping from one building to the other. On my way, I transferred to an old man standing on a balcony, and was able to soar above the city by tethering to pools of blood spattered around the scenery and swinging between them like Spider-Man. While not every single moment necessarily felt great to play, it was an enjoyable set piece to take part in. </p><p>If you’re looking for the tightest or smoothest action game available, there are better options. However, just like Siren and Gravity Dash, Slitterhead is a game that masterfully sets the mood. A wide array of different stages and situations will undoubtedly create an unforgettable experience with a unique flavor.</p><p>Slitterhead is set to release on PS5\PS4\Xbox Series X|S/PC (Steam/Epic Games) on November 8, 2024.</p><p><em></em><a href="https://x.com/RineD1987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Esra Krabbe</em></u></a><em> is an editor at IGN Japan.

Its release was expected across those platforms up until today. Black Myth Wukong will now launch on PS5 and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store only on August 20.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In a <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a>, Game Science said it was still optimizing the Xbox version, and apologised to Xbox users.</p><p>"PC and PS5 users can enjoy the full game starting August 20, 2024," Game Science said in its statement. "We are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards, so it won't release simultaneously with the other platforms. We apologize for the delay and aim to minimize the wait for Xbox users.

But the updates can't go on forever: it's time for a new Civ. During today's Summer Game Fest, we got our first look at Civilization 7.</p><p>It'll arrive in 2025 on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC, Mac and Linux via Steam, with a gameplay showcase this August. You can watch the first look below.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Sid Meier's Civilization (@CivGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CivGame/status/1799189056448041236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>"As the seventh mainline title in the franchise, Civilization VII is a 4X strategy game developed by the legendary team at Firaxis Games," reads the game's official synopsis. "Players establish their civilization, construct cities and architectural wonders to expand their territory, conquer or cooperate with rival civilizations in pursuit of prosperity, and explore the far reaches of the unknown world."</p><p>Civilization 7's reveal actually <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-leaks-via-2k-games-website">leaked this morning</a>, when a banner on the 2K website accidentally went live early. Though the leak didn't reveal much beyond the existance of the game itself, it did dispel recent rumors that a planned 2K announcement at SGF would be a Mafia game or Borderlands 4. And we've known a new Civilization game was in the works since February of last year, when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-civilization-game-officially-announced-by-firaxis">Firaxis boss Heather Hazen</a> announced that a then-untitled project was in the works.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/07/image-76-1717795269750-1717796161391.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Civilization 7 has officially been unveiled and will arrive in 2025.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"For more than 30 years, players from around the world have shared their love and support for Civ," said Sid Meier, Founder and Director of Creative Development at Firaxis Games, in a statement today. "I'm incredibly excited for Civ fans to see Civilization VII, a game that represents the culmination of three decades of strategy innovation and refinement."</p><p>“With more than 70 million copies sold-in and over 1 billion hours played, the Civilization franchise is a crown jewel for 2K," added David Ismailer, President of 2K Games. “What the team is looking to accomplish with Civilization VII is nothing short of breathtaking, and we're confident that Firaxis Games has another hit on their hands with Civilization VII."</p><p>We <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/26/sid-meiers-civilization-vi-review">loved Civilization 6 when it came out back in 2016</a>, saying it would "go down in history as the most fully-featured launch version in the series." Though the series has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilizations-past-and-future-as-told-by-its-lead-designers">changed leadership hands</a> a number of times over the years, it remains beloved and successful.

It's coming to Nintendo Switch, PC, and PlayStation 5 at launch this holiday.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>LEGO Horizon Adventures is an action adventure game inspired by the world of Horizon, and designed for two-player, couch co-op play. It appears to be a comedic take on Horizon co-developed by Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo, with Aloy as the star and very loosely following the story of Zero Dawn. </p><p>Aloy still fights cool robot dinosaurs (there's a very shiny looking Thunderjaw fight in the trailer), but it's all a little silly — very LEGO. There also appear to be plenty of unlockable costumes for both Aloy and her co-op companion, and the ability to make a customizable base in Mother's Heart that you can fill with lots of buildings that were...not necessarily available in regular Horizon.
</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>LEGO Horizon Adventures Screens</h3></div></output><p>LEGO Horizon Adventures was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-reportedly-a-new-playstation-game-set-for-reveal-soon">leaked earlier this month</a> by various reports, but with few details. We've previously seen LEGO collaborate with PlayStation and Guerrilla Games for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-lego-tallneck-set-build">actual physical LEGO sets based on the game</a>. And LEGO has made a number of successful video games based on Star Wars, Marvel, and other properties.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nobody-wants-to-die-seems-like-a-stylish-future-noir-detective-adventure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Solve murders in a future where nobody is supposed to die.</h2></div><section><p>With The Wolf Among Us 2 from Zombie Telltale (as I like to call them) <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wolf-among-us-2-pushed-to-next-year-in-effort-to-avoid-crunch"><u>nowhere in sight</u></a>, I need a good detective noir game fix. Fortunately, Nobody Wants to Die came out of nowhere a few months ago and blew up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDpsmhRBev8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IGN’s YouTube channel</u></a> – to the tune of 2 million views for a completely unknown project. It’s easy to see why: it looks awesome! It’s set in New York in the year 2329, where immortality is par for the course thanks to memory banks that can store your consciousness or straight-up transferring said consciousness into another body. I got a look at a 20-minute gameplay demo ahead of its just-announced July 17 release date and came away pretty impressed with the futuristic twist on classic noir-detective gameplay.</p><p>You play Mortality Department Detective James Karra in pursuit of a serial killer targeting the city’s elite. Obviously, nobody should be truly dying in this 24th-century day and age, and it became quickly evident during my hands-off demo that even your partner, Sara Kai, and your longtime boss the Chief of Police want you to just forget the murder scene you’ve arrived at and not risk kicking any possible hornet’s nests. “Just forget about this and call it a tragic accident,” the Chief suggests, but Detective Karra is having none of that. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Nobody Wants to Die - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>I like that there are dialogue choices from James’s first-person perspective when other characters talk to him, allowing you to choose snarky responses or in some cases outright lies. But I’m getting a bit ahead of myself. The scene shown in my demo saw James walk into the ornate lobby of Green Tower, only to find an atrium with a once-glorious but now burned and charred gigantic tree in the middle – along with the titular Mr. Green hanging from one of the branches. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I like that there are dialogue choices from James’s first-person perspective when other characters talk to him, allowing you to choose snarky responses or in some cases outright lies.</p></div><p>All but the first minute or two of the demo was spent investigating the scene. Seeing as how this is the 24th century, however, James has a lot of cool tech to help him out. The main one is the Reconstructor, a holographic projection that you can feed clues into, at which point it will reconstruct the murder scene in front of you. I don’t want to ruin the investigation for you before you’ve had a chance to play this section of Nobody Wants to Die for yourself, so I’ll spare you the specifics. But to speak generally, you’ll comb the scene for clues, examine them with your eyes, your X-ray device, your UV light, and your intellect to piece together exactly what happened. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I was impressed by how in-depth the case I saw in my demo was. This wasn’t a two-minute scene where you scan a couple of clues in the environment and then you’re done. No, you are clearly going to do a lot of futuristic detective work here, and I am here for it. </p><p>Nobody Wants to Die also looks great. It’s powered by Unreal Engine 5 – a more and more common but nevertheless welcome occurrence these days – and the sound work seems fittingly noir-ish, highlighted by the hardboiled voice work of the actor playing Detective Karra. Developer Critical Hit Games has been working on Nobody Wants to Die for six years now, and while I only saw one tiny slice of the detective gameplay and not the larger picture of the narrative campaign in store for us, I’m looking forward to finally getting my hands on it to find out what else it offers.</p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

Pre-orders for the game are available now (Xbox, PlayStation, Steam).</p><p>In this unique, Japanese-inspired, and visually captivating game, players will play as the protagonist Soh to make sharp strategic decisions and use skillful dancing sword actions, while working with rescued villagers and the Maiden Yoshiro, to overcome the challenges ahead. During the day, explore the village and purge the defilement by rescuing villagers and wisely assigning them roles and positions to help attack the Seethe at night. During the night, the villagers will fight alongside Soh to protect Yoshiro from the swarm of Seethe. The trailer showcased the Spirit State and new gameplay with a Festering Seethe. When Soh runs out of health, Soh will enter a Spirit State where the player cannot fight and can only give commands to villagers to protect Yoshiro. The Festering Seethe will call forth swarms of Seethe, so cooperating with your villagers is a necessity. In both situations, players will be able to experience the intense merge of action and strategy. Face the formidable Festering Seethe, purge the village’s defilement, and return peace to the mountain.</p><p>Those who pre-order the game will receive exclusive in-game items, including the Mazo Talisman “Walking Basket” and “Astral Projection,” which can be equipped to Soh, as well as a digital mini artbook featuring never-before-seen concept art created for the game.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
