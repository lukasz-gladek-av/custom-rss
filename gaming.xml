<p>Includes a look at 'gameplay'</p>

<p>Following the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/11/random-ghibli-inspired-animation-of-zeldas-castle-town-looks-even-better-in-third-person">exceptional work</a> carried out to reimagine <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> with Ghibli-inspired visuals, animator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RwanLink">RwanLink</a> is back with another stunning short film.</p>
<p>This time, it's focused on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Zelda: Majora's Mask</a> to celebrate the game's 25th anniversary, which commenced back in April to align with the game's release in Japan in 2000. And holy moly, the short film is absolutely stunning! Not only are the visuals alone simply beautiful to look at, but the overall direction is stellar, and the soundtrack from 'Mosik' really adds to the emotion.</p>
<p>The whole thing took around 8 months to complete, with RwanLink pouring around 40 hours a week into the passion project. The result is absolutely astonishing; there are just so many cool little details, including the cheeky inclusion of some <em>actual</em> Ghibli characters in and around Clock Town.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to the cutscene-style presentation, we also get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like if Zelda: Majora's Mask were built with Ghibli-inspired visuals. It's pretty neat. Finally, in a rather touching conclusion, RwanLink himself removes his own mask to reveal his face, thanking fans and Patreon members for their support over the years.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/another-netease-backed-studio-has-closed-without-releasing-a-game.1280874/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another NetEase studio has had its funding pulled without releasing a game, and this time, it's the turn of T-Minus Zero Entertainment and its founder, BioWare and Sony veteran Rich Vogel.</p>

<p>The news was announced by Vogel <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rich-vogel-093425/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on LinkedIn</a>, where he says that T-Minus Zero Entertainment's "journey" with NetEase is "coming to an end". Vogel says that he and his studio have been unable to "secure the funding [it needs] at this time" due to "current market conditions".</p>

<p>Although Vogel doesn't technically say that T-Minus Zero is shutting down, he does say later in the post that the studio's "talented team members will continue to explore new opportunities", so even if the studio is only entering hibernation, it sounds like Vogel doesn't expect a windfall anytime soon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-the-old-republic-rich-vogel-netease.jpg?itok=VIRUv5Ax 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-the-old-republic-rich-vogel-netease.jpg?itok=090kj6Rc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You might know Rich Vogel's name from games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Vogel founded T-Minus Zero Entertainment <a href="https://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-games-introduces-t-minus-zero-entertainment-new-global" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in 2023</a>, at which point he also revealed that his studio was working on an "online multiplayer-focused third-person action title set in a sci-fi universe".</p>

<p>In his LinkedIn post, Vogel says that the project (which is presumably the same one that was revealed at the studio's founding) had a "fully playable hands-on demo", but that this demo was unable to attract funding despite garnering "a lot of interest".</p>

<p>Perhaps Vogel can take some solace in the fact that his is far from the only studio to have NetEase pull the plug on it. Back in November last year, Worlds Untold, the studio founded by&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>'s Mac Walters, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">made the decision to "pause operations"</a> amid NetEase pulling its funding.</p>

<p>It's not just studios that didn't manage to release any games, either; the NetEase outfit responsible for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which was based largely in Seattle, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closed down back in February</a>&nbsp;despite the fact that&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>appears to be a resounding success.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-netease-rich-vogel.jpg?itok=PYUfhNj9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-netease-rich-vogel.jpg?itok=mtQx0FdZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' success couldn't prevent its development team from being shut down.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not clear what Vogel intends to do next, but it looks pretty certain that we've heard the last of T-Minus Zero Entertainment, unfortunately. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things industry-related.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tetris-effect">Tetris Effect</a> developers Enhance have released a new demo for their forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lumines-arise">Lumines Arise</a> on Steam, alongside news that the spacey rhythm attack game will launch on November 11th. If you missed Tetris Effect, it's a game about making deletable lines out of falling blocks while standing in the middle of a very musical supernova.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise, meanwhile, sees you arranging clumps of blocks into 2X2 scoreable combinations, which are removed from the playing field by a horizontally sweeping Time Line. While standing in the middle of a very musical supernova.</p><!--more-->

<p>There have been eight previous Lumines releases, including remasters, on various platforms since the first game's appearance in 2004. This one is a collaboration with Monstars Inc, who also worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rez-infinite">Rez Infinite</a>. I played a bit of Lumines Arise earlier this year, and spoke to an Enhance developer about its new emphasis on expressing "the human", which is what sets it apart thematically from Tetris Effect. I'll get that write-up turned around before the release date. If I don't, feel free to quote this piece at me aggressively in the comments on any and all subsequent news articles.</p><p>In the short term, I'll say that Arise is yet another pacey and flamboyant puzzler that drizzles your occipital lobe in (for example) footage of frenzied chameleons, while challenging your primary motor cortex to save you from total visual constipation. Yes, it's making bits of your brain fight each other. I like when games do that.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm interested to make sense of Arise being a more "human" game than Effect. Much as I enjoyed Tetris Effect, I entertain suspicions that Enhance's framing of Arise might be bullshit artistry. Perhaps "more human" just means there are more human figures in the background art. Come to think of it, I'm not sure the devs mentioned Enhance's most recent game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/humanity">Humanity</a>, during my hands-on - RPS reviewer Kim Armstrong <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/humanity-review">witheringly summarised</a> that as "perfect puzzles pumped with existential hot air".</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3847360/Lumines_Arise_Demo/">Here's the Steam link for the demo</a>, which will be available from today, August 26th till September 3rd. It includes three stages from the single-player Journey mode and a bit of new multiplayer mode Burst Battle, which can be played online cross-platform. The full game has VR compatibility but there's none of that nonsense in the demo, and they've locked the difficulty to easy. They don't want to scare you away, after all.</p>
<p>Those damn fool editors of RPS gone by never found time to review Tetris Effect, but they did put it on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-vr-games">best VR games</a>.</p>

              <p>Good morning and good day. I welcome you all back to Morning Checkpoint. Drink some coffee. Eat a bagel. Go to the bathroom. Now with all that out of the way, let’s get to some news and other stuff. Today, we have a <em>Marvel Rivals</em> leak, a giant <em>Zelda</em> collection, trouble in <em>Roblox</em>, and a new <em>Lumines</em> demo that won’t be around for long. Oh, and some new gameplay of a <em>Fallout/Doom</em> mod that looks sweet.</p> <h2><strong><em>Marvel Rivals</em> leak seemingly reveals Deadpool is coming</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-teases-deadpool-daredevil/">As spotted by <em>Insider Gaming</em>,</a> a <em>Marvel Rivals</em> leaker has shared some new voice lines that seemingly reveal Deadpool is coming to the popular online free-to-play hero shooter. In a video posted on Twitter on August 25, leaker XOXLeak shared two alleged Deadpool voice lines as well as a host of replies from other characters in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> referencing the Merc With A Mouth. That same leaker also shared evidence that Daredevil is coming to <em>Rivals</em>, too.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hero voice interactions w/ Deadpool <a href="https://t.co/MSGT2fSTtU">pic.twitter.com/MSGT2fSTtU</a></p> <p>— X0XLEAK (@X0X_LEAK) <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1960089802709356544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s possible these audio files are fake or were included in the game’s data to throw off dataminers. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/no-marvel-rivals-developer-netease-isnt-intentionally-planting-fake-leaks-to-mess-with-everyone-but-its-datamined-characters-arent-guaranteed-to-appear-in-the-future-either/">The devs behind the game have explained</a> that not <em>every</em> piece of content datamined from the game will end up in <em>Rivals</em>. And AI voice-gen tools are better than ever these days, so these audio lines could all be fake.&nbsp; But Deadpool has been a rumored <em>Rivals</em> character for a bit now, and he’s a very popular Marvel hero, so it seems likely he’ll be added in the future.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Lumines Arise</em> gets a demo, but just for a week</strong></h2> <p>Rejoice, as we now have a release date for <em>Lumines Arise</em>, the next entry in the wonderful music puzzler series. It’s out in November on PS5 and PC. Nice! <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lumines-arise-gets-a-demo-on-ps5-and-steam-to-celebrate-its-release-date-announcement-but-its-for-one-week-only/">And a demo for the game has been shadow-dropped on PS5 and Steam</a>, which is cool. But sadly, this demo will only be around for a week. Bleh. But hey, I can’t complain about getting to play more <em>Lumines</em> for free, even if it’s just for a week. We must all cherish the good news during these dark days.</p> <h2><strong><em>Roblox</em> players were disappointed by Lady Gaga’s <em>Dress To Impress</em> event</strong></h2> <p>Over the weekend, one of <em>Roblox’s</em> biggest games, <em>Dress To Impress</em>, held a large in-game event featuring Lady Gaga. The famous singer and actress was actually playing the game and fans were excited to meet her and hear her speak. However, that didn’t happen. Lady Gaga hung out in a separate server where only a few select players and influencers could interact with her, and she communicated via text chat. When some fans got angry about this, a community manager for the game reportedly said on stream: “None of you are forced to be here. If you’re unhappy, just leave.” Needless to say, it was a mess.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi everyone. We would like to take the opportunity to apologise to you and take accountability. We took the time to read over messages sent by a lot of you in the chat.</p> <p>I want to begin by apologising for my defensiveness personally. As a community manager, it is not professional…</p> <p>— Dress To Impress (@_Dress2Impress) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Dress2Impress/status/1959707211262734787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dress-to-impress-lady-gaga-meet-and-greet-leaves-fans-disappointed/1100-6534261/">On August 23, as reported by <em>GameSpot</em>,</a> <em>Dress To Impres</em>s posted <a href="https://x.com/_Dress2Impress/status/1959707211262734787">a lengthy apology on Twitter</a>. In the message, the community manager apologized for her behavior, and the devs explained why the event was so limited. They blamed <em>Roblox’s</em> tech limits for the lack of Lady Gaga’s voice being broadcast to players and said limited server space was to blame for the lack of a real meet and greet. The folks behind the online dress-up game are promising to do better in the future.</p>

 <h2><strong>The largest collection of <em>Zelda</em> stuff in the world</strong></h2> <p>Constantine Adams, a software engineer from Fairfax, Virginia, has the largest collection of <em>Legend of Zelda</em> memorabilia in the world, according to The Guinness Book of World Records. <a href="https://patch.com/virginia/fairfaxcity/legend-zelda-collection-fairfax-city-worlds-largest-guinness">As reported by Patch,</a> the collection contains over 4,000 items and is housed in the collector’s large basement. In July, Guinness confirmed it to be the largest in the world.</p> <p>“I’ve been very quiet about my collection for a long time,” Adams told the outlet. “It was just a goal, right? There was something challenging to do, and I enjoyed it. It was hard at times. I’m not jumping up and down because of it. But now’s my time to show it off and say, ‘Here it is.’”</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Overwatch 2</em>‘s director is aware of the game’s horrible Steam rating</strong></h2> <p>Things are looking up for <em>Overwatch 2</em> these days. The game’s Stadium mode has been celebrated by many players, and its new characters have been popular. But over on Steam, <em>Overwatch 2</em>‘s overall rating is still a “mostly negative” 25 percent. <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch-2/gamescom-2025-interview"><em>PCGamesN</em> asked</a> <em>Overwatch 2</em> game director Aaron Keller if he was aware of the low score.</p> <p>“It’s something that I do think about a lot. Our active players are telling us, ‘Hey, the game is in the best state that it’s ever been in, or has been in for a really long time. You have to reconcile that with the reputation from a much broader gaming community,” Keller told the outlet.</p> <p>“[That reputation] is one of the reasons we’re taking bigger swings&nbsp; – we’re trying to break through some of that noise and let players who may have written<em>&nbsp;Overwatch 2</em>&nbsp;off know that there’s still really exciting things happening in this game. I think if the players who stopped playing a year ago or two years ago jumped in right now, they’d recognize that there is something&nbsp;very different&nbsp;about the game, and that it’s come a really long way. I think that it has leveled up as a competitive&nbsp;FPS game. It’s giving players more strategic choice inside of a match, and, if you look at Stadium, there’s more ways to transform the way any hero plays.”</p> <h2><strong>ICYMI:&nbsp;</strong></h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/replaced-release-date-cyberpunk-pixel-art-batman-arkham-2000620061"><em>Replaced</em>, that cool-looking cybernoir action game, has a new release date</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-delta-3-remake-ps5-pro-performance-mode-2000620023">That new <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> remake isn’t running well on consoles</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/us-open-tennis-medvedev-bonzi-delay-crowd-yelling-booing-racket-smash-2000620025">The US Open was delayed for a bit because the crowd wouldn’t stop booing</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Fallout: Bakersfield Extended Gameplay Footage" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0Wv6kkloCU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"They can't get the hardware. It's really difficult right now."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A fresh report has detailed the difficulties faced by some developers keen to launch games for Switch 2 — but who remain unable to do so due to a lack of Nintendo support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0SW7R5H5wY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a>, Nintendo is still restricting its supply of Switch 2 development hardware and instead telling some studios to launch their titles as Switch 1 games that can then be played via backwards compatibility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has sparked frustration among a number of developers, including at least one major AAA studio unable to launch a Switch 2-native version of their game, while hardware is given to some indie creators — including the team behind a campfire simulator.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's been a lot of talk about this lately, that Nintendo seems to be almost discouraging Switch 2 development to some degree," Digital Foundry's John Linneman said during the team's most recent podcast. "I've spoken with plenty of developers where they were told that their game, they should just ship it on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's a lot of developers that are unable to get Switch 2 dev kits," Linneman continued. "We talked to a lot of devs at Gamescom this year, and so many of them said the same things. They want to ship on Switch 2. They would love to do Switch 2 versions. They can’t get the hardware. It's really difficult right now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One particular frustration has been the lack of transparency from Nintendo on why some studios have been given Switch 2 development kits, while others have not. IGN has contacted Nintendo for comment. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't really know what Nintendo’s mindset was with these sets of decisions," Digital Foundry's Oliver Mackenzie said. "I don’t really understand the strategy because, like you said, even now developers are struggling to get systems, and I know that some months ago when we were hearing things through the grapevine and talking to people, there were some weird exclusions with some big developers struggling to get kits for games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From what we've heard, there were some weird inclusions as well," he continued. "Some indies were included, which is nice to see. But there’s that campfire game, you know, the camera campfire game, and they’re getting kits. And some big developers, on the other hand, who developed AAA stuff, aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The camera campfire game here in question is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/chillin-by-the-fire">Chillin' by the Fire</a>, an indie hangout game set around a campfire which makes use of the Switch 2 camera. On the one hand, the simple fact this makes use of GameChat and the Switch 2's camera capabilities makes this impossible to launch on Switch 1, meaning that development hardware for Nintendo's newer console would be required. On the other, it's understandable why some AAA developers might be surprised to see this launch, after being told they wouldn't yet receive a Switch 2 development kit for themselves.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's weird stuff about discouraging Switch 2 development explicitly for some games, a limited subset of games like if you're doing a pixel art game at 240p, you probably don't need a Switch 2 kit," Mackenzie added. "But there are very few games on the Switch 1 that wouldn't benefit from being ported explicitly to Switch 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The thing that’s really stark to me too is, at this point, we’ve seen very few proper Switch 2 Editions post-launch. I don’t think we’ve seen any, hardly at all really, from third-party developers in particular. Obviously we saw No Man’s Sky, I think one or two other games in the mix there. But really, it’s been a very slow trickle of titles earning that Switch 2 Edition badge. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I really want to see more movement on that front. I hope it’s a temporary thing," Mackenzie concluded. "I hope that in a year or two, we’re looking back and we’re like, that was a really weird decision, but it was fixed in time. I hope that’s what we’re looking at."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-reportedly-set-for-september-as-metroid-prime-4-release-date-and-mario-40th-anniversary-speculation-mounts">Nintendo was planning a fresh Direct due this September</a>, with fan hopes high for word on Metroid Prime 4 and Mario details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

However, IGN was told in a pre-announcement briefing that existing Keldeo owners will not receive a second Keldeo as part of this research, and will instead simply receive more Keldeo candy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's new season details come amid a flurry of reveals from the Pokémon Go team, including yesterday's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-go-boosting-level-cap-and-rebalancing-experience-in-first-major-xp-change-for-5-years">major announcement that the game's level cap will be raised from 50 to 80 in October</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other (less major but very cute) news, an in-game celebration was announced this morning for the Netflix stop-motion series Pokémon Concierge, including a special Psyduck in a rubber ring costume. Looking ahead, datamining suggests that details of 2025's year-end Pokémon Go Wild Area event are on the horizon, while evidence points to some kind of remote trading option also being worked upon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          
<p>It's been a busy year for Framework, the company behind the now well-established series of repairable, upgradeable, modular laptops (and one paradoxically less-upgradeable desktop). The company has launched a version of the Framework Laptop 13 with Ryzen AI processors, the new Framework Laptop 12, and the aforementioned desktop in the last six months, and last week, Framework <a href="https://frame.work/blog/we-have-something-big-coming">teased</a> that it still had "something big coming."</p>
<p>That "something big" turns out to be the first-ever update to the Framework Laptop 16, Framework's more powerful gaming-laptop-slash-mobile-workstation. Framework is updating the laptop with Ryzen AI processors and new integrated Radeon GPUs and is introducing a new graphics module with the mobile version of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070—one that's also fully compatible with the original Laptop 16, for upgraders.</p>
<p>Preorders for the new laptop open today, and pricing starts at $1,499 for a DIY Edition without RAM, storage, an OS, or Expansion Cards, a $100 increase from the price of the first Framework Laptop 16. The first units will begin shipping in November.</p>
<p>While Framework has launched multiple updates for its original Laptop 13, this is the first time it has updated the hardware of one of its other computers. We wouldn't expect the just-launched Framework Laptop 12 or Framework Desktop to get an internal overhaul any time soon, but the Laptop 16 will be pushing 2-years-old by the time this upgrade launches.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/review-frameworks-laptop-16-is-unique-laudable-fascinating-and-flawed/">The old Ryzen 7 7840HS CPU version of the Laptop 16</a> will still be available going forward at a slightly reduced starting price of $1,299 (for the DIY edition, before RAM and storage). The Ryzen 9 7940HS model will stick around until it sells out, at which point Framework says it's going away.</p>

<p>This RTX 5070 graphics module includes a redesigned heatsink and fan system, plus an additional built-in USB-C port that supports both display output and power input (potentially freeing up one of your Expansion Card slots for something else). Because of the additional power draw of the GPU and the other new components, Framework is switching to a 240 W default power supply for the new Framework Laptop 16, up from the previous 180 W power brick.</p>

With the game launching on such short notice – next week, on September 4 – several indie titles that were slated to release on or near that date are collectively jumping out of its blast radius to avoid being overshadowed. Devolver Digital’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2023/09/14/baby-steps-launches-on-ps5-and-pc-next-summer">Baby Steps</a> joins this list.</p><p>The upcoming physics-based walking adventure by the creators of Ape Out and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy was set to launch on September. 8. Although it wouldn’t have arrived until one week after Silksong, publisher Devolver Digital isn’t taking chances and has delayed Baby Steps to September 23. The game, first announced in 2023, follows an "unemployed loser" named Nate who takes his literal first steps into a fantastical world. Players must master the physics-based walking to awkwardly/humorously traverse environments.</p><p>“Nate, the wary, onesie-donned failson at the heart of the eccentric adventure in literal walking simulator Baby Steps, has stumbled after attempting to ascend his greatest challenge yet: launching the week after Hollow Knight: Silksong's surprise release date,” reads Devolver’s press release.</p><p>A cute trailer announcing the new release date shows Nate awkwardly climbing atop a giant model of Hornet, the protagonist of Silksong.

All of these delay announcements specifically cite Hollow Knight: Silksong as the primary culprit.&nbsp;</p><p>This phenomenon will likely continue, as there are still plenty of smaller titles launching well within Silksong's blast radius. Titles like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2865670/JETRUNNER/">Jetrunner</a>, Atari's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1292460/Adventure_of_Samsara/">Adventure of Samsara</a>, Deep Silver's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/">Metal Eden</a>, and Bandai Namco's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3135840/Hirogami/">Hirogami</a> are just a few titles arriving right alongside Team Cherry's hotly anticipated sequel. It wouldn't surprise me if these developers are having difficult conversations about whether it's wise, or even financially feasible, to delay their titles or to weather the storm and hope for the best.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/26/baby-steps-and-other-indie-games-are-being-delayed-to-avoid-silksongs-launch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>Credit: Amazon Prime Video/Kyoto Animation.</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>It’s been a hell of a summer for anime: We have <a href="https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em></a>, <em>Dan Da Dan</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/panty-stocking-studio-trigger-cat-vibe-amazon-prime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>New Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt</em></a>,<em> </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/coming-of-age-anime-call-of-the-night-vampires" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Call of the Night</em></a>, and so much more. But both Isaiah and Chris have been floored by one show in particular: <em>City the Animation</em>. We sat down to talk about the ambitious slice of life anime from the Kyoto Animation.</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> Upon your very glittery recommendation, I finally took some time away from watching and writing about shonen anime to check out <em>City the Animation</em> on Prime Video. I'm glad I did, because the show is one of the most ambitious and comfy shows I've seen, well, since <em>Nichijou</em>.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I'm glad! And with good reason!</p><p>If readers have never seen <em>Nichijou</em> I'd highly recommend it. Like <em>City</em>, it was also based on a manga by Keiichi Arawi, and animated by Kyoto Animation.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="TVアニメ『CITY THE ANIMATION』ノンクレジットオープニング主題歌映像／Furui Riho「Hello」" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/10eZAXGuVT4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> And for more background, we should probably say what the show is about. So, while <em>Nichijou</em> is basically about the slice of life misadventures of middle school girls and all the kooky folks who make up their small town (including a robot lady), <em>City the Animation</em> is about well...a whole town of people as they go about their lives. Episodically, the show, alongside Trigger's <em>New Panty &amp; Stocking With Garterbelt</em>, does a whole assortment of short stories within its episodes. Only unlike <em>Panty &amp; Stocking</em>, there's a bit more consideration in having its little adventures have a sense of continuity with one another. It shouldn't be remarkable for an old school, cool studio like Kyoto Animation bringing back a throwback to anime conventions like this, but that's what makes the show such a fun watch.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Nichijou My Ordinary Life Opening | Hyadain no Kakakata☆Kataomoi - C" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qUk1ZoCGqsA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Right, a lot of the joy in both <em>City</em> and <em>Nichijou</em> also comes from the contrast of how goofy and lighthearted the topics are coupled with some of the most high effort, impressive sakuga that you have ever seen. Even the tiniest thing is given obscene amounts of love and attention.</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> And its art style is the kind of vibrant bright colors within every frame with the kind of warm, inviting energy of flipping through a Little Golden Books children's story or some of a throwback Disney hand-drawn animated short (which the show plays a nod to with the typography of its logo). I usually perk up whenever the show swings to its resident dad and ramen owner Tsurubishi Makabe trying to become a cool regular at other restaurants to the point he can waltz through the door and say, "I'll have the usual," on some peak old man shit I'm also close to cinching in my own neighborhood. I also adore whenever the show focuses on its middle schooler duo of Eri Amakazari and Matsuri Makabe Rosencrantz and Guildenstern-ing their way through the show as its resident dumbasses with jester's privilege. I'm also partial to the show adapting around the manga's apparent yuri ship of tomboy Midori Nagumo and Niikura as they butt heads throughout the show as its main trio alongside Wako Izumi whose documents their every misadventure with her trusty camera.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Amazon Prime Video/Kyoto Animation.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris P:</strong> Midori has such a sick look. I love the hoodie and shorts combo.&nbsp;</p><p>Eri and Matsuri's plotline also gets much more complicated as time goes on, and I got very emotional at the end of the 6th episode. There's also an ongoing arc of the publishing of a 4 panel (four koma) comic called <em>Mr. Bummer</em> about a guy who sucks and is always having horrible stuff happen to him and the drama of the creators having to deal with its continued publication.</p><p>Many of the plotlines in this are fairly lighthearted shaggy dog stories, but Kyoto Animation will wring so much out of them. Like there is a kinda nonsense bit in episode 7 about Tsurubishi trying to make fried rice, and he's on a train ride and they animate the living hell out of the wind catching his mustache. It's this TINY detail that clearly was a huge pain in the ass to get right, but it stuck with me.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Amazon Prime Video/Kyoto Animation.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> I was trying to surmise what makes <em>City</em> such a breath of fresh air to my friend yesterday, and I went on a tangent about how a single episode in an anime winds up being the thing you show off to folks as a display of what the show is cooking. Ironically, in my example being <em>Kill La Kill</em>'s fifth episode where Ryoko and Mako rush to get to school without being tardy, <em>City</em>'s fifth episode is one of the most awe-inspiring things I've seen committed to animation in a long ass time. The best way I can describe it is that the show goes nut nut mode with a live action diorama of a tower it animates its story around that suddenly shows up in the middle of town. Somewhere down the line, Midori and Wako battle their way down the tower in a reverse <em>Game of Death</em> scenario. While all that is a bunch of fun with most of their foes defeating themselves, the show combines the rest of its other characters’ plot threads in one of those picture-in-picture sportscast ads that TV sellers pitch to football dads so they can watch more than one game at a time. But here, the show animates what everyone is doing in upwards of nine tiny squares on your television, swapping out the most essential storyline to take up the biggest square on the screen as everyone wanders through their little misadventure.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="【わちゃわちゃ】『CITY THE ANIMATION』毎週日曜日 好評放送＆配信中！#アニメCITY" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/804JeZgaKnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>As if that wasn't impressive enough, the show ends on a little water bubble animation where all of its cast walk to an impromptu city-wide BBQ. But because Kyoto Animation doesn't skimp, they do like a bazillion bubbles outlining every character walking into frame, combining, until they make an entire mural of the town.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It's bar none the most elaborate, high effort piece of animation I've seen all year. It's the kind of thing you end a season on, and it's in episode five. One of the biggest flexes.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> It was so good, I immediately started rewatching <em>Nichijou</em> episodes to feel something again and to remind myself if they were cooking on this level way back in 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>And what's funny about that is whenever anime fans online talk about older shows, they treat the feat of its animation the same way gamers would a graphical update in a game, as if older shows couldn't possibly have the same quality (if not more so) than modern anime. As if time and resources versus production demand over the years means new shows should look better, when the case tends to skew the reverse with how there's more shows being made now than there were back in the day. Needless to say, me nearly doubling over laughing at a gag about Yuuko trying to eat her little bento box hotdog octopus only to drop it in a cacophony of hijinks, <em>Nichijou</em> still holds up.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>That conversation always annoys me because it always sidesteps an analysis of material conditions in anime production and what underpinned a lot of these production budgets. Like, anime has its good and bad eras (a lot of early mixed CGI and the transition to digital was a little rough, for example), but there's almost always someone willing to put the extra effort into it. That's why <em>Nichijou</em> holds up so well.</p><p>And both <em>City</em> and <em>Nichijou</em> as anime owe so much to Keiichi Arawi art, because he also puts so much work into it and to do either manga a disservice would be mortifying.&nbsp;</p><p>Also the manga are both very good!</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Amazon Prime Video/Kyoto Animation.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> It's also a testament to how much of an industry darling Kyoto Animation is. Coming off the tragic arson fire, which <em>Chainsaw Man</em> creator Tatsuki Fujimoto referenced in <em>Look Back</em>, it's been gratifying to see the studio remain a tour de force in the industry. Be it with sprawling steampunk period pieces like <em>Violet Evergarden</em>, gripping dramas like <em>A Silent Voice</em>, sci-fi epics like <em>Beyond the Boundary</em>, or slice of life gag manga like it's made a career of with shows like <em>Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</em>. With <em>City</em>, I realized I'd been yearning for more shows where characters float toward the smell of delicious bread, sleep with giant snot bubbles, or put more effort than none at all with niche delights like the art of eating ramen raw from the packaging.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Amazon Prime Video/Kyoto Animation.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Ghibli Food is an annoying meme but they absolutely sell food so well in this. Like they convey the shame and joy of midnight snacking on a raw block of ramen and sticking your tongue into the soup powder packet as a cycle akin to samsara.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Amazon Prime Video/Kyoto Animation.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> It's a real delight to watch with every episode not just how hard they'll go on its animation to sell a joke or which wrestling move its cast will break out (as they're wont to do) sporadically--it's to see what your friends in <em>City</em> are up to today. Kyoto Animation really nailed the same kind of feeling we're currently celebrating with James Gunn making <em>Superman</em> feel like a buddy you want to hang out with for everyone in their cast. And in a season where its only slice of life competition is <em>King of the Hill</em>, it's not even close with all the good vibes <em>City</em> has. I mean, even its eye catches for commercial breaks in between short stories are a vibe.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It's been an incredible season for anime (including <em>King of the Hill</em>) that just gives you a warm feeling inside.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grimwild-backerkit-ttrpg-rpg-designer-missing"><h3>RPG Designer Goes Missing After Crowdfunding Award-Winning Game</h3></a><p>'Fulfilment of the project appears to be on hold indefinitely until Maxwell can be located'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/overwatch-2-interview-pvp"><h3>Overwatch 2 Developers Say They’re Leaning Into What Works</h3></a><p>'We are trying to take bigger swings, bigger risks, and bring more change to the game faster than we did in the past.'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-silksong-gta-vi-elder-scrolls-vi"><h3>What’s Going To Be The Next Silksong?</h3></a><p>"Given that Silksong is real and about to come out, what other super long-awaited games are left?"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays"><h3>Indie Devs Are Delaying Their Games Because Of Silksong [Updated]</h3></a><p>'I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale,' wrote one developer</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-trailer-capture-director-maker"><h3>A ‘Game Capture Director’ Is The Person Who Gets The Gameplay Footage For A Video Game Trailer</h3></a><p>'The coolest thing I’ve ever done is probably put references to both Jaws and Pac-Mac in a single trailer'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/city-the-animation-review-anime-nichijou-kyoto-animation]]></content:encoded>

			<p>We’re back. Your loadout is prepared with power armour, Chainguns and Roadie Runs readied, and Sera is under attack again, but where there was once the reassuring feel of an Xbox controller in your hand, you look down to find a PlayStation 5 DualSense instead. Is this some Locust trick? No, this is gaming in 2025, and while it’s likely proof that the console wars are basically over, Marcus Fenix can never rest, with a new battleground to protect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gears of War: Reloaded | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzJDY6V6C4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded is the original Gears game, but tugged, tightened and scrubbed up to fit into a newer, shinier suit of armour, ready for battle on the enemy console. For the veteran, there’s not a whole lot to find, pulling together the additional campaign act from the original PC release and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/08/25/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition-review/">the 2015 Ultimate Edition</a>, alongside all of the previous DLC, and there’s cross-platform play as well as cross-save.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, though, it’s only cross-save across the brand-new Reloaded version of the game, as opposed to any other rendition of this game. It’s the kind of thing Fenix would shrug at, and so should you, but I found it a little odd that the cross-save is a feature limited to this outing, when Xbox gamers will have played it a number of times.</p>


<p>At this point, I could genuinely reload a Lancer in my sleep – assuming you only have to hit a shoulder button at the right time to do so. I’ve played through this campaign more times than I can count, but it still hits the same beats, still ramps up the drama, and is still capable of putting you on the back foot, especially on the higher difficulty settings.</p>
<p>The steady stream of iconic moments, from your first steps through the city, the fight through darkened alleyways filled with avian Kryll, or luring a Berzerker through narrow corridors, are as much of an adrenaline rush as ever. We don’t see many of these types of shooters anymore, and in the absence of modern or even remastered Killzone and Resistance, there’s a welcoming little slot on PlayStation that I think Gears will fit nicely into.</p>
<p>Multiplayer will play a large part in that, and co-op and competitive play is still a massive part of the gung-ho Gears experience. Adding in cross-play to bolster the community should mean that there’s always someone to play with or against, though I have to wonder how newcomers will fare against a legion of players who’ve been honing their reloads and shotgun blasts for the best part of twenty years. If you’ve got the tech, multiplayer is also available in 120fps on consoles and even higher on PC, which is frankly mind-blowing, making the game feel more fluid than it ever has before.</p>
<p>It’s still pretty brown and grey, though. That’s utterly indicative of the time, of course – it wasn’t until Gears 3 that the series really found a new palette – and for all that this looks pretty damn arresting at times, I still wanted some more vibrancy beyond the blood red COG logos and shining blue armour highlights. Reloaded builds on the work done for the Ultimate Edition a decade ago, enhancing it further, most strikingly with the lighting. If you want to be sold on a decaying, dehumanised civilisation, it does a good job of that, and with the campaign running with upscaled 4K at 60fps on PS5 and with HDR, it’s never looked better. PS5 Pro can push a touch further with resolution, shadow quality and PSSR, but it looks great on the base console.</p>

<p>For all that Gears might be the poster boy for the frat-boy, mid-2000s era of gaming, your comrades are even dumber than I remember. While Dom, Baird and Cole will do some work along the way, they’ll also stand in your way, run back and forth under enemy fire, and on occasion be more of a nuisance than you’d want. Sometimes you’ll just hear them thumping around somewhere nearby, and when those thumps are as loud as they are in Gears, it’s an unnecessary distraction.</p>
<p>Tie that up with a few graphical glitches – my favourite saw a painting end up stuck on Dom’s neck for a while, like he’d inadvertently ended up in a comedy skit with some Locust playfully hitting him over the head with it – and you can still see the Xbox 360 origins if you scrape away a few layers of the shiny paint.</p>
<p>There are a few little PlayStation 5 exclusive features here, and one of them is that the speaker in your DualSense delivers all the comm messages from Anya as well as the area-cleared audio notes, which is a nice touch, albeit one that reminds you that your speaker is probably turned up too loud. You can, of course, turn it off if you want to.</p>

<p>I hope that this is the start of Microsoft bringing across the rest of the Gears games, though it does feel like we should be getting something more like the Master Chief Collection at this point, at least for the first three games. There’s still a hell of a lot to like in the first Gears game – it is a classic that launched a thousand over-the-shoulder third-person cover shooters after all – but the series gets better, with 2’s campaign and 3’s multiplayer still holding position as the true highlights. The iconic Horde mode didn’t arrive until Gears 2 as well, and a Gears game without that now feels strangely lopsided.</p>

<figure><a title="Hello, Mario!" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0dce8bd23c131/hello-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There are three things that you should know about me before we dive into this feature. 1) I am, to all intents and purposes, a 'grown-up'. 2) I do not have any children, nor any tiny relatives to test this app on. 3) I'm a sucker for a bit of N64 nostalgia.</p>
<p>Keeping these first two points in mind, you might assume that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> — Nintendo's new Japan-only mobile/Switch app, laser-focused on pulling some sensory smiles out of a new generation of Mario fans — was not made for me. You would be right. I've spent 20 minutes with it, seen all that it has to offer, and it's unlikely that I'll ever open it again. But that doesn't mean that there aren't some smiles to be had for the old and wizened like myself, even if I am very much not the target market.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067torhkn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>First, some background information. Hello, Mario! marks the beginning of Nintendo's expansion project into the untapped world of toddler fandom. I mean, come on, those babies are just sitting there, without a single piece of Mushroom Kingdom merch on them! <em>The horror!</em></p>
<p>This 'My Mario' line has wormed its way into a bunch of different avenues already, from books and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-heres-a-closer-look-at-the-super-mario-wood-block-sets-doubling-as-amiibo">wooden blocks</a> (which double as amiibo, because you're never too young for some NFC goodness) to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-releases-its-me-mario-stop-motion-shorts-watch-them-right-here">stop-motion animated shorts</a>, but Hello, Mario! 'gameifies' the whole thing — and I use 'game' very loosely there.</p>

<p>For the most part, this is an interactive soundboard. Mario's ever-grinning face pops up in the middle of the screen, and you're free to squish and squash it in any way you please, all while he utters the general chorus of "<em>Ooh!</em>", "<em>Haa!</em>", and "<em>Wa-Haa!</em>" with every poke.</p>
<p>There's a small menu in the top left where you can choose to put Mario in a handful of different situations --beef him up with a Mushroom, bring on the rainbow with a Star, get inky with a Blooper, or hit the music block to see the prized plumber perform a rendition of an iconic tune while his surrounding shifts to an underwater scene or icon-filled backdrop.</p>
<p>Nintendo couldn't resist adding a <em>little</em> bit of 'game' to the whole affair. Spinning Mario's face in a circle or firing him through a pipe (also accessed from the menu) brings up a little bubble-popping challenge, where you can tap the bubbles or drag Mario's face into them, each pushing a counter up towards 100. Nothing outside of a small confetti burst happens when you reach triple-digits, but it's <em>just</em> enough to hit every beat in that 3-5-year age bracket, I suppose.</p>
<p>It's super simple and rather sweet. As anyone who ever spent an afternoon with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> start screen will tell you, there's something in the unending positivity of Mario's smile that makes squashing his face feel... good. The app's 2D sprite is a lot cleaner and marginally less disturbing than its polygonal predecessor, but there's something in my human nature that means, given the opportunity, I <em>have</em> to pull his moustache and see his reaction.</p>
<figure><a title="Hello, Mario!" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d36b36afa7bff/hello-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>There are even some surprises that cropped up as I poked and prodded Jumpman to hear his different responses. Repeatedly tapping his eyes makes him don a pair of shades, tickling his nose produces a big sneeze and results in a wacky 'tache, and leave him for long enough and he'll start to play peek-a-boo with you. It's all designed to get a chuckle out of little ones, but it'll get a little grin out of N64 fans, too.</p>
<p>After 10 minutes or so, Mario becomes sleepy, the music fades out, and the background is replaced by the night sky. The dozing face drops from the screen, and a message pops up telling you to close and reopen the app if you'd like to play again. It's a built-in measure for managing your kid's playtime, I'd assume, but it's also a neat way of wrapping things up.</p>
<p>If you can read that final message, then the app's not designed for you and you likely will have seen everything it has to offer by that point; if you <em>can't</em> read it...then what the heck are you doing here at the bottom of the feature?</p>

			<p>The Dino Crisis series could be among the next classic CAPCOM series to be revived, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://residentevil.com.br/lab/registros-de-resident-evil-requiem-e-dino-crisis-no-inpi-brasil/">Brazilian publication REVIL</a>, a new Dino Crisis trademark has been recently registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property. The July 3 filing is separate from the 1999 filing for the original and has been submitted around the time the Resident Evil Requiem registration has, suggesting that this new filing isn't meant for the updated PC versions of the first entries in the series released earlier this year, but for something different altogether. Interestingly enough, the trademark's class is the same as that used for the Resident Evil Requiem trademark, entertainment and video games class, so there's definitely the chance something related to the series is in the works, possibly a new entry in the series, a remake or even a remaster in the vein of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-hands-on-preview-aging-like-fine-wine/">Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny remaster.</a></p>



<p>The new Dino Crisis series registration with the National Institute of Industrial Property in Brazil isn't the only recent indication that the long-dormant series may be close to a return to the spotlight, following other series' revivals like <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/">Onimusha</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-2-re-engine/">Okami</a>. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-has-been-trademarked-in-japan-by-capcom-reigniting-hopes-for-a-comeback/">Back in March</a>, CAPCOM trademarked Dino Crisis again in Japan, which is usually done in Japan not just to protect rights to a property, but also when there's an intention to use the IP again. As CAPCOM did something similar with Onimusha, it looks increasingly likely that the series will be making some sort of comeback in the future.</p>



<p>As already mentioned, Dino Crisis made a small return <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">earlier this year</a> with the GOG release of the first two entries in the series. Both games have been updated with new features, such as improved DirectX game renderer, new rendering options including V-Sync control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing and more, increased rendering resolution to 4K and color depth to 32-bit, improved geometry calculation, smoother animation, video and music playback, cloud saves support, and much more</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Framework CEO Nirav Patel said he would deliver “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23652967/framework-laptop-16-modular-upgradable-graphics">the holy grail for gamers</a>” with the Framework Laptop 16. In 2023, he suggested it’d be the first consumer notebook to fulfil the promise of modular, upgradable graphics cards like a desktop PC. We at <em>The Verge</em> were skeptical, because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited">the last time</a> we heard someone tell that story, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/22313742/alienware-area-51m-lawsuit-gpu-upgrade-arbitration-settlement">it ended in lawsuits and forced arbitration</a>.</p><p>But today, some eighteen months after shipping the Framework Laptop 16, the company has done what no laptop maker has done <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/04/18/mxm-powerful-misused-hackable/">in modern memory, if ever</a>: it’s created a newer, faster discrete graphics card you can easily swap into its existing laptop.</p><p>In 2024, that laptop originally shipped with a optional AMD Radeon RX 7700S, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665800/framework-laptop-16-hands-on-preview-modular-gaming-laptop#:~:text=Fun%20fact%3A%20both%20the%20supposedly%20upgradable%20Alienware%20Area%2D51m%20and%20the%20Framework%20Laptop%2016%20have%20a%20common%20champion">with AMD’s support</a>, using a clever expansion bay system designed to be futureproof. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665800/framework-laptop-16-hands-on-preview-modular-gaming-laptop#:~:text=isn%E2%80%99t%20the%20only%20important%20thing%20Framework%20has%20done%20to%20evolve%20modular%20GPUs%2C%20though">More details here</a> on how it works.) Now, Nvidia is on board too, letting you purchase a mobile Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 8GB that you can physically swap in <a rel="sponsored" href="https://tiktok.pxf.io/c/482924/2160485/27618?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40verge%2Fvideo%2F7267920268520082731">as little as two minutes</a>.</p><p>That’s right: you can even swap between AMD and Nvidia. Framework says it doesn’t have final benchmarks, but says you’ll see a 30 to 40 percent uplift from AMD’s 7700S to Nvidia’s 5070, and it’ll come with a revised cooling solution that features fans with a new blade design and Honeywell PTM7950 thermal interface material.</p><p>Like the 7700S, the new 5070 will have 100 watts of sustained power and cooling to work with; not as much as beefier gaming laptops, but more than thinner machines typically get.</p><p>In the end, it wasn’t that hard to convince Nvidia to sign on, Framework CEO Nirav Patel tells<em> The Verge</em>. “They saw the success of the company, and it was clear we were an up and coming startup worth working with,” he says. Framework began working with Nvidia in early 2024, he recalls, not long after the Framework 16 began to ship. “We were able to clear that hurdle just through the success of the product,” he says, though he won’t share any sales numbers with me.</p><p>Then why did he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619586/framework-laptop-16-update-one-key-but-not-done">dodge my questions for so long</a> about whether there’d truly be GPU upgrades waiting for the first generation of Laptop 16 buyers? “If we find some massive roadblock and just can’t get it to work […] we want to make sure it’s done and it’s working,” he tells me.</p><p>But he says they didn’t actually hit any massive roadblocks — even though the Nvidia RTX 5070 isn’t the only upgrade awaiting buyers today.</p><p>In addition to the new GPU option, the second-generation Framework Laptop 16 will ship with a new mainboard featuring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618769/framework-laptop-13-2025-amd-ryzen-ai-300-strix-point">AMD’s AI 300 / Strix Point processors</a>, offering up to a 12-core/24-thread Ryzen HX 370 with Radeon 890M graphics in a chip that can comfortably run at a “sustained” 45W TDP. The new mainboard also now supports display outputs on four of its six expansion card slots, up from three, so you won’t need to think as hard about <a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/expansion-card-slot-functionality-on-framework-laptop-16-amd-ryzen-7040-series-rkUjGm7cn">which ports support which capabilities</a>, and a new mux lets the laptop drive its internal display more directly from the discrete GPU for lower latency.</p><p>It’ll also come with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167310/framework-laptop-13-screen-webcam-core-ultra-sd-upgrades">the better second-gen webcam</a> that came to the Framework Laptop 13 last year, a more rigid top cover, AMD’s newer RZ717 Wi-Fi 7 module, and Framework may become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/765542/framework-240w-usb-c-pd-charger-first-framework-16">the very first laptop maker to ship a 240W USB-C PD power adapter</a> so a fully loaded Framework Laptop 16 will no longer slowly drain its battery as you play, something that could occasionally happen with the previous 180W charger.</p><p>Four of the laptop’s USB-C ports support 240W power input, or five if you count the new and improved USB-C port on the back of the RTX 5070 GPU, which not only supports DisplayPort output but also 240W input and USB 2.0 for a mouse or keyboard. You might be able to create a single-cable docking solution that way with the right USB-C monitor. Just note the Laptop 16 maxes out at four simultaneous displays, including the internal screen, so you can’t get five or six screens at a time. (Were you truly hoping?)</p><p>And like the Framework Laptop 13, you won’t need to buy these upgrades as a complete package: Framework will sell most if not all of them individually for the existing Framework Laptop 16. For now, Framework is opening preorders for the new laptop starting at $1,499 (memory, storage, and OS cost extra), the 240W power adapter for $109, the new mobile RTX 5070 for a pricey $699, and the new Ryzen AI 300 mainboards starting at $749. A full pre-built laptop with the new GPU, 16GB/512GB and six USB-C ports costs $2,499 and goes up from there.</p><p>Like previous products, Framework will ship them in batches, with the first set arriving in November. <a rel="sponsored" href="https://framework.pxf.io/c/482924/1459308/17284?u=https%3A%2F%2Fframe.work%2Fproducts%2Flaptop16-amd-ai300%2Fconfiguration%2Fnew">It’s taking preorders now. </a></p><p>Framework will also sell also a revamped version of the Radeon RX 7700S graphics module for $449 with the same new fans and Honeywell thermal interface too, and it will reduce the price of the original RX 7700S module to $399, down from $499 originally.</p><p>The new cooling might be the part I’m most interested in, as my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24185827/framework-laptop-16-six-months-later-review">biggest complaints about the original</a> were heat and noise when using the graphics module (whose fans also cool the laptop’s CPU). Patel won’t promise that my issues have been fixed, only that it’s “something users are going to have go try,” but he says both acoustic performance and thermals should be better than the original for many reasons. It’s not just the graphic module improvements, but also a revised heatspreader and Honeywell thermal interface material on the CPU, which may itself run more efficiently than AMD’s previous generation of parts. I guess I’ll find out!</p><p>Note that Framework <em>isn’t</em> announcing any physical changes to the Framework Laptop 16’s unique “input modules” this year. It will be shipping a firmware update to keep every Laptop 16 from waking up if keys are pressed when the lid is closed, but there are no new modules or colorful spacers being announced today, though the keyboards themselves now offer versions with the Microsoft Copilot logo, or with no Windows logo at all “for all the Linux users out there.” You can also still buy Framework’s clear RGB keyboard, macropad, and LED matrix panels if you want to look flashy.</p><p>Speaking of Linux, Patel tells me his company will officially be supporting Bazzite on the Framework Laptop 16, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/761025/framework-desktop-bazzite-linux-steam-machine-pc-game-console-impressions">the SteamOS-like distro that we recently installed on the Framework Desktop</a> to great effect. Framework will publish its own guides, and he says the Nvidia RTX 5070 should work there too. With the latest kernel and drivers, he says Nvidia gamers “should be able to play anything on Steam on Linux and have it work well.”</p><p>There’s no getting around the fact that this is a pricey laptop, with graphics cards that cost more money for less performance than the equivalent desktop parts — even if you opt for the RTX 5070, you’re probably looking at playing the latest games at high settings at the laptop’s native 2560 x 1440p resolution, and lower settings if you opt for 4K, Patel suggests to me.</p><p>But with Framework, you’re paying for the promise of a laptop you can upgrade again and again, year after year, instead of buying a brand-new machine each time. The company did it with its 13-inch laptop, and it seems it might genuinely do it with its 16-inch laptop, too. It’s never been done before.</p><p>Just don’t expect Patel to get any looser-lipped about which future GPU upgrades might be available, or when. “If AMD announces something, obviously we’d want to talk to them,” he says. “We have a good relationship with Nvidia; obviously, when the future comes, we’ll be able to show you what we have.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/laptops/765528/framework-is-now-selling-the-first-gaming-laptop-that-lets-you-easily-upgrade-its-gpu-with-nvidias-blessing#comments">7<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/laptops/765528/framework-is-now-selling-the-first-gaming-laptop-that-lets-you-easily-upgrade-its-gpu-with-nvidias-blessing]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s homaging of Starship Troopers and/or parodying of real-life fascist interventionalism continues with Into the Unjust, a sizeable game update that will take you out to the Terminid Hive Worlds for a spot of cave combat. According to multiple geographers interviewed by RPS, caves are located underground. That's going to cause problems if, for example, your entire military strategy depends on being able to call in air support whenever you choose. The same geographers also allege that caves are dark. That's going to cause problems if you like to see the things you're shooting at.

<p>Helldivers 2 Into the Unjust launches 2nd September, and why read the rest of this evidently stupid news piece when you can just watch this seven minute "deep dive" (comedy whoopee cushion sound effect)?

<p>Did you skip the video? Bless you for your loyalty to the written word. Your reward is a hasty summary of Into The Unjust from me, plus more bad jokes. Basically, Hive Worlds are big jaggedy deserts made out of congealed snot and custard. The Terminids here appear vastly more annoying than the ones you'll find on, lol, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">Super Earth</a>, because they have the ability to burrow. 
</p><p>That extends to the Chargers, who can actually charge while burrowing. I would need to consult with the geographers again, but I'm not sure that should be allowed. At the very least, they should have to use a new word for it. I would recommend "churrowing" but that makes it sound like you're being assaulted by delicious fried dough. "Barging" is already a word, unfortunately, and "burraging" sounds like you tripped and bit your tongue while ordering an artillery strike. Can we please just move onto the next paragraph already.
</p>
<p>There are two new types of mission to undertake on Hive Worlds. Firstly, journeys underground in search of a horrible giant lung that's coughing up a bunch of poison fog. These missions readily evoke Aliens, and naturally put a strong emphasis on teamwork than many surface-level shoot-outs: in darker spots, one player may need to shoulder flashlight duties, sacrificing participation in the carnage for the good of the squad. I'm sure this won't lead to any broken friendships.
</p>
<p>The second type of mission sees you escorting a mobile oil drill with a big cannon on it. It's Dune and also, a pisstake of US oil politics. It seems like the new Dragonroach enemies will be a particular hindrance during these missions: they can fly and have acidic breath. The key to prevailing over Dragonroach appears to be forcing them to land by blasting their wings, and if that isn't grounds for modding Fus Ro Dah functionality into Helldivers 2, my name isn't Hey You, You're Finally Awake.
</p>
<p>The video includes details of some forthcoming Helldivers 2 warbonds, aka DLC packs. There's a crossover with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-3-odst">Halo 3: ODST</a>, which has been in the wind for a while, and lets you wreak war with such UNSC armaments as the Battle Rifle and Magnum (but will it capture the interplay between the former's shield-stripping and the latter's finishing shots?). There's also a Dust Devil warbond tailored to the new Hive World maps, which includes an assault rifle with incendiary rounds, a new napalm rocket, a gas harpoon, and a missile silo helpfully housed in a hellpod.
</p><p>Some recent Helldiverse happenings: they've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-patch-puts-a-stop-to-the-warp-packs-cheekiest-party-trick-because-you-are-done-it-is-time-to-go-home">put a stop to an exploit that let you warp out of the extraction shuttle</a>. They're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-wants-you-to-make-sure-virtual-citizens-dont-wet-the-bed-and-also-heres-another-free-cape">handing out free capes like they're going out of style</a> - a foolish observation of mine, for what is style if not cape. They're also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-3-is-hopefully-many-years-away-says-arrowheads-ceo-who-did-not-vote-for-gun">not making Helldivers 3 anytime soon</a>, unless Helldivers 2 updates itself so much that it becomes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> 3 by default.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-update-terminid-2000620349</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-is-plunging-players-into-the-horrors-of-the-bug-homeworlds.1280796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s next big content drop is right around the corner and it’s taking players into the depths of the chemical fog-infested Terminid home worlds. Revealed on Tuesday, Into the Unjust arrives in September alongside a new Devil’s Dust Warbond just a week after the hot PlayStation extraction shooter launches on Xbox Series X/S.</p> <p>After spending the summer fending off Illuminate invasions and jetpack-toting Automatons, Into the Unjust will send players back into the alien bug breach, tasking them with missions deep in Terminid territory that will include blowing up giant bug towers and navigating deep underground through their tunnel systems. New objective types will include escorting a giant moving oil rig as it gets attacked. We are so back.</p> <p>Fans will also have access to a bunch of new equipment coming in the Devil’s Dust Warbond. Here’s a breakdown <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/">from the PlayStation Blog</a>:</p>

 <blockquote> <p><strong>AR-2 Coyote</strong><strong><br> </strong>You can hunt in packs or go by your lonesome with this assault rifle that features incendiary ammunition. But be warned: this coyote is wild.</p> <p><strong>G-7 Pineapple</strong><strong><br> </strong>This cluster frag grenade might look like a cute and unassuming fruit, but it’ll have the bugs in absolute pieces.</p> <p><strong>S-11 Speargun</strong><strong><br> </strong>A true big game hunter’s companion. The S-11 fires heavy-duty projectiles that release a cloud of gas on impact.</p> <p><strong>EAT-700 Expendable Napalm</strong><strong><br> </strong>Heat up the planet with this single-use missile that contains napalm cluster bombs.</p> <p><strong>MS-11 Solo Silo</strong><strong><br> </strong>The long-range power of a missile in a new convenient package. Calls down a Hellpod-sized missile silo with a single, ultra-powerful missile and a handheld targeting remote.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Warbond will also include new armor that boosts resistance to toxins and other hazards players are likely to face in the thick of the Terminid fog. Combined with the new Strategems coming in the update, it should give lapsed players some fun new toys worth unlocking.</p> <p>But it’ll be baptism by fire for all of the players picking up <em>Helldivers 2 </em>for the first time on Xbox this week. Live today roughly 18 months after launching on PS5 and PC, the Xbox release should bring about an influx of players that tips the scales back in Super Democracy’s favor amid the game’s ongoing <em>D&amp;D</em>-style Galactic War meta game. It’ll also indicate just how much of a market there is for PS5 console exclusives on Microsoft’s rival platform.</p> <p>A successful campaign against the bugs won’t just unlock the next chapter in <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s story, it could also usher in the next phase of cross-platform ports from Sony’s first-party portfolio. But fans will have to survive untold new alien horrors first.</p>

<p>Battle royale is in the rearview mirror for PlayerUnknown CEO Brendan Greene. The father of battle royale has moved on from PUBG and the genre he popularized, and formed PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions. The first major project it’s working on is Prologue: Go Wayback!, and Brendan walked me through the game’s map potential, what to expect from Prologue, and what the end goal is.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/brendan-greene-pubg-creator-three-game-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prologue: Go Wayback!</a> is single-player and carries an open-world-survival vibe. It features randomly generated maps on every visit. In case you haven’t realized, this is <em>wildly </em>different from PUBG. Brendan has already explained to Insider Gaming how <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-pubg-creator-brendan-greene-is-humbled-by-battle-royale-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">humbled he is by battle royale’s success</a>.</p>



<p>But his new company has a new game, and it’s called Prologue: Go Wayback!</p>



<h2 id="h-it-takes-about-two-hours-to-get-across-the-map-in-prologue-go-wayback">“It Takes About Two Hours to Get Across The Map” in Prologue: Go Wayback! </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Brendan was kind enough to make this for us! Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.playprologue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Prologue</a> encourages you to explore a vast expanse. Each map is new, but the goal is the same: To survive and reach the Weather Tower. Brendan makes it clear from the outset: Prologue: Go Wayback! is about size, scale, and serendipitous exploration in the game’s unique procedurally generated 64km2 maps.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It generally takes about two hours to get across the map. We have this interesting machine learning type that creates a new base map every time you play. So you’ve got essentially infinite worlds you can explore, and all 8×8 and looking quite nice.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There are no vehicles, and all exploration is purely on foot. Prologue will remain a single-player game for now, as the newfound company “Doesn’t have the resources for now” to add a fully integrated multiplayer component. However, Brendan explained to me how there is still room for multiplayer functionality even now.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Like with the map editor, you can just create and share maps with friends and race across maps, because if you pass a seed to someone with the schematic, they get the same map as you. We’re thinking maybe, like, I want to look into maybe doing some kind of asynchronous, or no, like a multiplayer where you’re maybe playing with the ghost of your friend. So like it’s not a real multiplayer, but at least you can play together.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I was interested to learn that reaching the Weather Tower doesn’t necessarily define the gameplay experience. Brendan is happy for people to explore their bespoke biomes.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We have one guy who survived 17 hours in a Discord because there’s no end limit. Like, you have to get to the weather tower, but I don’t care if you do or not. We had one guy who posted a picture of this cabin on the edge of a cliff and he was like, ‘I found my home.’ He just wanted to stay there. Which I love because I’m just creating an emergence space. I fell back in love in gaming through Day Z, which is just emergence. It’s like tell your own story, do your own thing, and that’s the kind of spaces I want to create.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is part of the studio’s Project Artemis vision—which is likely to be Brendan’s final game overall.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baby-steps/">Baby Steps</a>, the hilariously awkward walking simulator from Devolver Digital, has taken a more cautious step back. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">In the looming shadow of Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, the team announced a new release date for September 23. However, the developers released a fun new video of Nate, the game's perpetually off-balance, onesie-clad walker, attempting (and failing) to climb a massive statue of Hornet, the star of Silksong.</p><p>This isn't the first game to quietly adjust its footing in the wake of Silksong's long-awaited launch and an increasingly packed fall release schedule. Demonschool, another upcoming indie title from publisher Ysbryd Games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-prompts-yet-another-game-delay-as-the-great-looking-demonschool-gets-pushed-back/1100-6534245/" data-ref-id="1100-6534245">has recently pushed its release to November, retreating from its original September 3 launch date.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5apDFK64tI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l5apDFK64tI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Behind Baby Steps' slapstick charm is an all-star indie dev trio: Bennett Foddy (Getting Over It), Gabe Cuzzillo (Ape Out), and Maxi Boch. Together, they've crafted a seemingly absurd yet oddly touching game about Nate, an unmotivated basement-dweller who discovers his one true gift: walking. One foot at a time, players guide Nate through a mysterious, scenic world using physics-driven controls that transform every hill into a mountain and every step into a monumental achievement.</p><p>With its new release date giving it some breathing room, Baby Steps now has a chance to shine on its own. Players will now help Nate lurch and flop through a surprisingly emotional journey filled with awkward encounters and scenic landscapes on September 23, on PC and PS5.</p>

            <p>Capcom has revealed new in-game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> loading screen art for Kimberly which will be given to all players as part of a recent community art contest.</p>
<p>This piece comes as a replacement for a former entry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-6-art-contest-rocked-by-ai-controversy-disqualification-issued">which was disqualified following allegations of AI use</a>. According to the terms and conditions of the art contest, all work submitted must be entirely original, and as such the suspected AI use broke the rules.</p>
<p>Alongside the new art reveal comes the following statement from Capcom: "The Street Fighter 6 development team has completed the previously announced replacement for Kimberly's new challenger screen. The illustration is based on her swimsuit Outfit 4, which has been earning rave reviews from the community."</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 is getting a fresh content drop next week with its Into the Unjust update, following on from the long-awaited Xbox launch and Halo ODST Legendary Warbond.</p>



<p>The stacked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/">Halo ODST Legendary Wa</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/">bond</a> is full of treats, but comes at a price, though the next big update in Helldivers 2 is right around the corner, bringing with it a host of new content.</p>



<p>From a new Premium Warbond filled with new weapons and armor, to new challenges to explore, the Into the Unjust update has plenty to offfer.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2">Helldivers 2: Into the Unjust Launches September 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More goodies. Image via Arrowhead</figcaption></figure>



<p>Announced in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, Into the Unjust in Helldivers 2 pushes players into a fresh battle against the Terminids into unknown territory, seemingly with a challenge that won’t allow you to call in Stratagems.</p>



<p>The teaser blog details disappearing “into the fog” to “discover new dangers”. It’s explained that “because of the nature of the caves, your Super Destroyer won’t be able to give you full support.” As a result, it’s your squad facing up against the Terminids alone.</p>



<p>New enemy types are also detailed, with “a new subterranean species of Terminid Warriors, Bile Spewers, and Chargers,” along with the Dragonroach, and “more terrifying creatures lying in wait on Hive Worlds.”</p>



<p>New challenges include escorting a mobile oil rig, locating and destroying the Hive Lung, along with new optional and sub-objectives too.</p>



<p>As is customary in Helldivers 2, the new drop of content also comes alongside a new Premium Warbond, called Dust Devils, which will “ensure survival in the harshest conditions these worlds can throw your way.”</p>



<p>The Warbond includes a primary weapon, a new throwable, and three unique stratagems, all of which launch on September 4.</p>



<p>Are you planning to pick up the latest Premium Warbond in Helldivers 2? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
A new major update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has been unveiled, which will finally take the battle to the home of Super Earth's enemies.
</p>
<p>
Into the Unjust will see players explore the Hive Worlds behind the Gloom, to the home of the insect-like Terminids. That means battling through an underground labyrinth of cave tunnels without Super Destroyer support from the skies.
</p>
<p>
News of the update arrives on the same day Helldivers 2 releases on Xbox Series X/S. Into the Unjust will arrive on 2nd September.

<p>
The update will bring a whole bunch of new enemy types, as well as new mission types. Players will need to locate and destroy the Hive Lung in the tunnels to stem the spread of the Gloom, as well as escorting a mobile oil rig across treacherous terrain.
</p>
<p>
The update will also arrive with a new Dust Devils premium Warbond. This will include a primary weapon, a new throwable, and three unique strategems, in addition to new armours, capes, and more - details in the image below.

            <p>Sony has pushed an update live to the PlayStation store that makes refunds considerably easier.</p>
<p>The new process, which can only be done on the PlayStation website or app, goes as follows: navigate to the PlayStation store and select the three dots in the top right corner to access your transaction history. From there, you should be able to select your past purchases and request refunds.</p>
<p>Previously, PlayStation users would have to use an online assistant, basically a chat bot, to negotiate a refund. The requirements for a refund remain the same: only a product bought within the last 14 days is valid, and you can't have begun the process of downloading or playing it. That is, unless what you bought is faulty, in which case these requirements may be circumvented.</p>

<p>It's a nice little update that should make those 2am reflex purchases of Detroit Become Human feel a little less rancid the next day. Also, anything that takes away those pesky chat bot supports is a good update in my book. This comes alongside a selection of other improvements made to the PS Plus store as of late, including additional accessibility options and Apple Pay support.</p>

		<p>Playing My Hero Academia: All’s Justice highlights one big thing for me: I really need to catch up and watch the anime. I think I’m at least three seasons behind now, and the eighth and final season is about to air in just over a month, but on top of all that, there’s a new series-capping game coming with My Hero Academia: All’s Justice.</p>
<p><iframe title="MY HERO ACADEMIA: All’s Justice | Battle Systems Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5QUi-Mrzrnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Just as with the previous games, this is a 3v3 3D arena battler, but with the jump to the final season, we have a roster stuffed full of characters who’ve now reached maturity and levelled up all their abilities. Where Shoto was a rough around the edged glass cannon at the start of the series –&nbsp;for reasons that were quickly revealed –&nbsp;he’s now mastered the powers of One For All, able to call upon more layers of inherited abilities than before.</p>


<p>One of the main draws here will naturally be playing through the story mode and reliving the various staged battles between heroes and villains depicted in the Final War arc of the manga and anime, but then there’s also just all the wish-fulfilment and fun of creating distinctly mixed up fighting trios and pitting them head to head. I stuck with the good vs. bad divide, and had a lot of fun with with the baddies, who definitely had the feel of being more powerful.</p>


<p>Combat revolves around four core actions, with a locked-on target combo, a guard and counter-attack, and an unblockable attack to break through a stern defence. Being able to dash and get out of the way of an attack is key, but so too is being able to quickly swap characters and resume the fight with a different set of powers and abilities. Bakugo’s explosive fists are better at short range, while Todoroki’s mixed fire and ice give him enhanced movement and a bit more range, so you could adjust to a rival’s tactics. Of course, if one of your fighters is knocked out, then your options become a bit more limited!</p>
<p>New for this game is the Rising meter. This builds up as you fight, eventually filling a meter until you can trigger it and boost the power of your character with increased attack power, movement speed and recovery speed – it’s a pretty big bump, and it’s automatically granted to you when reduced to your last character, which is nice.</p>
<p>And then there’s the Plus Ultra abilities, which can be used to trigger a Plus Ultra Combo and bring your full squad in for a devastating combo attack of character switching.</p>

<p>While there’s no doubt going to be a lot of returning players diving into All’s Justice, work has been put in to try and make this more accessible with a new single-button auto-combo to take off some of the load while trying to keep pace with the battling. It’s definitely a bit of a help, given how difficult it is just to maintain distance and positioning sometimes, but it’s intended as just a stepping stone up to the regular control scheme.</p>
<p>All-in-all, this feels like a solid evolution of the One’s Justice games and should be a great way to wrap up the series in video game form, adding a few gameplay tweaks and with a smidgeon of added accessibility.&nbsp;Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to go and figure out where I got up to in the anime…</p>
