			<p>More information on Monster Hunter Wilds will be coming next week during a Showcase stream, CAPCOM confirmed.</p>
<p>The stream, which will air at 7:00 AM PDT / 3:00 PM BST / 4:00 PM CET, will be presented by the Monster Hunter Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto. A small teaser for the event was shared today, and you can check it out below.</p>

<p>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1846476675980144662?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With Monster Hunter Wilds getting closer to its late February release date, it's no surprise to see promotion ramping up in preparation for what is likely to be one of the most successful game releases of the generation. The team is also continuing to work hard on the game to ensure <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-optimization/">a well-optimized experience on all platforms.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on February 28th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about how some of the new features impact the series' formula by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">hands-on preview.</a></p>
<p><em>While riding on a Seikret allows the hunter to use ranged weapons, having never really used the bow or the bowguns, I opted to go with the two weapons I was more comfortable with: the Long Sword and the Great Sword. Needless to say, I felt instantly at home with both, although my lack of knowledge of Doshaguma forced me to go for more forgiving Foresight Slashes than Iai Spirit Slashes with the Long sword. Though familiar, I appreciated some welcome changes for both weapons. The Long Sword's basic combo string and Foresight Slash, for example, are both enhanced when the Hunter reaches the highest Spirit level, giving users more reasons to hold onto their powered-up Spirit Thrusts and stay at the red Spirit level for longer. For the Greatsword, on the other hand, I did not have much time to discover all the new tweaks that the game will introduce, but the weapon felt as slow yet powerful as it always did, featuring the full array of moves seen in Monster Hunter World.</em></p>

The 14-day Game Pass trial was removed on October 8th, preventing people from signing up for a trial and playing through the <em>Black Ops 6</em> campaign without paying for a full month of Game Pass.</p><p>Microsoft first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/26/23657627/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-trial-offer-stopped">stopped its $1 trial</a> for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass in March last year, before bringing it back and nerfing it down to just 14 days instead of a full month. The Xbox maker then <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-pulls-1-xbox-game-pass-trial-just-days-before-starfield-release-date">briefly removed</a> the $1 trial just days before <em>Starfield</em>’s debut in September.</p><p>It’s not surprising to see the $1 Xbox Game Pass trial quietly removed once again, especially as Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">looks to <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></a> to boost its Game Pass subscriber numbers. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango">I reported earlier this year</a>&nbsp;that Microsoft had been debating whether to put new releases of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>into Game Pass, with concerns from some at the company that the revenue generated from typical&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;sales would be undermined by Game Pass. A $1 trial would certainly undermine sales and subscriptions, especially when Activision traditionally sells more than 20 million copies of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;on average, at around $70 each.</p><p>Microsoft is also planning to bring <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, <em>Modern Warfare III</em>, and <em>Warzone</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/14/24269925/xbox-cloud-gaming-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-support">to Xbox Cloud Gaming later this month</a>. This is the first time a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;game has been available at launch on Xbox Cloud Gaming, following Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But are there plans to shut the game down? Not so, its chief developer has insisted.</p><p>Rumors began circulating this week that support for XDefiant could come to an end after Season 4, which closes out XDefiant's Year 1 roadmap, if its player count failed to improve. Ubisoft has yet to announce player numbers or revenue figures for XDefiant, with Guillemot promising to say more at the end of October.</p><p>Now, XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin, who works at Ubisoft’s San Francisco development studio, has responded to those rumors, insisting the company does not plan to shut the game down after Season 4.</p><p>However, in-line with Guillemot’s comments, Rubin — who was an executive producer on Call of Duty before making the switch to Ubisoft — admitted player numbers are down. This, Rubin said, was because Ubisoft has done “very little marketing” as it works to improve the game. Once XDefiant is in “a better place”, the marketing push will begin, Rubin said.</p><p>“To be crystal clear there are NO plans to shut down after Season 4,” Rubin <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1846272225491484763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. “I've literally been in meetings as of last week to discuss our Year 2 plans. But, right now we are super focused on improving the technical experience (which includes netcode) and adding more content for Seasons 3 &amp; 4.</p><p>“We have done very little marketing so yes our numbers are down but that is just to give the team the time to get the game in a better place before we do bigger spends on marketing to bring new players to the game and to bring back players that have left.”</p><p>XDefiant launched into the brutal live service shooter market at a time when it had already claimed a number of high-profile victims. Rocksteady's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> flopped to the tune of $200 million after Starbreeze's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a> suffered a disastrous launch last year. Since then, things have only got more difficult, with Sony's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a> going down as one of the biggest PlayStation disasters of all time.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ubisoft has endured an awful year with the aforementioned disappointing return from XDefiant and, most recently, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws"><u>Star Wars Outlaws</u></a>. It <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025"><u>delayed Assassin’s Creed Shadows</u></a> into 2025 following poor sales of Outlaws, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-france-strike-called-over-return-to-office-order-and-pay-dispute"><u>its staff in France are currently on strike</u></a>.</p><p>In its recent note to investors, Guillemot acknowledged that the company's "second quarter fell short of expectations" and vowed to launch "a review aimed at further improving our execution." He also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda"><u>addressed some of the cultural conversations</u></a> happening around the company lately, which have intensified around Star Wars Outlaws and the upcoming Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p><p>Things have got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family and shareholder Tencent are reportedly considering teaming up to take the company private following the collapse of its share price.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ubisoft has ditched Epic Games Store timed exclusivity for its PC games and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-returning-to-day-1-steam-releases-starting-with-assassins-creed-shadows"><u>gone back to day-one launches on Steam</u></a>, a move clearly designed to boost flagging sales of its games. Ubisoft has yet to announce a Steam launch for XDefiant, but it feels like a certainty at this point.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Legendary Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu is not retiring from video game music work, despite rumours.</p>
<p>Confusion appears to have arisen following a <a href="https://x.com/Fantasian_EN/status/1846128890856800462">promotional video for the release of Fantasian: Neo Dimension</a>, Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi's RPG for which Uematsu composed the score.</p>
<p>"This is my final project as a composer of video game music," he said. "I hope you'll pick it up and play it! Thanks for your support!"</p>

<p>Fans presumed this meant Uematsu was retiring, but he's since confirmed this is a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>"Wait, wait, wait! Everybody calm down!," he wrote. "There seems to be some misunderstanding, but I'm not retiring from video game music work!</p>
<p>"I'm going to cut back a bit on my video game music work because I want to have more time to make the music I want to make. It would be difficult for me to take on the entire soundtrack of a video game because the time commitment for composing would be too long, but I would like to continue to work on jobs such as one theme song."</p>

<p>This is in line with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-likely-wont-compose-a-full-game-score-again">previous comments from Uematsu</a> from earlier in the year.</p>
<p>"As far as Final Fantasy is concerned, I'm still involved by writing the main themes for the games," he said back in February. "But I don't think I'll compose music for a whole game again.</p>
<p>"You would have to give it full throttle for two or three years. And I don't think I have the physical and mental strength to do it anymore."</p>
<p>Then, in April, he confirmed he'd be returning to the Final Fantasy series to write a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-composer-uematsu-returning-for-remake-trilogy-finale">new theme song for the third part of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy</a>.</p>
<p>Rebirth creative director Tetsuya Nomura asked Uematsu: "I'd like to believe you're a lock for the next title?"</p>
<p>Uematsu replied: "It'd be my honour. Really I'm honoured you're even extending the offer."</p>
<p>Uematsu composed the scores for Final Fantasy 1 - 9, and has contributed to many games since either with co-composers or providing individual songs.</p>
<p>His focus now, though, is his band Uematsu Nobuo conTIKI, as seen in the social post above.</p>
<p>Fantasian: Neo Dimension will be released on 5th December across Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam).</p>
<p>It's a cult classic RPG that's now been freed from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a>, though it loses tactility in the transition, as I wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-creators-fantasian-is-a-cult-classic-rpg-now-freed-from-apple-arcade-but-tactility-is-lost-in-the-transition">Eurogamer Fantasian: Neo Dimension preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Remedy fans are eager to learn the release date of the Alan Wake 2 Lake House expansion. Well, according to a fresh 'leak' via EB Games New Zealand (<a href="https://x.com/PlotPointsYT/status/1846464652576018642" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by X user PlotPointsYT), the second DLC for Remedy's game might be released on October 22.</p>
<p>The website <a href="https://www.ebgames.co.nz/product/ps5/309072-alan-wake-ii-deluxe-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lists</a> Alan Wake 2 Deluxe Edition with the following disclaimer:</p>
<p><em>*** Please note due to the global release of Alan Wake 2: Deluxe Edition, the in disc DLC for the Lake House Expansion will not unlock until midnight on 22nd Oct 2024.</em></p>
<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-dlc-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew</a> Alan Wake 2 Lake House would launch this October, and there's not much time left in the month anyway. During the September 2024 State of Play, we got our first look at the DLC, which will see players step into the shoes of Federal Bureau of Control agent Kiran Estevez for an adventure parallel to the events seen in the first game. Originally mentioned in Control, Estevez is the Lead Agent of Investigations Unit Beta. Portrayed by actress Janina Gavankar, she says in the trailer:</p>
<p><em>This isn't the Bureau's first time in Bright Falls. The FBC's research department set up a facility, The Lake House. If I had any clue what was waiting for us in there... I would've just kept on driving.</em></p>
<p>The titular Lake House is a secret research facility on the shores of Cauldron Lake, used by the Federal Bureau of Control to study the paranatural effects of the lake and the dark presence within it. Remedy said Alan Wake 2 Lake House would be a chilling survival horror experience, in contrast to the more whimsical stories seen in the first story DLC, which nonetheless got an 8.5/10 score in Wccftech's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>While it does not offer much in terms of gameplay, the Alan Wake 2: Night Springs expansion is a worthy DLC to experience for all fans of the base game and Remedy Entertainment's titles. Free from the limitations imposed by the base game's narrative, which was fairly loose to begin with, Sam Lake and his team have gone all out to provide some extremely entertaining scenarios that, unfortunately, are over way too soon and leave the player wanting more. Hopefully, the next expansion, Lake House, will offer something a bit meatier to complement the masterful storytelling that is as well showcased in Night Springs as it is in the base game.</em></p>

        <p>32 people are out of work</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Riot Games are cutting more jobs at their studios, the company announced today. This is the second time in a year the League of Legends developer has laid off workers. Chairman and co-founder of Riot, Marc Merrill, made the announcement yesterday, claiming that by cutting these jobs the company was "evolving League" and "investing heavily in solving today’s challenges". A total of 32 people have lost their jobs, mostly workers on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>, according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-developer-riot-games-announces-second-round-of-layoffs-this-year">a figure the developer gave</a> to our sister site <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This isn’t about reducing headcount to save money," said Merrill in <a href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/article/1846243708100091985">a post on Xitter</a>, "it’s about making sure we have the right expertise so that League continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond." </p>
<p>In January Riot announced they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-to-fire-around-530-people-and-shut-down-riot-forge-label-in-push-for-sustainability">slashing 530 jobs</a>, a total of 11% of their global workforce. Today's figure is significantly lower than those previous cuts, but that won't make things easier for those who've lost work. As is normally the case with layoffs, the workers will get severance pay, but Merrill also says they will also get six months health coverage as "support". </p>
<p>"Success isn’t about throwing more people or money at a challenge," Merrill goes on. "We’ve seen small teams at Riot (and elsewhere) build incredible things, while large teams (both at Riot and elsewhere) miss the mark.</p>
<p>"While the League team will ultimately be larger after these changes, what matters more than size is having the right team, right priorities, and a sustainable approach to delivering what players need."</p>
<p>Previous years have seen similar numbers of staff cut from the same studio, such as in January of 2023 when 46 workers were laid off as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-lay-off-46-staff-this-is-part-of-our-normal-course-of-our-business">"part of our normal course of business"</a>. In the wider games industry, job losses continue to affect many. Here are some of the more recent layoffs, along with the unhelpful euphemisms each company has used to linguistically mask the real human cost of someone losing their job. </p>
<ul>
<li>Hi-Rez studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-rez-studios-lay-off-unknown-number-of-workers-to-give-smite-2-a-sustainable-future">"reprioritized"</a> an unspoken number of workers.</li>
<li>Lost Boys <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-iv-support-studio-hit-by-layoffs-putting-139-people-out-of-work-proving-that-embracers-restructuring-is-not-over">"reduced"</a> 139 people.</li>
<li>Take Two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-take-two-cancel-games-and-lay-off-hundreds-to-rationalize-their-pipeline">"rationalized"</a> hundreds of employees. </li>
<li>Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">"aligned"</a> a total of 650 workers. </li>
<li>EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email">"sunsetted"</a> around 670 people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Layoffs and job losses are common enough in any business, but they do appear to have been especially frequent in the last few years within the gaming industry. It's important to remember that behind each number there is a person who has groceries to buy and electricity bills to pay. To say that you cut off their source of income to "evolve", like some hideous Pokémon, is not comforting or useful, nor an accurate reflection of what has actually happened.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Sony has confirmed that the Until Dawn movie will be released on April 25th, 2025 through its Screen Gems company (via <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/until-dawn-sony-screen-gems-release-david-f-sandberg-1236116823/">Deadline</a>). <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/18/until-dawn-movie/">The Until Dawn movie</a> was announced earlier this year, with David F Sandberg sitting in the director’s seat. He has previously directed horror movies Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation, as well as the more lighthearted superhero movie Shazam!</p>
<p><iframe title="Until Dawn&nbsp;2015 vs. 2024 – Is the remake worth it?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oiW6-ZUKb5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Until Dawn’s cast includes Peter Stormare, who has a long career of acting in big blockbusters as well as in videogames, Michael Cimino, Ella Rubin, Ji-young Yoo, Belmont Cameli, Odessa A’zion, and Maia Mitchell. How Until Dawn will translate to the cinematic screen remains to be seen, as the game has multiple branches and endings to it depending on player choices. For all we know, there will be multiple versions of the movie with different outcomes, or it will set its own unique ending different to the ones found in the game. Until Dawn’s story follows a group of young adults who are staying at a remote lodge on Blackwood Mountain which, unbeknownst to them, is a hunting ground of sorts and they are they prey. Every playable character in Until Dawn can be killed off at any moment, depending on the player’s own decisions, which is why it is almost impossible to predict which story path the movie will take.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/">Until Dawn Review</a></h2>
<p>Until Dawn was recently remade and released, following its original release in 2014. In our review for the remake of Until Dawn, Tuffcub said, <em>“Until Dawn remains a fantastic horror game with great acting and plenty of jump scares to get you out of your seat. While not essential for anyone that enjoyed the original game, this remake brings it to a new audience and is a solid update to what was already a great game.”</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant-isn%E2%80%99t-shutting-down-after-season-4-says-producer.1010670/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-isnt-shutting-down-after-season-4-says-producer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>XDefiant launched to great numbers in its first five weeks, with Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-registered-11-million-players-in-five-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming </a>that over 11 million players checked out the free-to-play first-person shooter during that initial timeframe. However, the situation quickly worsened due to players leaving in droves.</p>
<p>In late August, only around three months after the release, insider Tom Henderson said that Ubisoft had become unhappy with player numbers and the microtransactions (or lack thereof) that come with it. Henderson also said that developer Ubisoft San Francisco was given until the end of Season 4.&nbsp;The news certainly made XDefiant fans uncomfortable, especially since Henderson is usually very well-informed on the publisher's plans. However, a few hours ago, Executive Producer Mark Rubin took to Twitter (X) to <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1846272225491484763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirm</a> the game won't be shut down after Season 4; on the contrary, the studio is working on improving the situation.</p>
<p><em>To be crystal clear, there are NO plans to shut down after season 4. I've literally been in meetings as of last week to discuss our Year 2 plans. But, right now, we are super focused on improving the technical experience (which includes netcode) and adding more content for Seasons 3 &amp; 4. We have done very little marketing, so yes, our numbers are down, but that is just to give the team the time to get the game in a better place before we do bigger spends on marketing to bring new players to the game and to bring back players that have left.</em></p>
<p>XDefiant is currently in the middle of its second season. The next season is scheduled to add a new faction, three new maps and weapons, a new mode and map type, a 'Bots Mode', private matches, limited-time modes, daily rewards, a Prestige system, a faction mastery system, badges, and a death replay cam. The fourth season will also add a new faction, three new maps and weapons, a new device, a major event takeover, weapons mastery 2.0, weapon skill challenges, and vote to surrender in ranked matches.</p>

<p>You might have caught this one during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everything-announced-and-featured-at-day-of-the-devs-2024-in-one-place">Day Of The Devs</a> earlier this year. It’s stuck with me since because the developer Tanat seemed like a rad dude, and also because there’s nothing I cherish more than taking a bad pun and just absolutely going to town on it, marrow and all. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/building-relationships">Building Relationships</a> is about buildings forming relationships in a Love Islandy scenario, though without the reality TV framing you might find in say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crush-house">Crush House</a>. But the real gag here is the commitment to the bit. Besides that, it’s just a really charming and fun N64-style 3D platformer.</p>
<p>It also features the sort wonky physics that definitely wouldn’t get Ninty’s seal of quality, but work brilliantly here, especially since your character consists largely of angles but still insists on, you know, performing motions.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2666920/Building_Relationships/">The demo</a> sees you roll around the island meeting other structures. Some of them have quests for you. Some of them just want to evangelise about bouldering. You can introduce yourself as either ‘Billding’ or ‘Cementha’. You can go fishing for minivans and collect coins, but you can also just make your own joy, especially once you find the double jump and dash upgrades. One secret criteria I use to weight a game’s soul on my scales is whether it’s fun to climb things just for the sake of climbing them; to be <em>at advanced height </em>- in a position of <em>aerial bigitude</em>. It absolutely is here. Some hidden coins don’t hurt, either, but I must insist:</p><p>Please get a sound for when I collect a coin. Collecting a coin without a jingly sound feels like getting fizzy nose then not sneezing. It would have ruined my day, but then I noticed that my house simply would not stop hopping between where their feet should be during conversations. It made it look like they really needed a piss, which spurred me onward.</p>
<p>Also, the camera is a little drunk. Not super drunk, but it’s definitely had a few. It’s a bit stubborn in a wonky sort of way.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/building-relationships-pooping.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Tan Ant Games/Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The conversations are fun though. There’s several upgrade chests hidden about named ‘chester’. The one by the beach asks me if I identify more as a bottom floor or a rooftop (disgusting <a href="https://www.ancon.co.uk/projects/sports-leisure/switch-house-tate-modern-extension-london">Switch house </a>erasure). The boathouse is stuck on the lake so wants me to go around finding every fish. Eventually I get invited to a picnic, where I have to build flatpack furniture in another minigame. The flatpack furniture is only about 70% as frustrating as its real-life counterpart to assemble.</p><p>The demo doesn’t extend much beyond there. Stray too far on the island, and you’ll run into ‘relationship barriers’ which prevent further exploring. But there’s still plenty of nooks to explore. A tip: no matter how high you think you can get, and fast you think you can fly across the island, you can probably do it higher and faster. You probably don’t need me to tell you that whether you enjoy this one or not is going to be very vibes-based. But that’s dating, and also exactly what demos are for.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/corsair-9000d-pc-case/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/corsair%E2%80%99s-9000d-pc-case-is-a-monster-that-can-fit-two-mobos-and-eighteen-fans.1010643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/corsair-9000d-pc-case/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Corsair’s monstrous 9000D Super Full-Tower PC Case has just launched, bearing an eye-watering price tag of $499.99 and boasting a gargantuan profile that can accommodate two entire PC setups, making it perfect for the dedicated content creator. It’s a hulking thing that can fit up to 18 fans, configured nicely with the InfiniRail mounting system.</p>



<p>If you’re thinking of investing in this case, you’ll need a lot of room – it’s not unfair to say this is one of the biggest PC cases ever released.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-big-becomes-massive">When Big Becomes Massive</h2>



<p>Corsair’s PC cases are typically phenomenal things. I run a 5000X Mid-Tower case that’s pretty huge, but the 9000D positively dominates my build.</p>



<p>The super-sized 9000D case can accommodate up to <strong>six </strong>SSDs and <strong>five </strong>HDDs, but the main talking point here is that you can fit two PC setups in the box, both running independently of one another. If you’re a streamer, that means your streaming PC and your gaming PC can be housed in the same unit, which is an utter win.</p>



<p>It comes in white or black, but regardless of which colour you pick, you’ll be getting a beast of a case that stands at 698mm (69cm) tall. By comparison, my 5000X case is a measly 520mm tall. The 9000D is 307mm wide, and when built, it weighs a <strong>ridiculous </strong>~30 KG.</p>



<p>On the front of the case, you’ll get four USB 3.2 A ports and two USB-C ports, as well as a headphone and microphone combo jack. Everything about the case has been designed to accommodate accessibility and easy building – Corsair has spared no expense in the creature comforts poured into this unit. </p>



<p>The 9000D PC case is available now from Corsair.</p>



<p>I’d have asked for a review unit, but I’m not sure it’d fit through my front door.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/asmongold-banned-twitch-racist-comments/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/asmongold-banned-twitch-racist-comments/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Zack ‘Asmongold’ Hoyt has been banned on Twitch after a controversial rant during a recent stream. While on air, Hoyt slammed the Palestinian people, stating that they’re ‘from an inferior culture’ and making comments suggesting they’d be leading a genocide if they had access to enough weaponry.</p>



<p>After branding Palestinians as ‘terrible people’, Hoyt drew backlash across social media from creators tearing into his views. Shortly after, he was banned on Twitch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-was-way-too-much-of-an-asshole">‘I Was Way Too Much of an Asshole’</h2>



<p>In the wake of his main account being banned on Twitch, Asmongold took the opportunity to apologise for his statements on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Looking back on it, I was way too much of an asshole about the Palestine thing </p>



<p>My bad </p>



<p>Of course no one deserves to have their life destroyed even if they do things or have views I find regressive </p>



<p>You guys deserve more than me saying stupid shit like that, I’ll do better</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The account that has been banned is Zackrawrr, his main channel and the one that played host to his recent rant. His alt channel, Asmongold, is still live, but it’s unclear how long that’ll be the case. Twitch is typically pretty tough on streamers ‘circumventing’ a ban by broadcasting on another channel.</p>



<p>This is far from being the first controversy that Asmongold has found himself embroiled in. The 34-year-old streamer has always been vocal about his opinions, and it often pulls many into a pot-kettle-black type of debate. </p>



<p>One of the things Asmongold is notorious for is his way of living, which typically involves being surrounded by garbage and squalor as he streams to an audience of almost two million followers.</p>



<p>Do you think Asmongold was out of line for what he said? Let us know in the comments.</p>

Danmaku battles faster than you’ve ever seen will unfold in the skies of Gensokyo as you use your mobility to dodge countless bullets flying at you with a variety of spells.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>A meteorite suddenly crashes into Gensokyo.</p><p>A crack appears on its metallic, egg-like surface, and small particles of light shine through the cracks, and they scatter all at once, in all directions.</p><p>Eventually, they reach the most powerful residents of Gensokyo.</p><p>One of these lights reaches Reimu Hakurei. It engulfs her, as it transforms into what looks like a suit of armor.</p><p>A name echoes in her head, and she repeats it out loud:</p><p>“Valkyrie Arms…”</p><p>Sensing the beginnings of an incident, she sighs and looks off in the direction which the light came from.</p><p>She floats up into the air, and is gone in the blink of an eye, leaving nothing but a red trail of light behind her.</p><p>“My body feels so light…”</p><p>Flying faster than ever before, Reimu realizes that her armor—her Valkyrie Arms—are to thank for her newfound speed.</p><p>Who gave her this power, and for what purpose? To find the reason behind it all, Reimu hurries on her way… but it doesn’t take long before someone stands in her way.</p><p>“Looks like I’m not the only one.”</p><p>Standing before Reimu is another girl, similarly clad in a set of Valkyrie Arms. They were both granted the same power, and they both know what must be done…</p><p>And thus, a high-speed danmaku battle begins.</p><p><em>Valkyrie of Phantasm</em> is based on the <em>Touhou</em> series, but has a brand new original story with the creators’ own interpretations of the world and characters.

                <p>A very cool edition of one of the best metroidvanias in recent memory is on sale at Amazon for a limited time. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQRXS8Q2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blasphemous 2's Limited Collector's Edition</a></strong>, which released in August, is up for grabs for $85 (was $100). Only the PlayStation 5 version is available for this price, as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQRX2B8V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch edition still costs the full $100</a>. That said, you're getting <em>a lot </em>of extras here, more than what's offered with some collector's editions that costs twice as much.</p><p>Blasphemous 2's well-realized gothic world, haunting enemies, and methodical combat make it a great choice for fans of Castlevania and Dark Souls. The first game in the series was good, but the sequel is much better (and bigger). It's worth noting there's a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blasphemous-2-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0C94VTNSP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">standard physical edition available for $30 for Switch</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blasphemous-2-Xbox-X/dp/B0C9522912?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$25 for Xbox Series X</a> (the PS5 version is sold out), but Blasphemous 2's Limited Collector's Edition looks pretty darn cool.</p><h2>Blasphemous 2 Limited Collector's Edition for PS5</h2><p><strong>$85 (<del>$100</del>)</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4385229-blasphemous2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385229" data-ratio="0.71266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4385229-blasphemous2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4385229"></a><figcaption>Blasphemous 2 Limited Collector's Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4385229-blasphemous2.jpg"></figure><p>Here's everything you get with Blasphemous 2's Limited Collector's Edition:</p><ul><li>Collector's Edition box</li><li>Steelbook</li><li>Collector’s CD cover</li><li>Digital soundtrack</li><li>Instruction manual</li><li>Two CDs with music by Carlos Viola</li><li>Game Guide with 60+ pages</li><li>Marca Del Martirio metal coin</li><li>Art cards set with 3 new illustrations</li><li>Certificate of Authenticity</li><li>Album of illustrations with more than 60 pages</li></ul><hr><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blasphemous-2-review-unholy-pilgrimage/1900-6418101/" data-ref-id="1900-6418101">Blasphemous 2 review</a> awarded it a 9/10, praising its improvements over the original along with its brooding art style.</p><p>"Blasphemous 2 follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, mixing its unique and harrowing aesthetic with a gameplay amalgam of Metroidvanias and Souls-likes," wrote critic Richard Wakeling. "Where the first game faltered, however, its sequel makes significant improvements, resulting in a thrilling adventure that doesn't run out of steam."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1420391287"

            <p>
As Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 continues to work through its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-post-launch-roadmap-promises-free-new-modes-missions-and-more">previously detailed Year One post-launch roadmap</a>, developer Saber Interactive has offered a glimpse of the sci-fi shooter's new PvE operation - featuring the imposing Hierophant Bio-Titan Tyranid - and Lethal Difficulty mode ahead of their release "very, very soon".
</p>
<p>
As announced back in August, Space Marine 2's first year of post-launch content will be spread across four seasons. Season 1 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-gets-more-helpful-and-effective-bots-private-lobbies-and-more">arrived in September</a>, introducing the likes of private PvE lobbies and a new Battle Barge sparring arena. And with Season 2 poised to launch imminently, Saber has now dug a little deeper into what it'll bring, courtesy of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aTR-9RYPu0">new overview trailer</a> below.
</p>
<p>
For starters, there's that new PvE operation, taking players and their squads back to Kadaku to face the Hierophant Bio-Titan - a creature described as the "biggest and most terrifying Tyranid yet". And if that's not enough to be getting on with, Season 2 also introduces a Lethal Difficulty setting for operations mode that's designed to "test [players] skills against the most brutal Xenos and heretics". Oh and there's the new Neo-Volkite pistol in the armoury, should you be looking to add a bit of variety to your slaughter.

<p>
Everything above will arrive in a free update for all Space Marine 2 players, and Season Pass owners also get a range of new Dark Angel themed cosmetics at the same time. These includes the Weapon Skin Pack (bringing new looks for the auto bolt, rifle, plasma pistol, and power sword), plus the Champion Pack, which includes a full-body armour skin for the Bulwark class, a unique shield, and other additions - all of which also feature in the Season 2 trailer above.
</p><p>
Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2's Season 2 update will arrive for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC "very, very soon". It'll be followed by more new content as Year One continues, including additional PvE operations, new PvP maps, and a survival-based Horde Mode.

            <p>
Sony's live-action movie adaptation of developer Supermassive's acclaimed PS4 cinematic horror game Until Dawn is set to hit the big screen on 25th April next year.
</p>
<p>
An Until Dawn movie was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-slasher-horror-until-dawn-is-being-turned-into-movie">officially announced</a> back in January, with Shazam and Lights Out director David F. Sandberg helming the production based on a script by Blair Butler and It, Annabelle, and The Nun scribe Gary Dauberman. It stars Ella Rubin (The Idea of You), Michael Cimino (Love Victor), Ji-young Yoo (Expats), Odessa A'zion (Hellraiser), Maia Mitchell, and Peter Stormare - who'll be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-sees-peter-stormare-reprise-his-role-as-dr-hill">reprising his role</a> as psychiatrist Dr Hill from the game.
</p>
<p>
An Until Dawn movie has, admittedly, bit of a strange proposition from the start, given the whole point of Supermassive's original game (which released for PS4 back in 2015) was to let players live out their own trope-y teen slasher movie, navigating a whole bunch of classic genre conventions to see who lives and dies based on their choices. So an Until Dawn movie shorn of the interactive bits would largely just be a slightly naff slasher film.

<p>
Still, Sony's big screen adaptation - previously described as an "R-rated love letter to the horror genre" - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/filming-on-the-until-dawn-movie-has-wrapped">confirmed to have wrapped filming</a> earlier this month, and now <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/until-dawn-sony-screen-gems-release-david-f-sandberg-1236116823/">Deadline reports</a> it's set to hit cinemas on 25th April next year.
</p><p>
It arrives in the wake of Sony's recent Until Dawn remake for PC and PS5, which gave the original a striking makeover, but - as Digital Foundry's Will Judd <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-until-dawn-on-ps5-has-scary-technical-issues">recently explained</a> - released on a "shaky technical footing". But despite its slightly mixed reception, Sony seemingly has big plans for the franchise given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-leak-points-to-potential-sequel">hints of a sequel</a> in addition to the imminent movie version.
</p>
<p>
Until Dawn joins an increasingly long line-up of PlayStation games that've received the adaptation treatment for film or TV in recent years, with varying degrees of success. Sony's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a> and Gran Turismo movies didn't exactly dazzle when they launched in 2022 and 2023 respectively, but last year's nine-episode HBO adaptation of The Last of Us was a huge critical and commercial hit, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-we-know-about-the-last-of-us-season-2">second season on the way</a>. Still to come are big screen adaptations of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, Jack and Daxter, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gravity-rush">Gravity Rush</a>, with a TV adaptation of God of War also confirmed.

This time around, the show is hosted by Flip and not a random celebrity, like Shanon Doherty or Tracy Morgan. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.usanetwork.com/usa-insider/who-is-the-host-of-the-scare-tactics-reboot-flip&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.usanetwork.com/usa-insider/who-is-the-host-of-the-scare-tactics-reboot-flip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flip is described</a></span> as a “spectral pre-teen obsessed with horror movies and fascinated by human fear.” I’m not sure Flip, with his giant TV head and off-brand Crypt Keeper vibes, really works, but it also doesn’t matter. <em>Scare Tactics</em> has seen multiple host changes and various visual rebrandings over the last two decades and it never diminished the true joy of the show: Watching random people get thrown into terrifying and spooky situations and seeing what happens. And thankfully, this new version of <em>Scare Tactics</em> doesn’t mess with that aspect of the formula at all. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/I-3lXW-RcFQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/I-3lXW-RcFQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The first episode of <em>Scare Tactics</em></a></span>, which is available now (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/8IhrA4g2Vf8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/8IhrA4g2Vf8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">along with the second episode</a></span>) on YouTube, is a perfect return for the new series as it demonstrates that this version of the show can nail the wild paranormal pranks as well as the more tense, slower paced ones, too. </p><p>In the first prank, a man ends up as a witness to a wedding featuring a very pregnant woman and her husband. But slowly, it becomes clear that these people are probably part of some devil-worshipping cult and her baby ain’t human. The other prank in the first episode of <em>Scare Tactics</em> features a man who has been invited to a fancy dinner featuring exotic foods. Eventually, the meal takes a turn and he’s served what he thinks is human flesh. The tension of whether he will, like the actors tricking him, eat it or not is wonderful. </p><p>Here’s the second episode of the show, featuring some WWE superstars and a creepy doll that leads someone to a deadly clown. </p><p>Of course, every prank ends with someone revealing the truth to the victim and letting them relax and laugh off what just happened. It’s always enjoyable to watch people change instantly the moment their brains realize that they aren’t in danger but are actually just on a prank show. The mix of anger, relief, and joy always makes me giggle. </p><p><em>Scare Tactics </em>is a perfect show to watch during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-halloween-update-fortnightmares-all-new-skins-1851670757&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-halloween-update-fortnightmares-all-new-skins-1851670757">Halloween</a></span> (the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@ScareTactics&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@ScareTactics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old pranks are up on YouTube, too</a></span>) because it’s like a collection of horror anthology films from multiple genres, but starring real people who have authentic and varied reactions to the terrible events around them. </p><p><em>Scare Tactics </em>is a perfect show to watch with friends as a palette cleanser between films in a horror movie marathon<em>. </em>It’ll make you laugh and argue about who in your group would be the most terrified by a certain prank.

There are new motion control-centric modes like Toad’s Item Factory and Paratroopa Flight School. The titular Jamboree mechanic refers to allies that players can collect by winning mini-games during matches, while a new Pro Rules setting lets players remove much of the series’ chaotic RNG from the equation. </p><p>The results sound mostly positive so far, though the true legacy of a <em>Mario Party</em> game is never revealed until weeks and months into its life when fans have been able to experience every little wrinkle ad nauseum. <em>Jamboree</em> has an 84 on Metacritic so far, higher than both <em>Super Mario Party</em> and <em>Mario Party Superstars</em>. <em>Giant Bomb</em>’s Dan Ryckert, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-party-jamboree-review-this-party-is-too-crowded/1900-6418300/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-party-jamboree-review-this-party-is-too-crowded/1900-6418300/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviewing the game for <em>GameSpot</em></a></span>, praised its maps as some of the best in the series but was less impressed by the variety and creativity of the mini-games. </p><p>Catherine Castle, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-party-jamboree-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-party-jamboree-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writing for<em> Eurogamer</em></a></span> was less impressed still. “It just has the misfortune of not being very fun, and mistakes the volatility of chance and happenstance for being the same thing as competitive satisfaction that comes from playing a good game well,” she wrote. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Digital Trends</em>’ Giovanni Colantonio</a></span> was also down on <em>Jamboree</em>’s mini-games, but was more optimistic about side modes and what they might portend for the future direction of the series. </p><p>According to<em> VGC</em>, however, the game is still one of the best in the <em>Mario Party</em> series overall. “It still hasn’t managed to shake some of the core issues of the series (especially when it comes to balancing the game for younger and less experienced players) but judged against previous entries it stands out as a top offering,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/super-mario-party-jamboree/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/super-mario-party-jamboree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviewer Chris Scullion</a></span> concluded. Here’s what other reviewers thought of Mario Party’s latest outing on Switch.</p><hr><h2 id="h100604"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Not only does it faithfully return to the classic formula established in the Nintendo 64 entries, it confidently improves upon it with a fantastic set of boards that introduce unique and memorable mechanics. It’s also the most flexible <em>Mario Party</em> has ever been, with tons of ways to customize your game, including its brilliant new optional Pro Rules that reduce luck-based elements to a minimum and crank up the strategy for those who want it.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h100605"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-party-jamboree-review-this-party-is-too-crowded/1900-6418300/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-party-jamboree-review-this-party-is-too-crowded/1900-6418300/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GameSpot</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree </em>has the unenviable task of following<em> Superstars</em>, a game composed of the best minigames throughout the entire series. Ultimately, the quality difference is noticeable. Most of the new minigames are fine at best, with some standouts like Slappy Go Round, Prime Cut, and Unfriendly Flying Object. But for every genuine crowd-pleaser, there’s one that would make me groan when it popped up. Gate Key-pers is my least favorite, featuring five keys and three locked gates. Players laboriously rotate through turns as they randomly use keys on doors and try to memorize which combinations were already attempted. It takes forever and really slows down the pacing, which is something numerous minigames are guilty of this time around. More than one minigame also features the mechanic of “pick one of these things and hope no one else picks the same one or it doesn’t count,” which has never been fun even once. I expect a certain amount of nonsense and randomness in a<em> Mario Party</em> game, but <em>Jamboree</em> feels like it’s leaning too far into it at times.﻿<br></p></blockquote><h2 id="h100606"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-party-jamboree-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-party-jamboree-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> But <em>Jamboree</em>’s most egregious crime is how little it rewards you for actually being good at its sparsely-doled out minigames. Only occurring at the end of each round once everyone’s had their turn, they end up becoming like precious drops of water in the parched desert of interminably long dice rolls. But all you get for doing well in these brief moments of agency is more coins to add to your bulging purse strings, which you’ll regularly struggle to spend because you can never quite land on the right square at the right time - or at least that was my experience anyway. Time and again I’d amass a huge fortune after wiping the floor with my opponents during the minigame sections, but I’d only ever scrape the bottom of the final leaderboard because I’d had bum luck elsewhere. </p></blockquote><h2 id="h100607"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/super-mario-party-jamboree/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/super-mario-party-jamboree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>In general, though, <em>Jamboree</em> is certainly one of the better games in the<em> Mario Party</em> series, certainly when it comes to the sheer volume and diversity of content it boasts. Depending on how long Nintendo continues to support the Switch after its successor is released, this could potentially be the last game in the series to release on the system. If this ends up being the case, it’s a fitting third and final <em>Mario Party</em> on Switch – following the Joy-Con heavy gameplay of <em>Super Mario Party </em>and the old-school focus of <em>Mario Party Superstars</em>, this hits that Goldilocks spot by delivering the best aspects from both.﻿</p></blockquote><h2 id="h100608"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-super-mario-party-jamboree/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-super-mario-party-jamboree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Destructoid</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Circling back to my personal circumstances, it’s important to note that if my family didn’t play Mario Party with me, <em>Mario Party Jamboree</em> would be effectively worthless. You can play just about everything single-player, but the series is only really exciting if you have someone to play it with. That hasn’t changed with <em>Jamboree</em>. You can play it online, but I feel that something is lost when you’re not in the same room as the people you’re stealing stars from. Torpedoing someone’s success just isn’t the same when you can’t hear them mope and/or scream.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h100609"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.shacknews.com/article/141803/super-mario-party-jamboree-review-score&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/141803/super-mario-party-jamboree-review-score" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Shacknews</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Koopathlon is <em>Jamboree</em>’s boldest addition, pitting a player against 19 other characters in a race around a vast race course. As players collect coins in a specific set of minigames, they’ll make greater progress around the course. Bowser games keep things slightly even by having Impostor Bowser send anyone who loses flying backward. As an online session against 19 other random players, this is one of the more enjoyable of the nontraditional <em>Mario Party</em> modes. It only suffers because only eight friends can enter a session at once. This would have been an ideal mode to introduce player lobbies or something that would allow for more friends to jump in.﻿<br></p></blockquote><h2 id="h100610"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Gamer</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em> Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> is a return to form for a series that stumbled as it arrived on the Switch and barely steadied itself with <em>Mario Party Superstars</em>’ greatest hits runout.<em> Jamboree</em> brings creative boards and a range of enjoyable minigames to the table, but overcooks the single-player stuff. Though non-board multiplayer offerings are slim pickings, there’s a feast of<em> Mario Party </em>delights in this one, and as long as you’re happy to play <em>Mario Party </em>as it was meant to be played, you’ll find your fill here. </p></blockquote><h2 id="h100611"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Digital Trends</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> In trying to digest it all, I find myself a little torn by the eclectic extras. On one hand, they all feel like enjoyable, harmless bonuses. Do they all need to be fully built out when they’re meant to be quick diversions I can chip away at between parties? There’s more fun than dud here, even if I only feel like I’ll get an hour or two out of most modes. There’s another side of me, though, that wonders if all of those extras are a detriment to the core board game. Had Rhythm Kitchen been a smaller minigame, it would have been the most inventive one in the main game. The same goes for Toad’s Item Factory and Paratroopa Flight School, games that would have been more fun as 10- to 30-second snacks.<em> Jamboree</em> is full of great ideas, but too few of them are reserved for its bread-and-butter mode.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there-should-be-more-musicals-like-attack-on-titan-the-musical.1010508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/attack-on-titan-musical-broadway<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This weekend, I attended a performance of the limited run of <em>Attack on Titan: The Musical</em>. I can only hope that more anime musical adaptations follow in its footsteps.</p><p>Broadway has, for a long time, struggled with attracting young people to theaters. While theater audiences are getting slightly younger and more diverse, and apparently <a href="https://playbill.com/article/new-study-shows-that-67-of-gen-zs-and-millennials-are-broadway-curious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gen Z is very curious about the offerings on Broadway</a>, these changes are coming by degrees: according to Broadway League, <a href="https://www.broadwayleague.com/research/research-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the average age of a Broadway audience is 40.4 years old</a>. By contrast, walking into the New York City Center theater, I was immediately struck by how young everyone around me was. I’ve been lucky enough to see a few Broadway shows because my mother-in-law loves theater, and I’ve never seen so many twenty- and thirty-somethings in attendance. I say “lucky” because Broadway is also extremely expensive, with many tickets starting close to $100 for the worst seats in the house, and only going up from there. <em>Attack on Titan: The Musical</em>, by contrast, was only $45.</p><p>(If you want to be technical, New York City Center is on 55th, making this an off-Broadway show.)&nbsp;</p><p><em>Attack on Titan: The Musical</em> belongs to the “2.5D” musical genre, which refers to adapting a two dimensional anime into live theater. It’s a relatively common practice when a show is sufficiently popular; there have also been adaptations of anime like <em>Naruto</em>, <em>Yowamushi Pedal</em> and <em>Haikyu</em>. Go Ueki, the director of <em>Attack on Titan: The Musical</em>, has directed other 2.5D musicals as well, like the adaptation of classic manga <a href="https://cyborg009-the-stage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cyborg 009</em></a>. He’s joined by a cast of veteran 2.5D players, as well as dancers he’s met from his background of breakdancing. This is one of the first times that a 2.5D show has been performed in America. In 2019, <a href="https://playbill.com/article/a-first-look-at-the-sold-out-pretty-guardian-sailor-moon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon</em> played for three performances</a> at the PlayStation theater. All three performances were sold out.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Attack on Titan: The Musical</em> seems to be following in its footsteps, with its run completely sold out as well. Given how popular the source material is, that’s not a surprise. While it’s not as complex as some Broadway shows I’ve seen—the staging is sparse, mostly making use of projections and moving platforms alongside puppets and balloons to portray the titans—the level of performance was impressive. The dancing was especially cool to watch, with the core dancers backflipping over each other and one guy spinning on his head for like a minute straight.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ATTACK on TITAN: The Musical | OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WSijVnb2ogg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“I hand picked the dancers because some of them I worked with for like a whole month for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival,” Go Ueki told me through an interpreter. “Some of them I encountered through dance battles, and I really liked them. … I am an actor myself as well. So I got to perform in <em>Grease</em>, <em>Music Man</em> and <em>High School Musical</em>, so some of the actors and actresses I performed with in those musicals, and I really enjoyed working with them.” Ueki has a background in breakdancing and has performed and battled internationally.&nbsp;</p><p>While the West has always had a slightly fetishistic relationship to Japan (see also: <em>The Last Samurai</em> and <em>Memoirs of a Geisha</em>), this is the first time I’ve seen the cultural exports of Japan imported wholesale and accepted into our pop culture. <a href="https://aftermath.site/shogun-fx-hiroyuki-sanada" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Shogun</em></a>, a television show led by Japanese actors, swept at the Emmys. The best baseball player in the world is the Japanese <a href="https://aftermath.site/mlb-baseball-ohtani-see-through-pants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shohei Ohtani</a> of the Dodgers. Megan Thee Stallion had a mega-hit song with Mamushi, which featured iconic Japanese rapper Yuki Chiba, who she even brought to the stage during her performance at this year’s MTV Video Music Awards.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Megan Thee Stallion - &quot;BOA&quot; / &quot;HISS&quot; / &quot;B.A.S.&quot; / &quot;Mamushi&quot; &amp; More | 2024 VMAs" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Quebpj5fEbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>To Ueki, bringing <em>Attack on Titan: The Musical</em> to American audiences is about respect, something he says he learned about from hip hop culture, which he first encountered in the fifth grade. Breakdancing and hip hop have allowed him to travel the world and learn about different kinds of people.</p><p>“I traveled around England, of course, the United States and Germany. Everywhere I went, it was full respect, everyone had respect for each other,” he said. “I also love rapping, and Public Enemy taught me a lot. Their music taught me respect, and it really connected me to others. After any kind of dance battle, it doesn't matter which country you're from, you would shake hands after the battle, right?”</p><p>During a press event before the show’s opening, Ueki and the cast said that this was their first time in New York, and that having the show’s first overseas premiere in New York was a no-brainer.</p><p>“New York has Broadway, and anybody in the theater industry would love to be on Broadway,” he said. “We're so proud of the Japanese culture of manga and anime, and it's really nice that we get to connect with the audience.”</p><p>The audience was certainly enthusiastic ,even before the show began. One fan I met in line for merch, Anthony, told me that he’d been a fan of <em>Attack on Titan</em> since the very first episode and bought tickets for the musical without knowing what to expect. He was dressed head to toe in cosplay for the Survey Corps, the elite military division that main character Eren Jaeger joins in the show. Another fan, Chris Gbogi, who is the co-founder of a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/animesocialnexus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tristate area social group for anime fans</a>, said that this was the first musical he’d ever been to, anime or otherwise. He said that after seeing this show, he’d definitely go to another 2.5D production.</p><p>“I think it’s about how they wrap this story into a musical,” Gbogi said. “We know what the longer story is, but they really give you the key beats on it, and you're also able to enjoy the music. … We were all together gasping as they hit it into the music style of it.”</p><p>Although the audience in attendance were mostly people who had already seen the anime, Ueki said that he also took care to try to make it legible for newcomers.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Attack on Titan: The Musical</span></figcaption></figure><p>“I paid close attention to making sure to incorporate anything that was included in the original work, whether it be emotions or a shock or surprise I was in the original piece,” Ueki said. “I made sure that anybody who came to this piece newly would experience that.”</p><p>I’m not entirely sure that the 2.5D production is appealing to the core Broadway audience of 40 year olds and my mother-in-law. Because these are adaptations of very well known works within a devoted niche audience, they’re often geared more towards appealing to an established fan base rather than making sense to everyone in the room. That said, the established fan base <em>was</em> there, and they were extremely hungry for this show. When I tried to buy a commemorative t-shirt, I learned that they had totally sold out on the opening night the day before.</p><p>Ueki said that it’s his hope to bring more 2.5D productions to America.</p><p>“2.5D is something unique to Japan, but now it’s here and it seems like everybody loves it,” he said. “I hope that we can come back, and I hope we can connect again through this 2.5D musical.”</p><p>After the show, as I was putting myself together and watching the throngs of theatergoers take pictures of each other and gush about the performance, an older woman came to stand next to me. She had a slightly stunned expression on her face—she told me she’d never seen the anime before and bought tickets for the show blind.</p><p>“That was incredible,” she said as she put on her coat. “I cried.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-more-staff-making-it-the-second-round-of-layoffs-this-year/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In an unsurprising turn of events, Riot Games has announced yet <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-also-hit-by-layoffs-in-esports-hr-and-support-areas/">more layoffs</a>. The layoffs directly affected those working on the League of Legends team, and they were reportedly done to help "evolve League," as <a href="https://x.com/MarcMerrill/status/1846243708100091985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marc Merrill</a>, Co-Founder of Riot Games, stated. According to the update, these layoffs weren't done in an effort to save money, but instead, "it's about making sure we have the right expertise so that League continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond."&nbsp;<span>This year, in particular, has seen a drop in live monthly players. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://activeplayer.io/league-of-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">activeplayer.io</a>, </span>League of Legends is still performing incredibly well, with the game having over 130,394,000 average monthly players.</p>
<p>In addition to this, people are being introduced to the League of Legends world, and more people are playing the game for the first time thanks to Arcane, an animated series exclusive to Netflix. The first season did remarkably well, and the second season is close to release, with hype for the show building up rapidly. Merrill also states that despite there being this second round of layoffs, the League team will "eventually be even larger than it is today as we develop the next phase of League."</p>
<p>At the moment, it hasn't been stated how many staff members have been laid off in this new round of layoffs by Merrill himself, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24271081/riot-is-laying-off-32-staffers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spokesperson Joe Hixson</a> shared the number with The Verge, saying that 32 staff members have been laid off.&nbsp; Still, it's said that the Rioters laid off will be supported with a severance package that includes a minimum of six months' pay, an annual bonus, job placement assistance, health coverage, and more, according to Merrill's statement.</p>
<p>The comments under the announcement have been anything but kind, as game players begin to call out the company for overcharging on skins and Chromas, which cost an excessive amount of money.</p>
<p>The last round of layoffs was handled poorly. Those who were laid off found out via social media that they had lost their jobs rather than being told personally that they had lost their jobs. Merrill finishes his statement regarding the Riot layoffs with a conclusion: "While the League team will ultimately be larger after these changes, what matters more than size is having the right team, right priorities, and a sustainable approach to delivering what players need. If we're solving the wrong problems, more resources won't fix it. It's about building smarter and healthier, not just bigger."</p>

The Netflix series sought to remedy that by picking up where the reboot trilogy left off, reintroducing audiences to that same version of Lara (voiced this time around by Hayley Atwell). She’s a survivor with a well-established history of fighting for her life in addition to a globe-trotting explorer. Though if you don’t have any familiarity with the games that take place prior to the Netflix show, don’t worry, the show has you covered—perhaps too much.</p><p>One of the immediate pitfalls of <em>The Legend of Lara Croft</em> is its insistence on retreading the events and emotional struggles Lara went through in the games. It’s intended to make the show an easier entry point for new fans, but it’s handled in such a way that leaves people who have played the games feeling like Lara’s character has regressed for no reason. Lara can’t escape the guilt she feels over the death of her mentor, Conrad Roth. This is a plot point we see in the first game in the reboot trilogy, and is central to her character development in that title. Furthermore, Lara isn’t comfortable living in her home of Croft Manor as she still sees it as her dead father’s home. This is a representation of her inability to let go of her father’s legacy and accept her own responsibilities, something players already helped her through in 2015’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-the-kotaku-review-1741392788&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-the-kotaku-review-1741392788"><em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em></a></span>. So much of <em>The Legend of Lara Croft</em>’s runtime is devoted to these two internal struggles, even showing flashbacks of Roth’s death multiple times. </p><p>Falling back on old plotlines is only the symptom of a larger problem <em>Legend of Lara Croft</em> faces: its wholly uninteresting plot. To sum it up: Lara has to stop a man named Charles Devereaux (Richard Armitage) from collecting some MacGuffins (plot devices of no real importance) that will let him reshape the world in his image. The show tries to make Devereaux a compelling antagonist by sprinkling in some childhood trauma and the suggestion that he might have altruistic reasons for his mission, but ultimately reduces him to a one-dimensional villain by the season’s conclusion. Armitage does the best he can with a thin script but there’s only so much even a talented actor like himself can do. </p><figure id="" data-id="3926aa86a5b12bbd1bd7ea39577ac374" data-recommend-id="image://3926aa86a5b12bbd1bd7ea39577ac374" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="700" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bearded man holds glowing red and a green stones close together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bearded man holds glowing red and a green stones close together" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3926aa86a5b12bbd1bd7ea39577ac374" data-recommend-id="image://3926aa86a5b12bbd1bd7ea39577ac374" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="700" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bearded man holds glowing red and a green stones close together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lara’s mission to stop Devereaux takes her through a number of scenic locations that have her completing puzzles that could be straight out of the games—but without the audience having the ability to interact with these familiar tools, they feel like nothing more than plot devices used to kill time. While only consisting of eight, half-hour episodes, this frustrating pacing makes the show drag at every turn. Even the environment design itself seems to lack a sense of wonder that a good adventure should, something that feels like a step down for animator Powerhouse Animation, who previously delivered stunning visuals in Netflix’s <em>Castlevania </em>series. Whereas that show was constantly dripping with a gothic atmosphere in every scene, <em>The Legend of Lara Croft</em> has no sense of place despite the many locations Lara’s adventure takes her. That’s because outside of one impressive set piece that sees Lara rush through a city collapsing on top of her, there doesn’t seem to be much spectacle or compelling design in the majority of the show’s locales. In comparison to <em>Castlevania </em>the environment feels lifeless, with each new place Lara goes feeling too familiar to the last despite being at the other end of the globe.<br></p><p> Yet even with so much of the show feeling unremarkable, its portrayal of Lara manages to be filled with life. The survivor trilogy’s version of Lara has always been a much more serious and troubled woman and that continues in <em>The Legend of Lara Croft</em>. But the show doesn’t stop there, with Atwell, playing Lara with a hypnotic charm. This Lara is funny and suave. She’s got that adventurer’s death wish that she can’t stop joking about. Her personality brings a refreshing lightness to the character that was woefully absent in the reboot trilogy, which never let Lara be anything beyond a constantly-in-danger explorer. This time around you get to see her giddy with excitement at the prospect of hunting down treasures, or getting to know new cultures, or even at the promise of a fight. This blend aspects of survivor Lara with the more traditional charismatic adventurer we’ve seen in earlier iterations of the character without leaning too hard one way or the other. You get the sense that Atwell’s Lara is a true pulp adventurer hero, it’s just a shame the rest of the show just doesn’t know it.</p><p>At the end of <em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em>’s first season I am left with the strong impression that this show doesn’t know what it wants to be. There is no real sense of identity in its bland story that retreads old ground without saying anything new or exciting. While the titular heroine herself shines thanks to Atwell, the same can’t be said of the rest of the cast or the world in which they live. In many ways Netflix already has the most important key to make a successful <em>Tomb Raider</em> series: an incredible Lara Croft. If <em>The Legend of Lara Croft</em> gets a second season, it needs to create an adventure worthy of her.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, the layoffs are apparently occurring so the company can make "sure we have the right expertise."</p><p>"While team effectiveness is more important than team size, the League team will eventually be even larger than it is today as we develop the next phase of League," Merrill continued. "For Rioters who are laid off, we’re supporting them with a severance package that includes a minimum of six months' pay, annual bonus, job placement assistance, health coverage, and more."</p><p>Merrill continued his explanation in a follow-up post, in which he said that the success of a development team is unrelated to its size. "If we’re solving the wrong problems, more resources won’t fix it. It’s about building smarter and healthier, not just bigger."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While we're on the subject of team size, I want to talk a little about both size and budget, and why they aren’t the right way to measure whether a team will be successful.

A spokesperson confirmed that 27 employees were impacted across League of Legends development team and an additional five roles on Riot's publishing team. The spokesperson stated that those impacted would have the ability to use the company's internal job board to apply for other roles at Riot, but declined to share anything else.</p><p>These layoffs come rather uncomfortably as League of Legends celebrates its 15th anniversary, which Merrill references briefly in the post "so that League continues to be great for another 15 years and beyond." They also come <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riot-games-lays-off-530-or-11-of-staff-axes-riot-forge-label">nine months after Riot already laid off 530 individuals</a>, roughly 11% of its staff, in an effort to cut costs after allegedly taking on too many "big bets" as a company.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">games industry layoff tracker</a>, this puts the number of laid off game developers this year alone at over 13,000, with over 10,000 laid off in 2023 and over 8,000 in 2022.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred</a> marks the addition of Mercenaries to the game. Mercenaries are hirable NPCs that will assist you while playing alone, dealing damage and giving you passive boosts, depending on which Mercenary you have rolling with you. The new season also includes other new activities to complete, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-6-all-seasonal-journey-rewards-and-objectives-for-vessel-of-hatred-launch/1100-6527027/">Seasonal Journey objectives</a>.

This unlocks Rahier for you to recruit and is also where you can start the three priority quests to recruit the other Mercenaries. As you complete activities and kill monsters with a Mercenary at your side, you earn Rapport, which will increase your Rapport Rank. The first four ranks give you skill points for that particular mercenary, while the six remaining ranks earn you loot and Pale Marks, a special currency you can spend at the Mercenary vendor in The Den. After maxing out your Rapport, you will continue to earn Pale Marks for every 25,000 Rapport earned.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As for the skill trees, each Mercenary has two branching paths, which specialize in different abilities and damage types. You will have to choose between active skills and passive skills with each point earned, but you can refund the skill points for free whenever you want, letting you experiment with different Mercenary abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">You also get to select two Mercenaries, one as your main Mercenary and one as your Reinforcement. The main Mercenary is with you at all times, and you gain all of the skills you have purchased in their tree. For the Reinforcement, you can select one active ability of that Mercenary to activate on a cooldown whenever you use a specific ability. Once you hire a Reinforcement, you will need to set their ability and the ability of yours you want to activate them with. If you select your ultimate ability, for example, your Reinforcement Mercenary will use their ability whenever you use your ultimate ability.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Raheir</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4384826-mercenaryimage.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4384826" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4384826-mercenaryimage.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4384826"></a><figcaption>You can enlist two Mercenaries, one to be your full-time ally in combat and the other to provide occasional support.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4384826-mercenaryimage.jpeg"></figure><p>Reheir is the first mercenary you unlock, and it happens as part of the main campaign mission in Vessel of Hatred. It occurs extremely early, basically as soon as you reach the new area, and he is available for use from that point forward. Once you unlock Raheir, you can start the side quests to unlock the other mercenaries from The Den in Nahantu.</p><p dir="ltr">Raheri's skills either focus on buffing you defensively and taunting enemies, with the left side of the tree offering bonus armor passives and the right side offering resistance boosts. Raheir is a great Mercenary to use if you have focused more on increasing your own damage over increasing your armor and resistances.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Varyana</h3><p dir="ltr">Varyana can be unlocked via the quest "Slayer's Retribution" but in order to actually start this quest, you must first complete the Temple of Rot stronghold in the Dry Steppes. You just need to run to specific areas in the Dry Steppes and fight a bunch of barbarians. After doing so Varyana will be available to hire in The Den.</p><p dir="ltr">Varyana's main ability increases your movement speed based on massacre kills, which reset after not getting a kill for seven seconds. The right side of her skill tree offers abilities that knock down enemies and stun them, leaving them open to your attacks. The left side of the skill tree offers increased attack speeds and bleed abilities. If your build would benefit from increased attack and movement speed, Varyana is the Mercenary for you.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Aldkin</h3><p dir="ltr">Aldkin can be found in a passage in Nahantu after picking up the quest "A Nameless Mystery." Similar to Varyana, you will need to run around a bit in Nahantu, following Aldkin before eventually meeting him. At that point, he will be available to hire in the Den.</p><p dir="ltr">Aldkin is a little simpler to understand, as his skill tree is split into the fire damage side and the shadow damage side. If your build focuses on either of these damage types, you could benefit from having Aldkin with you. He can also inflict vulnerable on enemies, allowing you to deal even more damage.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Subo</h3><p dir="ltr">Subo can be found in Hawezar as part of the quest "A Feather on the Scale." Subo has you fend off a few waves of enemies before heading to another dungeon, but once again, all you have to do is run around to different objective markers and kill enemies. After that you can find Subo in The Den if you wish to hire them.</p><p dir="ltr">Subo doesn't have as clear a delineation between his skills. Across the board you can get chances for him to knock down, knock back, inflict vulnerable, and daze enemies, depending on the skills selected. His wide variety of options means he likely has something you can use, but you might not get as much of a boost compared to the other Mercenaries. That said, his attacks deal a ton of damage, so he does make a pretty good reinforcement.</p>

			<p>Posted on the official Call of Duty X account, the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pc-trailer-specs-preloading-intel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-load details</a> have been announced, alongside launch times of the game and system requirements for those who are playing the game on PC. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will require players to have 102 GB of space available on their SSD to be able to install the title, with the system requirements being rather respectable for the recommended settings, at the very least. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-gets-global-launch-game-trailer/">game will be released globally</a> by October 25. Those who are in American time zones will be able to play the game as of October 24, with the rest of the world joining the fight on October 25.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has had a pretty hefty promotional campaign, with there being multiple open betas for players to try out, as well as the game being live-streamed during an event to showcase it as well as get some deep dive commentary from the developers. Players will also be able to preload the game on all platforms as of October 21, with those eager to have the game ready to install. The game can be pre-loaded by 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET / 5 PM BST. For those who may have less than favorable internet speeds, being able to preload the game will make a huge difference, as you have a whopping 102 GB download to complete.</p>
<p>The official launch time for the game on Battle.net and Steam is October 24 at 9 PM PT / 12 AM ET. Below is the full map of launch times so that you can stay ahead of the game and jump right into the campaign and zombies or even jump-start your multiplayer experience if you don't want to start the campaign right away.</p>

This unfortunately included some personal information about members of its staff, but the majority of the leak consists of information about old and upcoming projects from the <em>Pokémon </em>franchise.

<p>XDefiant isn’t shutting down after Season 4. That’s the message executive producer Mark Rubin wants to make clear.</p>



<p>After rumors began to circulate on Tuesday that the game was at risk of being shut down at the end of Season 4, Rubin took to <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1846272225491484763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> to debunk the claims.</p>



<p>“To be crystal clear there are NO plans to shut down after Season 4,” Rubin said. I’ve literally been in meetings as of last week to discuss our Year 2 plans.”</p>



<p>He added  that the current focus of the team is to improve the technical experience of the game, including its netcode. He also said that they are working on content plans for both Season 3 and 4.</p>



<p>As far as the game’s player base,  Rubin admits that they have lost players since the game launched. However, he insists that its due to Ubisoft doing “very little marketing” for the game.</p>



<p>“We have done very little marketing so yes our numbers are down but that is just to give the team the time to get the game in a better place before we do bigger spends on marketing to bring new players to the game and to bring back players that have left,” he said.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously reported</a> that XDefiant was at risk of losing support from Ubisoft if its player base didn’t improved. That remains the case, though it was never reported that XDefiant would “shut down”. In the report, however, it was mentioned by sources that frustrations within the studio are aimed at leadership who “have refused to take responsibility for the project’s shortcomings”.</p>



<p>What do you think of Rubin’s denial that XDefiant was at risk of shutting down after Season 4? Let us know down below or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/980/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>
