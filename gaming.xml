		<p>With no build up or fanfare, Nintendo and Monolith Soft have just released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Edition…. edition, a paid upgrade to the game that brings technical improvements for the new generation hardware. Check out the trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition – Out now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kUGn2wulm_4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Switch 2 Edition upgrade is a fairly straightforward technical boost, now with a 60fps target through the game and 4K docked and 1080p handheld resolutions. We don’t know if Monolith has leant upon upscaling techniques or variable resolutions to get there, but this should make for a sharper looking, more responsive game in general.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition can be bought all together on the Nintendo eShop or with a $5 / £4.19 upgrade for existing owners of the Switch release. A physical release will be available from April 16th.</p>
<p>One of the last Wii U cult classics to be ported to the Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles X arrived in March of last year. With it still fresh in Monolith’s memory, it’s understandable why they would return to this first, but fans of the series will understandably be pining for a similar Switch 2 Edition treatment to be given to Xenoblade Chronicles 2, 3 and the Definitive Edition of the Wii original. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 would probably receive the greatest benefits, as Monolith’s first effort with the Switch did have its struggles.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-review/">our review of the Switch 1 release</a>, Dom said, “With a smattering of improvements as it jumps to Nintendo Switch, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition offers up an epic sci-fi tale set in one of the very best open worlds.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Viral Hit 'POOLS' Surfaces On Switch Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/viral-hit-pools-surfaces-on-switch-next-week</link>
            <guid>1440451</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Finnish dev Tensori's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pools1">POOLS</a> (sorry, POOLS) is a self-proclaimed walking sim with uncanny vibes. It launched back in 2024 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2663530/POOLS/">on Steam</a> and has racked up nearly 3000 user reviews in the time since, leaving it in the rarified "Overwhelmingly Positive" range on Valve's platform, and it's coming to Switch on 26th February.</p>
<p>As you can see from the trailer above — running native Switch footage, we're told — it looks pleasingly minimal and rather lovely, but don't go in expecting pure cosy vibes, or much else, for that matter, because the list of things this "liminal fever dream" <em>doesn't</em> feature is sizeable.</p>
<p>According to the official blurb, there's "no user-interface", "no dialogue", "no background music", "no typical story", "no characters to meet", no "notes" to find, "no hand-holding", and "no monsters chasing you or jumping suddenly towards you".</p>
<p>One for the misanthropes, perhaps? If you've had your fill of online chat and pings and squads and cosy character dialogue, a couple of hours' jaunt to your local '70s swimming complex — inexplicably and unsettlingly empty and pristine — sounds like just the ticket. And given the enormous number of monsters likely to be chasing and/or jumping suddenly towards you on just one day later on Switch 2 (courtesy of Capcom), a little genuine alone time sounds great.</p>
<p>For everything it <em>doesn't</em> have, Pools apparently contains atmosphere by the bucketload, using diegetic audio to ramp up the tension in these white-tiled, maze-like spaces where something's not <em>quite</em> right. This Switch (1) version includes the full OG game plus the "Chapter 0" free expansion, as well.</p>
<p>Here are a few more details and some docked Switch screens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you explore and advance further, you start to notice that the game's world changes around you. Rooms look and feel different. Each chapter has something unique. Constantly you're exploring new places, each with its own kind of mystery.</p>
<p>POOLS is inspired by internet phenomenons "Liminal spaces", "Found footage" and "Backrooms" - specifically "Backrooms Pools" or "Poolrooms".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There'll be a demo available on launch day if you're not convinced by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-exquisite-liminality-of-zelda-skyward-sword">all this liminal stuff</a>. The full game will set you back $9.79 / £8.50 / 9,75€ or your regional equivalent.</p>
<p>Our friends over at Push Square reviewed the PSVR2 version, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/psvr2/pools">awarding it an 8/10</a> and saying that "while it’s a short-lived experience, it’s one we couldn’t help but admire. It certainly caters to a niche audience, but it quickly creates a unique and tense atmosphere that plays with your head." We'll find out how Switch handles it soon enough.</p>

<p><em>It took great effort to avoid all the 'coming up for air', 'making a splash', 'dipping a toe', 'taking the plunge' metaphors on this one, just the surfacing one in the headline. Let us know if you're impressed by that and/or the game in the usual place.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/viral-hit-pools-surfaces-on-switch-next-week]]></content:encoded>

<p>The only unfortunate aspect of this week's batch of games is that only two of them are arriving as <strong>RTX 5080-ready</strong> titles, but at least both of those titles are brand new releases.

<p>No one ever thought the day would come when we would return to the bombed-out, decrepit remains of Raccoon City. Resident Evil Requiem gives everyone one more round, and if you’re ready to load the chamber again, find out when the Resident Evil Requiem release date is and expected release times.</p>



<p>There’s always a special vibe when a new Resi game is on the way. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> isn’t <em>just</em> a new game; it brings back Leon Kennedy for his first new outing since Resident Evil 6 (not counting the remakes). Throw in Grace Ashcroft, a lot of combat, puzzles, and the odd zombie, and you know you’re in for a good time.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A new, terrifying tale. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem has set a date with destiny for February 27, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>When Requiem was first announced, there were so many questions: How will Grace differ from Chris, Jill, Leon, and everyone that came before? Then, with RPD being sighted, we wondered if Leon was going to make one final bow.</p>

</ul>



<p>So much has been learned since Requiem first came to light. Once the February 27 release date was locked in, it immediately became a date for the diary. Whether you’re taking a mysterious sick day or you’ve booked it off, everyone will be there on launch day for the next chapter in the mainline timeline. </p>

<p><strong>According to the PlayStation Store, Resident Evil Requiem launches at 9 PM PT.</strong></p>



<p>Companies generally only post release time sheets on social media a day or two before launch. Right now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a> has done no such thing for Requiem. On the plus side, the PlayStation Store is known for posting an early look at a game’s launch time.</p>



<p>However, it must be said that this isn’t 100% accurate. It could change, and if it does, check back in as the guide is updated with new information to reflect this.</p>

<p>60fps and 4K for a small fee</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Hey, who's enjoying their Thursday? And who's looking forward to playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> later today?</p>
<p>Yep, you read that correctly — Nintendo has just dropped the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>, which landed on Switch in March 2025.</p>
<p>If you already own the game on Switch, the upgrade pack will cost <strong>£4.19 / $4.99</strong>. Or if you don't have the game yet, then you can grab the Switch 2 Edition on the eShop for <strong><em>£</em>54.99 / $64.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Those rumoured 60fps frames you thought would come eventually? They're right here in this upgrade pack. Docked resolution has also received a bump to 4K — if you have a TV that supports it. Otherwise, it'll just look smoother across the board.</p>
<p>A physical release will follow on 16th April 2026.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/880971/abxylute-n6-switch-2-hands-on-controller</link>
            <guid>1440397</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Gaming accessory company Abxylute has launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1932181238/abxylute-n9-n6-full-size-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2">Kickstarter campaign</a> for its upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/872223/abxylute-nintendo-switch-2-controller-n6-n9c-gamecube-retro">N6 and GameCube-style N9C Switch 2 dock-style controllers</a>. If the ergonomics of Nintendo’s Joy-Cons don’t jibe with you, these aim to be solid alternatives, particularly for people with medium-to-large-size hands.</p></div><p>Both of Abxylute’s new controllers have bigger, more comfortable grips than Joy-Cons offer, along with longer-lasting Hall effect joysticks. I tested a functioning prototype of the N6, and it has almost everything that people might be looking for to level up their gaming experience: full-size sticks, vibration, motion controls, customizable back paddles, and turbo mode for spamming commands.</p><p>What the N6 is going for isn’t anything new. CRKD popularized the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/28/24017863/nitro-deck-micro-review">slide-in form factor with the original Switch</a>. It adds thick grips to your console to make it look and feel more like a Steam Deck. For as much as it added to ergonomics, it stood out as a solution for the Switch’s Joy-Con drift drama by offering Hall effect sticks that won’t degrade. The N6 doesn’t mess with that formula very much. It has full-size Hall effect joysticks that are grippier and feature a concave top so your thumb can rest instead of sliding off. It has thick grips that go around the console’s back to let your fingers spread out, and its triggers are bigger and offer more tactile feedback.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Adding more grip to the back of the console doesn’t mean I don’t want more surface area on the front. Also, the edges of the Switch 2 that stick out from the controller look silly.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The thing is, the N6 doesn’t feel like as much of an upgrade over Joy-Cons as the Nitro Deck, based on my time with a functional prototype. For one, the left and right sticks are too low for my medium-size hands to comfortably reach with my fingers fully extended around its grips, making the D-pad and any of the system-level buttons below them especially tricky to access in a pinch. People with larger hands would likely have more trouble.</p><p>You might not experience issues if you have small hands, and/or if you primarily play games that don’t require fast reaction times. The N6 can handle fast reactions, but I never felt confident enough in my grip to execute twitchy commands with precision.</p><p>The ergonomics could be improved if Abxylute made the left and right sides of the controller taller and spread out the sticks and buttons more. That would make it easier for more people to fully grip the N6 without struggling to reach the sticks or buttons. As it is, I have to hold it in a precarious claw grip to play some games. Taller controls would also cover the top left and top right edges of the Switch 2, which are inexplicably exposed by the N6’s design.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Where my thumb naturally wants to rest, which just so happens to be where the joystick is located on the Joy-Con.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>Several aspects of the N6 remain in development, including how the rumble feels (strong, not attempting HD rumble, but also not terrible), and how the buttons and triggers sound (very pronounced — I’d get in trouble using this around my wife while she’s reading at night).</p><p>Abxylute proactively shared a list of known issues it’s working to address before the final release in April, which I think is a good move from a company that’s hoping to earn your pledge:</p><div><ul><li><span>Shoulder Buttons (L/R): You might hear a louder clicking sound or feel a slight wobble/instability. We are currently optimizing the components to ensure a more comfortable feel.</span></li><li><span>ABXY Buttons: On some units, these may feel stiff, have inconsistent travel, or make a loud rebound sound. We are switching to a new conductive silicone pad in mass production to ensure a consistent, quiet, and comfortable press.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Vibration/Haptics: The motor is currently too aggressive/noisy, and it may miss some subtle low-frequency vibrations. We are tuning the driver to fix this.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Cosmetics: For the Blue model, the silk-screen text on the back is currently too dark.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Build Tolerance: On individual units, you might notice slight inconsistencies in the feel of +/- buttons or a small gap on the right side. These will be tightened in production.</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Also, a note from the author: the prototype gets firmware updates through its USB-C port (it included a female to male USB-C cable to update it), but the mass production models will get wireless OTA updates from your smartphone.</span></li></ul></div><p>Abxylute is asking HK$ 618, or about $80, for the N6 as an early backer special price. It offered a limited allotment at this price, and it has already sold through most of them by the time of publication. Whether it gets more expensive after crowdfunding or not, it’s within the price range of the <a href="https://crkd.gg/pages/nitro-deck-2">$99.99 CRKD Nitro Deck 2</a> coming this Spring that offers many extra features. Based on my experience with an early N6 prototype, I’m not convinced it’s worth getting a controller that leaves much of your console exposed and struggles with ergonomics.</p><p><em>Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/880971/abxylute-n6-switch-2-hands-on-controller]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There's now a mod for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> which swaps out the likeness of actor Teruyuki Kagawa. Kagawa's casting in the remake, which saw him lend both his voice and likeness to secondary villain Goh Hamazaki, caused <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-fans-are-demanding-sega-recast-a-kiwami-3-actor-and-dark-ties-may-make-the-situation-worse">fan backlash</a> due to a <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/actor-teruyuki-kagawa-accused-of-sexual-harassment-tied-the-knot-in-2022">2022 report from Shukan Shincho</a> detailing sexual assault allegations against the actor.</p>
<p>Kagawa apologised at the time, but didn't specify what he was apologising for or confirm the events reported in the article. Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties director Ryosuke Horii <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-director-says-actor-accused-of-sexual-assault-was-cast-for-his-slimy-feel">recently said</a> Kagawa's casting was the result of developers RGG Studio having "tried to think of someone who makes you go, 'This guy's a creep'".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Now, as spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/yakuza-fans-removed-teruyuki-kagawa-kiwami-3/">TheGamer</a>, a modder going by Subcio060 has released '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/yakuzakiwami3/mods/207?tab=description">Goh Hamazaki Restored</a>'. As of writing, all it does is swap Hamazaki's in-game model from the default Kiwami 3 one which resembles Kagawa to one mirroring Hamazaki's appearance in the original Yakuza 3 (the latter is shown in the featured image of this article). In the 2009 version of Yakuza 3 and its 2018 remaster, Hamazaki was voiced by a different actor, Joji 'George' Takahashi.</p>
<p>Subcio060 wrote that they've got a host of future plans for the mod which go beyond just bringing back the old model in cutscenes and menus. Most intriguing of these is a hope to restore Hamazaki's original voice as provided by Takahashi, while also adding facial animations which match the PS3 version of Yakuza 3 and either replacing or removing the Kagawa version of the character in pre-rendered cutscenes.</p><p>The biggest dilemma they'll face to my eye is how to handle the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-sets-up-an-intriguing-path-but-rgg-will-need-to-prove-its-worth-joining-them-on-that-road">different ending scene Kiwami 3 features</a> compared to the original Yakuza 3, since Hamazaki's a key figure in both and says totally different things. That said, given how polarising this change to the narrative's been, I'd not be surprised to see those modding the game push to find a way of just restoring the original ending with Kiwami 3's swankier visuals.</p>
<p>The modder also revealed they've got plans to deliver "Yakuza 3 accurate shoes" to their creation down the line. If you fancy giving the Hamazaki swap mod a go, you'll need to grab the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/743">Shin Ryu Mod Manager</a> first, as it's a hard requirement.</p>
<p>Those still on the fence about Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties can also consider giving <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-review-a-stuffed-remake-defined-by-its-own-grim-connections">my review of it</a> a read.</p>

              <p>Every big game studio is currently trying to figure out if genAI tools are the real deal and how they can be used to help make games more quickly and efficiently. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-is-powered-by-new-version-of-creation-engine-starfield-classic-rpg-2000670744"><em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-time-todd-howard-has-talked-about-fallout-5-2000655749"><em>Fallout 5</em> director Todd Howard</a> recently pushed back against suggestions that the LLM boom is just a “fad” but said that just where and how AI might be implemented into the game development pipeline is still far from clear.</p> <p>“It’s certainly not a fad,” he said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4">February 18 interview</a> with <em>Kinda Funny Games</em>. “I think the AI answer now becomes ‘ask me in six months,’ right? It changes so much what you’re seeing out there. For us, we’re being incredibly cautious.” He confirmed that Bethesda is experimenting with AI for data-heavy tasks but keeping it out of the creative department, at least for now.</p>

 <p id="fb96c106-9d87-45f4-8b31-83048e55af79-0">“We can’t ignore it, in terms of it’s coming, it’s changing, every few months there’s a new model, particularly on the tech side with code or productivity or other things,” Howard said, adding, “it can help us get better at some big data tasks that just take us a lot of time, that we wish were done now so we can move onto the creative stuff.”</p> <p>At the same time, the veteran RPG designer confirmed AI isn’t being used to create anything that goes into Bethesda’s games. He didn’t get into the nitty-gritty about whether it’s being used for concept art references or placeholder text, but did suggest the company doesn’t see the technology as a potential replacement for human-made art.</p>

 <p>“We’re not using it to generate anything,” Howard said. “I think there’s an element of artistic intention that is essential to what we do and what others do. And if you look across things outside of AI, go back a hundred years, this idea of craftsmen, I still think craftsmen, and that handcrafted human intention, is what makes things special, and that’s where we want to be.”</p>

 <p>Speaking in generalities is one way to avoid <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-gen-ai-larian-bg3-reddit-ama-2000658429">the hot water some game company leaders have gotten into</a> by embracing AI experimentation. Some evangelists are predicting computer gods and mass unemployment by 2030. My only hope is we’re playing <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> by then.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass has another Free Play Days campaign this weekend, and it features a whopping four games, one of which could probably do with the injection of players to bolster a waning count.</p>



<p>That’s right, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> is free to play this weekend <strong>if </strong>you’re a Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, or Essential subscriber. This revelation was unveiled by Electronic Arts this week, but thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1r8kyti/preofficial_free_play_days_battlefield_6_chip_n/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Reddit</a>, we know the other three games joining the lineup are Chip ‘n Clawz: vs. The Brainioids, Polterguys: Possession Party, and Sunderfolk.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-battlefield-6-for-free-this-weekend">How to Play Battlefield 6 For Free This Weekend</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is in a bit of a sticky spot. The player count is dropping, viewership is in the toilet, and even the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-fails-revive-new-season/">launch of the new season</a> two update didn’t do anything to revitalize the first-person shooter.</p>



<p>That’s why there’s probably a lot riding on Battlefield 6 being the headline for this new Free Play Days drop.</p>



<p>Users across the Ultimate, Premium, and Essential tiers can enjoy what’s believed to be an unlimited run through Battlefield 6’s multiplayer offering, from today, February 19, to Sunday, February 22.</p>



<p>That includes all maps, modes, weapons, classes, and everything else you might lump into that spread. Additionally, Battlefield 6 is <strong>on sale</strong>, just in case you want to dip a little deeper and keep playing after the Free Play Days Trial is up.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 was a very strong shooter at launch, but it has backslid a bit over the last few updates, disappointing the community more than once. It’s up to you how long you play it this weekend, but there’s no risk involved, so you might as well give it a shot.</p>



<p>To play Battlefield 6 <strong>for free</strong>, you’ll need to have an Xbox Game Pass subscription at the required tier, and then it’s simply a case of navigating to the game in the store or finding it via a dashboard tile that’s undoubtedly going to be present to promote Free Play Days.</p>







<p>Are you going to give Battlefield 6 a shot during Free Play Days? Let us know your plans on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-early-access/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Wrestlemania season is upon us in WWE, which means the launch of a new accompanying title, and in the modern world of gaming, it’s understandable to be wondering whether WWE 2K26 has early access.</p>



<p>Set to launch officially on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-release-date-exact-start-times/" id="177609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 13</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K26</a> is the latest entry in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/2k-sports/" id="1233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2K Sports</a>‘ long-running franchise, with CM Punk on the cover for the first time in a decade.</p>



<p>If you’re impatiently waiting for the release of WWE 2K26 and are wondering if there are ways to jump in early, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-wwe-2k26-through-early-access">Can You Play WWE 2K26 Through Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Earlybird. Image via 2K Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, WWE 2K26 is available to play through early access, allowing players to jump in up to a week ahead of the full release, but there are some major caveats.</strong></p>



<p>Early access to WWE 2K26 is provided only by purchasing one of the premium editions of the game, which provide other benefits, including all DLC access and MyFaction rewards. However, the prices of these editions are significantly higher than the standard edition of the game.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-dev-confident-fans-will-like-new-ringside-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K26 Dev Confident Fans Will Like New Ringside Pass</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The King of Kings edition, centered around Triple H, is priced at $99.99, while the Attitude Era edition costs $129.99. Finally, the Monday Night War Edition of WWE 2K26 costs a whopping $149.99, over double the price of the standard edition.</p>



<p>That means you need to splash out at least $99.99 to secure the early access bonus to WWE 2K26, and it’s up to you to weigh the cost of whether it is worthwhile.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-wwe-2k26-have-a-demo">Does WWE 2K26 Have A Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>No public demo has been announced for WWE 2K26, and based on the recent history of 2K Sports, it’s extremely unlikely a demo will be made available before launch.</strong></p>



<p>This means there is no way to play WWE 2K26 early, even in demo form, without splashing out to secure one of the premium editions. Additionally, unlike rivals EA Sports, 2K does not tend to offer trial periods for newly-released sports games.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>Free-play weekends for certain platforms are possible, following the free-play weekend of WWE 2K25 in August last year, but, again, this is not guaranteed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hershel Wilk awakes in a small, dirty apartment in the city of Portofiro. Why she’s here, she does not know. Her mission objectives were supposed to be provided by her partner, codename “Pseudopod”, but he’s unresponsive – he just sits there in his underwear, staring at nothing, his senses on lockdown. In his pockets are an invoice for socks and a lipstick-printed business card that simply reads “All you need is miracle.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not just Hershel who needs a miracle. Developer ZA/UM needs one, too. Zero Parades: For Dead Spies is an espionage RPG that follows the playbook of the studio’s previous game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disco-elysium-the-final-cut">Disco Elysium</a>, incredibly closely, right down to opening on a confused protagonist in a run-down room. It’s another high-concept, combatless, dialogue-driven game about following threads and investigating leads. But capturing lightning twice is no easy feat, and simply repeating Disco Elysium’s triumphs is no guaranteed road to success. Thankfully, there are fresh ideas here that expand and evolve ZA/UM’s formula, making for what appears to be, on the surface, a more traditionally accomplished video game, but potentially at the cost of crafting a less interesting artistic creation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I recently spent around six hours with Zero Parades, playing through the entire <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zero-parades-demo-steam-next-fest">upcoming Steam Next Fest demo</a>, plus a significant amount beyond it. That meant exploring a wide section of Portofiro, a vibrant hub of criss-crossing cultures, painted in shades of Central America and Southern Europe. It’s made up of six districts, stretching from docklands, through a central marketplace and winding back alleys, and up to a hillside housing project. While perhaps small by traditional RPG standards, this is a much larger playspace than we saw in Disco Elysium, and that’s not just reflected in your step count. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Zero Parades: For Dead Spies - Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The city is alive. Rather than a decaying echo of times gone by like Revachol was, Portofiro is active. Every street is home to an oddball with their own strange perspective and, often, their own weird problem in need of solving. In the “Bootleg Bazaar” you’ll find two children transfixed by Sixty-Six Wolves, a cartoon that seems suspiciously like foreign propaganda. A few stalls down there’s Petre, a “Format Fetishist” obsessed with a type of vinyl record that wipes itself clean after a single play. Further up the road, you’ll bump into Kurt, a man so consumed by the need to follow imported fashion trends that he’s landed himself in crippling debt. Each is a window into a place where personal obsessions are the tools through which sinister powers manipulate the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I will, of course, need to play Zero Parades to completion to judge if its writing around this and other topics can match the unbelievably lofty heights of its celebrated predecessor. And I understand if you’re skeptical – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-directors-accuse-zaum-shareholders-of-fraud-as-the-company-says-they-were-fired-for-misconduct">ZA/UM’s controversial firing of key Disco Elysium creatives in 2022</a> has left many fans wary of both the studio’s management and the current team’s ability to craft something as meaningful. Based on my experience of this demo, though, I feel positive about the writing’s quality, with the odd caveat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The skills, for instance, which once again form the pieces of your fractured psyche and comment on your choices and the world around you, lack defined voices and feel largely interchangeable (with the exception of Statehood, which bellows your home country’s party line in all-caps). But when it comes to the city’s collection of strangers, it appears the current writing team has successfully penned a cast possessed of a similar blend of literary prose, otherworldly Lynchian vibes, and off-kilter political humour. And, as I cross-referenced their tales with those of others, I began to paint a picture of this deeply troubled world, where techno-fascist superpowers, communist republics, and investment banks battle for power, using secret police forces as knives and pop culture as rifles. </p><p>Portofiro begins to feel like a Venn diagram of multiple overlapping quests, much like the cities of Baldur’s Gate and Athkatla.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finding my place among all that initially felt overwhelming. As a spy, it’s my job to be a disruptor, to exploit those tensions for the gain of my home state. But, as previously mentioned, Hershel has no idea what her mission is. You simply need to talk and talk and talk until you find the threads relevant to your objectives, and there is no shortage of people to pull them from. But soon I began to see the connections. A representative of EMTERR, the world’s super bank, could be the starting point for solving Kurt the fashionista’s financial woes. A group of grizzled veterans impatiently waiting for their turn to dial into the “Miracle” sex line suddenly makes that business card I discovered make sense. And the suicidal Dr. Gonza’s medical know-how could diagnose Pseudopod’s condition… but first I’ll have to bring him the teeth of a medical board “narc” to halt his hanging attempt. As you collect these leads, Portofiro begins to feel like a Venn diagram of multiple overlapping quests, much like the cities of Baldur’s Gate and Athkatla did in BioWare’s seminal Infinity Engine RPGs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Disco Elysium certainly shared some DNA with the classics, it held many traditional RPG ideas at arm’s length. Zero Parades is less shy about being a video game. That feeling starts with the increased size and scope of its city, but is cemented in its more wholehearted embrace of regular skill checks and, importantly, building a gameplay system around failing them. You have a trio of pseudo health bars – Fatigue, Anxiety, and Delirium – which fill when you stumble through conversations and interactions in their respective field. For example, elongating an early phone call by asking all of the wrong questions will cause your anxiety levels to soar. Fail too often, or keep digging down into a dark memory hole that you shouldn’t, and you’ll take a permanent penalty to one of your stats. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are interesting mechanical wrinkles to this system. Skill checks typically involve rolling two dice, but you can choose to "exert" yourself, adding an extra die to increase your chances at the cost of damaging one of those pressure bars. It’s vital to learn how to manage your stressors, then, to keep the bars balanced. Smoking, for instance, will reduce your anxiety, which in turn gives you another opportunity to exert yourself.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another example of this more crunchy, systemic approach can be found in “Dramatic Encounters”, which turn moments of peril into a series of turn-based decisions, creating a sense of life-or-death drama in a game devoid of combat. It’s essentially Disco Elysium’s late-game tribunal sequence transformed into a defined mechanic. The example in my demo saw me attempt to evade an enemy agent through a busy marketplace, and the branching decisions offered classic spy fiction options: Do I pause to analyse, or act on gut feeling? Try to flee, or hide in plain sight? A skill check on my “Nerve” stat – a test of how cool I can stay under pressure – succeeds, and I walk straight past my hunter, confidently blending into the crowd. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this example is fairly low stakes, at every junction I nonetheless held my breath as I picked my next move, anxiously waiting to see if my choice paid off. I’m very interested to see how this approach will be applied to other spycraft staples – perhaps tailing, deploying bugs, or even straight-up assassination – as success here will likely be the thing that helps Zero Parades feel distinct from its predecessor and truly cement it as an espionage RPG, rather than Disco Elysium with a 00 license in its wallet. </p><p>This project is more recognisably a video game than the parameter-defying art experiment that was Disco Elysium.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zero Parade’s most interesting push into more traditional video game territory, though, is how it uses the city’s physical space to structure its branching quests. My final few hours were spent completing tasks that await beyond the Steam Next Fest demo, and the majority of that time saw me searching for a hidden jail, inside of which awaited a prisoner with vital information. The way you find this jail is determined by a number of different factors; there’s your personal method of investigation, of course, but your character’s stat build and your own ability to interpret the world’s clues also come into play. From what I can tell, this results in at least two completely different routes to the jail: breaking into a subterranean tunnel, or via poetry. Yes, poetry. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was that second, more artistic path that I took. After quizzing a reluctant boatman who clearly knew about the jail but refused to talk, I was able to use my “Blueprints” skill to track his involuntary eye movements and approximate the prison’s location. Poking around the region he kept gazing at led me to the offices of a poetry magazine, the Noscorrentes Review, which featured a suspicious locked gate that only contributing writers were permitted to pass through. So, how do you convince a pretentious editor that you’re a genuine, publish-worthy poet? Well, dumpster diving through the publication’s trash <em>will </em>secure you a poem, but it’s in the garbage for a reason. And so the only option is to literally write a verse yourself, digging deep into your own soul to increase the chance modifiers on your “Poetics” skill check. The task provides an insight into Hershel’s painful past, but also – most importantly – creates a composition worthy of the magazine’s pages. The editor lets me past the locked gate, and there, in the basement of the Noscorrentes Review, is the secret jail. It’s real. And it’s a path to even more trouble… but I won’t spoil that here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This branching path, effectively creating two entirely separate questlines that take place in entirely separate locations, reminds me more of RPGs like The Witcher and Baldur’s Gate than it does the almost immersive theatre approach of Disco Elysium. That’s not to say that Zero Parades <em>is</em> a traditional role-playing game. Far from it. But it’s clear that ZA/UM’s attempt to build on its established formula has taken it down a path that makes this project more recognisably a video game than the parameter-defying art experiment that was Disco Elysium. It’s a feeling only reinforced by the espionage genre and the more global approach to its story. There are factions, and one of them is an evil empire! That’s video game stuff. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although on the surface they run the risk of appearing as less experimental design decisions, I don’t think these are poor choices. In fact, they are what I think make Zero Parades interesting. I left the studio feeling as if I’d just played a fascinating RPG with a strongly defined, richly realised setting, spearheaded by a protagonist who could navigate that world’s obstacles in a myriad of compelling ways. And yet, despite this, Zero Parades still feels beholden to Disco Elysium, as if its ambitions are caged by the reluctance, or refusal, to stray too far from the safety of beloved ideas. Elements like the sentient skills feel like they are template, rather than tradition. In many ways, it feels willing to risk being an imitation in the hope of capturing lightning twice. I doubt that was a risk worth taking, and yet I still think the odd chimera of old and new that ZA/UM has produced may prove to have merit in its own right. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/zero-parades-hands-on-preview-a-complex-spy-rpg-hiding-in-one-giant-shadow]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Video games are losing the "attention war" to gambling, porn, and crypto, according to industry report]]></title>
            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/video-games-are-losing-the-attention-war-to-gambling-porn-and-crypto-according-to-industry-report</link>
            <guid>1440355</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new report by Epyllion, a gaming industry advisory company headed by venture capitalist and market guru Matthew Ball, has broken down the state of the video game industry, and has published data indicating the medium is losing the war for people's attention to other ventures, including gambling, crypto, and pornography.</p>
<p><a href="https://issuu.com/ballmatthew/docs/gaming2025_vee10?fr=xIAEoAT3_MzMz">The report</a>, a lengthy 164-page presentation which you can (and should) read yourself, dedicates a whole section called "Video Games are losing the attention war in the 'Major Market 8'" to the topic. It starts by comparing pre and post pandemic consumer spending from eight major video game markets - the USA, Japan, South Korea, UK, Germany, France, Canada, and Italy.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, these countries made up over 60 percent of total spending on video games. Post-pandemic, almost all of these regions have seen a drop in gaming population. In the US, 2.5-4 points worth of players stopped playing video games, the Canadian Trade Association found in its latest report that roughly one-in-six players prior to the pandemic have stopped playing.</p>
<p>These decreases in participation have resulted, the report posits, in a drop in spending. In the US, PC and console spend is down eight percent since 2020 / 2021, which comes to roughly $2.3bn. Mobile gaming's US annual growth in terms of spending has largely flattened since 2025, but it's still above 12 percent compared to 2020, and now beats out console spend.</p><p>Total spend across all "Major Market 8" regions on console and PC shrunk by $4.8bn, and mobile is down by $2.3bn, all while five of these eight markets are at all-time highs in terms of total spend. This money is instead going elsewhere, to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> for example, which the report states makes up 67 percent of net growth.</p>
<p>So that's a lot of dire-sounding figures, but why is this happening? Where is all this attention and money going? Well, chapter four of the report links this drop to multiple other mediums garnering people's attention. These are social video, creator pornography, AI assistants, crypto and memecoins, prediction markets, online sports betting, and igaming &amp; icasinos.</p>
<p>In just the US consumption of Tiktok is up 39m hours a day compared to pre-COVID figures. In the 2025, American consumers spent roughly $5bn on Onlyfans. Crypto currency too has been siphoning attention and money from video games according to the report. While its first boom happened during the pandemic video game boom, its second rise in popularity among the public happened in 2025 while the video game industry stagnated.</p>
<p>During this 2025 period, AI apps that allowed for "role play, erotica, and art" have soared. The latest tracked statistic for installs for this software came to just under one billion worldwide.</p>
<p>Prediction markets, where users can bet on events that happen in the world, also had a recent boom in popularity. Users placed 1.5m bets a day during Q4 2025. Online Sports Betting is also taking potential users' money. In 2025, US net losses due to sports betting passed $17bn, a 35x increase from 2019 as these sorts of services become normalised, legalised, and integrated into sports in the USA. Despite bans in other countries, international net losses are around $53bn a year.</p><p>iGaming, which include online casinos, are yet another avenue from gambling which the report raises as an alternative path of gamer's money. iGaming is twice the size of the mobile casino game category in terms of growth, and 21 percent of <strong>all</strong> US video game spend. Worldwide, gamers lose $54bn a year in legal iGaming, which accounts for 45 percent of global gaming spending.</p>
<p>The report states: "Video Gaming's post-pandemic problem isn't that players choose to watch TikTok instead of buying a AAA game, or subscribe to Onlyfans instead of buying a PlayStation; it's that on a Friday evening, players are placing a growing share of their time and spend <em>elsewhere</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Over the past week, I’ve watched left wing commentators on Bluesky, the niche short form blogging site that serves as an asylum for the millennials driven insane by unfettered internet access, discuss the idea that “the left hates technology.” This conversation has centered around a few high profile news events in the world of AI. A guy who works at an AI startup wrote a blog <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/something-big-happening-matt-shumer-so5he/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>claiming that AI can already do your job</u></a>. Anthropic, the company behind the AI assistant Claude, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-30-billion-series-g-funding-380-billion-post-money-valuation?ref=aftermath.site"><u>has raised $30 billion in funding</u></a>. Someone claimed an AI agent wrote a mean blog post about them, and then a news website was found to <a href="https://aftermath.site/story-about-ai-being-mean-gets-pulled-because-journalist-used-ai-that-made-mistakes/"><u>have used AI to write about this incident and included AI-hallucinated quotes</u></a>. Somewhere in this milieu of AI hype the idea that being for or against “technology” is something that can be determined along political lines, following a blog on Monday that declared that “<a href="https://www.transformernews.ai/p/the-left-is-missing-out-on-ai-sanders-doctorow-bender-bores?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the left is missing out on AI</u></a>.”</p><p>As a hard leftist and gadget lover, the idea that my political ideology is synonymous with hating technology is confusing. Every leftist I know has a hard-on for high speed rail or mRNA vaccines. But the “left is missing out” blog positions generative AI as the only technology that matters.</p><p>I will spare you some misery: you do not have to read this blog. It is fucking stupid as hell, constantly creating ideas to shadowbox with then losing to them. It appears to be an analysis of anti-AI thought primarily from academics and specifically from the professor Emily Bender, who dubbed generative AI “stochastic parrots,” but it is unable to actually refute her argument.</p><p>“[Bender’s] view takes next-token prediction, the technical process at the heart of large-language models, and makes it sound like a simple thing — so simple it’s deflating. And taken in isolation, next-token prediction is a relatively simple process: do some math to predict and then output what word is likely to come next, given everything that’s come before it, based on the huge amounts of human writing the system has trained on,” the blog reads. “But when that operation is done millions, and billions, and trillions of times, as it is when these models are trained? Suddenly the simple next token isn’t so simple anymore.”</p><p>Yes it is. It is still exactly as simple as it sounds. If I’m doing math billions of times that doesn’t make the base process somehow more substantial. It’s still math, still a machine designed to predict the next token without being able to reason, meaning that yes, they are just fancy pattern-matching machines.</p><blockquote>All of this blathering is in service to the idea that conservative sectors are lapping the left on being techno optimists.</blockquote><p>The blog continues on like this for so long that by the time I reached the end of the page I was longing for sweet, merciful death. The crux of the author’s argument is that academics have a monopoly on terms like “understanding” and “meaning” and that they’re just too slow in their academic process of publishing and peer review to really understand the potential value of AI.</p><p>“Training a system to predict across millions of different cases forces it to build representations of the world that then, even if you want to reserve the word ‘understanding’ for beings that walk around talking out of mouths, produce outputs that look a lot like understanding,” the blog reads, without presenting any evidence of this claim. “Or that reserving words like ‘understanding’ for humans depends on eliding the fact that nobody agrees on what it or ‘intelligence’ or ‘meaning’ actually mean.”</p><p>I’ll be generous and say that sure, words like “understanding” and “meaning” have definitions that are generally philosophical, but helpfully, philosophy is an academic discipline that goes all the way back to ancient Greece. There’s actually a few commonly understood theories of existence that are generally accepted even by laypeople, like, “if I ask a sentient being how many Rs there are in the word ‘strawberry’ it should be able to use logic to determine that there are three and not two,” <a href="https://www.inc.com/kit-eaton/how-many-rs-in-strawberry-this-ai-cant-tell-you.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>which is a test that generative AI frequently fails</u></a>.</p><p>The essay presents a few other credible reasons to doubt that AI is the future and then doesn’t argue against them. The author points out that the tech sector has a credibility problem and says “it’s hard to argue against that.” Similarly, when this author doubles back to critique Bender they say that she is “entitled to her philosophy.” If that’s the case, why did you make me <em>read all this shit</em>?</p><p>All of this blathering is in service to the idea that conservative sectors are lapping the left on being techno optimists, but I don’t think that’s true either. It is true that the forces of capital have generally adopted AI as the future whereas workers have not—but this is not a simple left/right distinction. I’ve lived through an era when Silicon Valley presented itself as the gateway to a utopia where people work less and machines automate most of the manual labor necessary for our collective existence. But when companies from the tech sector monopolize an industry, like rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft, instead of less work and more relaxation, what happens is that people are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/waymo-lyft-uber-protest-california-robotaxi-ae899573f4b12aa1844656fa5f7365ec?ref=aftermath.site"><u>forced to work more to compete with robots that are specifically coming for their jobs</u></a>. Regardless of political leanings, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/09/17/how-americans-view-ai-and-its-impact-on-people-and-society/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>people in general don’t like AI</u></a>, while <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney/"><u>businesses</u></a> as entities are <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report?ref=aftermath.site"><u>increasingly forcing it on their workers and clients</u></a>.</p><p>Instead of creating an environment for “Fully Automated Luxury Communism,” an incredibly optimistic idea articulated by British journalist <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/products/476-fully-automated-luxury-communism?srsltid=AfmBOorv4q7MTlhTeHU0CF5R2crsDTe0z3P7R-X8GA6pTSxg9wkEameG&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Aaron Bastani</u></a> in 2019, these technologies are creating <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Hilariously, although the author of this blog references Bastani’s vision of an automated communist future as the position leftists <em>should</em> be taking, <a href="https://x.com/AaronBastani/status/1939670022676480001?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bastani does not appear to be on board with generative AI</u></a>.</p><blockquote>Part of the reason I made a hard leftwing turn was because I was burned by my own techno-optimism.</blockquote><p>Friend of Aftermath Brian Merchant points out something important about all this discourse: most of this conversation serves as advertising.</p><p>“We’re in the midst of another concerted, industry-led hype cycle, this time driven more visibly by Anthropic, which just landed a $30 billion investment round,” <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/five-takeaways-from-an-unhinged-ai?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Merchant writes.</u></a> “This time the hype must transcend multibillion dollar investment deals: It must also raise the stock of AI companies ahead of scheduled IPOs later this year and help lay the groundwork for federal funding and/or bailout backing.”</p><p>Part of the reason I made a hard leftwing turn was because I was burned by my own techno-optimism. I am <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/05/07/politics/millennial-canon-bracket-barack-obama-years-legacy?ref=aftermath.site"><u>part of a generation that believed it could change the world</u></a>, and then was taught a harsh lesson about money and power. The first presidential election I voted in featured a platform of “Hope and Change” and then did not deliver hope or change, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/magazine/barack-obama-brought-silicon-valley-to-washington-is-that-a-good-thing.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>that administration embraced Silicon Valley in their ambitions</u></a>. Techno-cynics are all just wounded techno-optimists.</p><p>In fact it is following those two things—money and power—that have made me a critic of AI and the claims of corporations like Anthropic and OpenAI. More than anything, understanding that tech companies will just say things because it may benefit their bottom line has led me to my current political ideology. After President Barack Obama allied with Silicon Valley, these same companies have <a href="https://datasociety.net/points/what-does-silicon-valley-want/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>been happy to suck up to President Trump</u></a>. Asking the question “who benefits from this?” is what has created my criticism of AI and the companies pushing these models. As far as I can tell the proliferation of the technology mainly benefits the people making money off of it, whereas, say, a robust and fast train network would provide a lot more obvious benefits to working people in the country where I live.</p><p>Like Merchant, I do feel more and more like the Luddites were right, a view that is bolstered by leftist theory. But as Merchant has argued, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/09/18/luddites-social-technology-visionaries/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Luddites did not hate technology</u></a>. They were skilled workers who understood the potential for technology to exploit them. So much of how technology integrates into my life also feels like exploitation—watching Brian Merchant destroy a consumer grade printer with a sledgehammer at a book reading several years ago unlocked this understanding for me. Does that printer actually make printing easier, or is it primarily a device that <a href="https://aftermath.site/printers-suck-so-bad/"><u>eats up proprietary ink cartridges</u></a> and begs me for more?&nbsp;</p><p>The questions leftists ask about AI are: does this improve my life? Does this improve my livelihood? So far, the answer for everyone who doesn’t stand to get rich off AI is no. I’ve been working as a writer for the past decade and watching my industry shrivel up and die as a result, so you’ll excuse me if I, and the rest of the everyday people who stand to get screwed by AI, aren’t particularly excited by what AI can offer society. One thing I do believe in are the words of Karl Marx: from each according to their ability, to each according to their need. The creation of a world where that is possible is not dependent on advanced technology but on human solidarity.</p>

            <guid>1440322</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Just as things were starting to look up for <strong>Bungie</strong>, with some positive buzz building around <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-gamelay-new-impressive-death-awaits-trailer/">Marathon</a></strong> as we inch closer to the new extraction shooter's arrival, the tides take a turn for the worse once again. In a statement shared on its social media channels, the studio has announced that the next major update for <strong>Destiny 2</strong>, the upcoming <strong>Shadow and Order</strong> update, which was supposed to be out on <strong>March 3, 2026,</strong> has been <strong>delayed by</strong> <strong>three months</strong> and will now arrive on <strong>June 9, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>A lack of promotional marketing for the update this close to its initially intended release already had players suspecting a delay would be announced, alongside the fact that the update would have been out just days ahead of Marathon, which arrives on March 5, 2026. Bungie fans and anyone who wanted to try out Marathon would have also just finished playing it for a whole weekend during its server slam test, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-will-host-a-marathon-server-slam-test-just-ahead-of-launch-next-month/">which runs from February 26 to March 2</a>.</p>



<p>Instead of squeezing in the launch of a new update and a new game into one week, the Shadow and Order update will now arrive a little more than three months after its initial date. To make matters worse, if the delay time didn't raise concerns about the state of the update, Bungie's statement surely will, as the delay isn't to give Marathon more space to breathe or give the studio time to fix a significant bug they've recently discovered. It's to give the update <strong>"<em>large revisions</em>,"</strong> including changing the title of the update and give the team time to bring <em>"sizable</em>" quality-of-life updates.</p>



<p>"<em>Our next Major Update, Destiny 2: Shadow and Order, is <strong>undergoing large revisions and will be delayed</strong>,</em>" Bungie begins in its statement. "<em>This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will <strong>also be renamed</strong>. This update will now launch on <strong>June 9, 2026</strong>. We will provide exact details closer to release covering previously announced Weapon Tier Upgrading, but also additions like expanding Tiered Gear to all Raid and Dungeon activities, Pantheon 2.0, Tier 5 stats for Exotic Armors, and more.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Through June, we will continue to have routine bug fixes and stability improvements, continued portal modifiers, Guardian Games (March), and the return of a more frequent Iron Banner cadence (April)."</em></p>

</div></figure>



<p>Of course, the changes being made to this update could, and likely will, ultimately be for the better. But announcing such major changes this close to release, for something that is not the game's next big expansion, and just a mid-season update, clearly points to there having been not just one, but several mishaps along the way. Delays and changes like this are rarely due to just one thing going wrong, and it doesn't inspire confidence in Destiny fans who now have to wait months for an update they thought they'd get to check out in just a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>Especially after its last major update, which was the arrival of its Star Wars-themed <strong>Renegades</strong> expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-renegades-out-now-steam-concurrent-player-count-rises/">failed to revitalize the player base</a>. Hopefully, when Bungie is ready to talk about the update closer to release, it'll have been worth the wait.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>For months, I’ve been keeping an eye out for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/denshattack">Denshattack!</a>, an enticingly loud stunt-action game that’s somewhere between an autorunner and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, if Tony Hawk was an electric locomotive and not a man of mortal flesh. I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/at-a-largely-humourless-gamescom-train-kickflipper-denshattack-was-a-golden-streak-of-joy">played it last year</a> and was instantly smitten with its speedy, tricksy rail riding, and now that there’s a newly released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2524850/Denshattack/">Steam demo</a>, perhaps you will be too.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I’ve had a go, and while the playable story bits – in which your unsatisfied ramen delivery girl embarks on a career of competitive train flipping – are still enjoyably breakneck, there’s also a purely stunt-focused score attack mode that’s given me a fresh appreciation for the depth of Denshattack!!’s tricks system.</p>
<p>In contrast to these opening campaign stages, where you learn the basics of jumping and twisting your carriage on linear A-to-B runs, this mode is a looping maze of grindrails, halfpipes, and rideable walls. Both a proving ground and training facility, which is useful, because most of the aerial tricks in Denshattack!!! demand such complex yet precise flicks of the gamepad’s right stick that I’m not certain all of them are possible without undergoing some manner of cybernetic thumb joint surgery.</p>



<p>It’s good fun, though, thrashing a fat, blocky engine around like with such pace and aplomb that it almost starts to look graceful. It still feels like the campaign is the place to go for big, silly set pieces and an even greater sense of barely-holding-together speed, where tricks are mostly grabbed in the brief windows where you’re not dodging track hazards, or barrelling along atop a commandeered Ferris wheel. But there’s something more quintessentially Hawkian about the score attack mode, and it’s not just the animal brain desire to make a bigger number on the next run than the last one.</p><p>There’s a real mastery to be pursued here, I reckon. One measured less in combo multipliers and more in the physical spectacle of perfectly timed 720s, or grinds so clean they wouldn’t nudge the bubble on a spirit level. Pure athleticism, if you don’t count the traction motor.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the Denshattack!!!! demo is out now. There’s still no word of a release date beyond "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hello-pacific-drive-dlc-boltgun-2-trailer-denshattack-release-window-and-solasta-ii-early-access-update">Spring 2026</a>," as far as I can tell, so hopefully it doesn’t get the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/scratch-that-the-steam-machine-is-delayed-after-all-and-valve-confirm-ram-shortages-will-affect-pricing">Steam Machine treatment</a>. In the meantime, you can also read Malindy Hetfeld’s chat with David Jaumandreu, studio director at developers Undercoders, about its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-game-developers-worldwide-are-reliving-y2k-japan-from-jet-set-radio-to-dance-dance-revolution">influences from rhythm games and Japanese rail transit</a>.</p>

 <p><span>“Please help Ludovic, who is a wonderful and kind person that makes the world a better place. America is better with him here,” Hazlewood writes.</span></p> <p><span>Details are scarce on exactly when, where, and how Mbock was detained. According to </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samred.com/post/3mf6olxcfic23"><span>a post on Bluesky</span></a><span> from writer Sam Machkovech, Mbock emigrated from Cameroon and has lived in the U.S. for “more than half his life, having graduated from a MD high school in 2006.” As news of Mbock’s situation spread, the fighting game community and his teammates in The Hiero Group have been sharing the GFM and pleading with the public for financial support.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-content-update-mode-servers-2000671282</link>
            <guid>1440310</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you, like me, have been keeping up with<em> Highguard</em>, well, there’s good news. Despite last week’s studio layoffs and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-update-roadmap-servers-discord-2000670633">radio silence afterwards</a>, Wildlight Entertainment’s hero shooter has snuck out a new content drop. It includes a new map and raiding item, as well as new mounts that look like <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>‘ Owlbears. But the real pocket of hope is a new mode the developers are teasing based around what <em>Highguard</em> does best: raids.</p> <p>“This patch is purely content focused, with a brand new Base and a powerful new Raid Tool added to the game, along with new offerings in the Store,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/518613150889673564">read the patch notes</a> on Steam. “We are also working on next week’s patch, which we aim to bring a new game mode focused on the Raid experience, as well as some balance adjustments to weapons, among other things.”</p> <p>The “Raid experience,” for folks who bounced off <em>Highguard</em> at launch or haven’t given it a try, is when one team is breaching a base and trying to plant bombs on objectives to blow it up. There’s a bit of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> sprinkled in with destructible walls and gadgets that assist with breaching, including zip-lines you can shoot out from a siege tower to quickly get behind enemy lines. It’s usually the best part of any match and is where the real promise of <em>Highguard</em> begins to break through. A new mode that serves that up in a more concentrated form could work really well.</p> <p>Wildlight still hasn’t given an update on just how the old content roadmap is being modified or scrapped, but that new mode is supposed to arrive next week. In the meantime, however, this week’s patch will add the Cloudbreach map which takes place at the launchpad for a giant airship, and the Lockpick, a new item that lets you shoot a dart at doors and windows to take control of them away from the enemy during raids. A purple variant will even add an electric shock that zaps enemies nearby. Plus there’s new Moonbruin Mounts which look cool, though good luck <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">getting anyone to spend money</a> on <em>Highguard</em> right now.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wraith Ops Demo Goes Live As Dev Promises ‘No Battle Pass, No FOMO, No Gacha’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wraith-ops-demo-live-steam-no-battle-pass/</link>
            <guid>1440307</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Wraith Ops, a developing first-person shooter from Grassrootz Games and publisher Team 17, has just launched a demo <strong>exclusively </strong>on Steam. The shooter, which is ‘all about gunplay and gameplay first’, has launched the new demo as part of Steam Next Fest, the event that pays tribute to upcoming, developing games across a range of genres.</p>



<p>While the demo is pretty short, it gives a glimpse of what Wraith Ops promises: pure, unadulterated gun-toting action. As the game’s blurb states, there are no immersion-breaking cosmetics, no gacha mechanics, and no ‘silly killstreaks’, all of which are said in a jab at games like Call of Duty.</p>







<h2 id="h-wraith-ops-isn-t-the-next-call-of-duty">Wraith Ops Isn’t The Next Call of Duty</h2>



<p>To say that Wraith Ops is anything like Call of Duty would earn you a scolding from the game’s developer. It’s stressed everywhere on the Steam page and the game’s social channels that it exists as the antithesis of Activision’s first-person shooter franchise, despite bearing similarities.</p>



<p>But then, how different can a first-person shooter truly be from what’s already on the market?</p>



<p>Steam Next Fest has welcomed a small demo for Wraith Ops, which includes a mode called Arena, a 6v6, one-life mode, made playable across three maps: Airfield, Mall, and Submarine. Since the Gamescom demo went live in August 2025, Grassrootz Games has implemented <strong>876 </strong>bug fixes and tweaks, ready for the rollout of this new demo.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Wraith Ops has been neck-deep in the development pipeline for a <strong>very </strong>long time. The game’s social channels <span>launched in 2019, and its&nbsp;<strong>original demo</strong>, under the name ‘Project Wraith’, was listed on Steam as far back as</span> August 2021.</p>







<p>Are you at all interested in giving Wraith Ops a try on Steam? Let us know what you think of the game on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Denshattack! Preview: It’s Basically Tony Hawks With Trains, And It’s Phenomenal]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/denshattack-preview/</link>
            <guid>1440304</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Denshattack! is an arcadey, platforming, sports-based racer of sorts, infused with high-octane speed, a kickass soundtrack, visuals that rival any of your favorite animes, and it’s impossible to put down. Another way of describing it is an on-rails skateboarding game where trucks are replaced with trains—and occasionally Ferris wheels.</p>



<p>I could describe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/denshattack/" id="3613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Denshattack!</a> in any number of ways, and it wouldn’t encapsulate just how manic this game is. Conceptualizing this game had to be due to a concoction of energy drinks, arcade nostalgia, an anime binge, and trying to hit high scores on the recent Tony Hawk remakes. </p>



<p>In Denshattack!, developer Undercoder has created something equal parts beautiful, ambitious, and insanely tough to put down.</p>



<h2 id="h-denshattack-is-tony-hawk-s-meets-jet-set-radio-meets-thumper">Denshattack! Is Tony Hawk’s Meets Jet Set Radio Meets Thumper</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Undercoders</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some of my favorite games I’ve ever played feature bite-sized sections of the same gameplay where I <em>have</em> to replay them to better my last performance, to the point it feels like life or death: Think Hotline Miami or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gran-turismo/" id="1132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gran Turismo</a> license tests.</p>



<p>The OG <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tony-hawks-pro-skater/" id="1325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk</a> games are also quintessential examples with their time-limit-driven runs. Denshattack! grabs this idea by the horns and steams off into the distance with it. As Emi Araki, you take control of a train: A train that can kickflip, manual, grind, all the while firing along a track at what feels like a million miles an hour.</p>

</ul>



<p>2001’s forgotten Airblade—a blatant attempt to cash in on the Tony Hawks hype—didn’t do much to push the needle in the skating genre, whereas Skate did, and Denshattack! feels like the next step-up in creativity (with carriages). Five minutes after jumping into the tutorial level, I quickly realised that the game is as hard as it is pretty.</p>



<p>It has Jet Set Radio’s endearing art style, the Tony Hawks ‘one-more-run’ attitude, and Thumper’s necessity for swift reflexes and reactive thinking to oncoming obstacles, just without the aid of a beat.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-like-trains">I Like Trains</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Undercoders</figcaption></figure>



<p>The press demo I was treated to included a handful of the opening levels and a much more advanced Trick Park, usually only available later in the game. Oddly enough, I thought this was a smart decision as it gave me a glimpse into the myriad of other controls and gameplay functions sure to befuddle my brain further.</p>



<p>You need to mentally cycle through a variety of controls, quickly learn what each danger sign means, and what the applicable prompt is. Even after 10 minutes, I was jumping <em>over </em>corners, careening into disaster, honking my train horn when I was supposed to hopping over onto another track, and doing tricks when I was supposed to be plummeting my train straight down from 50ft in the air.</p>



<p>These might be the most durable vehicles ever created.</p>

</ul>



<p>One thing that became immediately clear is that you will need multiple runs to fully complete each level, and that’s exactly what I did. Every level has collectibles, forcing you to find hidden routes, shortcuts, and play the level differently; you need to score points and rack up combos, complete it as fast as you can, and try not to crash.</p>



<p>Levels quickly descend into anarchy as your train screeches through a city one second, before mounting a Ferris wheel, engaging in a Crash Bandicoot-style running at the screen sequence, evading lava, and clearing huge gaps over ginormous Tiki heads. If the whole game is going to be like this, how could I not want to play more?</p>



<h2 id="h-denshattack-preview-round-up">Denshattack! Preview Round-Up</h2>



<p>After reading through my own preview, I realise I’ve said virtually nothing bad about Denshattack! There was the odd bug and abnormality, which I was forewarned would be an issue, as the game is still in development as it heads to a 2026 launch. However, my snippet of gameplay has resonated with me for days, and I can’t stop thinking about it.</p>



<p>Denshattack! is a genuine challenge, and it’s fun. Anything I did wrong was my fault, and I wanted to learn from my mistakes to post a better score, smash my previous best time, and complete all the mini-objectives. I’ve barely seen any of what the full game has to offer, and I can say with absolute certainty that Denshattack! needs to be on your wishlist right now.</p>
