			<p>Developing an original experience is becoming increasingly difficult in the video game industry, due both to the market's failure to always reward truly innovative games and the objective difficulty of creating something that hasn't already been done and making it fun. Still, plenty of titles inspired by gaming greats have managed to carve out a space in the industry thanks to the quality of the experience they offer.</p>
<p>This definitely feels like it will be the case with Steel Seed, a stealth action-adventure game in development by Storm in a Teacup, a small Italian development studio that has released some pretty unique indie games like N.E.R.O. - Nothing Ever Remains Obscure, Enki, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/close-to-the-sun-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Close to the Sun</a>, which attempted to do something different from the norm to varying degrees of success. With their latest game, on the other hand, the Italian studio seems to be playing it a little safely, as Steel Seed is a game that draws inspiration from other linear action-adventure titles like the Uncharted and the Star Wars Jedi series, featuring some light platforming and parkour and a combat system that's vaguely reminiscent of a Soulslike game. This, however, could be the best for the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250306164231_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the experience felt almost immediately familiar in the short 20-minute-long demo I had the chance to try, the combination of elements from different games and their quality is sure to set the game apart from its illustrious inspirations. Set in a dark sci-fi world where humanity is on the brink of destruction, Zoe wakes herself up from what felt like a very long slumber to discover herself changed with a robotic body that grants her abilities far superior to those of a regular human. Lost in a world she doesn't recognize, Zoe sets out together with the mysterious drone KOBY to find her father and obtain the answers she seeks, only that this new world she woke up in won't make it very easy for her, as it is filled with machines out to take her down.</p>
<p>Steel Seed is clearly going for a cinematic approach, which feels well-realized already a few minutes into the adventure with some impressive set pieces like a giant robot going after Zoe and her companion drone, but developer Storm in a Teacup is clearly doing things right regarding gameplay as well. While the game employs a Soulslike combat system without a stamina system with light and heavy attacks and dodging, which can become a perfect dodge when timed correctly, as the sole defensive option, at least in the beginning, it implements these features well, thanks to how enemies react to hits, and how responsive Zoe feels to control. The challenge level also seems to be on point, as the enemies in the first area hit hard and don't just stand still taking hits. Over the course of the adventure, it will be possible to expand Zoe's skills to perform more complex maneuvers that will make combat feel more varied than in the first few minutes of the adventure.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250306164614_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Another big part of the Steel Seed experience will be the stealth mechanics, which also felt well put together in the short demo I played. Moving from one cover to another, Zoe will have to be extra careful avoiding and taking enemies down with instant takedowns, as their AI is mostly on point, making them react properly to Zoe's presence and alerting others in case she is found out. Overall, the stealth mechanics at the beginning of the game are somewhat straightforward, but they are well put together, and they are sure to evolve over the course of the game with more complex level design and an increased involvement of KOBY, who will be able to scan the environment unseen to help Zoe plan a course of action. Best of all, stealth sequences don't seem forced, although going straight for the enemy will put Zoe at a clear disadvantage due to the enemies' higher numbers.</p>
<p>With an interesting setting that sets up some compelling mysteries right off the bat, great responsiveness, solid gameplay mechanics, and some impressive visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5, Steel Seed has the chance of becoming one of the surprises of this packed 2025. I did not know anything about the game, but the short demo I tried was enough to make me very interested in a game I feel will surprise many when it launches later this year on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has a new update that makes copious little and large changes to the popular animal-hitting sim. As often with PC game patch notes, the changelog is a balance of mealy fare such as fixes for broken <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapons-tier-list">weapons</a>, and moments of absurdity, such as addressing a problem whereby you'd hack the tail off an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ajarakan-tips-weaknesses-rewards-how-to-beat">Ajarakan</a> only for it to transform into another monster's appendage. Also, you'll no longer be able to cheese the Gore Magala by somehow dropping a dozen boulders on it simultaneously.</p><!--more-->
<p>The update notes in question are to be found on <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060">Capcom's FAQ for currently known issues</a>. The list of technical problems addressed as of today, 10th March include the "Grill a Meal" and "Ingredient Center" features not unlocking, the Field Guide becoming inaccessible, players falling through the map during the mission "Toward Fervent Fields", NPCs not appearing in "A World Turned Upside Down", tutorials repeating themselves, Lance Power Guards and mantles not activating properly, Insect Glaive offset attacks causing your hunter to space out, force quits due to a screen rendering bug, and wait, stop! I'm just listing and rewording them all. So much for not letting the AIs take my job.</p>
<p>Let's skip to the highlights. Firstly, they've fixed a problem where "some environmental features such as floating rubbles" could be exploited several times. I've never managed this myself, but I've now looked up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1j7w7m1/floating_rubbles_you_will_be_missed/">a relevant player video on reddit</a> and well, that's not how you're supposed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-hirabami-tips-weaknesses-rewards-how-to-beat">to beat Hirabami</a>. Can't fault the effectiveness, though.</p>
<p>Secondly, they've nobbled that issue with hacked-off monster parts transforming into parts from other monsters - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1j2xurg/monsters_dropping_the_wrong_parts/">see this video</a>, in which a dismembered Ajarakan obstinately poops out pieces of Gravios. I take a fiendish delight in this bug inasmuch as Capcom have accidentally gone full Monster Gacha machine. Monster Hunter is, in my experience, pretty gentle with its randomised loot drops, but who knows, perhaps this is secretly them testing a wonderful, magical omnibeast with three rotating eyes and one big arm you yank with your slinger to make assorted wyvern kidneys fall out the bottom.</p>
<p>The FAQ also spotlights a few Monster Hunter Wilds bugs they're still working on. These include network errors when firing an SOS flare right after a quest begins, link members (aka, people you've formed a regular four-person hunting party with) not being prioritised when deciding which players appear in base camps, Palico blunt weapons failing to inflict stun and exhaust, and problems with your profile not being editable and certain side missions being unfinishable.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds continues to be a Steam favourite. I confess, I've drifted away since last week, but that is simply because I am a news shark who must keep swimming forward to the next big release, or else succumb to a deluge of floating boulders. How are you getting on with it, if you're still playing?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With the Switch 2 looming later in 2025, this is likely the last year we’ll see Nintendo develop and publish most of its games on the handheld hybrid that revolutionized how we play console-quality games. Over those eight years, Nintendo has put out some exceptional games from its stable of legacy franchises, and also created a handful of new ones that could stand the test of time. But what were the best of the best? Setting aside the games that are just straight remakes or re-releases (with an exception or two, noted in the text), here’s our ranking of the 30 best games Nintendo released on the Switch from its debut in 2017 to the present day.</p></div><div><p>Most of us played <em>1-2 Switch </em>because we needed something to play with friends who didn’t want to sit around watching us play <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. The mini-game collection is pretty much a Switch tech demo that almost feels like a <em>WarioWare </em>game but not as good or memorable. Still, it’s a fun time killer when you don’t have anything else to play on your Switch. Luckily, a lot has happened in the eight years since, like every other game on this list. </p></div><div><p><em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em> is a compilation of bite-sized speedrunning challenges lifted straight from Nintendo’s releases for its very first console. It has selections from the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, the first <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, and much more, and packages them in a way that requires you to constantly rethink levels you’ve likely played hundreds of times over the past 40 years. As Carolyn Petit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-world-championships-nes-review-online-1851602392&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-world-championships-nes-review-online-1851602392">wrote when the collection came out</a></span>, “Repeatedly, <em>Nintendo World Championships</em> thrilled me by giving me exciting new ways to tackle games that I’ve been intimately familiar with for most of my life, and I suspect that I’ll continue having fun going back to it for some time and trying to improve my rating in some of the game’s many challenges.” Unfortunately, as she also notes, it lacks leaderboards for its individual challenges, eliminating the opportunity for fierce competition with friends that could have made this release an essential throwback instead of merely a novel curiosity. </p></div><div><p>The <em>Mario Party</em> series is, in a word, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-party-jamboree-switch-reviews-metacritic-1851673386&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-party-jamboree-switch-reviews-metacritic-1851673386">divisive</a></span>. <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree </em>isn’t any different. It’s got some great mini-games mixed in with some bad, some boards are a nightmare to play through while others are a breezy trip around the block, and ultimately how you feel about all of that will be determined by whether you’re playing with people who are good sports or the gamer equivalent of an angry wasp who knows nothing but how to pester you for your coins and stars. After nearly 30 years, <em>Mario Party </em>has iterated on its systems and polished away some of the rough edges that sometimes made these games miserable, but for all that refinement, its core impact remains largely unchanged: getting people to go from agreeable friends to sworn enemies with one roll of a die.</p></div><div><p>Seeing Princess Peach get to star in her own game for the first time in ages is certainly welcome, but sadly <em>Princess Peach: Showtime </em>ends up feeling secondary to its <em>Super Mario </em>counterparts. It has cool ideas like giving Peach different costumes and personas to don that also grant her new abilities, but it’s hampered by a simple platforming that doesn’t match the thrills of the <em>Mario </em>games. Hopefully next time Peach gets a starring role the game is up to snuff, and importantly, doesn’t take nearly another 20 years to come out. </p></div><div><p><em>Nintendo Switch Sports</em> had some massive shoes to fill as a successor to <em>Wii Sports</em>. The motion-controlled sports collection didn’t become the household name that its predecessor did, but that’s a tall ask considering <em>Wii Sports </em>was packaged in with Wii systems. By the time <em>Nintendo Switch Sports </em>launched in 2022, the novelty of the premise was dead and gone, but if you’re open to it again nearly 20 years later, you’ll find <em>Nintendo Switch Sports </em>is a fun party game evocative of a different era in Nintendo’s history. It’s a bit unremarkable, but it gets the nostalgic job done with a bit of modern flair. </p></div><div><p><em>ARMS</em> is one of the few new IPs Nintendo invested in for the Switch, and it’s also one of the more underrated games on the system. Its eccentric brand of stretchy, midrange melee combat isn’t quite as deep as the brawling in its fighting game contemporaries, but it is novel and stylish, and could have been a springboard for a better sequel. Though <em>ARMS</em> lives on thanks to fighter Min-Min’s inclusion in the <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> roster, it seems the series has largely been forgotten by Nintendo. Hopefully that changes with the Switch 2, because there’s potential here. </p></div><div><p><em>Nintendo Labo </em>is one of the more oddball experiments the company tried out with the Switch. The toys-to-life cardboard cut-out kits let users assemble handmade peripherals such as a fishing rod, a piano, and a toy car, each taking advantage of the Joy-Con controllers and the Switch itself to create truly original experiences you wouldn’t find on any other platform. Labo is an interesting use of the Switch’s tech, and it’s a shame we haven’t gotten more “throwing spaghetti at the walls” projects like it. Maybe Nintendo will have more ideas like it with the Switch 2's technical upgrades. </p></div><div><p>When I was in college, I didn’t have a real exercise routine. I would run laps around the neighborhood, but that wasn’t the launching pad I needed to actually adopt a healthier lifestyle. <em>Ring Fit Adventure </em>launched shortly after I graduated, and while I don’t play the fitness RPG anymore, I don’t think I would have moved onto more impactful exercise routines without it. The first time I played Nintendo’s exercise game, I woke up the next morning sore in a way I’d never been. This game doesn’t put on kid gloves and tell you to just jog-in-place your way to the end of a dungeon, it uses its titular Ring to make you push, pull, twist, and otherwise contort yourself into different poses to take down in-game foes, all with the goal of creating a regular gamified workout routine. Sometimes all you’ve gotta do to get someone to make a lifestyle change is make it a video game first. Now, I’m a self-taught gym rat, and I would probably have never gotten to that point without playing this game. </p></div><div><p><em>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</em> is a beast of a compilation. As the name implies, the collection includes 51 selections from the realms of board games, card games, and beyond. As Mike Fahey put it when he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendos-new-clubhouse-games-is-a-damn-fine-collection-1843582587&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendos-new-clubhouse-games-is-a-damn-fine-collection-1843582587">wrote about the collection</a></span>, “<em>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</em> is no cheap-and-dirty mini-game bundle. It’s a polished collection of beloved multi and single-player card, dice, board, and sports games in a wonderfully presented package. It’s good stuff. <em>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics </em>doesn’t just collect games, it celebrates them, teaches them, and helps keep their legacies alive.”</p></div><div><p>We often forget when recalling the Switch’s incredible first year launch lineup that <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> was part of the party. Monolith Soft’s sequel to the late-era Wii exclusive took the open-world RPG to the skies for a beautiful, sprawling, somewhat uneven adventure. Building on its predecessor, it married more engaging combat with even deeper progression mechanics to yield interesting exploration and fun battles, held back only by the annoying gacha mechanic underlying the game’s blade spirit system. The sky pirate fantasy about an orphaned salvager named Rex who battles an evil empire took narrative swings that didn’t always land and the characters were weak, but the overall package wasn’t without its charms. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>It was wonderful to see the princess, for the first time, take the starring role in a proper <em>Zelda </em>game  instead of just being the series’ namesake (and no, we don’t count the CD-i games in which she was playable). Unfortunately, not unlike the aforementioned <em>Princess Peach: Showtime </em>existing in the shadow of Mario’s exploits, while <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>has some novel ideas, it also can’t quite hold a candle to the kinds of adventures Link gets to headline. The one-two punch of B-tier, female-focused games in the span of six months had the unfortunate effect of making it seem like Nintendo really doesn’t think its leading ladies are ready for prime time. — Carolyn Petit </p></div><div><p>It’s sad that it took nearly ten years for us to get another<em> </em>game in this consistently delightful series. <em>Pikmin 4</em> continues the series’ trend of being an approachable but reasonably challenging spin on the RTS genre, all while letting you watch in horror as the titular little guys drown, get crushed, and fall to their deaths. Try not to let too many of them meet such a fate, though, or you’ll be out of resources as you try to move treasures to your ship, take down giant foes, and engage in the whimsical camaraderie of having dozens of adorable little bug-like creatures to vibe with.<em> Pikmin </em>isn’t the biggest of Nintendo’s franchises, which is probably why we’ve only gotten four of them on consoles in over 20 years. But every time one shows up, it’s wonderful, and<em> Pikmin 4</em> is no exception. </p></div><div><p>I always recalled the original <em>Luigi’s Mansion </em>on GameCube as being a bit divisive, but perhaps that perception came from it not quite getting the kind of glowing praise usually reserved for the mainline <em>Mario </em>platformers. As the spooky spin-off series has gone on, it’s only gotten better as Nintendo massaged the original concept and riffed on it in fun, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/we-stared-into-gooigis-cold-murderous-eyes-1835459296&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/we-stared-into-gooigis-cold-murderous-eyes-1835459296">often memeable ways</a></span>. As Chris Kohler wrote in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/luigis-mansion-3-is-an-eerie-delight-from-the-lobby-to-1839360620&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/luigis-mansion-3-is-an-eerie-delight-from-the-lobby-to-1839360620"><em>Kotaku</em>’s original review</a></span>, “It’s the sheer variety of experiences in <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em> that keeps it entertaining throughout. While you might at first think you’re in for a repetitive time as you go through the first few floors and find nothing but standard hotel rooms, things get quite unexpected as you continue higher and higher. While it doesn’t reinvent the wheel, it’s a solid take on a series that hasn’t had many entries over the last nearly 20 years. Mostly, it’s just nice to see that Luigi is indeed alive, and not dead.”</p></div><div><p>The <em>Splatoon </em>franchise has pretty rapidly gone from being a new, unproven series on the Wii U to giving us one of the most popular multiplayer games on the Switch, which is no small feat. <em>Splatoon 3</em> offered up a meaningful iteration on the first two games’ Turf War wall-painting mechanics and kept people engaged for months with regular Splatfest competitions that became mini-online wars over the silliest debates, and the appeal is no mystery; effortlessly moving through the ink you leave all over the map is still a delight. As Ari Notis <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447">once wrote</a></span>, “If <em>Splatoon 3</em> doesn’t win you over to Nintendo’s take on the world of competitive shooters, nothing will. This third game in the ink-splattering sequel has something for everyone, from an endearing single-player campaign, to raucous showdowns against giant enemy salmon. It improves or expands on just about everything from the previous game without getting too overwhelming or losing its soul in the process, still focused on two teams trying to coat a location in their color of ink. The online connectivity can still be a mess, but the amount of character customization and player self-expression takes the social shooter to a whole new level. There’s even an in-universe collectible card game. It’s <em>Splatoon 3</em>’s world, we’re just living in it.”</p></div><div><p>The <em>Paper Mario </em>series has had a bit of an identity crisis over the years. Where once they were known as turn-based RPGs with a focus on well-timed input commands, we’ve since gotten a platformer and an action-adventure game that bear the <em>Paper Mario </em>moniker and signature visual style. <em>The Origami King </em>tries to find a happy middle ground between everything <em>Paper Mario </em>has ever been, and the result is a delightful sequel, albeit a potentially aggravating one that doesn’t commit to the tried-and-true turn-based formula of the series’ most beloved entries. As Chris Kohler wrote in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-the-origami-king-the-kotaku-review-1844379684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-the-origami-king-the-kotaku-review-1844379684"><em>Kotaku</em>’s review</a></span>, “I’m not sure why Nintendo feels that <em>Paper Mario</em> can’t be a role-playing game: What exactly was the issue with the original games, which were widely praised and sold very well? But the major issue for me was not that Nintendo removed the series’ RPG mechanics, but that what it replaced them with was not as good. <em>Origami King</em> might not be the successor to <em>Thousand-Year Door</em> for which fans have been clamoring, but this time the formula works, allowing the series’ great writing and worlds to shine through.”</p></div><div><p>It’s fun to think about how if you’re ever hankering for another one of Mario’s run-and-jump adventures, you could just open up <em>Super Mario Maker 2 </em>and find an endless treasure trove of levels you’ve never experienced before. As a creation tool, <em>Super Mario Maker 2 </em>is full of new options and features to help you create the <em>Mario </em>levels of your dreams. As a nearly limitless archive of fan-created levels and challenges, the average <em>Mario </em>fan who has no interest in making their own stages still has a ton to get out of it.</p></div><div><p><em>Kirby </em>spin-offs have been 3D before, but <em>Forgotten Land </em>marks the first time the main platformer series has made the jump. Its open areas and possession mechanics feel inspired by <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and though the pink puffball doesn’t quite reach the same highs, <em>Forgotten Land </em>still has a lot of charm, challenge, and creativity in its DNA. The Mouthful Mode in which Kirby tries to devour things he can’t quite fit in his gaping maw and then uses them for his own goals is still one of the funniest things to be announced during a Nintendo Direct, and it’s a clever feature that riffs on Kirby’s most recognizable trait: eating people and things and using them or their defining characteristics to his own advantage. <em>Forgotten Land </em>is a great spin on old ideas, and I can’t wait to see the series get even more creative as it further explores a 3D design space.</p></div><div><p><em>Metroid Dread</em> is at its best when it leans into how dangerous Samus Aran’s intergalactic exploits truly are. The sidescroller’s most memorable encounters are the ones in which the bounty hunter makes it out by the skin of her teeth, having barely scraped by without her fully-equipped combat suit and all her tools at her disposal. As Carolyn Petit wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metroid-dread-the-kotaku-review-1847823602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-dread-the-kotaku-review-1847823602">in the <em>Kotaku</em> review</a></span>, “I’m glad that<em> Dread</em> really goes for it, that it wants to make you feel hunted and disadvantaged and that it’s willing to feel hostile in order to accomplish that. The result is a feeling that survival itself is a reward more meaningful than all the upgrades in the world, a feeling I rarely get from games anymore.”</p></div><div><p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em> felt like a do-over in more ways than one. It took learnings from Monolith’s previous games and used them to turn the blueprint for the original <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> into a full-fledged open-world RPG that didn’t just feel like beautiful skyboxes over mostly empty fields. The combat is finely tuned, the characters are great, and the story about child soldiers is the best Monolith has ever produced. <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em> tells an evocative tale of friendship, betrayal, and existential fear with one of the best party-based real-time hybrid combat systems around, and the studio’s obsession with baroque skill trees and stat augmenting systems is kept mostly in check. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>When Nintendo said “Everyone is here,” they meant everyone. <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>’s bonkers roster of 89 playable characters is an achievement, albeit a nightmare to balance. A common experience of disappointment among fighting game fans is seeing the next game in a series you love get announced, but your main not make the roster.. <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate </em>says “eff that” and brings back every single character from previous entries, creating a remarkable class reunion of the most iconic heroes and villains of Nintendo’s history. The guest characters, like the long-dormant Banjo-Kazooie and the unexpected Sora from <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, are wild, and damn, that Joker reveal the night before launch got me to leave my house and buy a copy at midnight. <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate </em>was an ongoing cultural event for so long that, much like <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, I can’t quite imagine how Nintendo is going to follow it up on the Switch 2. Maybe after all this expansion, a return to basics is what the series needs. </p></div><div><p>Before <em>Wonder </em>came along, it had been a while since the 2D<em> Mario</em> games had gotten a real upgrade, and while this one isn’t necessarily a revelation, it is the most interesting 2D platformer the plumber has given us in a hot minute. With new power-ups like the Elephant Fruit and level-altering Wonder Seeds, <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> knows how to maintain what makes the series so beloved while also keeping long-time fans on their toes. </p></div><div><p>Once trapped on the Wii U, <em>Super Mario 3D World </em>departed from the likes of <em>Super Mario 64 </em>and <em>Galaxy </em>to give us a game that fused the sensibilities of the series’ early 2D games with 3D gameplay. It deserved to reach a wider audience, and thankfully Nintendo liberated it from the library of that poorly selling console, sweetening the pot in the process by packing in a compact, experimental new adventure (which is why it’s included on this list). <em>Bowser’s Fury </em>adapts <em>3D World</em>’s new costumes and mechanics for an open-world game starring Mario and Bowser Jr., and right from the get-go it establishes a sense of scale unlike anything in the base game. When you start it up and immediately see a giant, terrifying kaiju version of Bowser unleashing fireballs at you like a final boss, it’s genuinely chilling, and establishes that this isn’t just another run-of-the-mill <em>Mario </em>adventure. <em>Bowser’s Fury </em>is a bite-sized experience, but it gives us a lot to chew on as we consider what the future of 3D Mario might look like.</p></div><div><p>If you owned a Switch in 2020, chances are you were playing <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>. If you didn’t own a Switch before the latest entry in Nintendo’s beloved life sim series launched right at the beginning of the covid-19 lockdowns, you may have bought one so you could maintain some semblance of human interaction. <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>is an often cumbersome game, so much so that there are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auTi3stuL5M&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auTi3stuL5M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fake Nintendo Directs</a></span> made to illustrate all the bare minimum improvements fans hoped for but Nintendo never actually implemented. Even so, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>represents one of the quintessential “you had to be there” moments in video game history. Words alone can’t capture how unifying it was to go to your friends’ islands when we couldn’t see each other anywhere else. <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>may be clunky, but it was also a creative and social outlet for millions of people when we needed it most. It’s easily one of the most important games on the Switch. </p></div><div><p>It’s a bit maddening that Game Freak put out one of the most significant leaps forward the <em>Pokémon </em>series has ever seen with <em>Legends: Arceus</em>, but hasn’t looked to it as a template for the future. Taking <em>Pokémon </em>to a historical period before Pokémon gyms and criminal organizations existed let Game Freak design an action/turn-based hybrid RPG unlike anything the series had seen before. Its catching mechanics are unmatched, the changes it makes to the turn-based battles add new layers of strategy, and its story is some of the best narrative work Game Freak has ever pulled off. <em>Legends: Arceus </em>marks the first time since I was a kid that the <em>Pokémon </em>world felt big and unknowable. I’m excited for <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, but I don’t know if it’s going to feel the same without all that historical intrigue. </p></div><div><p>There aren’t many games that have inspired the level of fandom fervor that <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses </em>has. Six years after its release, the question of whether or not Edelgard is a war criminal is still a touchy subject. Intelligent Systems’ first Switch game, developed in collaboration with Koei Tecmo’s Kou Shibusawa team, redefined what <em>Fire Emblem </em>was for a lot of fans. Though there’s some discussion to be had about whether its tactical combat is up to snuff compared to that of its predecessors, the school life and social sim elements are some of the most entertaining and endearing in the genre. Characters like the suave Claude, the honorable Dimitri (until, y’know, he’s not anymore), and the aforementioned war criminal Edelgard have essentially become the modern faces of the <em>Fire Emblem </em>franchise. There was a whole other <em>Fire Emblem </em>on the Switch in <em>Engage</em>, but we’re still talking about <em>Three Houses</em>. </p></div><div><p>In many cases, Nintendo porting a game from the Wii U to the Switch felt like the company was putting them on a lifeboat so they could escape a sinking ship. <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>is one of those rescues, but it’s also so much more (which is why it’s on this list). The kart racer was ported to the Switch just a month after the console launched in 2017; it’s now been nearly eight years since that day and Nintendo is still adding new content to the 11-year-old game. <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>is the best-selling game on the Switch, with a whopping 67.35 million copies sold as of 2020, and when you’ve got that big of a success story, adding a ton of new playable characters, courses, and modes is a no-brainer. Nintendo has announced that a new <em>Mario Kart </em>game is coming to the Switch 2, and considering that it’s following up one of the most feature-complete games in its genre, it’s going to have some huge shoes to fill.</p></div><div><p>Eight years later, I still get the <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>bop <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1IHvzwUd6w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1IHvzwUd6w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Jump Up, Super Star”</a></span> stuck in my head from time to time. Every <em>Mario </em>game has to find some way to make the series’ winning run-and-jump formula fresh and exciting, and <em>Odyssey</em>’s big mechanical change was pretty transformative. Giving Mario’s hat eyes and letting you throw it on objects to take control of them adds a completely new dimension to a <em>Mario </em>level. There are over <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/every-super-mario-odyssey-transformation-ranked-1826833661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/every-super-mario-odyssey-transformation-ranked-1826833661">50 different objects</a></span> Mario can control, and half the fun of <em>Odyssey </em>is testing the limits of what the game will let you do. I was surprised when I was able to possess random objects like cars, as well as enemies I’d only ever fought over years of playing these games. Those magical moments are sprinkled throughout <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, reinvigorating a series that you might think would start running out of gas at this point, and it all culminates in an amazing finale that pays off in an incredible way on both <em>Odyssey</em>’s core mechanic and Mario’s long-time rivalry with the Koopa king.</p></div><div><p> It’s hard to fully get perspective on just how influential <em>Breath of the Wild </em>has been when the ramifications of its arrival are still rippling throughout the realm of game design. With this incredible release Nintendo reinvented its own flagship fantasy series, integrating deep systems into its world in ways that make it feel stunningly alive, a place packed with incredible interactions and discoveries rather than just a map filled with icons to clear. At a point in time when many AAA games are trying to be these massive, life-sucking, open-world time wasters, <em>Breath of the Wild</em> stands as a testament to a concept of open-world design that’s not about simply cramming a map with objectives to complete but making the world so interactive and responsive and surprising that you naturally want to spend time there, just playing and experimenting and discovering.</p></div><div><p>Following up <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, one of the defining games of the last decade, is no small task, but<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> builds upon <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s foundations to stunning effect. The first game asks you to explore its open world to your heart’s content. <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> asks you to build something in all the empty spaces. Nintendo looked at the previous game’s themes and traversal and, instead of making the world bigger for the sake of it, chose to find new ways to extrapolate those ideas into something altogether different.</p><p><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> is all about experimentation, creative thinking, and problem-solving, and no two people play it the same way. I remember being in Discord calls playing the game alongside friends and it took days or weeks for some of us to come across certain storylines and characters others encountered right away because the paths we took were so vastly different. Then we used the Ultrahand mechanic to build vehicles, platforms, and other tools to solve puzzles with solutions that hadn’t crossed each other’s minds. Sharing a <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> clip is like presenting an art piece all one’s own, as people’s stunts, creations, and solutions were expressions of their creativity. <em>Breath of the Wild</em> told players to go wherever they wanted, and then <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> asked them to find a new way to get there. Like its predecessor, it will no doubt be hugely influential to the next generation of open-world games, perhaps in ways that we can’t yet begin to imagine.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

During the new look at the game, a character by the name of Neil--played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli--was introduced. While his dark past with the Bridges organization was teased, it's the brief moment where Neil dons a bandana that had Metal Gear Solid fans pointing at their screens:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4456523-death-starnding-snake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456523" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4456523-death-starnding-snake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456523"></a><figcaption>Solid Snake, is that you?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4456523-death-starnding-snake.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4456524-deathstranding2%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456522-deathstranding2%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456524,1300-4456522" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4456524-deathstranding2%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4456522-deathstranding2%283%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4456524-deathstranding2%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456522-deathstranding2%283%29.jpg"></figure><p>As seen in the image above, Neil looks remarkably similar to Solid Snake once he dresses up for a fight. Back in a 2020 Instagram post, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDMIVpVnef5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kojima mentioned that Marinelli</a> would be the "spitting image" of Snake if he ever decided to wear the character's bandana, and it looks like that prediction has come true in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2</a>.</p><p>What's also interesting to note here is that the character is flanked by several soldiers, similar to how Death Stranding's antagonist Clifford Unger would surround himself with troops whenever he appeared in the game. That suggests that Neil has died and has become a post-death entity, someone who finds himself driven to complete his unfinished business and can journey to battlefield beaches.</p><p>Another reference to Metal Gear Solid can be seen in the brief scene where Heartman takes control of the DHV Magellan submersible, fusing it with a gigantic entity from the tar to take on other titans. Yoji Shinkawa, who was the art director on 1998's Metal Gear Solid, also worked on Death Stranding 2 so it's not too surprising to see a few visual callbacks with the design of the Magellan.</p><p>There's also a hint of Pacific Rim in the control interface here for Magellan Man, which is a nice allusion to the film's director and Deadman's visual inspiration, Guillermo del Toro.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456525-deathstranding2%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456525" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456525-deathstranding2%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456525"></a><figcaption>Magellan Man is ready to rumble.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456525-deathstranding2%284%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456528-deathstranding2%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456526-deathstranding2%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456527-deathstranding2%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456528,1300-4456526,1300-4456527" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4456528-deathstranding2%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4456526-deathstranding2%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4456527-deathstranding2%286%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456528-deathstranding2%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456526-deathstranding2%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456527-deathstranding2%286%29.jpg"></figure><p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will launch for PS5 on June 26, and anyone who purchases the digital deluxe or collector's edition can start playing two days early on June 24.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced its Alarmo clock will be available on general sale in Japan in May.</p>
<p>Previously, only Nintendo Switch Online members have been able to order the alarm clock worldwide, though in Japan a lottery system was put in place due to its popularity.</p>
<p>A wider launch of the clock was expected in mid-January, but this was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-hits-snooze-on-alarmos-public-release">later postponed to early March</a> due to stock shortages. The clock will finally be ready for general sale in May - but only in Japan.</p>

<p>Nintendo Japan added an update to its <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2024/1204.html">Alarmo notice</a>, stating the launch date for non-members will be 22nd May 2025, both from the My Nintendo Store and game retailers. Pre-orders will open before this, though a date is unknown.</p>
<p>So far this is only in Japan, but presumably news of a worldwide general release will follow.</p> <div>

<p>First revealed in October, the Alarmo is an interactive alarm clock that responds to your body's movements by playing different sounds based on Nintendo video games.</p>
<p>Indeed, Nintendo has today added classic sound effects from Super Mario Bros. on the NES to the device, available to download for free.</p>

<p>Last month, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-coming-in-june-at-400-former-nintendo-employee-predicts">former Nintendo employee</a> - sales lead in the sales and retail department - suggested the Alarmo release being tied to Nintendo Online accounts may have been an intentional test ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> pre-orders.</p>
<p>Switch 2 is yet to have its release date announced. Perhaps the general sale of Alarmo in May will free up Nintendo's online store for the new console.</p>
<p>"Alarmo's clever motion sensor is the star of the show in this pricey Nintendo-coated lifestyle gadget that otherwise skimps on the fun," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-review-marios-charm-cant-justify-alarm-clocks-90-price-tag">Alarmo review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>One of my favourite things in the entire world is the brash poetry inherent in the word 'skyscraper', and the many writing and language lessons gleaned from considering how utterly mundane that word actually feels to use. This week, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> community join me in the "probably thinking too much about skyscrapers" club. Paradox's city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> has turned ten.</p>
<p>To celebrate, they've <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/cities-skylines-anniversary">constructed a towering roadmap of freebies</a> for it and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a>, including new radio stations, new content, and a free-to-play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/542225339665876198">Steam event</a> for the original running March 20-24.</p>

<p>Some<a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/news/ten-years-of-cities-skylines"> blogly</a> musings:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We founded Colossal Order with the dream of creating a city-builder that would bring more freedom and creativity to the cities players can build. With Cities: Skylines, that dream not only came true, but thanks to the continued support of our amazing fans, we had the opportunity to keep growing and building this game and community many years after its release and take it even further than anticipated. It's been an incredible journey that's taught us so much - and still has more to teach - and we are forever grateful to everyone who made it possible and who joined us along the way.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Cities: Skylines has continued to receive updates throughout the years, the most recent being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-latest-dlc-came-out-this-week-18-months-after-its-final-dlc-came-out-last-year">last October</a>. Its sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-review">launched in a rough state</a> a year prior, though has seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-months-of-renovations-cities-skyline-2-performance-is-considerably-less-terrible">some improvements since</a>. It's also seen some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">controversy surrounding "rushed" DLC</a>, and still looks a ways off from overtaking the original in both popularity and reception.</p>
<p>Paradox have fessed up to misjudging the impact of Skylines 2's launch technical shortcomings. Players are now "less accepting that you will fix things over time," Paradox CEO Mattias Lilja <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">told Edwin last year</a>, with CCO Henrik Fåhraeus commenting seperately that "we were aware that performance was not great, but we underestimated how it will be perceived by players." </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-is-nothing-beyond-this-point-except-a-promisingly-odd-metroidvania-about-exploring-the-void<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
One of my Foundational Video Games is <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/4498-mazeworld-the-ghost-of-mordaine">Mazeworld</a>, an elder Apple Macintosh first-personifier in which you explore a Carollian landscape of blue-walled darkness and rainbow-shelled snails. I was a young slip of a boy when Mazeworld released, and prone to daymares about crocodiles floating through the ceiling. Imagine my reaction to a game in which you are immediately confronted by a slathering, bodiless Cheshire Cat, its face a grinning smear that is only visible when it's charging right at you.
</p>
<p>
I'm always looking for games that similarly hide themselves, throwing you into a chasm of occult potentiality from which anything might emerge, given the appropriate rites. Games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nix-umbra-review-occult-horror-at-its-most-focused-and-intense">Nix Umbra</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-of-a-wish">Death Of A Wish</a> and now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nothing-beyond-this-point">Nothing Beyond This Point</a>, a topdown metroidvania in which you are a flaming cube surrounded by floating rods, dropped into a pixelart-scuffed void. RPS reader Mr_B recommended it in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-are-we-all-playing-this-weekend-324?view=comments">our last weekend plays thread</a>, and I couldn't resist trying the demo.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The aforesaid void isn't quite a blob of bad vibes, in practice. It has structure and the suggestion of an orderly grand design. There are 16 areas divided into tacit rooms, with reassuring fixtures such as campfires. There are genre-familiar activities such as having to clear a room of foes before you can leave it, or choosing between three permanent power-ups at key junctures.</p>
<p>There is also a fair amount of Enigma, however. Some rooms wrap around themselves and can only be exited from a certain side. Campfires aren't just "access points" and "save points", they're there to provide "a false sense of security". There are sigils that can eventually be interacted with in the form of a doodling minigame, altering the environment. There are also three gods to find, and the rudiments of coherent places. At one point a disembodied voice started talking to me in garbled Cthulhu language, alluding to a distant obelisk. 
</p>
<p>
The combat is also quite ingenious so far. Basically, you're immortal as long as you're surrounded by floating rods, which dissolve when you take damage and can be regenerated by holding space - which locks you in place for a fateful second or two. Rods are also spent to perform special abilities such as fireballs and AOE blasts, so battles are inherently tenser and more focussed on resource management than in a lot of vanias. Enemies consist of crawling horrors, sniper ghosts, and mallet-wielding machines.
</p>
<p>
I do get some sense that Nothing Beyond This Point will resolve eventually into a straightforward game of room clearance, levelling, and boss battles (I broke off playing the demo after I was slain by a robot-building robot) but then again, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321280/Nothing_Beyond_This_Point">the Steam page</a> cautions that "you've seen nothing yet". Haha, I don't see what they did there. I wonder if they have a Cheshire Cat. I wonder if they have crocodiles. Argh.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-factions/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-factions%E2%80%94everything-we-know-about-battlefield-2025-factions.1129824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-factions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlefield’s Factions determine which regions fight each other in matches. The concept has been around for decades, and Battlefield 6, which may release in 2025, will again feature waging Factions.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> could be pivotal for both EA and the storied shooter franchise. Recent Battlefield games haven’t fared too well. Battlefield 1 was solid, whereas Battlefield 5 focused too much on what fans didn’t ask for. On the other hand, Battlefield 2042 was the series’ comparison to jumping the shark.</p>



<p>2025 aims to bring Battlefield 6 and make it one of the best. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> Factions have been the topic of conversation, so let’s dig into the latest details.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-factions-confirmed-so-far">Battlefield 6 Factions Confirmed so far</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will you fight? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6’s 2025 pre-Alpha footage has shown NATO and what looks to be a PMC outfit called Pax Armata</strong> <strong>as the main opposing Factions.</strong></p>



<p>There are a few things to consider with Battlefield 6’s Factions so far. Firstly, this is a pre-Alpha, and it’s <strong>likely EA is using a ton of placeholders and unofficial names</strong> for now. The focus is on the gameplay, network connectivity, and overall game stability.</p>



<p>Given recent criticism of the franchise, it’s understandable if the multiple developers aren’t as bothered about the names of the game’s Factions for now. Secondly, don’t be surprised if EA does end up sticking with more generic Factions such as NATO and either an unnamed PMC (Private Military Company), or the generic use of “PMC” instead.</p>



<p>Real-life global tensions mean these decisions can’t be taken lightly. Battlefield 2042 did use “Russian Army,” “United States Marine Corps,” and “British Army,” but times change. So don’t be surprised to see Battlefield 6 adopt safe Faction names.</p>



<p>Even if Battlefield runs with NATO, you likely won’t be stuck with the same few default selections. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j6wy6t/thats_a_union_flag_right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Reddit post</a> has identified a Union Flag on a soldier’s uniform using the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 leaks</a>. This means there’s potential wiggle room for customization options. The OP for the post said: “I’m hoping Dice is brave and gives us some clear depictions of Russian, Chinese &amp; Iranian uniforms for the opfor Faction.”</p>



<p>Again, real-world scenarios and events have a bearing on how Battlefield 6’s final content looks. We’ll have to see how close EA and DICE push the boundaries.</p>



<hr>



<p>We’re still not 100% sure when Battlefield 6 is set to launch, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA has claimed it will be before April 2026</a>. We’re still not ruling out a 2025 launch either. </p>



<p>What do you think of Battlefield Labs so far? Does the game look promising? Are we finally due a brilliant Battlefield game?</p>

            <p>Doom: The Dark Ages serves as a prequel to 2016's Doom and its sequel Doom Eternal, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-is-an-origin-story-for-the-doom-slayers-rage">tells the "epic cinematic origin story of the Doom Slayer's rage"</a>. But, even though it's a prequel, don't expect The Dark Ages to end with the Slayer being popped in a coffin.</p>
<p>As a reminder, 2016's Doom opens with the Slayer lying in a coffin, before he swiftly breaks free from the chains binding him so he can shoot the faces off advancing baddies. It is quite the way to kick things off.</p>
<p>So, if The Dark Ages is going to set us up for Doom 2016, surely we already know how the upcoming game is going to end, right? Wrong!</p>

<p>"I mean, that would end the Dark Ages, the medieval chapter of the Doom saga. This is kind of like the Chronicles of the Slayer," Doom: The Dark Ages game director Hugo Martin told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/doom-the-dark-ages-wont-end-with-the-slayer-in-a-coffin-waiting-for-the-start-of-doom-2016-that-would-mean-that-we-couldnt-tell-any-more-medieval-stories/">PC Gamer</a>, when asked about potentially seeing the Slayer getting locked away.</p>
<p>"So if we took it all the way to that point, then that would mean that we couldn't tell any more medieval stories. And I'm not announcing projects or anything other than to just say it's better to leave it open."</p>
<p>The game director added that the Doom: The Dark Ages team has some DLC planned for the prequel, so again putting the Slayer in a coffin during the main story wouldn't make sense.</p>
<p>"We do have a DLC and things like that, so it won't - I'm not giving away spoilers - but it doesn't end with him [in the coffin]," the developer continued.</p>
<p>"The story is that they collapsed a building on top of him and then put him inside of that sarcophagus that we find him in at the beginning of 2016," said Martin.</p>
<p>"And this game doesn't end that way."</p>

			<p>There are two castles, and that ‘V’ between them means that they’re not on the best of terms. You play cards from your deck in an effort to destroy the nefarious enemy castle. And… well, that’s just about the only the aim of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3398880/Castle_V_Castle/">Castle V Castle</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Castle V Castle | Official Game Reveal (Steam PC &amp; Mobile)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3WHiA2nZrRE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The demo that you can currently leap into as part of Steam Next Fest does away with any pretence of tutorials or storytelling, instead leaning on the idea that the title does both of those things. What more could you need to know?</p>


<p>Castle V Castle is a strategic resource management game, accruing enough of each to use in offense and defence against that vile enemy castle. There’s probably some deep-seated visual analogy for the fact that you and your enemies look identical, but I’ll let you mull that over on your own time.</p>
<p>These resources are broken down into separate sections, with your castle’s level prominently displayed at the top. You’ve then got Build, which displays the number of bricks you have, and the number of builders, followed by the Attack category which shows your soldiers and number of weapons. Finally, there’s Magic, which contains Witches and Magic Power.</p>

<p>Each of these can be utilised to grow your castle, expand defences, or go on the attack, whittling the enemy castle down faster than they whittle yours. It’s simple, but there’s a real push-and-pull between the two sides.</p>

<p>Successfully completing a stage grants you a reward chest or, if you’re unlucky, a cursed chest. Either will give you the choice between two permanent upgrades or curses, before sending you off again to fight the next castle. They really do throw them up these days, don’t they? As you progress you might have to decide whether to focus on magic or old fashioned sword-swinging, depending on the curses and boons you’ve chosen.</p>
<p>The biggest sticking point comes when you don’t have enough resources to play a card. Discarding one will see it replaced by another, but you also lose your turn so it can completely change the outcome of a round if you don’t get it right. I found it easier to get rid of higher value cards, focusing on easier to play, low value cards, but you miss out on the most powerful attacks if you do that, from whirling dervishes of knights, to a robot that counts down through ten rounds before annihilating you.</p>
<p>There’s a great sense of character here, despite the simple black and white visuals and focused gameplay. The demo is quite short – 20 minutes, if that – so it’s not a huge timesink to check out, and if it captures your attention, there’s a daily challenge that you can hop into each day. Castle V Castle is listed as a singleplayer title, but it feels like a natural fit for online multiplayer, which I hope is something the team at Nopopo consider. Either way, I can see it capturing a good number of players in its grey brick walls when it releases.</p>
<p>Castle V Castle is a smart spot of strategy, with a great aesthetic. It’s definitely one to keep an eye on.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has today received its latest update, fixing a number of issues.</p>
<p>The update, known as ver.1.000.05.00, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-soon-to-fix-monster-hunter-wilds-issue-where-its-celebrated-food-scenes-arent-showing">was announced last week</a>, and now that it's live Capcom has released a full list of fixes.</p>
<p>Alongside an issue where the game's celebrated food scenes weren't showing, other fixed issues include the Monster Field Guide not being accessible (which is pretty crucial), players falling through the map after the Towards Fervent Fields mission in Chapter 2-1, and issues with screen rendering causing force quits.</p>

<p>A full list of fixes can be found in the <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Capcom has also updated its list of known issues. These will presumably be fixed in the next patch, though some of these issues have been on this list for the past couple of patch notes.</p>
<p>The known issues are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A network error occurs when firing an SOS flare right after a quest begins.</li>
<li>Link Members are not prioritized over other players and may not appear in some places including Base Camps.</li>
<li>Palico’s attacks with blunt weapons do not inflict stun and exhaust damages.</li>
<li>Hunter Profile cannot be edited properly on some occasions.</li>
<li>Some side missions cannot be completed under certain situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Capcom has requested players restart the game and update to the latest version before playing again.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has proven exceptionally popular since its release at the end of February. While Steam player numbers have taken a dip, its all-time concurrent player count peak was at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">over 1.38 million players during its first weekend</a>. That's the fifth highest peak ever on the platform.</p>
<p>The game sold 8m copies in its first three days on sale to become <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Capcom's fastest-selling game ever</a>. That number will have risen even further since.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mod-introduces-highly-requested-feature-still-missing-from-the-vanilla-game.1129791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-highly-requested-feature/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Monster Hunter Wilds shared online today introduces yet another highly-requested feature that is still missing from the vanilla game.</p>
<p>The Layer Any Weapon mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/496?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces a very simple Layered Weapon system that allows hunters to layer the appearance of any weapon onto the currently equipped one, similar to what is possible to do in the vanilla game with armor. Given how the strongest weapons in the game, the Artian weapons, don't have the best looks in most cases, this mod is a must for those who want to look at something other than the mechanical design of these weapons.</p>
<p>Shortly after the launch of the game last month, plenty of mods were released online addressing some of Monster Hunter Wilds' biggest issues, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-addresses-stuttering/">performance</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/">low challenge level</a>. Even with these issues, however, the latest entry in the series proved to be very successful, selling <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-8-million-units-in-3-days-the-fastest-game-in-capcoms-history/">8 million units in 3 days</a>, the fastest ever for CAPCOM. The game's success, in my opinion, is completely deserved, as it is a very solid game that's really fun to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-version-gets-esrb-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-version-gets-esrb-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch.1129773/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-version-gets-esrb-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The ESRB has <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40439/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> the official rating for the PlayStation 5 version of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, sparking inevitable discussions about the game's imminent debut on Sony's console.</p>
<p>This title went back and forth several times. It was already planned to go fully multiplatform in the beginning, but then Microsoft renegotiated the deal with Disney and Lucasfilm after its acquisition of Bethesda to make it a PC and Xbox exclusive. However, by the time the game actually got its final release date, Microsoft had shifted its policy toward multiplatform releases. At Gamescom 2024, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would launch in December for PC and Xbox and in Spring 2025 for PlayStation 5. The latest rumors point to a release on Sony's console sometime next month and today's finding of the ESRB rating certainly supports this theory.</p>
<p>MachineGames has already published a few post-release updates, although to be fair, the game was already great at launch, as I discussed <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>Still, some of those improvements could come in handy for this new version. The game now supports fully ray traced shadows; moreover, the most recent update <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3-adds-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-and-path-tracing-support-on-amd-intel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> support for path tracing on AMD (and Intel GPU) and AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation integration. Given that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle already <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-an-impressive-ray-tracing-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured a great ray tracing implementation on the Xbox Series X</a>, it is possible the developers might push it even further on the PlayStation 5 Pro, which features several hardware-based ray tracing optimizations.</p>
<p>Could this game be the first path traced title available on the PS5 Pro? Maybe. When we floated the idea of path tracing for Sony's console <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an interview with System Architect Mark Cerny</a>, he remained cautious, adding that developers 'need to have a highly optimized strategy for doing it if you're going to do it on PlayStation 5 Pro'. Well, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is likely the most optimized path tracing game available right now, so there's no better candidate in theory. We'll see if MachineGames actually tries it or sticks with a more conservative enhanced ray tracing target.</p>

            <p>A new trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has dropped. It puts a ten-minute dent into the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a>'s enigma, but the most tantalising question still remains: is Kojima using that subtitle to deliberately remind everybody of the original's <a href="https://youtu.be/5cnXkbUFdBs">most infamous scene</a>? Bold choice if so, although not the only one. Here's the trailer, complete with familiar mechs and very familiar bandanas. See Konami, this is what happens when you pop out for five minutes to re-release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars">Suikoden</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside The Solitude of Prime Numbers's Luca Marinelli wearing a Snakely bandana and a Rex-reminiscent mech, the trailer also has a console release date: 26th June 2025, or 63 days before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. This is approximately enough time for players unfamiliar with Kojima's works to pick up Death Stranding 2 on a whim, finish it, buy  Delta of out curiosity, then think "hey, this Snake guy is a total rip-off of Luca Marinelli's character!". A paratextual commentary on identity, memory, and hero worship? Kojima you sly old dog, you've done it again!</p>
<p>Shared as part of a panel at SXSW, the trailer joins news of an <a href="https://kojimaproductions.jp/en/deathstranding-concerts-announced?dm_i=74N0,1E4S2,1MPLY2,4YF2G,1#m-scroll-target">orchestral concert </a>and <a href="https://kojimaproductions.jp/en/deathstranding2_hamilton_announced?dm_i=74N0,1E4S2,1MPLY2,4YF2G,1#m-scroll-target">a watch</a>. Why, you could wear the watch to the concert and draw attention to yourself in the queue by loudly asking "what time does this thing start, anyway?!" and theatrically glaring at your wrist, then smarmily asking "oh, this old thing?" at great volume to no-one in particular. You'd be really cool if you did that.</p>
<p>It took about eight months for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> to break console containment. If this follows suit, we might well see the sequel on PC by the end of the year. I reckon we got the best of both worlds with the original's late release though: more time to play other games, and a shiny Director's Cut to boot. I enjoyed it so much I was compelled to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/object-ive-review-death-strandings-pizza">spill words aplenty on pizza</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>For the best part of a decade we’ve explored video games through a historic lens in <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playing-with-history">Playing With History</a>, studying AAA blockbusters such as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> to indie gems like <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/radio-commander">Radio Commander</a>, examining the real-world people, events, and cultures that inspired them.</p>
<p>We’re proud to announce that Playing With History is to become a premium print publication with its first volume heading to crowdfunding platform, Kickstarter, later this year. Available digitally and in both paperback and hardback, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playingwithhistory/playing-with-history-pixels-polygons-and-the-past">Playing With History: Volume One</a> promises over 200 pages of developer interviews, deep dives, and retrospectives, all presented in a visually arresting format.</p>
<div id="attachment_457611"><p id="caption-attachment-457611">Battlefield: The Endless War For Wake Island is just one of many original articles created for Playing With History.</p></div>
<p>Together, with video game creatives and historians, we investigate a wide spectrum of historic eras and how they are represented, from the prehistoric playgrounds of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/far-cry-primal">Far Cry Primal</a> to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a>’s nightmarish Normandy landings and far beyond. Whether it’s Romans, Vikings, samurai, or pirates, we leave no virtual stone unturned, with plenty of fascinating detours along the way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microtransactions-are-stopping-creativity-reckons-josef-fares/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Always the outspoken game designer, Hazelight's Josef Fares has recently commented on the negative influence that the widespread usage of microtransactions is having on the game industry. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjgQpyc1gh4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to YouTube channel Fall Damage</a> in a reaction video to user comments, Fares explained:</p>
<p><em>Of course, and that goes for everything we do at Hazelight. I think that kind of shit affects the design of how the game should be done. Every time you take a design decision based on you making more money in the game, I think it's a huge problem, and it's stopping our industry from a creative perspective.</em></p>
<p>For a few years, especially around 2017-2018, there were instances of highly aggressive microtransactions that triggered massive backlash from fans. Famous instances include <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-hit-by-class-action-for-nba-2k-loot-boxes-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBA 2K</a>, Star Wars Battlefront II (where Electronic Arts was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced</a> to remove them just before launch), <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-avengers-now-features-gameplay-related-microtransactions-despite-promises-itd-never-happen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Avengers</a> (in this case, too, the developers had to quickly cut them from the game), and more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-community-is-angry-at-the-new-microtransactions-techland-responds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light 2</a>. Microtransactions even made it into several single player games, like <a href="http://wccftech.com/shadow-of-war-director-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Middle-earth: Shadow of War</a>, various Ubisoft games, and even CAPCOM's <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-has-time-saving-mtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Devil May Cry V</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-mods-bypass-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-gets-microtransactions-for-instant-weapon-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p>
<p>Nowadays, developers are more careful when implementing microtransactions, sticking strictly to cosmetic items in most cases. However, microtransactions are more pervasive than ever, especially since the game industry isn't growing meaningfully anymore and development budgets continue to increase. The only solution, then, is to try to squeeze more out of the average consumer.</p>
<p>Thankfully, if you don't want anything to do with microtransactions, there are still several games completely devoid of them, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-has-no-drm-or-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a> or even Josef Fares's own Split Fiction, which just launched to positive reviews. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned an 8/10 score from Nathan Birch</a>:</p>
<p><em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios’ last couple of games, but it’s hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two’s unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone’s favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you’re not up for its sometimes-frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em></p>

            <p>Over the weekend, hectic 1v1 shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a> got yet more free maps in an update. The developers added <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2386720/view/509574242369537162">eight new cramped deathzones</a> alongside a further four maps for owners of the "maps 'n' hats" DLC, then threw in a new submachine gun and a music player for good measure. But over on the game's Discord server, amid the mine-laying mercenaries and bum-sliding shootscum, the developers also held a poll that revealed future plans. They asked players what they'd prefer: a 2v2 mode or a four-player free-for-all? </p>
<p>"We'll do both," said devbrother Leonard Lemaitre, "but it's a matter of which one comes first."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The poll, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1124764095623741473/1265760231913422969/1347947995441664121">posted on Saturday</a>, currently puts the presumably chaotic four player free-for-all mode ahead, with twice as many votes as the 2v2 mode, which I can only imagine will be an intense bonding exercise for connoisseurs of early 2000s multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> lobbies. Although the poll is being conducted with emojis, and it's possible a lot of voters are getting the "two silhouetted people" emoji confused with the "two silhouettes hugging" emoji, thereby splitting the 2v2 vote. Is there an electoral commission for frenzied first-person killsports? Nah, we can solve this with a first-to-three in Chateaux_13_Alt_Alt. </p>
<p> It's very pleasing to see the game pumping out updates. It was already an "anarchic first-person speed dater you'll fall in love with" according to our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-review">Straftat review</a> from Rick, and that was before they added <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-resurrects-a-counter-strike-map-you-either-love-or-hate-cannibalising-fps-history-in-the-best-way-possible">another heaving bunch of maps to the concrete bullet brawler</a>. Including this latest update, my estimate is now 192 maps (if you own the DLC) although I could have easily lost count. There's a reason it was one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-24-favourite-games-of-2024">favourite games of 2024</a>.</p>
<p>This weekend's update adds a few other bits and bobs. You can now view your match history in the stats menu, for example. And you can disable your crosshair in the options, if you are some kind of instinctually accursed murder master. Don't matchmake with me, please, I don't like that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new filing from the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has confirmed multiple Switch 2 features.</p>
<p>Now we know Amiibo figurines will be supported, as Switch 2 will support NFC - it's in the right Joy-Con, just like the original Switch.</p>
<p>It's also confirmed to have faster Wi-Fi compatibility with support for Wi-Fi 6 networks with up to 80MHz of bandwidth, up from Wi-Fi 5 on the original Switch. However, it doesn't appear to support the more recent Wi-Fi 7 or Wi-Fi 6E.</p>

<p>Further, we already knew Switch 2 would have USB-C ports both on top and at the bottom of the console, but these filings confirm both ports can be used to charge the console.</p>
<p>We also now know the Switch 2's code designation is BEE, with BEE-001 being the model of the console, BEE-012 and 014 being the left and right Joy-Cons, and BEE-053 being the Relay Box.</p>
<p>Similarly, the GameCube had the code DOL (for Dolphin) and the Wii had RVL (for Revolution).</p>
<p>Below are images from the filings (thanks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/625931/nintendo-switch-2-fcc-nfc-wi-fi-6-usb">The Verge</a>).</p>

<p>We still don't know the release date for the Switch 2 but it's not long now until we find out - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">Nintendo is hosting a Direct livestream</a> on 2nd April at 2pm UK time.</p>
<p>Little is known about the console so far, beyond its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">reveal back in January</a>, but it's hoped the Direct will provide a wealth of information: from its release date and price, to the launch line-up. Presumably that will include the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">new Mario Kart game previously teased</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
