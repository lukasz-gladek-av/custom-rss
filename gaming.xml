            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-driving-adventure-rv-there-yet-crosses-1-3m-sales-in-just-one-week.1335766/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Nuggets Entertainment has revealed that its co-op driving adventure&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?</em> has hit a very impressive sales milestone less than a week after its release.</p>

<p>On Friday, Nuggets <a href="https://x.com/RVThereYetGame/status/1982121374002168034" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the game had crossed a million sales with a rather endearingly lo-fi picture of a character pushing an RV up a hill, and over the weekend, sales reached almost 1.3 million (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cooperative-indie-darling-rv-there-yet-cruises-past-13-million-sales" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>).</p>

<p>In a video on the official Nuggets YouTube channel, "winch operator" Jace Varlet says that he and his team are aware that players have reported some bugs in&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?</em>, and he says those bugs are being worked on by the development team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rv-there-yet-sales-rock.jpg?itok=ZTT8TpEF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rv-there-yet-sales-rock.jpg?itok=t3YsR1Ml 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Indie "friendslop"-style adventure&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?&nbsp;</em>has crossed an impressive sales barrier.</figcaption></figure><p>Varlet also acknowledges that players are complaining of some features, like multi-language support and key rebinding, being unavailable in&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?</em>, with some even going as far as to suggest that the game should have been released in Early Access.</p>

<p>According to Varlet, the reason these features aren't present in the game is that "it was a game jam game", with the kind of strict deadline that implies, and the team "had no expectation" that&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?&nbsp;</em>would become as popular as it has.</p>

<p>As for why&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?&nbsp;</em>didn't launch in Early Access, Varlet says the game "by and large is there", even if some features are missing, and that no other features were planned, thus making the Early Access label unsuitable for Nuggets' effort.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?</em>, it's a co-op adventure game in which you and your friends must take an unconventional route home after a vacation. It's in a similar vein to games like indie hits&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-2m-sales" rel="nofollow">Peak</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-together-steam-surprise-hit" rel="nofollow"><em>Chained Together</em></a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-new-160w-prime-charger-just-hit-record-low-for-the-first-time-and-its-already-running-low-on-stock-2000639096</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-new-160w-prime-charger-just-hit-record-low-for-the-first-time-and-it%E2%80%99s-already-running-low-on-stock.1335760/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We all use multiple devices every day; for both work and play. Our phones keep us connected, laptops handle the typical 9-to-5, and tablets come in handy for some on-the-go productivity. But juggling chargers for everything? That’s where it can get messy.</p>
<p>Carrying separate blocks and wires for all your devices is inconvenient. Things get bulky fast, and there’s no guarantee you’ll find a spare outlet for each device when you’re not at home. The solution? An efficient, but safe-to-use multi-port charger that works well with a range of devices.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5020/"> The 3-port Anker Prime charger does a great job at that, and you can now grab it for just $110 on Amazon, after a nice $40 discount.</a> The only catch? This deal is limited to Prime members. Non-Prime members can still get it at the regular price of $150, or wait it out for another future drop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5020/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charge Multiple Devices at Once</h2>
<p>You’re getting three charging ports and a total output of 160W. It can deliver up to 140W from a single port, which is great for power-hungry devices like MacBooks. When using all three, the power gets split up depending on the devices you’re juicing up. For example, it can deliver 70W + 70W + 20W when you’re charging two laptops at once, or 100W + 30W + 30W if you want to prioritize one main device, while also powering two more.</p>
<p>There’s a smart display on top, which gives you an insight into exactly how much power is being delivered to each device in real time. For more custom modes, you can connect the charger to the Anker app via Bluetooth. It lets you customize your control, plus switch charging modes as per your needs.</p>



<p>Compactibility is impressive. It plays nicely with just about everything, including iPhones (12 through 17 Series), iPads, MacBooks, AirPods, Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy phones, and even Steam Deck, ThinkPad X1, etc. And despite all this power, the charger stays compact and lightweight. It’s no larger than an AirPods Pro case, meaning you can toss it into your backpack and carry it around without feeling like you’re carrying something heavy. ActiveShield 4.0 monitors temperature 120 times per second to prevent overheating, so safety won’t be a concern either.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5020/">Altogether, this efficient charger replaces three with one. It fits into your hand, and still packs enough power to juice all your essentials quickly at the same time.</a></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><i>The Outer Worlds 2</i></a> is available for all starting on October 29, 2025. Those who’ve purchased the premium edition, however, can get in on the action early with “advanced access.” And if you do, you’ll get treated to a unique “Flaw” for your character (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/the-outer-worlds-2-fans-punished-by-obsidian-with-hilarious-debuffs-for-everything-from-dialogue-skipping-to-consumerism-if-they-purchase-the-usd100-premium-edition/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>) literally titled “Consumerism.” Flaws grant the player a double-edged sword of buffs and debuffs that can impact certain in-game actions or decisions, or specific character builds. And “Consumerism’s” description amusingly reads, “You’re the reason our marketing works. Promotions and sales have riddled your brain, and you’re more interested in buying the next big thing than financial planning.”</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>: The&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></p> <p>Well, while it might double as a subtle reminder for some of us (re: me) to dig into that “financial planning,” at the very least the Flaw nets the player a permanent 15-percent discount on all vendors in the game, at the cost of earning 10 percent less for any item sold.</p>

    <p>But that’s not the only amusing Flaw Obsidian packed into the game. Racing through all the dialogue in the game will earn you “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1og6q38/skipping_through_dialogue_in_rpgs_finally_bit_me/">Foot-in-Mouth Syndrome</a>,” where you’ll earn 15-percent extra experience on everything at the cost of having your dialogue choices made for you at random.</p>

 <p>Another amusing Flaw triggers when you invest in your skill points a little too evenly. “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1ogm9cd/is_this_a_good_flaw/">Easily Distracted</a>” seems to trigger when you spread out your skill points across five different skills. This Flaw lets you raise skills more quickly, though it’s much harder to invest in one skill over any others as it only lets you “add skill points into your lowest non-zero Skill or any Skill you have no points in already.”</p> <p>I’m sure these are far from the only nuggets of meta-humor Obsidian has packed into this game.</p>

<p>Kratos Actor Christopher Judge has expressed his thoughts about going to Egypt for the next God of War game.</p>



<p>We keep hearing updates on spin-off and mainline God of War games, but we have yet to receive an official announcement. We recently saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshots</a> of the canceled multiplayer game emerge online, and now Kratos’ actor has expressed interest in traveling to Egypt for the next mainline release. </p>



<h2 id="h-going-to-egypt-for-the-next-god-of-war-would-be-a-completion-of-my-circle">Going to Egypt for the Next God of War “Would be a Completion of My Circle’ </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/god-of-war-actor-christopher-judge-says-he-hopes-a-potential-sequel-will-take-place-in-egypt-but-i-have-no-doubt-that-no-matter-what-pantheon-it-is-it-will-be-great/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Kratos actor Christopher Judge spoke about going to Egypt for the next God of War game at a panel at MCM London Comic Con. Judge stated that travelling to this location “would be a completion of my circle”, as he is highly popular for playing Teal’c from Stargate. Judge said “but whatever is decided”, before tracking back and stating “if there is another game”, he has “no doubt that no matter what pantheon it is, it will be great.”</p>



<p>Egypt, as the next location for a God of War game, has been a topic that has surfaced online many times in the past. And it makes sense to do so as well, as Kratos has already conquered Greek and Norse pantheons, it’s time for him to face off against a new set of gods. There was also a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> earlier this year that Sony was casting Middle Eastern actors for an unknown AAA game, which could be the next God of War title set in Egypt. </p>



<p>In other news, Amazon’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-casting-call-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casting call</a> for its God of War TV series has leaked. Additionally, the long-rumored Greek God of War game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/greek-god-of-war-game-pushed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly delayed to 2026</a>. What are your thoughts on the Kratos actor wanting to go to Egypt for the next God of War?

<p>EA's internal chatbot, ReefGPT, is making life harder, not easier</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7714a909d6b5d"><a title="EA Staff Are Reportedly Less Than Happy With Their Much-Hyped AI &quot;Helpers&quot; 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7714a909d6b5d/ea-staff-are-reportedly-less-than-happy-with-their-much-hyped-ai-helpers-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: EA Sports</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0m17d8827ko">the negative press</a> and questions surrounding the <a href="https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2025/05/copyright-office-report">ethical use of training data</a>, Generative AI is making a significant impact on game development, with many of the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/3d/video-game-design/why-the-games-industrys-ai-revolution-is-its-biggest-battle-yet">industry's major players</a> now utilising the technology to help create and enhance their products.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts has made no secret of the fact that it's betting the farm on AI; <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/opinion-electronic-arts-used-to-empower-developers-now-it-looks-to-replace-them-with-ai">last year, the company talked openly about its plans to leverage the tech</a>, and, more recently, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/ea-is-diving-headfirst-into-generative-ai-with-new-partnership">it has inked a deal with Stability AI</a> to "co-develop transformative generative AI models, tools, and workflows that empower EA’s artists, designers, and developers to reimagine how games are made".</p>
<p>Not everything the AI hype machine touches is turning to gold, however. We're now seeing reports from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">Business Insider</a> (via <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/108403/report-eas-internal-ai-is-causing-issues-with-games-development/index.html">Tweak Town</a>) that EA's internal chatbot, ReefGPT, is making life more challenging for the company's beleaguered human developers.</p>
<p>Sources have told Business Insider that ReefGPT is actually <em>increasing</em> the amount of work EA's staff have to contend with, as it is responsible for creating faulty code that then needs to be manually fixed. Other sources claim that EA's AI tools are susceptible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)">hallucinations</a> (a common issue with AI agents); again, these need to be fixed by hand, which slows everything down and nullifies any time-saving benefit AI would have introduced.</p>
<p>On top of all of this is the feeling among EA staff that these AI tools are effectively going to replace them in time, which, as you can imagine, is hardly good for morale. Following the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ea-goes-private-after-usd55-billion-acquisition-by-saudi-arabias-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners">announcement</a> that EA has been acquired by the PIF (Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners for $55 billion, it's easy to see why the company's 'fleshbag' staff are less than happy right now.</p>
<p>One of the few companies out there which is resisting the use of Generative AI in its workflow is Nintendo – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/dont-worry-nintendo-likely-wont-utilise-generative-ai-in-its-game-development">at least that's what the official line was last year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several months of rumors</a> about a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved, the game that started one of Xbox's most successful franchises, Halo Studios (formerly 343 Interactive) <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> Halo: Campaign Evolved during this year's Halo World Championship event. The remake, powered by Unreal Engine 5 visuals (with the original game's code running beneath), will be released next year on PC, Xbox Series S and X, and even PlayStation 5 for the first time in the series.</p>



<p>As with all remakes, some fans immediately started dissecting the gameplay footage to see what was changed from the original. Even more interesting, though, is the point of view of one of the original developers, Jaime Griesemer, who was a designer on the first three Halo games. <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1981959132082274764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking on X</a>, he criticized some level design changes from Halo: Combat Evolved and eventually likened the remake to the dance remix of a classic song that goes straight to the chorus.</p>



<p><em>You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters. I intentionally placed rocks in the way so you had to fight them on foot. When you can just smash the crates out of the way, it wrecks the encounters. But the worst part? They put trees in the landing area of the WooHoo Jump. Lame.</em></p>



<p><em>Yes, everybody, I know you can FORCE the Warthog through the gap in a variety of ways. I literally spent most of a day making it discouraging and difficult, but not impossible. You’re welcome!</em></p>



<p><em>On further analysis, I’m sure it’s because the vehicles take damage, and so you’re just as likely to destroy the hog as get it over the rocks. If anything that makes it -worse- because -none- of the vehicle tricks are going to work anymore. It’s like the dance remix of a classic song that skips the intro and the bridge and just thumps the chorus over and over.</em></p>



<p>His perspective isn't shared by one of the co-creators of the Halo franchise, Marcus Lehto (who was recently in the news because he criticized Electronic Arts for not crediting all of his team at Ridgeline Games in Battlefield 6). Lehto was at the Halo World Championship and, <a href="https://x.com/game_fabricator/status/1982523556320948338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a>, relayed a very positive first impression:</p>



<p><em>My honest impression of seeing the new Halo: Campaign Evolved is this:</em></p>



<p><em>I absolutely love where this is going. The game looks and feels genuine. It's gorgeous in a way I wish we could have built it originally back in 2001. It warms my heart to see Halo: Combat Evolved like this.</em></p>

              <p>PC upgrades don’t have to be bulky or complicated. Those looking for a no-fuss, low-profile desktop setup for their everyday work and play sessions should consider investing in a mini PC. These blocks quite literally fit in your hand, take practically no space at all, and even travel with you.</p>
<p>Like traditional PCs, these compact options also come in a range of configurations. If you’re mainly focused on everyday use (browsing, streaming, regular office work, studies), you don’t need anything over the top.<strong> A mini PC with at least an Intel N-series processor, 8GB of RAM, and a solid-state drive (SSD) will do the job well,</strong> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5019/">which is exactly what Kamrui AK1PLUS Mini PC offers, and it’s now available for just $146 on Amazon.</a> That’s a straightforward 19% discount on this powerhouse, but this deal is only available to Prime members. Non-Prime members can get it at its retail price of $190. And since Prime members also get free delivery, you’re saving a good chunk on both the price and the shipping.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5019/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Modest Specs for Day-to-Day Use</h2>
<p>This mini PC is powered by a 12th Gen Intel N95 processor with a clock speed of up to 3.4GHz. It offers a 30% performance bump over earlier chips like the N5095 and N5105, so it’s fast enough for most day-to-day tasks. There’s 8GB of DDR4 RAM for speedy multitasking, plus a 256GB M.2 SSD that offers sufficient space to store all your important files. The memory isn’t exactly massive, so it won’t be able to handle heavy gaming or resource-intensive creative tasks, but should be enough for regular usage. And if your storage needs grow over time, you can add a second 2.5-inch SATA SSD or HDD, or upgrade the existing M.2 SSD to as much as 2TB.</p>



<p>It also supports 4K at 60Hz via Intel UHD Graphics, and lets you connect up to two monitors simultaneously with dual HDMI ports for a bigger setup. Other connectivity options include two USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, a Gigabit Ethernet port, dual-band WiFi (2.4GHz + 5GHz), and Bluetooth.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5019/">Despite all this power, the Kamrui mini PC stays fairly quiet while working, thanks to its built-in smart cooling fan.</a> It also includes a VESA mount, so you can attach it to the back of your monitor for a cleaner setup. Just be sure to get your orders in fast, since the deal might end any moment now.</p>

Asked if he agreed with the feedback that "certain sections" in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a> felt a little long, he disagreed, saying: "Regarding time management in certain sections, especially in FF7 Rebirth, I honestly don’t believe that they were longer than necessary. I feel like nowadays, players just have too much to do and too much to play; so they often feel the urge that something has to be concluded quickly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/its-not-about-cutting-content-final-fantasy-7-remake-director-explains-concise-part-3-comments/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>, Hamaguchi expanded further on this, saying: "Just to explain, the original question I was asked there was, they said that there are some people who played Rebirth, the second game in the series, and they felt that because we’ve added in new story content, which wasn’t in the original Final Fantasy 7, to them it felt like the story was being stretched out," he explained. "So they asked whether we were considering doing anything related to that in the third game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I feel that the pacing, the content, and the balance in Rebirth is exactly as I wanted it. I personally don’t feel it’s been stretched out; it doesn’t feel unnecessarily long. To me, I think I got that right, and I think a lot of people would agree with me."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hamaguchi explained that while he is looking at pacing and ensuring "that the story developments move forward in a fairly speedy manner and with the right pace essentially, rather than feeling slow and drawn out," his comment may have been "misconstrued."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think that may have been misconstrued by people; they may have said, ‘Okay, that means they’re going to cut down on the volume and they’re going to remove story content, it’s going to be a shorter game, they’re going to cut it down’, and that’s not what I’m saying at all," he added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s about making sure the pacing feels right, it’s not about cutting out content, it’s making sure that it feels right, the speed that the story progresses at feels right, and it is fairly quick and feels like you can get through it at a reasonable pace. But it has to feel right, so that’s what I mainly intended to say there."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Weirdest Things That Happened in the Original Final Fantasy 7</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">RPG fans have been on the hunt for news about the next entry in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy since its last installment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a>, launched in early 2024.

        <p>When we first opened the streets of Prague to you, we could only hope that the nights you spent there would create the memories they did. From the battles fought on the rooftops to the friendships made in the chaos, <em>Bloodhunt</em> has lived through you in countless unforgettable ways.</p><p>During these past four years, we have been thrilled to see your passion and dedication to <em>Bloodhunt</em>. Your feedback, creativity, and enthusiasm for our game has meant the world to us. However, despite you, our amazing community, the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable.</p><p>This has led us to make the difficult decision to take <em>Bloodhunt</em> offline.</p><p>The sun is now going to rise over Prague. We will be taking down the <em>Bloodhunt</em> servers on April 28, 2026, after which the game will no longer be available.</p><p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p><p>The game will remain fully playable until April 28, 2026. After this date, the servers will be taken offline, and the game will no longer be available on either PC or PlayStation 5.</p><p>As of today, token purchases have been disabled. However, the in-game store will still be open, allowing you to spend any tokens you may have until the servers go down. Once the game goes offline, any remaining tokens will not be usable.</p><p>All account and gameplay data will be deleted after closure in accordance with GDPR and/or equivalent.</p><p>This announcement does not affect your statutory rights. <em>Bloodhunt</em> and all related services are provided under the Privacy Policy and EULA available here.</p><p>If you have questions about your account, data or other inquiries please reach out to <a href="https://support.sharkmob.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharkmob Support</a>.</p><p>We encourage everyone to enjoy the time that remains in Prague and to keep playing, making the most of these final months together.</p><p>Thank you for being with us on this journey. We hope your memories from the rooftops and back alleys of Prague will stay with you as they have with us.</p><p>—The Sharkmob Team</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-to-end-service-on-april-28-2026]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Halo: Campaign Evolved vs Halo Combat Evolved Side by Side Graphics Comparison</p>
      </div>
<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved will mark the sci-fi franchise's debut on a PlayStation platform, and people have a lot of strong feelings about this. One of the original Halo developers is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">embracing the remake</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">another says it has issues</a>. The response has gone all the way to the White House, with the office posting a <a href="https://x.com/whitehouse/status/1982638578913206632?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">meme of Donald Trump as Master Chief wielding an Energy sword.</a> Trump has jokingly taken credit for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-declares-the-console-wars-officially-over-with-halo-on-ps5/1100-6535718/" data-ref-id="1100-6535718">ending the so-called "console war,"</a> with Halo now finally coming to PlayStation.</p><p>Halo: Campaign Evolved features "reborn" visuals, new prequel missions, more guns, and the ability to sprint. There is no head-to-head multiplayer support, but campaign co-op will be available. Check out the video above to get a closer look at the remake compared against the original.</p><p>Pricing for Halo: Campaign Evolved has not been announced, but it has been confirmed that the game will launch at the same time on all platforms, as opposed to coming to Xbox and PC before PS5. It will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-game-pass-titles/1100-6534406/" data-ref-id="1100-6534406">available at launch on Xbox Game Pass.</a></p><p>In addition to Halo: Campaign Evolved, Microsoft is rumored to be working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/">new live-service Halo game</a>, and it's likely to come to PS5 as well given Microsoft has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-halo-games-will-be-on-playstation-going-forward-says-microsoft/1100-6535712/" data-ref-id="1100-6535712">"Halo is on PlayStation" going forward.</a> Halo: Campaign Evolved and future Halo titles will be developed using Unreal Engine 5.</p><p>2026 marks the 25th anniversary of the Halo series, and in addition to the launch of Halo: Campaign Evolved, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-fest-2026-announced-to-celebrate-franchises-25th-anniversary/1100-6535719/" data-ref-id="1100-6535719">Microsoft is hosting the first-ever Halo Fest. </a></p>

                <p>Activision has released a new entry in its "Replacer" series of Call of Duty ads, this one featuring Terry Crews and Nikki Glaser play forensic agents who attend a crime scene because the real forensic teams is off playing Black Ops 7. Actor Peter Stormare originally brought the Replacer character to life, but a previous ad <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-black-ops-7-trailer-makes-fun-of-the-jeff-bezos-celebrity-rocket-launch/1100-6535689/" data-ref-id="1100-6535689">shot him into space with Jake Paul</a>, so Crews and Glaser are stepping in for the time being.</p><p>Things go pretty sideways in this new video, as the characters played by Crews and Glaser are obviously in way over their heads. Crews finds a severed thumb on a table and freaks out when he sees a dead body.

<p>"All claims to exclusivity are hereby dissolved. Console loyalists are instructed to cease hostilities, disband militias, and enjoy this new era of gaming," the directive from GameStop reads.</p><p>While the Halo: Campaign Evolved release isn't quite as definitive an end to console exclusivity as the GameStop post suggests, it is a major move away from exclusivity for Xbox. While the company has previously released some of its other major exclusive franchises to PlayStation, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/" data-ref-id="1100-6531314">Gears of War</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forza-horizon-5/" data-ref-id="5000-533238">Forza Horizon 5</a>, Halo has long been a flagship franchise for Xbox. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-games-will-be-on-playstation-going-forward-says-microsoft/1100-6535712/" data-ref-id="1100-6535712">Halo will be on PlayStation</a> moving forward.</p><p>Xbox exec <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-competes-more-with-tiktok-than-with-other-consoles-exec-says/1100-6535715/" data-ref-id="1100-6535715">Matt Booty explained</a> that Xbox is looking to go where the players are, even if that means releasing games on rival consoles. The strategy has been working out for Xbox so far, with its formerly exclusive franchises seeing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-sales-charts-thanks-to-ps5/2900-6605/" data-ref-id="2900-6605">great sales on the PlayStation</a>.</p>

The cause of the outage has now been identified, revealing that the massive outage was the result of a single software bug.</p><p>As initially reported while Amazon was trying to figure out the cause of the 15-hour outage, the problem originated in DynamoDB, AWS's DNS management system. As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/the-multi-billion-dollar-15-hour-aws-outage-that-brought-the-internet-to-its-knees-last-week-was-apparently-caused-by-a-single-software-bug/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, the issue originated with DNS Enactor, a component of DynamoDB that constantly updates domain lookup tables to stay on top of load balancing as conditions change.</p>

<p>The bug started when the DNS Enactor started to lag, and "experienced unusually high delays needing to retry its update on several of the DNS endpoints." The DNS Planner continued to generate new plans, and while the first Enactor was delayed, a second DNS Enactor began to implement those plans.</p><p>Once the second Enactor had implemented the new plans, it began the clean-up process, which deletes all plans older than the one it had just implemented. At the same time, the first Enactor finally caught up and overwrote the newer plan, with a check that should have prevented that from happening also failing due to the high delays. The clean-up from the second Enactor then deleted the older plan, which had become the active plan. "As this plan was deleted, all IP addresses for the regional endpoint were immediately removed," Amazon engineers explained, with the deletion of the active plan causing an "inconsistent state" that required manual intervention from an operator to eventually correct.</p><p>The cascade of bugs eventually led to a 15-hour outage, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/101925/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon reported</a>, and network intelligence company Ookla, which runs Downdetector, <a href="https://www.ookla.com/articles/aws-outage-q4-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">estimated</a> that it was one of its largest outages on record. The outage took out gaming services including Roblox, Fortnite, Pokemon Go, PlayStation Network, Rocket League, and Wordle, along with a huge number of non-gaming services and platforms.</p>

"We are all seeking to meet people where they are," he said of the decision to put Halo on its competitor platform. "Our biggest competition isn't another console. We are competing more and more with everything from TikTok to movies."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 11 Minutes Of Halo Campaign Evolved Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p>Booty explained that Microsoft hopes to bring more players into the Xbox ecosystem by bringing its flagship franchises to a new audience, adding that consumers no longer feel strong attachments to the devices they use to play their games.</p><p>Microsoft isn't the first company to consider competition from outside its own sector of the entertainment industry--back in 2019, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-says-it-competes-with-fortnite-more-than-h/1100-6464484/" data-ref-id="1100-6464484">Netflix made headlines</a> when it told investors that it competes more with Fortnite than HBO when it comes to screentime. Netflix added at the time that it had thousands of competitors when it came to entertainment options, and now Xbox is taking a similar perspective on competition. That may partially explain it testing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-with-ads-plan-for-xbox-cloud-gaming-has-been-confirmed-by-microsoft/1100-6535714/" data-ref-id="1100-6535714">free, ad-based version of Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>.</p><p>The competition between Xbox and PlayStation has long been a regular games industry talking point, albeit one where Microsoft often found itself on the back foot. With Microsoft's recent focus on its Game Pass subscription service, as well as a number of high-profile studio acquisitions, it's been theorized that the company is looking to move away from competing in the console hardware space. However, Microsoft has confirmed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">next-gen Xbox</a> is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-reconfirms-next-gen-xbox-hardware-is-in-development/1100-6535554/" data-ref-id="1100-6535554">in development</a>.</p>

                <p>There's been a lot of hype among Halo fans surrounding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-announced-for-2026-features-new-prequel-missions-and-sprint-but-no-multiplayer/1100-6535695/" data-ref-id="1100-6535695">the long-rumored remake</a> of the first game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-700149">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>.

However, Jaime Griesemer--a designer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-combat-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-2728">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> and the design lead on Halo 2 and Halo 3--isn't happy about some of the changes that were made for the remake.</p><p>In a series of posts on <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1981927318752039135" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>, Griesemer lamented the trailer's sequence where the Warthog vehicle moved past obstacles that were placed in its path to prevent plays from being able "to steamroll the Hunters." "When you can just smash the crates out of the way it wrecks the encounters," added Griesemer. "But the worst part? They put trees in the landing area of the WooHoo Jump. Lame."</p><p>Griesemer went to tag Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">who is a big fan of the remake</a>) before asking the following question: "What have they done to beloved B30?!"</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1981927318752039135" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters.

            <p>Dr. Kawashima and Nintendo were right: brain-training games can actually have a significant positive effect and reduce the effects of aging on our brain. A <a href="https://games.jmir.org/2025/1/e75161">new scientific study</a> has found that as much as a decade of aging may be offset by our efforts playing them, which is good news if you spent a very long time playing Brain Training.</p>
<p>The key finding was that doing rigorous mental exercises for 30 minutes a day boosts the chemical messenger acetylcholine, which not only carries messages across the brain but improves learning, memory and attention functions. Acetylcholine levels typically deplete with age.</p>

<p>The study monitored 95 people over the age of 65 years for 10 weeks and found a 2.3 percent rise in acetylcholine after doing brain training exercises for 30 minutes a day. As <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/22/nx-s1-5581409/mental-exercise-reverse-brain-change-aging-acetylcholine?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_source=bsky.app">NPR</a> noted in an article about the report, 2.3 percent doesn't sound enormous, but when you consider there's usually a decrease of 2.5 percent <em>per decade</em> due to aging, it reframes the discovery. Brain-training games may offset as much as a decade of degradation caused by aging.</p><p>There's an important distinction to make, though. In order to achieve the desired result, you need to play games that are specifically designed to exercise these parts of your brain, such as Nintendo's Brain Training once was. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a> and solitaire won't do it; they were what half of the participants played during the test and their acetylcholine levels didn't change.</p>
<p>Dr Ryuta Kawashima was the neuroscientist Nintendo's games were developed in collaboration with, and brain age (as the game was titled in Japan) and dementia prevention are specific areas of expertise of his. In other words: this is exactly the sort of thing he was trying to achieve with his Nintendo games.</p>
<p>The Brain Training games first appeared here in 2006. They were made up of many mind-stretching games based around maths, memory recall, and many other things, and you'd play them every day and the game would give a score based on your performance. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-brainage-ds">We gave the original Brain Training 9/10 in our review</a>, and the series would go on to have numerous sequels and even a Switch version released in 2020.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It used to be something of a marvel to see fully fledged PC and console games being ported across to Nintendo’s consoles, whether we look as far back as the Wii, or consider the number of “impossible” ports to the original Nintendo Switch. With the dawn of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, though, these kinds of ports are almost expected. Given that the earlier Two Point titles made the jump to the original Switch, how does <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> fare on the newer console?</p>

<p>Two Point Museum is another charming take on the management sim, filled with irreverent humour and bucket loads of puns to bring a wry smile to your face. At its core you’re still doing similar tasks to Two Point Hospital, creating rooms and a flow for patrons to follow, managing your staff, and just trying to make as much money as possible, but there’s a very different theme to Two Point Museum and a much more obviously creative endeavour behind constructing your museum.</p>


<p>But before you can place attractions in your museum and build and theme exhibits around them, you first need to acquire them, sending your experts out to various locations to dig up new and unusual fossils, to catch different rare fish, to… hunt ghosts and haunted mannequins? These aren’t your standard history museums, that’s for sure!</p>


<p>With this Switch 2 version arriving almost eight months after the original release, there’s already been a bunch of updates and DLC that are thankfully represented in this port. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/08/two-point-museum-fantasy-finds-review/">Fantasy Finds DLC</a> is available separately, but there’s also the Digiverse collaborations with smaller and indie games like Dredge and Vampire Survivors which are already in this game. We still want to see DLC that adds more levels and locations to build in, and we’ll always dream about added features like multiple floors, but this is in lockstep with the game on other platforms.</p>
<p>But the most important factor is how the game plays, and for me, this Switch 2 release is a very enjoyable rendition of this game… with some caveats. The game fundamentally looks great, the chunky art style helping to minimise the impact of lower texture detail and reduced floor reflections and other effects, and it’s being rendered at a high enough resolution that it looks nice and smooth on the Switch 2’s screen when playing handheld, and even on larger screens. That’s pretty great, but the caveat is that the frame rate can and does suffer as your museum grows.</p>

<p>Even by the time you’ve reached the end of the first museum’s first mission, you start to feel the CPU limitations of the Switch 2. There’s some noticeable little stutters and hitches as you load into object picking menus and snap to a room to modify, but more fundamentally, it’s just the game needing to simulate a couple hundred guests and staff as they amble around your museums, and while viewing from a stationary camera is fine, you start to feel the stutter when panning around. It’s dependent on the simulation speed, so pausing the action makes camera movement nice and smooth again, with frame rate struggles getting a little worse as you speed things up.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting here that the Switch 2 version deliberately keeps the guest count in check. It defaults to a 200 guest limit (which can easily be stuffed into a basic museum space) with an option to bump that up to 300, but the PC game defaults to 400 guests with a range from 200 to having no limit at all.</p>

<p>And to me, I think that’s totally fine. This isn’t a genre where you need twitch reactions, and regardless of the frame rate, I’m someone that makes many building and room modifications while the simulation is paused. Maybe at the start as I’m slapping down a quick room blueprint in a basically empty space, but as soon as I’m having to overhaul an active area, and when guest satisfaction is an evolving metric, it’s best to do this when paused.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the game does feel a little bit glitchier on Switch 2 than I remember from playing on PC. We’ve had a couple of game crashes on this console and a soft lock that needed us to restart, and that can be a tad inconvenient depending on when the last autosave was. There were also some weird problems, like one of the Bandage Box healing chairs just repeatedly catching fire five or six times in just a matter of minutes, we’ve got a ghost stuck outside of their room that nobody cares about, some visual effects like fire and smoke are just rendering as grey squares, and there’s some missing tooltips that make getting around the menus a bit confusing at times. Most of the issues we found are highlighted for a post release patch, but it’s a shame they’re here on day one.</p>

<p>I do also think that playing with a gamepad feels a bit clunky at times. They’re generally OK to understand and there’s plenty of tooltips, but the way that buttons are context sensitive as you get into a room’s menu always has me pausing to think about what button I need to press.</p>
<p>That’s not a problem on PC, of course, when you’re clicking around the UI with a mouse. Hey, wait a minute, the Switch 2 has that mouse mode, doesn’t it? Sadly, Two Point Museum doesn’t have Joy-Con mouse mode support at launch, and while the team have said they’re looking into it, they’re rather non-committal about the possibility.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-two-point-museum-switch-2-probably-the-best-game-in-the-series-but-no-mouse-mode.1335682/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>Universities and hospitals: they’re well-known money spinners (assuming you ignore socialised healthcare) and make perfect sense for a management sim. What doesn’t strike me as such a lucrative institution is a museum. I went to a lot of them as a child specifically because it was a cheap day out, and as I rocket closer towards middle age, I finally appreciate my parents’ mentality.</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s not the theme I expected from the third Two Point game before it was announced, and my initial reaction was one more of confusion and minor pessimism than anything else, partly for the reasons previously mentioned. More fool me, though, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> may well be the most balanced and well-rounded of the lot.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159799/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You’re the curator of a museum, or rather several museums, and it’s your job to pull in the punters, make the staff do their job, and secure new exhibits to make it all worth everyone’s while. You’ll not be making it an affordable day out, either; your museums are a <em>business</em> first and foremost, and that means staff can take one short break every month or so, and keyrings from the gift shop will cost patrons 50 quid a pop.</p>
<p>So far, so similar to previous entries, but one of the big changes this time around is exhibits and, more specifically, how to get them. You’ll have to send your staff through a helicopter-shaped rabbit hole where they set off to explore wherever it is you’ve told them to go, in the hope that they’ll not return dead (or worse, with a poor-quality exhibit).</p>
<p>Despite never really seeing where your staff members go on these expeditions, Two Point Museum still manages to instil a sense of exploration, all whilst safely hovering aloft your roofless enterprise.</p>
<p>This goes doubly so when staff encounter a random dilemma during such a trip, where a situation demands your expert decision-making. They might find what appears to be an oasis in the desert, and you have to decide if they should pursue it or stay on course.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159792/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As this is a Two Point game, your natural reaction and sensible thinking have to go out the window in these instances. That oasis? Actually a spa with a full staff wondering why they get so few customers. I’ll be honest, even though the game makes a foreboding sound whenever a dilemma occurs, I was absolutely thrilled each and every time, because it’s genuinely impossible to know what the outcome might be the first time around. Two Point Museum operates on a twisted, almost uncanny logic that continually delights and surprises.</p>
<p>The type of museum you run makes a substantial difference as well. The game will bounce you around the different museums available to you in order to progress, and each (initially) plays very differently from one another.</p>
<p>Depending on what you’re trying to discover, you’ll have to send your staff out to dig up dinosaur bones, catch fish to put in the aquariums you probably should have already built, dive deep into the bowels of an old technology centre, or, you know, dip into the netherworld to extract ghosts for children to gawk at. You can even take your helicopter into space. Amazing.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159790/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some exhibits you can simply plonk down, others require you to find their constituent parts, some need to be put in their own special rooms (think fish and ghosts), and some need to be kept in a specific level of humidity, temperature, or both.</p>
<p>Did I mention plants? I don’t think I did. These aren’t your garden variety botanicals, though; the plants people want to see are man-eaters, although in fairness the guests they eat don’t seem to die, only come out…changed. Some guests even demand this as their idea of a perfect museum visit. Why not dive headfirst into a gaping, vegetative maw so you can seemingly have your genetics altered to look like a clown? That’s a Batman story we haven’t yet seen.</p>
<p>And it’s important to keep guests happy, as not only will they pay a frankly staggering amount to gain entry, but also will freely dump sometimes hundreds into your appropriately-positioned donation stands. How much they donate is based on an exhibit’s ‘buzz’, how much detail your information stands divulge (which can be increased by destroying and analysing an exhibit in a special room), how entertained they are, and several other factors besides.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159798/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And you’ll need to satisfy those, as donations make up a substantial part of your income. Entry tickets are a one-time thing, but donations can just keep coming and coming, and it’s never dissatisfying to see your stands bursting with golden coins to collect.</p>
<p>If all this seems a bit hard to get a grip on, then that’s reassuring, because the game is absolutely <em>rammed</em> with mechanics and twists on the basics. It eases you in, though, which is absolutely necessary, even if it can feel a touch basic at first. New mechanics and themes are drip-fed to you as you progress, meaning you don't get a chance to get bored doing the same thing time and time again.</p>
<p>It’s a meaty game too, easily demanding upwards of 50 hours for the base game, and the Fantasy Finds DLC will no doubt take that further still. Although it will be available on Switch 2, it sadly wasn’t live during our time pre-release. Further expanding what’s on offer is the Digiverse map of expeditions, which was released recently on other platforms as well. This map expands the exhibits you can acquire to include those from other games (currently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dredge">Dredge</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>), with the promise of more to come.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159791/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Tantalising stuff! And that’s not just my opinion, either. Bands of thieves and vandals, some of whom are from competing museums, are desperate to come in and either damage your hard-won treasures or take them for themselves. This is one of the trickier mechanics to master at first, as suddenly your security guards have more to do than empty the giant buckets of cash your guests have filled up.</p>
<p>Two Point Museum is a game that just keeps on giving. Every time you think you’ve got all the mechanics under your belt, the game tosses you another, like portals opening up and letting malevolent spirits in to harass your guests, or whoops! Now you have to tackle marketing campaigns!</p>
<p>The customisation is similarly excellent. You can freely build and modify not only each room in a museum, but each and every building as well (with one or two exceptions, of course). The floors, walls, partitions, dividers, and even the colour of individual decorations, it’s all up to you how it looks. Does it make a difference to how the game plays? Not even slightly, but I still caught myself spending cumulative hours fiddling around with floor tiles and decorative items’ positioning.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159794/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And to top it all off, Two Point Museum continues the trend of an excellent soundtrack interspersed with properly chuckle-worthy chatter from its resident DJs, wonderfully clear and vibrant visuals, and really fantastically executed controls for the genre.</p>
<p>One thing is notably missing on Switch 2, though, and that’s mouse mode. It seems like an obvious inclusion, but sadly it’s not included here at launch. We did speak to the developers recently, who confirmed that they are considering it, but right now it’s controller or nothing.</p>
<p>Visually, it’s a big step up over Switch 1’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/two_point_campus">Campus</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/two_point_hospital">Hospital</a>, although the game is capped at 30fps. It’s a very smooth 30fps in the early stages of each museum, but unfortunately it does struggle a bit as things get more hectic, and it seems to be the same in both docked and handheld for the most part. It’s not a dealbreaker per se, but given the leap to much more powerful hardware, I was hoping that it might be a little more consistent than it is, given that the game runs far better on other systems like the Steam Deck and Xbox Series S.</p>
<figure><a title="Two Point Museum Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159793/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It just feels like there’s performance that’s been left on the table in its current state. I also experienced a few graphical anomalies, such as dust clouds being made entirely out of 2D squares, and one particular sandy floor texture going absolutely bananas and flashing terribly unless the camera was stock still.</p>
<p>I have faith that these little issues can be ironed out in updates — and a little more optimisation to get some more stability wouldn’t go amiss either — even if they don’t do anything to spoil the game.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Two Point Museum might be the best Two Point game to date. It’s smart, funny, good-looking, and packs in more mechanics than you can shake a stick at, all without feeling overwhelming or too much to handle.</p>
<p>It’s got some performance-based blemishes on Switch 2, and the lack of a mouse mode at launch feels like an obvious omission. Still, the final package is an incredibly entertaining one that fans of management sims would be mad to skip.</p></section>

			<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved, the remake of the first entry in the Halo series announced last week <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-development-virtuos/">after months of rumors and speculation</a>, is set to introduce significant visual improvements over both the original and the Combat Evolved Anniversary remaster, judging from some early comparison videos shared online.</p>



<p>Following the game's announcement at this year's Halo WCC, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a> shared two comparison videos on YouTube, comparing the current available footage of the remake with a recreation of similar sequences in the original and the Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary remaster. Needless to say, the differences are massive between the modern remake and the other two versions of the game, offering an unprecedented level of fidelity that will make the iconic first entry in the series shine.</p>



<p>On the other hand, it's clear how, in terms of ambiance and atmosphere, Halo: Campaign Evolved won't try to mimic the original and will instead offer a different take. In this case, which will be better will be up to player's preference.</p>

<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved will <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">feature more than the updated visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5 </a>showcased in the comparison videos above. The remake of the first entry in the Halo series will also come with three new bonus missions set before the events of the campaign, four-player co-op, some gameplay tweaks, including the introduction of sprinting, and more. As the name implies, however, the multiplayer mode of the original Halo won't be remade.</p>



<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved will also mark the series' debut on PlayStation consoles, further compounding Xbox's current multiplatform strategy, which saw the launch of former exclusives on other platforms. The remake will also launch on Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2026.</p>

            <p>Ideal podcast game and source of all my lorry knowledge <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2%3EEuro%20Truck%20Simulator">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> is expanding its map to Ireland in the future, devs SCS Software have revealed. The DLC, dubbed Isle of Ireland, will include both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as fresh trucking locales.</p>
<p>It's another entry in the list of add-ons in the works for Euro Truck Sim 2, which also includes a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/euro-truck-simulator-2-is-pining-for-the-fjords-with-a-nordic-expansion">Nordic map expansion</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-years-after-teasing-buses-were-coming-to-euro-truck-simulator-2-they-finally-arrive">coaches</a>, and a number of reworks to existing areas. The latter includes a <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/10/project-uk-rework.html">UK revamp</a> announced just the other week, which should ensure that driving from Birmingham to Belfast shouldn't resemble a voyage from 2013 to 5.</p>

<p>"Drivers will be able to tackle narrow routes lined with stone walls and hedgerows, travel on untamed coastal stretches battered by the Atlantic winds, and roll through small villages and towns steeped in charm and tradition," SCS wrote in their Ireland expansion <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/10/introducing-isle-of-ireland.html">annoucement post</a>. "From the energetic streets of Dublin and Belfast to the peaceful rhythm of the countryside, making a delivery without pausing to admire the view will be a challenge in itself!"</p><p>In terms of landmarks to admire in between cargo hauls, expect the likes of the Rock of Cashel, Ben Bulben, Belfast’s Samson and Goliath cranes, and the Giant’s Causeway. "Haul through farmland, cross windswept landscapes where folklore feels close at hand, and navigate into vibrant city centres where modern life and centuries of history stand side by side," the devs say. "Ferry ports such as Rosslare will also play an important role, opening the way to connections across the Irish Sea and beyond."</p>
<p>As is usually the case with Truck Sim expansions, there's no release date for Isle of Ireland yet. "Everything shown so far is still very much a work in progress" according to SCS. Given the Nordic Horizons expansion sounded like it was being loosely aimed at 2026 in its 2024 reveal, maybe we'll be headed to Ireland in 2027.</p>
<p>Until then, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3851260/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2__Isle_of_Ireland/">wishlist it on Steam</a> and stare wistfully at the screenshots. Maybe scroll from Malin Head to Mizen Head on Google Maps to help limit any ire the wait engenders in you.</p>

              <p><span>The news that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911"><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>is coming to PlayStation 5</span></a><span> next year sounds like fan fiction to anyone who grew up in the heated console wars of yesteryear. Oh, there are definitely people still fighting this made-up war and extended marketing campaign, but as console exclusivity increasingly becomes a thing of the past and systems do mostly the same things as one another, anyone with a lick of sense knows that there’s nothing to even fight about anymore. </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>, Xbox’s longest-running franchise, was one of the last big names to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><span>make the jump to PlayStation</span></a><span>, and now that it has, people are finally catching up to the rest of us in realizing that the war is over. That includes Funko Pop store GameStop, and…</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/trump-autism-tylenol-press-conference-reaction-jokes-2000627950"><span>the Trump Administration</span></a><span>?</span></p> <p><span>GameStop started with a mock-up of a statement declaring the console wars over. Sure, that’s the kind of thing a company makes for social media when trying to capitalize on something in the news. The store notes that now that the </span><i><span>Halo: Campaign Evolved </span></i><span>remake is coming to PlayStation 5, there’s nothing to fight about anymore, so you can take your Sony Ponies back to the stable and power down your Xbots.&nbsp;</span></p>

The official White House account quote-tweeted the post with an AI image of Trump saluting while dressed in </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>protagonist Master Chief’s Spartan armor and holding an Energy Sword, all in front of the White House, which notably doesn’t show where the</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/26/politics/white-house-east-wing-history"><span> newly demolished East Wing would be</span></a><span>. Have AI-generation models been fed information about the president’s ongoing personal project of putting a ballroom where something else once was? Will they generate images of the White House as it stands now by default? Or did whoever put this prompt in say specifically to block the view? The bigger question is what happened to the other 10 states no longer represented on the American flag, which only has 40 stars on it?</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[This 2025 HP Laptop Is Practically Free After Amazon’s Huge 73% Limited-Time Discount, $200 Worth of Accessories Included]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-2025-hp-laptop-is-practically-free-after-amazons-huge-73-limited-time-discount-200-worth-of-accessories-included-2000639087</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-2025-hp-laptop-is-practically-free-after-amazon%E2%80%99s-huge-73-limited-time-discount-200-worth-of-accessories-included.1335667/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When a fully loaded brand-new HP laptop falls into Chromebook pricing territory, chances are it’s a deal you’re going to want to jump on. But you don’t have long to grab this one at Amazon, because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5018/">this Intel-powered laptop that normally sells for $1,300 is only going to be marked down to just $351 for a limited time</a>.</p>
<p>Take a look at how many full-PC laptop features you get for a Chromebook price: An Intel N150 processor and graphics, 14-inch HD display, 720p Wide Vision HD webcam with dual-array integrated digital microphones, 128GB of SSD storage and a 256GB Micro SD card for more, and a Wi-Fi 6 connection for fast internet. Maybe not&nbsp;<em>quite</em> a $1,300 laptop if we’re being fair, but absolutely a great deal for $351.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5018/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All the Ports You Need</h2>
<p>On top of the 256GB Micro SD card that comes free as part of the accessories bundle, this HP laptop has all of the expansion options you need. That multi-format SD card reader may come with a 256GB card, but you can use it for any sized card you want for reliable file storage. There’s a USB-C port, two USB-A ports, and an HDMI port for external monitors or other connections. The Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth connections give you all the wireless options you need.</p>
<p>Also included in the $199 accessories bundle is Windows 11 Professional (preinstalled), a 128GB USB thumb drive, wireless mouse, cleaning kit, and a 7-port USB hub with both USB-A and USB-C cords for even further expansion possibilities. With the 15th Gen Intel N150 processor able to cook up to 3.6GHz in maximum speed, you don’t have to be shy about using as many of those ports as you want at the same time.</p>



<h2>Made to Go</h2>
<p>A lower price tag usually suggests a larger, heavier laptop, but that’s not the case with this 14-inch HP model. This one’s only 0.71 inches thick with the lid closed, and a very economical 12.76 inches by 8.86 inches in size. The overall weight clocks in at just 3.24 pounds, so it’s tailor made to easily slide in and out of your backpack. The 7.5-hour battery life just adds to the remote work appeal.</p>
<p>There are other laptops out there in the $350 price neighborhood, and definitely more than a few Chromebooks, but this 14-inch HP laptop and all of its built-in features stand out as being a lot of laptop for the price. Add in the free additions of Windows 11 Pro with Copilot and the rest of the $199 accessories bundle, and you’ve got a deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5018/">But it’s only here for a limited time, so head to Amazon now before this $351 HP laptop offer vanishes.</a></p>

                <p>Almost a week after high-profile Twitch streamer Emiru was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/streamer-emiru-disputes-twitchs-account-of-assault-response-at-twitchcon/1100-6535557/" data-ref-id="1100-6535557">assaulted during a TwitchCon meet-and-greet</a>, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has posted a statement apologizing to the streamer and acknowledging the multiple failures that allowed the incident to happen.</p><p>While Twitch posted a statement about the assault shortly after it happened, the company's version of events was strongly disputed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/streamer-emiru-disputes-twitchs-account-of-assault-response-at-twitchcon/1100-6535557/" data-ref-id="1100-6535557">Emiru's own statement about the incident</a>. Clancy has also been called out for his comments on the assault during an <a href="https://x.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979703220705673602" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a> with Taylor Lorenz, where he seemed to put the onus back on creators to "control [their] community."</p><p>Clancy has now posted a personal statement on the <a href="https://x.com/Twitch/status/1981825064904667169" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitch X account</a>, apologizing directly to Emiru and taking responsibility for the incident. "It shouldn’t have happened and we take that very seriously," Clancy said in the statement. "We failed, both in allowing it to occur, and in our response following. We mismanaged our communications about the incident, and that includes the comments I made. I apologize to Emiru for all that took place."</p><p>The statement continues to outline the next steps Twitch will be taking, including a "complete analysis" of the incident involving Emiru, as well as other issues that have been brought up in the wake of TwitchCon 2025. The other issues mentioned in the post include handling of IRL streaming at TwitchCon, as well as issues around accessibility at the event.</p><p>"You put a lot of trust in us by attending TwitchCon, and we take our responsibility to keep you safe seriously," the statement concludes. Reactions to the post have been mixed, with some commenters pointing out that Twitch has made similar promises around improving security at TwitchCon in the past. The post was also sent out late on a Friday afternoon, a notoriously <a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/friday-news-dump/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">strategic timeslot</a> for companies sharing bad news they want to move on from quickly.</p><p>Emiru has said that she will not be attending TwitchCon again in the future and has strongly urged other creators to reconsider their attendance.</p>

Now, Microsoft and Halo Studios have confirmed that all Halo games going forward will be on PlayStation as well as Xbox consoles and PC.</p><p>Following the official announcement of Campaign Evolved, Halo Studios community director Brian Jarrard <a href="https://youtu.be/OrvqXfY_7tU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">appeared on stage</a> at the Halo World Championships and wore a PlayStation T-shirt while sharing the news about the franchise's multi-platform future.</p><p>"It's a huge deal," said Jarrard. "It's a long time coming. We're just super excited to be able to welcome even more players now into the franchise we love, to fall in love with Halo the same way we all did 24 years ago. As a community guy, I know the Halo community is super excited to welcome in their friends as well. It's just going to mean more Halo for everyone. It's really a new era. Halo is on PlayStation going forward, starting with Halo: Campaign Evolved."</p><p>This shift isn't surprising given Xbox president Sarah Bond recently suggested that the concept of exclusive games "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exclusive-games-are-antiquated-xbox-president-says/1100-6535625/" data-ref-id="1100-6535625">is antiquated for most people</a>." The number of Xbox games making the leap to PlayStation has greatly increased over the last two years, including another signature Xbox franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-launch-times-revealed-for-franchises-debut-on-ps5/1100-6534232/" data-ref-id="1100-6534232">Gears of War</a>. There have even been times this year when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/" data-ref-id="2900-6827">Xbox games dominated the best-selling titles</a> on PlayStation's US sales charts.</p><p>Microsoft didn't announce the rumored <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/">live-service Halo game</a> during the Halo World Championships, but the company has previously said that there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/">multiple new Halo games in the works</a>. The 25th anniversary of the franchise is next year, and Halo: Campaign Evolved will launch in 2026 on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

			<p>Stray, the cat adventure game developed by BlueTwelve and published by Annapurna Interactive, will reportedly headline the PlayStation Plus Essential games lineup for November 2025.</p>



<p>Earlier today, known leaker billbil-kun, who <span>has proven extremely reliable regarding PlayStation Plus game lineup leaks in the past, revealed in a new report posted on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-on-connait-le-titre-phare-des-jeux-mensuels-de-novembre-2025-60690" target="_blank">Dealabs</a>&nbsp;that the game that made headlines when it was launched in July 2022 for being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8mOAV0KJLE">widely appreciated by cats as much as by their owners </a>will be available to all PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium subscribers</span> starting from November 4.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Stray's joining the PlayStation Plus library next month would be its return to the service rather than its debut. At launch, the game was made available as part of the PlayStation Plus Extra library and was available to subscribers for around one year. The game's departure from the PlayStation subscription service <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/stray-xbox-release-date/">coincided with the end of its one-year console exclusivity.</a></p>



<p>Although Stray's addition to the PlayStation Plus subscription service may be disappointing for some users, especially after<a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-ps-plus-essential-october-the-last-of-us-part-2/"> this month's addition of the excellent Alan Wake 2</a>, there could still be some surprises waiting in the wings. Two more titles will be part of November's lineup, which is expected to be revealed in full later this week, on October 29.</p>



<p>For those who never had the chance to try out the game before, however, Stray will be an excellent addition to the PlayStation Plus library, as the game features some great visuals, a richly-realized world, fun platforming, and more. You can learn more about it by checking out <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/stray-genre-curious-cat/">Nathan Birch's review of the PlayStation 5 version.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-airpods-pro-2-aren%E2%80%99t-the-new-kid-on-the-block-anymore-so-they%E2%80%99re-priced-to-move-to-almost-nothing.1335634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Until just a few short weeks ago, the AirPods Pro 2 were Apple’s end-all, be-all wireless earbuds, with thousands of glowing reviews and millions of units sold. Now that the AirPods Pro 3 are officially on the market, the Pro 2 earbuds might have just morphed into something even better — a terrific buying opportunity, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">if this Amazon deal taking 32% off their price is any indication.</a></p>
<p>It’s not like the quality of the AirPods Pro 2 have taken a sudden turn for the worse. They still have the H2 chip at their core to create incredibly efficient noise cancellation, spatial audio with head motion detection, and the world’s first hearing test and FDA-cleared hearing aid features in consumer wireless earbuds. The only thing that’s changed in the couple of months since they were supplanted at the top of the Apple food chain is the price, which just got a lot more friendly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Breakthrough Tech</h2>
<p>The H2 chip was a massive game-changer not just for the AirPods, but for the entire wireless earbud market. It literally doubled the noise cancellation power of the original AirPods Pro, and did so by increasing the number of times it analyzed external sounds to an incredible 48,000 per second. With that kind of noise-cancelling power, you can completely tune out the outside world and enjoy you playlists, podcasts, and audio books — a true luxury when you’re on a long flight or stuck in a crowded environment.</p>
<p>It’s also easy to let enough of the world back in to keep yourself aware of your surroundings by switching the AirPods Pro 2 into adaptive transparency mode, which is a wise personal-safety suggestion when you’re a pedestrian in a heavily trafficked area, or on a run or walk while alone.</p>



<h2>The Perfect Fit</h2>
<p>Another innovative feature of the AirPods Pro 2 is the fit test, accessible in the Bluetooth settings of your iPhone or iPad. By playing different tones to determine the quality of the seal between your ear and the AirPods, you discover which of the four different sizes of silicon tips is the right one for you to enjoy your AirPods Pro 2 to the fullest.</p>
<p>One area where the fit of the AirPods Pro 2 just dramatically improved is your budget, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">thanks to this 32% off Amazon deal that makes the AirPods Pro 2 a truly outstanding buy at just $170.</a> Perhaps we should be thanking the AirPods Pro 3 for dropping in time to make their legendary predecessors one of the better pre-Black Friday tech deals that we’ve seen.</p>
