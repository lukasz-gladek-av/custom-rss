			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-reaches-50-million-global-downloads-hoyoverses-latest-success/">Zenless Zone Zero </a>has only been available for a public audience for several days, but the players love it. The game was released with various characters you could unlock and try and pull using standard banners. Since its release, miHoYo has announced the newest character, Seth Lowell, to join the roster and the first to join the game.</p>
<p>Seth is a brand new character who joins the squad of playable characters in Zenless Zone Zero. He is an adorable cat cop in the Criminal Investigation Special Response Team. As of yet, we don't know his capabilities or his role in the game.</p>
<p>The official social media accounts for Zenless Zone Zero began posting pictures of this white-haired cat boy and attaching some quotes that he uses within the game. <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/news/124698" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Lowell</a> is being voiced by the highly talented Nazeeh Tarsha, who has voice-acted in games such as Genshin Impact, Street Fighter 6, and many more.</p>
<p>Seth Lowell is the second playable character from the Criminal Investigation Special Response Team to be available in the game. Zhu Yuan is the first playable character from that faction. We also already know we will get a third character from this faction named Qingyi.</p>
<p>While not much is known about either character's arrival in Zenless Zone Zero, it is heavily hinted that Seth Lowell has big connections to New Eridu, especially as he says to contact New Eridu's Public Security, the section he works in.</p>
<p>We are currently unsure of what weaponry Seth Lowell will be equipped with and what elemental attribute he'll be carrying. Based solely on the quotes that have been released, he may be a melee fighter who uses fists or fist weapons.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there is currently no set release date or time for Seth or Qingyi's release. There is also no information on their rarity, but we expect that miHoYo will begin drip-feed details over the coming days before their release. Once both Seth and Qinyi are released, there will be three playable characters from the Criminal Investigation Special Response Team faction, compared to the stark Obol faction, which only has one playable character.</p>
<p>Will you be rolling for Seth or Qinyi?</p>

While all of the above has told us which of Blizzard’s heroes would be donning looks based on Hasbro’s robots in disguise, we hadn’t seen the skins in-game yet. Now Blizzard has released some in-game screenshots of each of the skins, as well as concept art for the Ramattra and Reinhardt skins that will be available in the <em>Overwatch 2 </em>store today.</p><p>Blizzard artist Bobby Kim talked about how the team integrated the mechanical elements that make <em>Transformers</em>’ visual identity distinct while also preserving <em>Overwatch 2</em> heroes’ silhouettes that have become recognizable over the years. Reinhardt’s skin, for instance, resembles Autobot leader Optimus Prime, complete with the iconic red truck-like torso.</p><p>“When developing the skin, I tried to integrate the sturdy, truck-like design that Optimus Prime is known for, such as the front windshield and the exhaust on the skin’s shoulders, to make him look more like a speeding truck when he charges,” Kim said in a Q&amp;A press release. “I also tried using sharper, angular parts throughout the skin, which I think captured the iconic look of Optimus Prime.”</p><p>Ramattra, meanwhile, has a skin based on Megatron, the antagonist of the <em>Transformers</em> franchise. The tie-in comic Blizzard released showed Ramattra and Megatron joining forces, claiming they both wanted peace for the Omnics, the oppressed synthetics of the <em>Overwatch </em>universe. While I’m not thrilled with Blizzard doing an actual in-universe crossover while its own story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720">is once again on ice</a></span>, I can see how Ramattra, a radical fighting for Omnic freedom, finds Megatron’s offer tantalizing.</p><p>Bastion and Illari round out the <em>Transformers </em>skins as Bumblebee and Arcee. Each skin will be available in the <em>Overwatch 2 </em>store alongside unlockable <em>Transformers</em>-themed player icons, name cards, and titles. Click through to see the skins in action.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a0387c0cfe4919c92bd954c7f452316d" data-recommend-id="image://a0387c0cfe4919c92bd954c7f452316d" data-format="jpg"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-last-of-us-season-2-set-leaks/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>New images from the production of the second season of The Last of Us have emerged online, showcasing Ellie (Bellay Ramsay) and Dina (Isabela Merced) walking around the post-apocalyptic setting, tooled up and ready for action. There are clear indicators to The Last of Us Part II, with Ellie sporting her iconic tattoo, and both characters wielding the same weapons carried by their digital counterparts in the game.</p>

<h2 id="h-developing">Developing</h2>



<p>The images released online recently show Ellie and Dina exploring the post-apocalyptic wastes in the second season of the award-winning show, which is set to drop in 2025. Some fans have criticised various elements of the images, from the length of Bella Ramsay’s hair to the cleanliness of the clothes that the young actors are wearing:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Eagle-eyed fans also took a few shots of sets around Vancouver, revealing a few details – including a group of actors portraying Seraphites (‘Scars’) from the second game, which was released in 2020. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Four new shots on-location from season two of The Last of Us in Vancouver. Three photos are of a street in Chinatown and the other includes actors playing seraphites/scars + crew relaxing during non-filming under a wall with the words “feel her love”.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheLastofUs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheLastofUs</a>… <a href="https://t.co/sVxlHt6yry">pic.twitter.com/sVxlHt6yry</a></p>— Naughty Dog World (@NaughtyDogWorld) <a href="https://twitter.com/NaughtyDogWorld/status/1810577756721205525?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>The storyline for the second season hasn’t been confirmed yet, but there are expectations that it’ll deviate a little from what was shown during the 2020 game. It’s widely believed that The Last of Us Part II will unfold over two seasons, with the next batch of episodes laying the groundwork for the road ahead. Given recent casting choices, we know that we’ll get as far as to see Abby and Ellie clash, but to what extent, nobody knows.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-wants-to-be-your-dream-open-galaxy-ign-first<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>“I think, in general, making games is really tough. Making open-world games is really, really tough. And making Star Wars open-world games is the next level of difficulty.”</p><p>Julian Gerighty, creative director at Massive Entertainment, is up for a challenge. For the first time ever, we’re getting a fully open-world Star Wars video game. It’s been a long time coming, but after back-to-back successes with both The Division and The Division 2, Gerighty was in the mood to take a risk.</p><p>“I think this is maybe just my approach, but even if it's scary, you've got to do it,” he says. “You've got to lean into it. What's the downside to pitching a Star Wars game in San Francisco at LucasFilm Games in George Lucas' old office? [...] If it doesn't work, it doesn't work, but you still have that experience.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/toshara-shipwreckvista-concept-1720441006689.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Concept art of Kay Vess and her companion Nix looking out at a High Republic shipwreck. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Fast forward several years after that meeting and Massive Entertainment is less than two months away from releasing Star Wars Outlaws, a fully realised version of the original pitch described in that office: an open world of dual ambitions – maintain the cinematic legacy of the films, and create immersive scoundrel gameplay that grants you the freedom of the galaxy.</p><p>“I think it's taken this long to get an open-world Star Wars game because of how, excuse the pun, massive it is to build a game like this. There are only so many studios in the world who build games of this scale,” says Steve Blank, director of franchise content and strategy at Lucasfilm. “The door is then open for Massive to come to us and say, this is what we're interested in doing, this is the type of game design and gameplay we want. This is what we're thinking about in terms of an archetype.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are only so many studios in the world who build games of this scale.</p></div><p>“It's the outlaw player fantasy and it's open world, those were the two main pillars that we pitched,” explains Gerighty. “Why open world? Because the outlaw fantasy really needs that to live and breathe.”</p><p>“It's a combination of our DNA as a studio, our background, when we think, ‘Okay, what do we have a lot of experience doing? What do we think we're good at?’ And this fantasy, this scoundrel in Star Wars begs for freedom,” adds game director Mathias Karlson.</p><p>Massive was fully confident in its abilities to create engaging open worlds – The Division offered a bullet-filled action playground, while last year’s Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora displayed an ability to work well within a Disney license by building a near-unmatched visual paradise. But Star Wars was the new challenge that this team yearned for. Of course, locking down what kind of experience would live inside a Star Wars open world was the first thing that had to be decided.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“We took a step back of course and thought, ‘Okay, Star Wars open world. What an opportunity. What does that naturally want to be?’” Karlson says. “It wants to be the full scale, from the very small to the very big, meaning sitting inside a cantina, playing Sabacc, being able to walk through the street, jump on your speeder or drive across the planet surface, literally park your bike in your own ship, take off into space seamlessly, and explore that region.”</p><p>That vision of “full scale” helped secure a green light from Star Wars’ custodians. But getting LucasFilm’s blessing was just the key in the ignition. Translating the cinematic spectacle of the original Star Wars movie trilogy into an open-world game – set between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, two of the most iconic films of all-time – was the actual challenge. One that Massive set out to address in every aspect of Outlaws, from the way it looks and sounds, to the type of action-adventure gameplay it supplies. </p><h2>Making an Open World Cinematic</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/sarlaccpit-1720441163877.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kay and Nix venturing into a Sarlacc Pit. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>“For us, the sort of cinematic ambition that we had was in presentation,” explains Gerighty. For that, he went straight to the source. “What we did was take a lot of inspiration from the original trilogy, but with today's technology, so very similar to what Rogue One did with its references to the production design of the original trilogy. [Its aim] was to replicate a lot of the filmic effects of those lenses in the 1970s. So you'll see barrel distortion on the sides, vignetting, film grain, chromatic aberration, and of course all wrapped up in an ultra-widescreen presentation.”</p><p>You can expect that level of detail in Outlaws’ cutscenes. But Gerighty notes that making a game cinematic “doesn't mean cinematics necessarily. What I care the most about is the interactive part.”</p><p>“I think it's a key point for open-world games at large, scaling does not always need to be grand, but it needs to be conscious,” Karlson theorises. “The scale of Tatooine needs, should, and does in our game feels very different. It breathes, it’s open sand dunes and long sightlines. It's easy to pick up any little anomaly on the horizon and there might be an opportunity for you, compared to the dense streets of Kijimi, which is a city in perpetual winter where people are trying to stay warm.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Scaling does not always need to be grand, but it needs to be conscious.</p></div><p>Scale is something written into the very DNA of Star Wars, whether seen on the big or small screen. Greig Fraser, Rogue One’s director of photography, recently told IGN that “If you watch any Star Wars film, that's what it's all about. It's knowing how big a human is going into this massive Millennium Falcon, how big the Millennium Falcon is going to this massive Death Star. It's scale upon scale upon scale.” It’s a philosophy Gerighty and the team at Massive took into Outlaws when crafting the introduction to its open world.</p><p>“One of our intentions for the beginning of the game was to make it feel very small and then [get] bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger,” explains Gerighty. “So [at the] beginning of the game, you start off in one room and it's claustrophobic and it's meant to make you feel a little bit trapped. You open up and it's city streets, but it's contained. And then you get into some narrative stuff and you steal a ship and you explode into the galaxy and all of a sudden you crash land on this planet, which is a wide open world.” </p><p>The aim here is to create a “sense of everything growing for you and not just the scale of the galaxy, but the scale of the possibilities for you as a character.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Outlaws’ campaign tells the tale of Kay Vess, a young scoundrel looking to build a team from across the stars in order to pull off one big space heist and remove the “death mark” placed on her by the Zerek Besh crime syndicate. It’s the basis of a story that evokes many other adventures from across both games and film. </p><p>“I love Mass Effect 2. It’s one of my favourite games,” states Navid Khavari, Outlaws’ narrative director. “There were so many influences. I think you look at everything from Ocean’s 11 and Ocean’s 8 to Star Wars itself. The previous films and that heist feeling was always kind of in the fabric.” He also namechecks Kurosawa, the Japanese director whose samurai stories were so influential on George Lucas’ original trilogy.</p><p>Knowing what sort of story you want to tell is one thing. Telling an engaging story in an open-world setting is another task altogether, and one that Khavari is well aware of, having written for Far Cry 4, 5, and 6, as well as The Division.</p><p>“It's one of the things you always have to keep in mind,” he says. “How are we going to weave a narrative and an open world together, so that we're telling the story, but also giving you the freedom to go wherever you'd like?” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We knew early on that if you got distracted by curiosity, the world had to react to that.</p></div><p>“We had a really clear approach on Outlaws,” he explains. ”There was Kay's journey[...] There were key points that we knew we wanted her to hit, and then that makes her story part of the wider Star Wars narrative. But between those moments, we knew early on that if you got distracted by curiosity, the world had to react to that. It had to expect that the player's going to go off the beaten path.”</p><p>The things that lie off the beaten path are built in accordance to something Massive refers to as “the three-second rule,” where within a few blinks of an eye you can instantly understand the nature of a location or character and the story behind them.</p><p>“Before you even put life in them, they need to visually tell a story about what kind of place it is, what's happened in the past, what type of life and events have taken place in them so that they get that lived-in feeling,” Karlson explains. “That lived-in, relatable, substantial feel, I think is a hallmark of any good open world, but also very Star Wars when you think about it.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/jawasandcrawler-1720441370568.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kay approaches a Jawa on Tatooine. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Star Wars’ aesthetic has always been rooted in the idea of the “used future”, where everything from the largest spaceships to the tiniest droids have that instantly recognisable layer of grime. Those small details build up into authentic, cool, and bespoke spaces –  something Massive has always managed to build into its own open worlds. The Division and its sequel are packed full of memorable levels ranging from New York landmarks to Washington DC museums, and that philosophy is being transferred to Outlaws’ many planets. Its main missions promise to take us to iconic locations such as Imperial bases and Jabba’s Palace.</p><p>“We can lean into the virtual tourism aspect of, ‘Hey, what is the distance between the moisture farms and Mos Eisley and the cantina?” says Gerighty. “There is a linear roller coaster story, a golden path, if you will. And around that, of course, there's the open world.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That sort of connective tissue of planet or moon to space was crucial to our whole approach.</p></div><p>“That's the dream I know I had as a kid,” Khavari adds. “That is what I've always wanted from a Star Wars game. That when I'm on a journey, when I'm entering into a quest, it might start on foot, it might start with me navigating a High Republic cruiser that's crashed, but I want to be able to jump into my speeder and blast off, [...], take off into space, maybe land in a space station and meet some characters that factor into my quest or journey along the way. And so that sort of connective tissue of planet or moon to space was crucial to our whole approach, right? Because that's kind of the fantasy that I think players are hoping for.”</p><p>That fantasy and freedom is evidently at the core of Outlaws, and while all five planets and moons (Toshara, Tatooine, Akiva, Kijimi, and Cantonica) won’t be instantly available to hyperdrive between, Gerighty claims it won’t be long into Kay’s journey until the galaxy opens up.</p><p>“There's a very structured intro that leads you to crash land on Toshara, which is a moon that we created with LucasFilm Games,” he says. “And once you finish the sort of linear narrative on Toshara, the other planets open up and it becomes completely non-linear and you can choose to tackle those [worlds] in any order you want.”</p><h2>A Galaxy of Exploration</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/kijimi-vista-1720441454367.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Concept art of Kay looking out over Kijimi City. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Exploration of these worlds is highly encouraged, with maps that are not (at least initially) flooded with icons and points of interest because you’re seeing these places from a fresh perspective.</p><p>“Kay hasn't seen the galaxy, she doesn't know everything,” Karlson explains. “The first time you come to Toshara you'll have a map where you can see mountains over there and stuff, but discovery is what gives you more information.” </p><p>“You're going to have to take some risks,” says Gerighty. “You're going to have to go to a cantina [...] and you can eavesdrop and pick up on some conversations that will lead you to another location that reveals a location within the open world that you have to get on your speeder to go and find. And there will be a fog of war that you'll be able to clear up and that's really where your curiosity will open things up even more.”</p><p>Each of Outlaws’ worlds vary in size. Toshara, Massive’s newly created moon, is around the same size as the jungle planet of Akiva, but a little smaller than the vast desert of Tatooine.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Assassin's Creed Odyssey has different zones on the map. Toshara is two or three of those put together.</p></div><p>“It was less about how big, but more about how long in terms of traversal with the speeder it would be,” Gerighty reveals. “[Toshara takes] four or five minutes nonstop, which doesn't sound like a lot, but once you're committed it's a fairly large amount and you are always going to be distracted. Assassin's Creed Odyssey, which was one of the games that we were looking at while creating this, you have different zones on the map [...][Toshara is] two or three of those put together.”</p><p>And that doesn’t even take into account the vast areas of space that surround each planet and serve as entirely different areas of orbital exploration and opportunity. We’ll cover that, as well as the starship side of the game, in greater depth later on in this month’s IGN First.</p><h2>Experts, Reputation, and the Wanted System</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/imperiallocationillusiveexpert-1720441614582.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kay encounters a mysterious Imperial expert. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>In terms of mission design, we’ve seen action ranging from stealth infiltrations, frantic dogfights, high-speed chases, and intense blaster battles, with some quests even evolving to include all of these elements at different stages. Star Wars Outlaws is thus perhaps better thought of as a single-player narrative action adventure in the wrappings of an open world – something more akin to Marvel’s Spider-Man than dense RPGs like The Witcher or Ubisoft’s recent Assassin’s Creed games. Its mixture of popcorn action and blockbuster narrative ambition is a departure from Massive’s gear-based experience on The Division. It is a new chapter in the continued evolution of a studio that started life as a real-time strategy developer.</p><p>“I think if you look at the evolution of the open world, there's a life, a dynamism, a systemic quality to The Division 2 that we didn't have in The Division 1,” states Gerighty. “I'm not talking about the presentation, the soft values at all. I'm talking about pure gameplay experience, single-player or cooperative. That was very, very important to us to have as a living, breathing element that engages players while they're playing Outlaws.” </p><p>It’s an evolution of what Massive has been doing in their games for years now – keeping worlds feeling bustling and alive, even when set against post-apocalyptic backdrops or in the midst of galactic wars.</p><p>“We in both Division games, but especially in the second one, developed what we call ‘living world systems’,” explains Karlson. “So same thing here. We have systems that make sure that the world is always alive with movement, traffic, speeders, zipping around the Empire, patrolling  syndicates have footholds out there, and these can cross paths. Also sometimes more substantial events happen and it's really up to you if you want to engage or not.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Star Wars Game Review</h3></div></output><p>Perhaps Outlaws’ most interesting method of breathing life into its open world is its approach to character progression. There’s no levelling up or incremental stat boosts to drop experience points into. Instead, Kay’s abilities and equipment are linked to experts – people you’ll meet across the galaxy who’ll grant you upgrades in exchange for work.</p><p>“They are full-on characters,” Karlson explains. “So they're spread out in the world and you don't know exactly who they are, what exactly they have to offer you and how to reach them from the very beginning. So there's this journey of discovery here as well. And once you reach them, there's a character there to interact with and an adventure to go on because they won’t instantly just, oh, here you go. And then they essentially open up a little regional progression for you where the nature of those things is also very tangible.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>An upgrade definitely ties into Kay pulling off the heist, but it's also very much its own journey, which is in the Star Wars tradition as well.</p></div><p>For example, after finding a Jawa by sourcing their location from overheard intel at a cantina, you can complete a mission for them in order to gain a new skill. In this case, it’s to venture into a dead Sarlacc to find a pristine tooth from its second mouth, which you can then exchange for a laser turret for the Trailblazer, Kay’s starship.</p><p>It’s a smart way of blending gameplay progression with a narrative befitting of the Star Wars criminal underbelly. “You can go on a journey with a character such as an expert who is going to teach Kay a new skill and give her a new upgrade to her blaster,” says Khavari. “Now, that skill, that upgrade definitely ties into Kay pulling off the heist, but it's also very much its own journey, which is in the Star Wars tradition as well.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/trailblazerturret-1720441749777.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kay's ship, the Trailerblazer, equipped with a laser turret - an upgrade given to her as an expert mission reward. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Another system aiming to marry gameplay with narrative is how Outlaws’ tracks Kay’s reputation with each of the criminal syndicates. Her bond with each of the Hutts, Pykes, Crimson Dawn, and Ashiga Clan will strengthen or weaken depending on your choices in dialogue and mission objectives.</p><p>“Your reputation moving in the positive direction unlocks a lot of things for you,” says Karlson. “Everything from actual access to territory that they control where you might have [only] been able to sneak in otherwise, to landing pads in the open world, to discounts with traders affiliated with the syndicate and unique really exotic rewards. But if you really get on their bad side, that's another thing that you'll feel dynamically in the game because they actually send hit squads out for you in the open world to try and take you out.”</p><p>The reputation system doesn’t just sit inside of missions, though. Smaller opportunities regularly present themselves to boost your relationships among the syndicates. These might be smaller skirmishes where choosing to get involved can benefit you and the organisation you side with. A strong bond with one may even help you out with the bigger threat looming over the galaxy…</p><p>“If you've for whatever reason ended up wanted and you're being chased by the Empire, and you cross paths with a syndicate that you have a really good reputation with at the moment, they might join in and help you out,” Karlson reveals. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/imperialcheckpoint-concept-1720441872113.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Concept art of Kay arriving at an Imperial checkpoint. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Outlaws directly follows the events of The Empire Strikes Back, and sees the Imperial forces at the peak of their powers. In gameplay terms, the Stormtroopers are basically like GTA’s police, and adopt a similar wanted system. Find yourself in a restricted area or accidentally fire a stray laser blast at a Stormtrooper and you’ll quickly find yourself in hot water. It’s by no means a revolutionary system when it comes to open-world design, but one that is made all the more exciting thanks to a lick of Imperial black and white paint. </p><p>“It has a good range of escalation and de-escalation,” Karlson states. “It's really up to you if you want to try and hide or maybe bribe an Imperial officer that's a bit corrupt in a city somewhere, or try to hyper jump to a different space region. But you will feel it. </p><p>“And let's just say there are Death Troopers for a reason,” he teasingly adds.</p><h2>Balancing Quality with Quantity</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/trailblazer-back-1720442036547.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Concept art of the Trailblazer blasting into space. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Beyond the main missions, expert side missions, and the reputation system at the core of it all, many other snackable activities exist in Outlaws’ open world. These range from quick contracts such as smuggling and stealing, gambling in Sabacc (Star Wars poker), to playing asteroid field arcade shooter games and betting on Canto Bight’s Fathier Racing. All of these activities bolster your ever-growing supply of credits which can be used to purchase new customisation and gear options for Kay, her pet-like alien companion Nix, and the Trailblazer.</p><p>And yet, there’s more. Emergent events frequently take place throughout the open world, whether on land or in space. “Every two, three minutes there'll be something that's happening, whether it's an ambush or the empire arresting some civilians or getting into combat with some criminal syndicates. And it's up to you whether you want to engage or not,” Gerighty reveals.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We don't want things to be just big for big sake.</p></div><p>With so much to do in Star Wars Outlaws, how does Massive go about avoiding open-world “bloat”? With a near-endless galaxy of opportunity, there’s the worry that things may spiral, feature creep sets in, and everything just gets “too big”. The studio had a clear plan from the start, though, leading with variety over size – quality over quantity, if you will. “So we don't want things to be just big for big sake. We need it to be contained, always fun, always proposing different activities,” Gerighty confirms.</p><p>“It's about calibrating size to substance,” adds Karlson. “When you see something that breaks pattern, that stands out for whatever reason, and you go there and look, there's something there to do, and that repeats frequently enough. [We also make sure] the quests, the bespoke content of the game, makes use of it so that it doesn't feel like a separate experience, but it's all one.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/toshara-kaynix-speeder-concept-1720442104911.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Concept art of Kay speeding toward the Toshara capital of Mirogana. Image credit: Massive Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p>Of course, no matter how much there will be to do in Outlaws, one thing that can be expected is a healthy helping of nods to the larger Star Wars galaxy. Lando is set to make an appearance, and we’ve already seen a glimpse of Han Solo in carbonite, but it sounds like they might just be the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>“What I would say is there are Easter eggs,” Khavari reveals. “There's characters that you'll meet along the way across the main quests and whether it's the experts or the wider stories you're going to stumble across. August 30th is a really great date. I recommend bookmarking it in your calendar.”</p><p>August 30 is right around the corner, a short wait for many players for whom an open-world game set in a galaxy far, far away has been a long-held dream. I could feel a similar passion for Star Wars coming out of each person I spoke to at Massive, and for them, I can’t help but get the sense that the dream is a shared one. Making open world games is tough. And bringing open world to Star Wars may well bring an extra level of difficulty, but for Gerighty and the team it’s been a challenge worth taking on.</p><p>“I'm getting to that point where I think I can count the number of games I can do until I'm put out to pasture on one hand,” Gerighty says. “And it becomes more and more important to me to choose what I do because it's really important for me to do quality work with people that I love working with. And Star Wars is definitely on the bucket list.” </p><p><em>Simon Cardy once got kicked out of a school assembly for calling somebody Salacious Crumb.

This group also includes current NFL stars like Patrick Mahomes, Davante Adams, Christian McCaffrey, and Joe Burrow. </p><p>More interestingly, the blog post mentions two programs coming to CUT: ICYMI and Legends; the former program will feature players who contributed to iconic moments in past seasons and helped their team excel on the iron, while the latter focuses on legendary All-Americans and see how they fare against the current stars of collegiate football. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>College Football 25 College Ultimate Team Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>This announcement is part of EA Sports' weeklong set of reveals for College Football 25 ahead of its release next week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2s-new-ceo-wants-to-keep-the-games-best-bug-yet<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> players have discovered a quite fantastic bug that prevents them from taking fall damage — and the new CEO of developer Arrowhead wants it to stay.</p><p>As surfaced by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dy2sup/to_whoever_said_emoting_reduces_fall_damage_thanks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor Chunke-Funke-Monke</a>, Helldivers 2 emoting actually reduces fall damage. It’s true: perform an emote while you’re falling from a height you'd typically die from and you'll reduce the damage you’d normally take and survive.</p><p>Why does this happen? The theory is that Helldivers 2 applies its physics model to fall damage as it does across the game. That is, the game works out which part of your body you’ve landed on and determines damage accordingly. It makes sense! A bang on the head is probably going to be fatal, but you might survive a bang on your butt… just.</p><p>Helldivers 2 doesn’t let you change your orientation as you fall through the air, but if you emote while doing so you force your character model to reposition into the emote pose, thus changing the part of you that hits the ground first. Genius!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/09/screenshot-2024-07-09-162144-1720538641799.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: reddit / Chunke-Funke-Monke.</figcaption></figure></output><p>This is genuinly useful in a game packed with explosions that often send your Helldiver hurtling across the map. And so, Helldivers 2 has a new meta: using emotes to prevent fall damage. Now that’s a twist Super Earth didn’t see coming.</p><p>You’d think Arrowhead would want to patch this one out (I doubt it’s intended gameplay), but new CEO Shams Jorjani, who recently replaced previous Arrowhead CEO and current chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt, tweeted to call for it to stay.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">can we please, please keep this? <a href="https://twitter.com/ArrowheadGS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ArrowheadGS</a> <a href="https://t.co/a57PMZ4JtT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/a57PMZ4JtT</a></p>— Shams Jorjani (@ShamsJorjani) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1810303338660983259?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>While emote free-falling is meme worthy now, what might be better for Helldivers 2 long-term is a more realistic mechanic that lets players reduce fall damage in-universe. Perhaps there’s certain armor that would help, or gear that gives you a parachute or something similar. Yet another mechanic to potentially add to Arrowhead’s long list of upcoming Helldivers 2 content.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">we'll add inflatable bouncy bags that deploy from under your arm pits or some shit if we have to. c'mon! we have the technology - where there's a will there's a way!</p>— Shams Jorjani (@ShamsJorjani) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1810326466262966483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>This isn't the first time Helldivers 2 players have discovered unintended emote gameplay. Soon after the PC and PlayStation 5 co-op shooter came out earlier this year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-hugging-strategy-is-the-most-wholesome-yet">players discovered that if one Helldiver used the shield generator pack to protect from sustaining damage from explosives, they could hug emote another player to share the shield</a>. Wholesome!</p><p>Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time, having shifted an incredible 12 million copies in just 12 weeks. Amid the huge revenue Helldivers 2 has generated, Arrowhead itself has suffered a number of crises, including launch server problems and a battle with Sony itself over the console maker’s controversial attempt to force Steam players to account link to PlayStation Network.</p><p>Arrowhead recently revealed it was in the process of setting the studio up so it could “make more and better stuff” in the long-term. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d2pozq/hello_fellow_helldivers_greetings_from_the_newly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an introductory post on reddit</u></a>, Jorjani said the studio has had to adjust to the enormous success Helldivers 2 has brought to the company.</p><p><em>Image credit: reddit / Chunke-Funke-Monke.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The Mutated Leaper ability now has a 50% increase to the inner explosive damage, while the radius for that damage is decreased by 79%. The developer says leaps must now travel 18.1m or more for lethal explosive damage to occur. The Mutant Juggernaut mutation is now nerfed with a 25% decrease to maximum health.</p>

Snap Tap is very similar to Wooting’s promised <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/14/24100819/wooting-80he-keyboard-rappy-snappy-feature">Rappy Snappy feature</a> and works by prioritizing the latest input between two selected keys to allow <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> and <em>Valorant </em>players to counter-strafe more quickly.</p><p>The Snap Tap mode means you don’t have to release the previous key when you’re strafing, so if you enable A and D for Snap Tap, then it makes strafing near instant, improving directional changes and movement in esports games. The difference is only a couple of milliseconds, but that’s enough to get a kill quicker than your opponent.</p><p>“Snap Tap Mode, integrated directly into the firmware, allows for instantaneous directional changes without lifting the initial key,” <a href="https://press.razer.com/product-news/introducing-snap-tap-mode/">says Razer</a>. “This seamless transition is crucial in competitive gaming, where even milliseconds can impact gameplay outcomes, making Snap Tap Mode a game-changing feature for the Huntsman V3 Pro line.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Strafing without Snap Tap.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Razer</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Strafing with Snap Tap.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Razer</cite></p></div><p>Razer’s Snap Tap comes just months after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/14/24100819/wooting-80he-keyboard-rappy-snappy-feature">Wooting announced its Rappy Snappy feature</a> for its upcoming 80HE keyboard. Wooting is also planning to bring Rappy Snappy to its existing 60E keyboard, widely regarded as one of the best gaming keyboards on the market. Wooting first introduced the concept of Rapid Trigger to gaming keyboards, which Razer, SteelSeries, Keychron, and many others have copied.</p><p>It’s surprising to see Razer first to the market with a feature Wooting already announced, but despite repeated promises of a 60HE beta of Rappy Snappy in recent months, the company hasn’t released it yet. Wooting is expecting to deliver its first batch of new 80HE keyboards in August, complete with Rappy Snappy.</p><p>Razer is rolling out Snap Tap as a software update for the Huntsman V3 Pro line, including the full-size, tenkeyless, and 60 percent models. You’ll need the latest version of Synapse and a firmware update to enable Snap Tap. Razer says this is a “phased&nbsp;software&nbsp;update,” so it might not be available for all Huntsman V3 Pro owners for a few days yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was the company’s simplified, free, and bare-bones alternative to Microsoft Word—a more fully featured word processor still popular in 2024. Since Notepad’s launch in the 1980s, the company has made minor updates to Notepad, but it’s never been a real word processor. And that’s not changing anytime soon, but at least now if you do use Notepad on Windows 11 you’ll be able to spellcheck words. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-notepad-finally-gets-spell-check-autocorrect&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-notepad-finally-gets-spell-check-autocorrect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>PC Mag</em></a></span>, starting this week, Microsoft is rolling out an update for Notepad to all Windows 11 users that adds those familiar red squiggly lines under misspelled words inside text docs. Users can then right-click the red line to see the correctly spelled version of the word and click that option to fix the typo. </p><p><em>Technically</em>, this new spellcheck feature for Notepad has been around for some users since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/03/21/spellcheck-in-notepad-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/03/21/spellcheck-in-notepad-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March as part of a beta test</a></span>. But starting with Windows 11 Notepad version 11.2405.13.0 and forward, it seems the testing is done and spell check is now a built-in feature for the app for everyone. I’m not sure why Microsoft doesn’t add this simple feature to Notepad on Windows 10, seems like it could do that, but I guess this is supposed to be one more incentive to get people (like myself) to switch from 10 to 11. And to that, I say: No way, Microsoft. No way. </p><p>Meanwhile, WordPad, a free word processor that lives between Notepad and Word, is not long for this world. In a future update for Windows 11, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features#:~:text=WordPad,deprecated%20features.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features#:~:text=WordPad,deprecated%20features." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft has confirmed its plans to remove WordPad</a></span> from the operating system. It’s expected that WordPad will be removed in September or October of this year. So perhaps that’s the reason Notepad is getting some upgrades. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Once Human is being released today, with the developer, Starry Studio, deploying another open-world survival game into the well-populated genre. Once Human is a free-to-play, multiplayer-based title with base-building elements, sumptuous visuals, and a wide variety of enemies to battle with friends or alone.</p>



<p>Ahead of the game’s release, the team at Starry Studio released a blog post detailing the season and ‘wipe’ operating model that Once Human will have, touching on the innovative ‘Eternaland’ mechanic that’s being featured in the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-stays-forever">It Stays Forever</h2>



<p>Once Human looks great on the surface, and early gameplay previews have revealed a game that offers a substantial amount of freedom and customisation. It’s probably not bad for a free-to-play survival shooter – but it’s in the unique elements that Once Human shines.</p>



<p>One such element is the Eternaland feature. In <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/devBlog/20240709/37623_1165873.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent blog post</a>, Starry Studio explained that Once Human will be subject to regular seasons, and the end of each season will bring a ‘wipe’ or a reset to the platform, offering a ‘new start gaming experience, allowing you to rectify any regrets from the previous season.’</p>



<p>Here’s the twist, though – everything you unlock and collect while you play Once Human, including blueprints, homes, and ‘memories of fighting alongside friends’, will be transported to Eternaland, which has been dubbed ‘a personal world of your own’. In the blog post, Starry Studio said that by doing this, Once Human can offer ‘limitless imagination and creativity’, giving players a permanent and personal environment within which to experiment, complete new challenges, and ‘unleash (their) creativity’. </p>



<p>It’s a long way of saying that Once Human has a creative mode, basically.</p>

                <p>This year marks the 10th anniversary of Burial At Sea Episode 2, the final installment of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bioshock-infinite-review/1900-6405763/" data-ref-id="1900-6405763">BioShock Infinite</a>'s DLC and the last time gamers had a chance to revisit Rapture. 2K Games finally announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-bioshock-game-is-now-in-development/1100-6472016/" data-ref-id="1100-6472016">a new BioShock game</a> in 2019, yet details and news have been scarce. But now, it looks like there's finally positive momentum for BioShock 4.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshock-developer-ramping-up" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, 2K Cloud Chamber, the studio in charge of making BioShock 4, has listed 30 open positions dedicated to the title's production. 2K Cloud Chamber senior cinematic designer Jeff Spoonhower wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeffspoonhower_bioshock-activity-7214273087096115200-JWZK/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Linkedin</a> that "The BioShock team at 2K Cloud Chamber is ramping up! We have many positions open across a variety of disciplines including art, animation, engineering, design, narrative, and production. We are working on a really awesome project, and our studio is remote-friendly."</p><p>There are still a lot of questions about what will be in BioShock 4 and how it will relate to the three games that came before it. The first two BioShock games were set in the underwater city known as Rapture, while BioShock Infinite shifted the action to an elevated city called Columbia. The two-part Burial At Sea DLC established the ways that Rapture and Columbia were linked in the multiverse while tying up Infinite's loose ends.</p><p>While BioShock 4 may still be a few years away, series creator Ken Levine's new game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-judas-trailer-at-state-of-play-shows-off-bioshock-like-combat/1100-6520723/" data-ref-id="1100-6520723">Judas</a>, looks a lot like the earlier BioShock games in its previously released previews. Judas is also expected to be released for the current console generation even though it doesn't have a release date. As for BioShock 4, there's no telling when that game will arrive, but don't be shocked if it skips this console generation.</p>

                <p>Free-to-play co-op shooter Once Human launches today on PC, iOS, and Android. The game has cross-play, meaning you can play with your friends regardless of what platform they are on. However, cross-progression has some limitations. If you make an account through Steam, for example, you can't transfer your character from Steam to iOS or Android or even to another PC storefront.</p><h3>Once Human Cross-Play</h3><p>A launch Q&amp;A on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460/view/4230650600757463064" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> clarifies how cross-play works. The gist is that every platform has access to the same servers. As long as you are on the same server as your friends, you can play with them. It doesn't matter whether you are on Steam, Epic, mobile, or the Once Human launch client "Loading Bay."</p>

<h3>Once Human Cross-Progression</h3><p>The same Q&amp;A explains cross-progression limitations, though the wording is confusing. Because of "their inherent limitations," some account types like Steam cannot use their account or character on another platform. Starry Studio didn't name any other platforms, so it's worth checking with your preferred platform before diving in. If you want to play across PC and mobile, the best bet is to download Loading Bay. The Q&amp;A also promised that more account options are on the way, though it stopped short of mentioning console versions or changes to existing account types.</p><p>Once Human is a survival shooter with both PvP and co-op modes. It takes place in a post-apocalypse where an entity known as Stardust has transformed plants, animals, and humans into new, violent creatures. Players must brave the world to fight bosses and complete quests with various factions. There are also crafting and creation elements where you can construct your own home and customize your look and weapons.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-pharaoh-dynasties-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-pharaoh-dynasties-update-aims-for-redemption-later-this-month.922701/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-pharaoh-dynasties-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sega and developer Creative Assembly have announced a release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Total War: Pharaoh&nbsp;</em>Dynasties update, which is bringing new factions, reworked units, and much more.</p>
<p>The update will arrive on July 25th and will be an entirely separate edition of the game, although it will be free if you've already bought&nbsp;<em>Total War: Pharaoh</em>. You won't be able to transfer saves between the two, however, and cross-progression won't be possible either.</p>
<p>Dynasties will also be the last major update for&nbsp;<em>Total War: Pharaoh</em>; there won't be any further DLC or expansions, although Sega and Creative Assembly have pledged to continue updating the game with quality-of-life improvements and fixes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-war-pharaoh-dynasties-update-release-date-siege.jpg?itok=Q4pV4yOX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/total-war-pharaoh-dynasties-update-release-date-siege.jpg?itok=I3E2NAsl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Total War: Pharaoh&nbsp;</em>is about to get an overhaul.</figcaption></figure><p>If you played&nbsp;<em>Total War: Pharaoh&nbsp;</em>and weren't particularly impressed by it (as, indeed, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/total-war-pharaoh-review-this-is-not-it">our own reviewer wasn't</a>), then you'll be pleased to know Dynasties is making a number of much-needed changes.</p>
<p>You can look forward to four new major factions and a total of 25 new minor factions, as well as an expanded campaign map, which Creative Assembly says will be almost twice as big as the game's current map.</p>
<p>Additionally, Dynasties is bringing 150 new and reworked units, including cavalry, and it's also adding some new battle mechanics to the table, giving you more options when it comes to combat strategy.</p>
<p>A new Dynasties family tree system, which is presumably what the update is named for, will introduce a&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings</em>-style lineage system to&nbsp;<em>Total War: Pharaoh&nbsp;</em>as well, adding a sense of zoomed-out history and grand strategy to proceedings.</p>

<p><em>Total War: Pharaoh&nbsp;</em>launched on October 11th, and while <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/15189/total-war-pharaoh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">critical reception was broadly positive</a>, the game is currently sitting at a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1937780/Total_War_PHARAOH/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"Mixed" rating on Steam</a>, with players pointing to a lack of variety in factions and an outdated engine as major flaws, among other things.</p>
<p>The problems were enough for Creative Assembly VP Roger Collum to acknowledge the reception to&nbsp;<em>Total War: Pharaoh&nbsp;</em>(as well as&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 3</em>) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/total-war-leadership-apologizes-for-warhammer-3-and-pharaoh-mistakes-promises-action-to">back in December</a>, when he promised the studio would improve the game in order to "get back to solid ground".</p>
<p>Since Dynasties represents the last major update for&nbsp;<em>Total War: Pharaoh</em>, it looks like this is the final opportunity Creative Assembly has to make good on its promise.&nbsp;<em>Total War: Pharaoh</em>'s Dynasties update arrives on July 25th, and the base game is available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1937780/Total_War_PHARAOH/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on Steam right now</a>.</p>

            <p>Prolific fantasy author and number one Ranni stan (“I'll pick the ending where my character gets a waifu”) Brandon Sanderson has been thinking a lot about how to apply <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> and the Souls games' signature storytelling approach to novels. During a <a href="https://youtu.be/cgEZvQhRqTg">recent playthrough</a> on his YouTube channel, he was asked if he thinks there’s a way to replicate Souls-like descriptions in books. “I’ve wondered that. I really have,” Sanderson replies.</p>

<p>“I think you could do some interesting…” Sanderson starts, before describing Souls’ method of storytelling, and possibly getting distracted by a collectable cookbook in the distance. He talks about the reserved use of NPCs and cutscenes, and the item descriptions that tell snippets of the game's overall stories. “They don’t want to hand you the story. You gotta piece it together.”</p>
<p>He goes on to compliment this approach for videogames specifically. “It doesn’t stop the action, you get to stop it when you want. Games are about playing.” Sanderson reckons that having to work to piece the mystery together aligns with FromSoft’s approach to mood. “There aren’t a lot of answers, so it creates a game on top of the game.”</p>
<p>“Can you replicate this?” he continues, referring to writing traditional fiction, “I think you possibly can. It’s like how we use epigrams as a supplementary storytelling style.” A supplementary storytelling style to stealthily slide the Souls series’ signature storytelling into Sanderson’s softbacks? Do go on! “Obviously, Dune is the great big pioneer of this. Watchmen’s the other really great example.”</p>
<p>Sadly, we’re denied more of Sanderson’s insight, as he immediately gets distracted by a gnarled tree with strung up corpses. “I bet those guys fall down and attack me,” speculates the big 34 million copy-selling nerd, before going to investigate.</p>
<p>Sanderson has been vocal about his love of FromSoftware’s work in the past, and Bandai Namco seem keen to work with him, having previously sent him a care package <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/elden-rings-publisher-wants-to-work-with-author-brandon-sanderson-and-he-has-a-soulsborne-pitch/">containing an expression of interest in collaboration</a>, and also <a href="https://youtu.be/pPj6VRnl3og?t=882">a massive sword</a>. It’s always the men who can afford massive swords that get sent free ones, to quote Engels. Ah, he deserves it, I’m sure. Back then, Sanderson commented that he'd actually already thought up an entire pitch for a Soulsborne game, having previously expressed <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/mistborn-author-says-he-should-have-written-elden-ring-instead-of-george-r-r-martin/">good-natured salt</a> at George RR Martin being the one to write <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>’s lore.</p>
<p>“From Software decides to make a fantasy game and partner with a fantasy novelist, right? And they choose someone who spends his days blogging about the NFL, rather than the person who has played their games since King’s Field, and has listed their games among his top 10 consistently over time? What are you thinking, people?” 

</p><p>Sanderson, who also wrote lore for tabletop skirmish game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonbreaker">Moonbreaker</a>, is also not above some additional playful salt over the series’ previous lack of a dedicated jump. “Whoever went to to Myazaki and said ‘um, hey, you know there's this revolution that's been made in video games. You may want to try it -  it's called a jump button! And showed him Mario and he's like, oh wow you can have a button for that nowadays?” Of course, real fans know that if you use jump to clear an obstacle in Elden Ring, you haven’t really cleared it.</p>
