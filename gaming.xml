            <p>
I suspect I might be in a minority here, but I can confidently say I didn't use a single repair kit as I bumbled and faffed my way through MachineGames' excellent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> late last year - mainly because I was so enamoured by the game's ludicrous clobbering loop I couldn't take two steps forward without hoovering up another handful of melee-focused bric-a-brac. So I very much appreciate that Indy's latest update finally gives my never-diminishing stash of repair kits a purpose by letting me lob them at foes.
</p>
<p>
Besides that, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's Update 4 comes with a heap of tweaks and changes designed to further enhance its already excellent action, starting with two new Adventure Books that'll provide Indy with some additional whip-focused benefits. Open Season, for instance, creates a temporary window after whipping enemies in which they'll take increased damage from subsequent attacks. And with Sleight of Hand, Indy can pull an enemy's weapon towards him after disarming them with the whip.
</p>
<p>
That brings us to Update 4's dozen or so quality of life improvements. These include new one-liners for Indy during fights, meaning you'll get a bit of extra vocal variety while punching Nazis and other miscreants. And Machine Games says Ray-traced Global Illumination has also been improved across all platforms "at no performance cost".

<p>
Elsewhere, there's now a timer around Indy's health showing how long you'll need to wait until enemies call off a search, and a number of UI elements and effects - specifically the HUD's centre dot and "stealth" vignette while crouching - can now be toggled on or off. Additionally, the journal has seen some improvements while in its somewhat fiddly "lowered" state; you can see more of it, for starters, and it's now possible to switch between local and level maps.
</p>
<p>
Moving on, there's a new "Always Allow Skipping Cutscenes" option if you have absolutely no patience for cinematic chatter; there are a couple off new tutorials; the menu for purchasing Adventure Books and map information booklets has been improved; the PC version now supports the PlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller for advanced haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, and PlayStation or Steam Deck controllers will now show up in the controller configuration menu on PC. And for more on Update 4's lengthy list of bug fixes, you'll be <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/7gQFCUktT0FwdnHFlcZVOV/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-4?linkId=100000356791847">wanting to check out MachineGames' patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's fourth major update is now live on PC and Xbox, and it seems reasonable to expect all its additions and improvements will feature in the PlayStation 5 release when it launches next Thursday, 17th April. And it is, of course, well worth picking up. "Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones," we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">wrote in our five star review</a>, "The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames" - and that was before we went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">name it Eurogamer's game of the year in 2024</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-releases-out-of-early-access-in-september/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developed by Funday Games and published by Ghost Ship Games, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is the rougelike auto-shooter spin-off of first-person co-op mining shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/deep-rock-galactic-a-dwarf-is-always-a-dwarf-even-in-space/">Deep Rock Galactic</a>. The top-down adventure launched in early access on Steam in February 2024, and Ghost Ship Games announced today it'll launch out of early access later this year.</p>
<p>Announced during the Triple-I Initiative Showcase, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor will hit its 1.0 launch on <strong>September 17, 2025.&nbsp;</strong>It'll be available on PC through Steam at launch, though hopefully, once it hits 1.0, we'll hear something about when it'll be moving to consoles.</p>
<p>Over 1 million players have already dived into Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor since its release a little more than a year ago, and in that time, Funday Games has released multiple new biomes and characters for players to try out, with more sure to come when its 1.0 release arrives.</p>
<p>Unlike Deep Rock Galactic, which has a co-op focus, Survivor is a single-player game that challenges players to take down waves of hordes of aliens. At the same time, you search for anything and everything shiny and valuable.</p>
<p>Funday Games promises that the 1.0 update will be "<em>the biggest update we've ever made</em>," though the exact details of the update remain unclear. Fans are hoping that it will include the anticipated endless mode, which was previously delayed from the last content update for Survivor, as Funday Games opted to focus on getting Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor ready for its September 1.0 release instead.</p>
<p><iframe title="Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor - 1.0 Release Date Trailer | The Triple-i Initiative" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fxv51gpDO3g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer for its release date does show players, though, that a new mechanic, 'Gear,' will be added with 1.0. Unfortunately, we don't have any concrete answers to how players get it, what functions gear has, or any other questions players have about it. Funday is holding off on those details until the game's release is closer.</p>
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor's release date wasn't the only news from Ghost Ship Games during the Triple-I Initiative Showcase, as we also got word that a closed alpha test for <a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core-is-a-roguelite-spin-off-of-the-popular-co-op-game/">Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</a> will be taking place soon, ahead of the game's early access launch. You can sign up for a chance to participate in that playtest on Rogue Core's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2605790/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Rogue_Core/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-first-look-at-endhroudeds-next-update-promises-a-rebirth-of-that-titular-shroud.1161246/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-look-at-endhroudeds-next-update-promises-a-rebirth-of-that-titular-shroud<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Right, anyone fancy a small look at the next update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enshrouded">Enshrouded</a>? Today's Triple-I showcase delivered exactly that, though I have to admit it's pretty brief, and doesn't show all that much. The game's sixth update, Thralls of Twilight, is due out sometime in May, and seems to come with some big additions. For one, there's new enemies that "creep, crawl, and stalk you further," which sounds… pleasant.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The update will give you a few more reasons to dive into the shroud too. There's more resources, the ability to unlock a new weapons customisation mechanic, and more besides that. Improvements have also apparently been made to the game's nighttime cycle, as there'll be enemy groups going around the world at night with some new rewards you can find too. Gems are also being added that'll let you can attach to your weapons that all have special effects.

Enshrouded's creative director Antony Christoulakis had a chat with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/enshroudeds-next-update-promises-a-rebirth-of-the-shroud-with-new-monsters-resources-and-a-whole-new-weapon-customization-system/">PCGamer</a> recently too, where he explained that this update is focused on the shroud so much because it's "not strong enough yet from our perspective. So, we introduced new enemies that are coming with the next update, as well as improving the topology and adding more points of interest to these [shrouded regions], and also some new mechanics that hopefully make combat also more interesting."
</p>
<p>
The game has been out in early access for a little over a year now, and the intention was originally that it would be out within a year, but obviously the game needs a bit more time. It's also 20% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/">Steam</a> at the moment, so now seems like a good time to pick it up if you're so inclined.

<p>After years of speculation, all signs point to The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion remake coming soon, so here is everything you need to know about the leaked announcement and release period. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-time-does-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-release-date-times-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda</a> and 2K Games partnered to create <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/virtuos-unannounced-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion</a>, which was released in 2006. The fourth installment in the series is often considered one of the greatest games ever made. In saying that, it is almost overshadowed by its successor, The Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim, which is one of the best-selling games of all time and went on to receive several remasters. </p>



<p>As fans wait for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-6-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, Bethesda reportedly has plans to remind fans just how special the fourth game in the series is. </p>







<figure><figcaption>The Elder Scrolls gameplay has come a long way since 2006. Image via Bethesda </figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion hasn’t officially been confirmed by Bethesda.</strong> </p>



<p>Rumors originated in 2022 when a remake or remaster of Oblivion first popped up during the FTC investigation into Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The game was expected to be released during the 2022 fiscal year. </p>



<p>When that date passed, the project resurfaced again in December 2024, as rumors <span>suggested</span> Virtuos was developing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-4-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake on Unreal Engine 5</a>, which was further believed to be included in January’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-could-be-revealed-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Direct</a>, which came and went without an announcement. </p>



<p>No official announcement hasn’t stopped rumors from intensifying. </p>







<p><strong>No, The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion has no official release date</strong>.</p>



<p>However, Giant Bomb’s <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ifsfg5XFuRI&amp;t=14s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jeff Grubb</a> revealed, “I have been told it’s going to shadow drop at any moment this month.”  </p>



<p>For those unfamiliar with the term, a shadow drop is immediately releasing a game without any previous announcement or confirmed release date. </p>



<p>Shadow-dropping a game of this magnitude would be a surprise. Still, it isn’t something Bethesda hasn’t done before: Bethesda’s former studio, Tango Gameworks, shadow-dropped Hi-Fi Rush in January 20203. </p>



<p>The marketing strategy ultimately failed, as Grubb claimed in April 2023 that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-microsoft-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a> “didn’t make the money it needed to make.” </p>



<p>Despite the game receiving positive reviews, the lack of marketing might have resulted in lackluster sales, and Tango Gameworks was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hi-fi-rush-microsoft-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to shut down</a> in May 20024. </p>



<p>That reportedly hasn’t scared Bethesda from trying the shadow drop strategy again. </p>







<p><strong>Bethesda has a proven track record of producing successful remasters, so fans should feel confident with The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion remake. </strong></p>



<p>In 2016, The Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim Special Edition contained all three DLC add-ons with a graphical upgrade. In 2017, Bethesda brought Skyrim to VR with a new title and released an Anniversary Edition of the beloved game in 2021 with additional Creation Club content. </p>



<p>Based on that, fans should expect The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion remake to include the Knights of the Nine&nbsp;and&nbsp;Shivering Isles expansions and a much-needed visual overhaul. </p>



<hr>



<p>The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion isn’t the only remake reportedly coming soon. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-complete-ps-store-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last of Us Complete Edition</a> is now available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-animated-playstation-backgrounds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-seemingly-teased-by-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 9 remake</a> was recently teased. </p>

The Last of Us Part 2 continued Ellie’s story in 2020 and then went on to receive its own remaster in early 2024.

No, he wasn’t paid to change his opinion (as far as we know), but he harped on the financial burden incurred when crafting elaborate VFX-heavy films like his <em>Avatar</em> series and Denis Villeneuve’s <em>Dune </em>movies<em>. </em>According to him, if we want to keep making such films, production costs have to come down, and AI might be the way to do that.</p><p>“If we want to continue to see the kinds of movies that I’ve always loved and that I like to make and that I will go to see—<em>Dune</em>, <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, or one of my films or big effects-heavy, CG-heavy films—we’ve got to figure out how to cut the cost of that in half.” </p><p>He made sure to clarify that in his view, AI shouldn’t replace humans’ jobs, but accelerate them. AI should be “doubling their speed to completion on a given shot, so your cadence is faster and your throughput cycle is faster, and artists get to move on and do other cool things and then other cool things.” It appears he views AI in movies as akin to the computer replacing the typewriter, rather than sentient killing machines replacing the human species.<br></p><p>As practical as that may be, it still sounds like it came from bizzarro world when you remember that Cameron gave an ominous warning about AI <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2023/07/terminator-director-james-cameron-on-rise-of-ai-1235441905/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/terminator-director-james-cameron-on-rise-of-ai-1235441905/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back in 2023</a></span> when he told CTV News, “I warned you guys in 1984, and you didn’t listen.” Finding AI so horrifying that he references his 1984 film <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Terminator</em>, whose plot is set in motion by an AI that seeks to wipe out humanity, when warning about its dangers doesn’t sound like a stance one can just pivot from in less than two years. <br></p><p>Still, he’s spent time since then studying the workings of AI, which may have contributed to the shift in his views. On the <em>Boz to the Future</em> podcast he discussed taking time to learn the nuances of the AI space in order to find a way to leverage its redeemable aspects to push filmmaking further. “The goal was to understand the space, to understand what’s on the minds of the developers,” he explained. “What are they targeting? What’s their development cycle? How much resources you have to throw at it to create a new model that does a purpose-built thing, and my goal was to try to integrate it into a VFX workflow.”<br></p><p>To his credit, he never said AI should be writing movies, having said in 2023, “ “I just don’t personally believe that a disembodied mind that’s just regurgitating what other embodied minds have said—about the life that they’ve had, about love, about lying, about fear, about mortality—and just put it all together into a word salad and then regurgitate it...I don’t believe that have something that’s going to move an audience.” So he’s not fully on the AI bandwagon. But he did join the Stability AI <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/james-cameron-joins-stability-ai-board-of-directors-1236097835/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/james-cameron-joins-stability-ai-board-of-directors-1236097835/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board of Directors</a></span> last September to help bring AI capabilities to future filmmakers. With Cameron on board, it could only be a matter of time before Hollywood begins finding ways to incorporate AI without killing us all.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's been a minute since a turn-based game set in the&nbsp;Might &amp; Magic world of Enroth came around—about 10 years, actually, not counting <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/songs-of-conquest-is-the-heroes-of-might-magic-rebirth-we-all-deserve/">spiritual successors</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era/"><em>Olden Era</em></a> takes players to the continent of Jadame, never before explored in the game universe. Woodland spirits fight medieval armies, zombies spawn from the battlefield, demons get into the mix—there's a lot going on. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era/">sign up for a playtest at the game's Steam page</a>, and it's due out in early access in Q2 2025.</p>

If you thought Nintendo was the master of re-releases, then <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> might just be gunning for its title. The studio has announced yet another release for The Last of Us - but this time it's returning in the form of a two-game Complete edition.
</p>
<p>
Hints that Sony and Naughty Dog might be preparing another The Last of Us release first surfaced back in March, when it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-reportedly-getting-mysterious-new-physical-ps5-special-edition">reported a mysterious new PlayStation 5 special edition was on the way</a>. Little was known about it at the time, beyond the fact it was supposedly getting a physical edition, but all has now been revealed.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us Complete, as its name suggests, bundles together the PS5 versions of The Last of Us Part 1 and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, which initially released in 2022 and 2024 respectively. It'll be available in two forms; a digital edition, which is live on the PlayStation Store right now, and a special physical Collector's Edition, which arrives on 10th July.
</p>

<p>
The Last of Us Complete's digital release features exactly the same content as you'd get if you brought both games separately, but it does provide a bit of saving. It's <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA29488_00-0000000000000000">priced at £94.99 on the PlayStation Store</a>, making a purchase £19.99 cheaper than buying Part 1 and Part 2 individually.
</p>
<p>
As for the Collector's Edition, it's exclusive to PlayStation's online store. It comes in a steelbook case with separate discs for Part 1 and Part 2, and also includes the Left Behind prequel chapter, The Last of Us: American Dreams Comics #1-4 with new cover art, a set of four lithographic art prints, and a Thank You letter from Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann - which I'm assuming isn't going to be handwritten. It costs £109.99/$109.99 USD, and <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/buy-games/the-last-of-us-complete-collectors-edition-ps5">pre-orders are open now</a>.
</p>
<p>
But will Naughty Dog's latest The Last of Us release <em>actually</em> end up being the "complete" edition. Druckmann has sent mixed messages about the likelihood of a third series instalment over the last few years, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-3-could-be-one-more-chapter-to-this-story-says-co-creator-druckmann">telling fans "there's probably one more chapter to this story" back in 2024</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-boss-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">reversing course this March</a> and warning, "Don't bet on there being more."
</p>
<p>
There is, though, <em>sort of</em> new The Last of Us on the way, courtesy of HBO's live-action TV adaptation. Season 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">begins airing</a> this Sunday, 13th April (14th April in the UK), and looks like it'll be substantially expanding on the events of the second game. We already know some new characters are being introduced for Season 2 - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-catherine-ohara-will-play-in-the-last-of-us-marking-a-significant-change-from-the-games">Catherine O'Hara's Gale</a> - and given showrunner Craig Mazin is predicting the series will run to four season, there's plenty of space to chart routes previously unseen. Especially as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-show-renewed-for-season-three-and-the-second-hasnt-even-aired-yet">Season 3 is already confirmed</a>.

			<p>During the ESO Direct, ZeniMax Online Studios unveiled what's coming this year to the popular MMORPG Elder Scrolls Online. You can read about all of it <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-add-subclassing-and-seasons-of-the-worm-cult-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, from the new subclassing feature to the Season of the Worm Cult (which continues the original game's storyline) and more.</p>
<p>Wccftech was among select outlets that accessed the presentation beforehand. Afterward, key developers from ZeniMax Online Studios (Studio Head Matt Firor, Game Director Rich Lambert, and Executive Producer Susan Kath) answered several questions from the assembled press. You can find the full transcript below.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I personally love the interesting mix of architecture that we have. It's Argonian and High Elf kind of put together. I love the wall that we've got in there; it's splitting the zone in two. And then, this isn't specific to Solstice, but I freaking love subclassing. It opens up so many opportunities for builds.' - Rich Lambert</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to change from an annual Chapter model to the content pass?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt Firor:</strong> With the chapter mode, we did a lot of great content over the years, but most of it hit in June. It was a big moment and it didn't leave a lot of time for the team to make content over the rest of the year. What it really did is it locked us into this cadence that made it so we couldn't experiment as much as we wanted. This will free us up so that we can put time into doing<br>
things like the Cyrodiil Champions test, for example. Take some time out of the content pipeline and move it into how we can make the game better, how we can make systems that are already in the game better, and what we can do to shake things up.</p>
<p><strong>Will subclassing work with my current character build?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert:</strong> Yes. That's the most important part of subclassing: you don't have to reroll a new character in order to do it. You can just take the class that you already have or a character that you've already spent all this time and effort with and roll out new abilities and new skill lines to it.</p>
<p><strong>How will this seasonal pass affect ESO Plus?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Susan Kath:</strong> Not significantly, because you're still getting access to the things that traditionally you got access to as part of ESO Plus. It is just a way to group the content over the entire year kind of into one package that you can pre-purchase, so you have access to it all the moment that we release it.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite thing about the new Solstice zone?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>There's so much. I personally love the interesting mix of architecture that we have. It's Argonian and High Elf kind of put together. I love the wall that we've got in there; it's splitting the zone in two. And then, this isn't specific to Solstice, but I freaking love subclassing. It opens up so many opportunities for builds.</p>
<p><strong>Is subclassing a part of the base game update?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>It is, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Will subclass abilities be weaker versions of the original ones or the same?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>They are the same. The only penalty that you have is that those abilities cost twice as many skill points to use. That was the trade-off. In order to give you more flexibility, you have to be even more invested in the character.</p>
<p><strong>How will you balance the FOMO (flavor of the month) with these seasons?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>That's a really good question. I think what we have shown in the past is with new things that we do, there's always a little bit of that FOMO, but we will sometimes bring things back. We will also make sure that super exclusive things are generally easy to get so that you don't feel like you have to grind every single day of the season in order to get it. Those are the pillars that we're leaning on for the seasonal stuff.&nbsp; Some of it is FOMO, though. It's a season, it's active; go and play and do the things and experience it while it's there.</p>
<p><strong>Will subscribers of ESO Plus have access to the content pass with their active subscription?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Susan Kath: </strong>Well, there's the content pass, and then there's ESO Plus. No, it is not included in ESO Plus.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Firor: </strong>Just like the Chapters before weren't included in ESO Plus. There will be content throughout the year that is included in ESO Plus, but what is in the content pass for Seasons of the Worm Cult is not included in ESO Plus, just like last year's Chapter was not included in ESO Plus.</p>
<p><strong>How do you plan on balancing subclassing? For example, taking the Arcanist and using a Templar beam, will that be way overpowered?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>That was the biggest concern when we first started pitching this. In particular, the dungeon team were like, don't break our Trials. We've done a lot of testing on that and yes, power level will go up some, but we're fine with where it is. We haven't done anything to dramatically nerf things or reduce a lot of power from the abilities. We want this to be fun and we want players to experiment and make cool things.</p>
<p><strong>How are we going to access the subclassing feature?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>There's a little bit of friction in terms of how you unlock it. If you are someone like me or Matt who's played Elder Scrolls Online forever and have multiple level 50 characters, then all those skill lines are unlocked and the only thing you have to worry about is leveling the actual abilities on your character. If you are a player that only has one character, then you can go through a number of quests and train those skill lines in order to be able to use them. We thought about a bunch of different ways to make this as widely available as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Can you further explain the new content pass?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Susan Kath: </strong>By purchasing the content pass this year, you will have access to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-gets-fallen-banners-dungeon-dlc-overhauled-starting-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fallen Banners dungeons</a>. You have Seasons of the Worm Cult part one and part two and you have the Soul Wall event. The Soul Wall event, however, is unique in that everyone will be able to participate, but the experience if you have purchased the content pass is going to be different.</p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>Yeah, there's more stuff. I think the best way to explain it is with the Chapter model. The content pass encapsulates everything for the entire year. If you have ESO Plus, you still get the dungeons, the way it's always been.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Firor: </strong>If people are a little confused about it, this year is a transition between last year's Chapter model and next year. This year, we already had content in the pipeline, and so we're doing this bridge year where we have some items that feel a little bit like the Chapter did, but we're calling it a content pass just so we can put some extra things in it and get people ready for what's coming next.</p>
<p><strong>How much will the content pass cost and what will it include?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Susan Kath: </strong>I cannot tell you that right now as I don't remember it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Firor: </strong>The basic idea is that if you want to go to the zone of Solstice, you have to buy the content pass. Then there are some things around the edges, but that's the big thing.</p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>You get to participate in the Soul Wall event even if you don't have Solstice. There's some things you can't do in there, but you can help the server work towards unlocking things.</p>
<p><strong>Susan Kath: </strong>Matt spoke to it very succinctly. It is a transition year for us. It is spreading things out a bit. You could think of it very much akin to what you have seen in the past, but it's spread out, it's changed up a little bit and it'll change more as we go into the next year. But the base game of Elder Scrolls Online is still getting updates throughout the year. That doesn't change.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The entire server is working towards the goals of the event, and there's a number of stages. I'm not going to go too deep into things, but there's a number of stages that you work towards. You help set the camps, you help fend off attacks on those camps, and then the last stage is actually going into the wall area and bringing it down for the entire city. This is something we've never done before and I'm super excited for this.' - Rich Lambert</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Will the Writhing Wall event be a real-time experience shared among all players, similar to how Fortnite events are usually conducted?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>Sort of. The entire server is working towards the goals of the event, and there's a number of stages. I'm not going to go too deep into things, but there's a number of stages that you work towards. You help set the camps, you help fend off attacks on those camps, and then the last stage is actually going into the wall area and bringing it down for the entire city. This is something we've never done before and I'm super excited for this.</p>
<p><strong>How does subclassing maintain class exclusivity?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>I knew that question was going to come up. One of the core tenets of subclassing is that you can't change your original Elder Scrolls Online class. You have to have at least one skill line from your original class in there. If I'm a Templar, I can drop two of the skill lines, but I have to keep one of them. That allows us to retain some of that class identity. It still makes your class choice important, but you have this flexibility to really turn it into a hybrid of whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>How will you reintroduce the existing systems for Elder Scrolls Online players who come back after a while?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Susan Kath: </strong>The returning player stuff, the welcome-back stuff, is very near and dear to my heart because when joining the team here at ZOS, that is exactly what I was. I have played the game numerous times since launch. Coming in as a returning player, these two got earfuls from me in my first few months back where I was pinging them and going "Oh my God, I don't know how to do this and this is really frustrating to me." I'm really excited about this system. As a longtime MMO player, not just of Elder Scrolls Online, I've fallen in love with the games that I've played over the years and they all feel like home to me in some way or another. Coming back to a game, it's like slipping into a book that I'm familiar with. It is comforting and I would like to make it as easy as possible for people to come in. The answer to the actual question is that is part of what the whole welcome back experience is all about.</p>
<p>We've found numerous things, like Golden Pursuits, that have been a great way to bring people to content that they may not have experienced before that's happened since they've left and returned. That is just one of the ways that plays into that system. I think it's going to be really cool, and it's all based on the player as well.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Firor: </strong>That's actually a good point. All you have just seen was about all the new content that's coming up and some new systems, but we're still doing all the other stuff that we talked about over the course of the last 6 months, which is making the new user experience better, making the returning user experience better, etc. We redid the graphical look and feel of the starting islands in the last update, and we're continuing to do main game tutorial work.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any planned social features or improvements for guilds, such as exclusive cooperative content, internal events, or more robust management tools?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>How about I just say we have some things planned for guilds that we're not quite ready to talk about yet? But we understand this is a big thing for players.</p>
<p><strong>What was the primary objective of the UI rework?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt Firor: </strong>To make the game feel more modern. In 2014, on PC, it was a different world than it is now. We made our console UI in 2015 to be a little more forward-looking and less old-school MMO, so the work we're doing now is making the PC version and bringing that up to the same level. It's about making it cleaner, more intuitive, and just making it look and feel better.</p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>And also make it easier to maintain. It's a combination of things.</p>
<p><strong>The starter zones just got a facelift, like you mentioned. Are there any plans to enhance other visual aspects of Elder Scrolls Online, such as character hair?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt Firor: </strong>We have a list of things that we're enhancing. Everything that you're thinking about is on a list somewhere, but obviously, we can't do everything all at once. We have a cadence that we're trying to hit to make other zones in the game look better. We've already talked publicly about making combat look and feel more modern and better, which includes everything you're just talking about, except for possibly hair.</p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>We actually just introduced hair, too!</p>
<p><strong>Matt Firor: </strong>All of these things are on a list, and by going to a cadence that isn't locked into the calendar year, we get to do these things. That's the big message from us.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We have a list of things that we're enhancing. Everything that you're thinking about is on a list somewhere, but obviously, we can't do everything all at once.

<p><strong>What more can you tell us about the recent Cyrodiil Champions experiment and possible new PVP content?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>It was a phenomenal test for us, orders of magnitude better than I think a lot of us thought was going to happen. It really showed that that original vision that we wanted for this massive scale PVP, we can do it. Now, what we are doing is digging through the mountains of data, because there were some spikes, it wasn't all perfect. We are digging through the mountains of data and seeing where those problems were and what we can do to solve them, and then we're going to continue to roll out more tests.</p>
<p>The next one is probably going to happen sometime after Update 46. But the goal is to make incremental progress on this and continue to reintroduce more things, because what we did in the Cyrodiil Champions test was as bare bones as we could make it so we could really prove whether it was the ability system.</p>
<p><strong>Going to the Solstice zone, how does the size of Solstice compare to regions added in previous Chapters? Does the change in cadence mean there may be years with no region added at all?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>Maybe. It's comparable in size to your previous chapters; it's just split in half.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think really sets this season's new environments apart from what we've already seen?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>It's partly the mix. It's Argonian and High Elf, which just sounds weird but makes sense. It's also this tropical feel. Solstice is a tropical island mixed with some Cold Harbour and other fun stuff. It's just a different vibe and feel.</p>
<p><strong> Any further details about the new Trial?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>I always say this and people think I'm full of it, but the team always finds new ways to impress and push the boundaries of our technology. They've done some things. In particular, there is a fight where you have multiple bosses and you're moving around between platforms and just doing crazy cool things. Again, they one-upped themselves with this Trial, and I can't wait for people to jump in there and start playing with it.</p>

Again, they one-upped themselves with this Trial, and I can't wait for people to jump in there and start playing with it.' - Rich Lambert</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Are there plans to introduce new dungeons for four players?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>Quarter one and quarter three are the dungeon updates. It's four dungeons in total. We've already launched two this year with Fallen Banners, and the other pack is in the third quarter. I can't remember the name of what we called it, but there's two more dungeons on the way.</p>
<p><strong>Will subclassing be usable everywhere, such as Trials? How do you expect it to impact the build diversity?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>Yes, it's everywhere. It's part of the base Elder Scrolls Online game. The hope is that this opens the door for even more cool builds and definitely spreads out some of the current meta. I mean, it's going to break the current meta. It'll be really interesting to see what players come up with. The meta is something that we talk about a lot. It's really pushed by a certain number of players that this is the only way to do a thing, and that's not entirely true, but I think this is going to open up a lot more flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Will subclassing allow you to select skill lines or pick skill by skill?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>It is skill line wise, and then you can pick the skills within that skill line. You can't cherry-pick the best skills from each line.</p>
<p><strong>Will subclassing worsen the issue of hybrid changes and Scribing, undermining the distinct identities of the classes?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>There's going to be some of that naturally, just because you're going to be able to have multiple skill lines that aren't from your class. But that also very much fits the mold of what our game is, which is play whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Firor: </strong>It is what Elder Scrolls is all about: player freedom. We have to put some box around it; we're just making the box a little bigger with this.</p>
<p><strong>How will subclassing avoid the problem where everyone equips certain powerful abilities, such as Radiant Oppression? Players will be concerned about this.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>We're concerned about it as well. That goes back to the meta and shaping up the meta. In our internal and external tests, we have found that there's a huge amount of diversity in terms of builds and skills and whatnot. What some players think works and is the only way to do it isn't necessarily the right way.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned plans for new Elder Scrolls Online players who want to start their journey in a game that has been there for more than 10 years. Can you please explain this a bit more?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Susan Kath: </strong>We've already begun rolling out the first of the new player improvements since November. We did some more in this most recent update, refreshing the new player zones and really looking closely at the&nbsp;new player experience. We've put a lot of research into that, seeing where people were struggling to get into the game. Our plan is to continue to support that.</p>
<p>Again, as Matt said, this decision to move away from the Chapter model is so that we can return to things like this. We can make some changes and see if this makes the new player experience even better. We'll watch it for a while, come back, and make some more changes. That's not something&nbsp;that we've had the luxury of being able to do for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Firor: </strong>It's a ten-year-old game but still, millions of people play Elder Scrolls Online for the first time every year. We have so many new players that come in all the time. During the pandemic, we had so many people playing the game that we had to focus on server stability and making sure that the game was going to hold together. Now that we're getting into the back end of the swing of things, it's 'let's make this game as good as possible for new players and returning players.'</p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>The ultimate goal with the new player stuff is to make sure that players understand all the things that are in the game because there's a ton of stuff, and we don't do a particularly good job of surfacing all of those things.</p>
<p><strong>What's the future for companions and crafting? Will we see new recipes and companions each season or similar?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>I don't know about each season, but companions are pretty popular with our player base and so we will find ways to continue to build on that system.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Firor: </strong>If you think about companions, we've added new systems to the game since launch, at least one a year. Companions, the card game, the housing. These are all things that we can pull from when we're putting a new season together to make a really compelling season. That gives us a lot of flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Why is now the right time to continue the base game story?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt Firor: </strong>I was waiting for that question. Most of the questions here so far have been about systems, which is great because a lot of people play these games for character development, but Elder Scrolls Online is centered around storytelling and our storytelling is probably the best in the industry. We&nbsp;love what we do here and the main story of the game when it launched had unbelievable voice talent and really cool characters. We brought many of these characters back in different Chapters and in different situations, but we haven't actually told the next version of the story of what happened after the Planemeld didn't happen.</p>
<p>This is cool for us because we get to bring these characters back in the same way that they were in 2014 when the game launched. You're going to see a lot of familiar names and voice talent. It's just super fun and nostalgic for us to be able to go back and extend the story going forward. Just seeing Raz and Gabrielle, these people were part of our lives early on, because we tested this game internally for many, many years and we know these characters very well.</p>
<p><strong>Could you provide more information about the returning characters, especially about a specific necromancer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>No, that's a story spoiler! But hey, the Worm Cult's coming back. That should be a big enough thing.</p>
<p><strong>Will we have the opportunity to test everything that was mentioned on the Elder Scrolls Online PTS server? If so, is there any information on when that might be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rich Lambert: </strong>Next Monday.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> is looking to experiment in 2025, ranging from its new seasonal content model, a major server-wide event unlike anything in the game's history, and even the ability to mix and match abilities from different classes to create something entirely new.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer ZeniMax Online revealed what's coming in the year ahead for its long-running MMORPG at a recent ESO Direct. In it, studio director Matt Firor reiterated much of what he said in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-chapters-in-favor-of-more-frequent-bite-sized-updates/1100-6528526/">end-of-year blog post</a> from December. Unlike every year since 2017's Morrowind chapter, 2025 will not see the release of a new expansion, but will instead see the game shift to a seasonal content model that Firor said will allow it more freedom to experiment when it comes to releasing new content and addressing the needs of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want to keep telling great stories, but also mix in new ideas and gameplay systems, and that's exactly what we're going to do," Firor said. "But we'll do this in a different cadence, one that allows us, the developers, to broaden our focus and increase variety."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Seasons Of The Worm Cult</h2><p dir="ltr">ESO game director Rich Lambert and executive producer Susan Kath then dove into what all will be coming in place of a new chapter. The game's first season under this new format will be Seasons of the Worm Cult, one that will actually serve as a decade-later sequel to the game's original Molag Bal storyline and will kick off in June. It will introduce a new zone, the isle of Solstice, where players will investigate the resurgence of Bal's Worm Cult and meet familiar faces from the game's first main quest along the way. The zone is home to outcast elves and Argonians, with Carribean-esque beaches and tropical forests for players to explore.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4473776-esosolsticebeach.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473776" data-ratio="0.56253443526171" data-width="1815" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4473776-esosolsticebeach.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473776"></a><figcaption>The new Solstice zone sits off Tamriel's southern coast.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4473776-esosolsticebeach.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Though Seasons of the Worm Cult will last most of the year, Kath made clear that might not be the case for future seasons. In the years ahead, seasons could be shorter, ranging from three to six months. Those may take the form of "remix" seasons where ZeniMax Online revisits old storylines, with the developer teasing a Dark Brotherhood-themed season.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of purchasing a new chapter, players will instead be able to purchase a $50 content pass that will include all of the year's upcoming seasonal updates, including new dungeons. The content pass will be separate from ESO's existing ESO Plus subscription, though all of Season of the Worm Cult's new dungeons will be included as part of ESO Plus. During a post-ESO Direct press Q&amp;A attended by GameSpot, Kath said the team was looking at ways to further add to and incentivize ESO Plus but did not announce any specifics.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Subclasses</h2><p dir="ltr">News that subclassing will be coming to ESO for all players in June is likely the biggest announcement. Regardless of which of the game's seven classes a player originally picked, they'll be able to select abilities from up to two skill lines from other classes to experiment with, with over 3,000 unique skill line combinations.</p><p dir="ltr">The ESO Direct and subsequent Q&amp;A didn't dive into many details, but ZeniMax Online did confirm players will need to keep at least one skill line from their original class. While one character can learn all the available non-main class skill lines, they'll only be able to actively use abilities from two other class skill lines at a time. The feature will unlock at the game's max level of 50, and unlocking subclass skill lines will be account-wide across all characters. Some class skill lines will cost double the amount of skill points, though Lambert said he doesn't think that will be a problem for the game's dedicated players.</p><h2 dir="ltr">New Experiments</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4473777-esosolsticewrithingwall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473777" data-ratio="0.56262626262626" data-width="1980" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4473777-esosolsticewrithingwall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473777"></a><figcaption>A massive magical barrier, the Writhing Wall, divides the new Solstice zone in half.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4473777-esosolsticewrithingwall.jpg"></figure><p>Aside from subclassing, ZeniMax Online is experimenting in other ways as well. The new Solstice zone will be divided in half by a massive magical barrier called the Writhing Wall, an obstacle that will see players later in the summer participate in a server-wide event that will be the first of its kind in ESO. Players on each server will need to come together to gather resources, defend the island from the Worm Cult, and eventually breach the wall, in the process unlocking the second half of the zone. From how it was described, it sounds similar to something like vanilla World of Warcraft's iconic Gates of Ahn'Qiraj event, where players contributed to a war effort in order to unlock the gates and access two new raids. Lambert said breaching the wall will be a one-time event per server but that there will be ways to experience most of the event for those who miss out.</p><p dir="ltr">"The goal will be to work together with fellow players to breach the wall from the West and gain access to the Eastern half of Solstice," Lambert said. "Your mega-server's collective effort and activity is really going to dictate how fast that server will progress through the phases, which ultimately means players are going to experience the epic final encounter and outcome of the event at different times."</p><p dir="ltr">One major experiment ZeniMax Online has already conducted is the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-onlines-longest-running-issue-is-the-target-of-a-new-play-test-but-its-just-a-first-step/1100-6530226/">Cyrodiil Champions test</a>, which was briefly mentioned during the ESO Direct. It's the studio's answer to performance problems that have long plagued the game's large-scale PvP mode and something that Firor specifically called out as needing to be addressed in his end-of-year blog post. The test, which ran March 24-31, vastly simplified abilities and stats for all players in Cyrodiil in the name of significantly improving performance. In the Q&amp;A, Firor said the test was a huge success and surpassed its goal of being able to support the number of players in Cyrodiil seen shortly after the game's launch in 2014.</p><p dir="ltr">"It couldn't have gone much better," Firor said. "It was beyond-our-wildest-dreams successful."</p><p dir="ltr">Lambert said the next step is to dig through the "mountains of data" from the test. Then, the team will begin to add more changes like additional skill lines and stats before running more tests, slowly working towards turning Cyrodiil Champions into a full-fledged feature.</p><p dir="ltr">ZeniMax Online is also putting an emphasis on catering to new and returning players. As spotlighted in the ESO Direct, updates have already been made to the game's tutorial and starter zones, and the team will continue to look at making the returning player experience better with a "Welcome Back" system set to debut this summer. Kath declined to go into detail on what such a system would entail during the Q&amp;A but said it wasn't a "one-size-fits-all" approach and that it would be a "quest-based, reward-driven experience."</p><p dir="ltr">ESO celebrated its 10-year anniversary last year, and Firor said the game will continue to evolve in the years to come, now with a new format that will allow the team to improve aspects of the game it couldn't find time for on its old yearly chapter schedule.</p><p dir="ltr">"We just didn't have time to do all those little things," Firor said. "This lets us open the development schedule and do lots of cool little things as well as continue to work on content."</p>

                <p>Outbound, an indie open-world camper simulator where players live off the grid in their van, is getting a closed alpha on April 14.</p><p>A new trailer for the cozy survival-crafting game was shown as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/triple-i-initiative-2025-everything-announced-at-the-showcase/2900-6460/" data-ref-id="2900-6460">2025 Triple-I Initiative showcase</a>.

Starting on April 14, random subscribers will be selected to join the playtest.</p><p dir="ltr">"The closed alpha is an early build of the game and we want to test mechanics and overall stability with a limited number of players," the developer, Square Glade Games, stated in a post on Steam. "With a little bit of luck, you can also join!"</p><p dir="ltr">While Square Glade Games says most of the game's features--including cooking, vehicle and player upgrades, environmental puzzles, collectables, and more--are part of the alpha, there are still more features currently in the works. Those features, which are slated to ship as part of the game's launch, including fishing, bee-keeping, more biomes, additional character customization options, a dog companion, and full controller support.</p><p dir="ltr">Outbound players start with an empty camper van powered by renewable energy and a dream.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/katana-zero-dlc-still-coming-itll-still-be-free-and-itll-be-almost-as-big-as-the-original-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Six years after its original release, Katana Zero remains one of the best 2D hack-and-slash one-hit-kill games on any platform. Its tightly executed gameplay and mysterious story make it extremely repayable, along with the speedrunning mode that was added to the game post-launch.</p>
<p>The DLC that developer Askiisoft announced shortly after the game's launch in 2019 has yet to come. However, during today's Triple-I Initiative Showcase, we finally got a glimpse at the DLC, along with the announcement that it'll be "<em>coming soon</em>."</p>
<p>Askiisoft also confirmed that the DLC will still be free for players who already own Katana Zero. Just as exciting is the confirmation that every new addition the DLC brings will add up to this expansion being about "<em>the size of the original game</em>."</p>
<p>The DLC will feature new characters, levels, and gameplay mechanics, and developer Askiisoft assures players in a press release that when it does arrive, this DLC will have been "<em>worth the wait.</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Katana ZERO - Free DLC Trailer | The Triple-i Initiative" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qMyziPJY_aw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fans of Katana Zero have been waiting for answers about the base game's story, which this DLC promises to include. Understandably, Askiisoft is hesitant to provide any story insights ahead of the DLC's release. What we do know is that this DLC will pick up right where Zero's story left off in the base game, and as we see in the trailer, we'll also get a better glimpse into his past.</p>
<p>This DLC reveal was the 'one more thing' at the end of the Triple-I Initiative Showcase, which shows just how much pent-up excitement exists for the next chapter of Katana Zero's story. It's definitely still upsetting that we don't even have a release window yet, but the fact that we have an update after years of silence has definitely rekindled fans excitement, and removed any doubt that the DLC had died somewhere along the way in the last six years.</p>

            <p>
There's a whole bunch of games set in space that let you duke it out in dogfights, form strategies around entire fleets, terraform planets, all often pretty violent acts. So, I found it very funny to see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/x4-foundations">X4: Foundations</a> at the Triple-I showcase today, which received a trailer for its upcoming Diplomacy update which is literally about just talking things out. Seriously, when it says that it's introducing diplomacy it means it, as when it arrives you'll be able to send diplomats to negotiate and forge alliances so that you don't have to jump to war right off the bat.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's a new facility, the Embassy, that you'll be able to send said diplomats to chat with other factions. On top of that there's Agents, who can "be deployed on independent assignments to achieve diplomatic objectives within the X universe." Details about the update are pretty slim outside of that, the trailer didn't give all that much away, not even a release date outside of the fact it's coming in 2025. The update will be free at the very least! Not bad for a game that'll be seven years old this November.

<p>
From an outsider's POV, it does also tickle me that this game is so old yet in a game about building a space empire, trading, fighting, all that jazz you'd expect from a sci-fi game of its ilk, the game's inhabitants never thought to just talk to each other. Oh well! Better late than never.
</p>
<p>
It's probably worth pointing out that X4: Foundations is actually on sale right now, as it's only £12/ $15 down from £40/ $50. You've got until April 16th to get it at that price, no need to rush, but it might be good to get it now ahead of this upcoming update if it takes your fancy.

The event puts the spotlight on smaller projects ahead of Summer Game Fest season and returned this year with updates on a whopping 36 games, including world premieres for a few that look really cool. </p><p>There was news about 2019 action platforming hit <em>Katana Zero</em> and its long-promised DLC, as well as brand new reveals for upcoming releases. There was <em>Void/Breaker</em>, a frenetic roguelike cyberpunk FPS from Stubby Games that looks like it builds off of some of the ideas in the team’s 2022 FPS puzzle adventure<em> The Entropy Centre</em>. There was also <em>Frostrail</em>, a post-apocalyptic survival crafting shooter from Shiro Unlimited and FakeFish. Another one of those? Yes, but this one revolves around a train that serves as your home base, transportation, and salvation from the cold and the “horrifying abominations” hiding in it.</p><p>The most surprising announcement for me personally was the latest free DLC for <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. While the bullet hell roguelite getting more content is nothing new, this update is a crossover with Square Enix’s lesser known<em> SaGa</em> franchise. Out now, the DLC drops<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/saga-emerald-beyond&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/saga-emerald-beyond"> <em>SaGa Emerald Beyond</em></a></span>’s characters into the game’s chaotic arcade adventure. What franchise collab should be next? I’m still holding out for <em>Mega Man</em>. You can watch the full showcase below or scroll through for a look at everything else announced during the 2025 Triple-i Initiative showcase. </p></div></div><div><p>Real ones know and have been waiting almost five years for a glimpse of what was once likened to <em>Katana Zero 1.5</em>. With “all new characters, levels, gameplay and story,” this “massive” DLC still doesn’t have a release date but sounds oh so close. </p></div><div><p>The high-speed shooter is coming later this year and offers weapon crafting, gun modding, and environmental destruction. An open playtest is currently running on Steam through April 24. </p></div><div><p>The first-person shooter is all about open-world survival crafting to upgrade the train that’s keeping you and your friends alive. It hits Early Access for PC in 2026.</p></div><div><p>11 Bit Studios’ latest project is about a space mission worker named Jan Dolski who must create alternate versions of himself with unique skills but shared memories in order to survive. It now has a release date of June 13, 2025.</p></div><div><p>A nightmarish life sim, <em>Neverway</em> features the work of <em>Celeste </em>and<em> TowerFall</em>’s pixel artist and the music of Disasterpeace who composed the mesmerizing soundscapes for both <em>Fez </em>and <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em>.  That’s it. That’s all I needed to know. </p></div><div><p> If you guessed that <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</em> would feature the mining horde mode shooter’s mechanics with new run-based roguelike elements, you’d be correct. Players can sign up for a Closed Alpha happening now. </p></div><div><p>One of the better <em>Vampire Survivors</em> copycats now has a 1.0 launch date. After winning fans over in Early Access, the full version is coming out September 17, 2025. </p></div><div><p>The twee van-life sim about crafting and sustainability will feature a closed alpha on April 14. Upgrade your vehicle, grow crops, and explore a beautiful alternate world where hope still abounds. </p></div><div><p><em>SpeedRunners 2: King of Speed</em> was announced with a release window of 2025 for PC and 2026 for console. The <em>Nickelodeon All-Stars Brawl</em> team is making it, and for anyone unfamiliar with the original, the hook is the game’s 8-player platforming races with a battle royale-like “ever-shrinking ring of fire.”</p></div><div><p> A workshop apprentice goes on an adventure. Many 3D action-platformer hijinks ensue. Will there be collectibles in this modern re-imagining of a retro throwback? Players can find out when it hits PC and console in 2026. <br></p></div><div><p> Control cabin boy Sam and loyal husky Ellie in solo or co-op to explore an uncharted island and uncover a bleak mystery. Who’s ready to cry?!</p></div><div><p> But what is it exactly? I’ll let the devs explain. According to them, <em>Into the Fire</em> is “a disaster extraction survival with arcade elements.” Neat! Players can face volcanic demons in Dante’s Archipelago in Early Access later this year. </p></div><div><p>Arcade medieval army brawler<em> Tears of Metal </em>has a great art style and some really rad-looking combat. You can try the hack-and-slash roguelike online with friends in the current Steam beta running until April 17. </p></div><div><p><em> Vampire Survivors: Emerald Diorama</em> is the hit arcade roguelite’s latest free update featuring a cross over with Square Enix. It’s out on every platform right now. </p></div><div><p> The long-awaited strategy follow-up now has an Early Access launch window of summer 2025. I can’t wait. </p></div><div><p> Interstellar politics is about to get more complicated. A free summer update for<em> X4: Foundations </em>will add new strategic elements for alliance building, including sending agents out on missions to influence partners and rivals.</p></div><div><p> The escape room game lets you solve puzzles in Dracula’s castle or deep space starships. Players can go hands-on with the sequel now on Steam. </p></div><div><p><em>Rematch</em> is like <em>Rocket League </em>but with actual people playing actual soccer. Small teams play offense and defense on no out of bounds fields and perform over the top moves to score and tackle. It launches Junes 19, will be on Game Pass, and has a closed beta test the weekend of April 12. </p></div><div><p> You’re stuck in a gross prison cell. Pay off your debt with nothing but an ATM and a slot machine. It’s coming to Steam later this year and also has a free demo available to try now. </p></div><div><p> The action-roguelike spin-off is getting a couch co-op mode for two players and content from <em>Dead Cells</em> sometime this summer. </p></div><div><p> The survival crafting Soulslike is getting a new Thralls of Twilight update in May as it continues its Early Access journey. </p></div><div><p><em> Olden Era</em> is a new entry in the beloved  turn-based strategy series.
