            <p>It’s been a good while since we last got a proper Transformers video game, with the four years since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xcom-enemy-unknown">XCOM</a>-ish Transformers: Battlegrounds in 2020 only seeing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/transformers-online">long-in-the-works</a> MMO Transformers Online finally biting the dust. That’s about to change, with the reveal of a curious new combination of racer and roguelike starring the robots in disguise.</p>

<p>Transformers: Galactic Trials somehow marks the first time the vehicular bots have featured in a racing game, though as you might expect from a franchise known for switching between forms it’s not quite a pure driving experience, either.</p>
<p>Instead, developers 3DClouds are billing the game as a mixture of traditional racing game and action-RPG  as the vehicular robots speed around tracks before shifting into their bot forms to fight through groups of enemies standing in the way of the finish line. There’ll apparently be roguelike progression in the form of Prime relics to collect to level up certain skills, while also unlocking extra characters - both Autobots and Decepticons - and skins for said characters.</p>

<p>Galactic Trials will launch with two modes: a titular single-player mode working through the 10 included levels and an Arcade offering with two-player local multiplayer in quick races, with the option to customise the available tracks, weapons and characters. “Location-based specialised tournaments” will also be a thing, though I’m honestly not sure how that translates to just two players being able to play in the same room - this might just be a word-salad way of saying that you can create bracket-based tournaments for bigger groups, perhaps.</p>
<p>2024 is apparently the Transformers series’ 40th anniversary, with Galactic Trials arriving on October 11th. After a relative drought of Transformers video games, there’s a chance we’ll see more of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-tactics-studio-splash-damage-are-making-a-transformers-action-game">Splash Damage’s co-op shooter Transformers: Reactivate</a>, too, after its planned closed beta slipped out of last year.</p>

It was an open-world action game starring Aiden Pierce, a vigilante “grey hat” hacker in Chicago who uses his phone and tech expertise to hack the city’s infrastructure, cameras, and other electronic gadgets. While the first game would end up being pretty successful and spawned a franchise, Ubisoft was betting big on <em>Watch Dogs</em> before it even launched, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/watch-dogs-isnt-out-yet-but-theres-a-movie-in-the-wo-1172993658&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/watch-dogs-isnt-out-yet-but-theres-a-movie-in-the-wo-1172993658">announcing a film based on the game in August 2013</a></span>. And now, it’s finally, actually, for real being made. <br></p><p>On July 3, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1808540050046484836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1808540050046484836" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official Ubisoft account on Twitter shared</a></span> a photo of a clapper board on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6GCLknCe27aNmvECtOkIK7/watch-dogs-movie-starts-production-this-summer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6GCLknCe27aNmvECtOkIK7/watch-dogs-movie-starts-production-this-summer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set of the live-action <em>Watch Dogs</em> film</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-executive-producer-addresses-spiderbot-concerns/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When  XDefiant released its major patch for Season 1, it ended up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/op-xdefiant-ability-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making one of its abilities</a> — spiderbot — even more powerful. It’s led to a lot of discourse online about why it was done and if/when it should be fixed.</p>



<p>The conversation has gotten so loud that even executive producer Mark Rubin has <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1808511436173529112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">taken to Twitter</a> to address players.</p>



<p>In his post, Rubin explained that what players were able to do against the spiderbot when XDefiant first launched wasn’t actually supposed to be allowed. It was a bug that ultimately got fixed with Season 1, taking away a defense against them. </p>



<p>“[T]here was also a bug in that meleeing them was way harder than it was supposed to be,” he said. “So we wanted to keep the bug of shooting them off your own face in the game until we fixed other spiderbot issues.”</p>



<p>Rubin added that taking away a “important counter” was unintentional, and that it will be reverted as part of the game’s next “non-emergency patch”. The reversion will return the ability to shoot them off by shooting at your feet. </p>



<p>“The other changes to spiderbot will remain. i.e. longer cooldown, etc.,” he said.</p>



<hr>



<p>You can read his full statement below:</p>



<p><em>“OK now that we’ve gotten through the patch and Ranked is now live, I want to talk about the Spiderbots.</em></p>



<p><em>“So when the game launched there was a bug that you could shoot down at your feet and destroy the spiderbot. This was not intended. However, there was also a bug in that meleeing them was way harder than it was supposed to be. So we wanted to keep the bug of shooting them off your own face in the game until we fixed other spiderbot issues.</em></p>



<p><em>“However, the bug fix got integrated into the Season 1 patch and so an important counter was removed unintentionally. We are reverting that fix in the next non-emergency patch. So you will again be able to shoot them off your own face by shooting at your feet. The other changes to spiderbot will remain. i.e. longer cooldown, etc. </em></p>



<p><em>“For the future, we are going to change the way spiderbot works so that there is a easier and clearer way to get them off you own face. But until then the bug where you can shoot them off your own face will remain. </em></p>



<p><em>“And we will continue to find other ways to balance all of the abilities over time.”</em></p>

<p>Sukeban Games acknowledge the influence of Parasite Eve - which emerged from a  collaboration between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy series</a> creator Hironobu Sakaguchi and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> director Takashi Tokita, among other JRPG veterans - as a key foundation for the upcoming game, but insist “that’s about where comparisons end” without giving any further details for now. Still, the clips of combat in <a href="https://sukeban.moe/index.php/2024/07/03/parabellum/">the announcement post</a> definitely recall both the look and vibe of the 1998 Square Enix gem, with the player character’s action bar needing to fill as they freely run around and evade before pausing to select an action and target in a polygonal target zone.</p>
<p>That player character is ex-merc Reila Mikazuchi, who takes a last chance at returning to her mercenary ways before having things complicated by the realisation that “the real enemy isn’t in front of her gun”. Reila will be able to explore the game’s world across a set of seven chapters and various moody environments (with secrets hidden around), running into “hand-placed encounters” rather than random battles. Each level will also conclude with a boss battle, in classic RPG fashion.</p>
<p>Sukeban said that the game has been in the works for around two years - discounting a few ditched variations before that - with .45 Parabellum Bloodhound aiming for more of “a uniquely ‘Sukeban’ experience” in comparison to the many references and pastiches in VA-11 Hall-A. (The explicit Parasite Eve gameplay root aside.)</p>

</figure>
<p>The devs are yet to put even a rough release date on the game, citing a desire to “not repeat a N1rvannA situation” - a brief update on the VA-11 Hall-A sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valhalla-sequel-nirvanna-announced">announced back in 2018</a> expresses that the studio are all-in on .45 Parabellum Bloodhound for the foreseeable, which is “significantly ahead in development” and now taking the devs’ full attention.</p>
<p>“I was actually gonna wait until we had the entire game built before announcing it Officially, but selling games has become much harder. It’s not 2016 anymore, so if we want this game to have a chance we gotta start now and hoard those wishlists and shit,” Sukeban wrote, before giving a release expectation of: “In short: When It’s Done.”</p>
<p>As someone who came late to Parasite Eve, only actually playing it in the last few years as I filled out my endless to-do list of cult classics and nineties gems, it still holds up extremely well in terms of combat and atmosphere. Still, parts have undoubtedly aged, and it’s surprising that few games - aside from its own sequels - have taken its excellent battle system as a leaping-off point for a modern successor. From this early tease, .45 Parabellum Bloodhound looks like a very promising way to carry the torch, from its stylistically low-res textures and low camera angles to the cyberpunk text treatment and vivid colours of your status bars. Count me in.</p>

<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations launches in October, and it appears the character teases aren’t done yet from Sega. </p>



<p>“The Japanese [Sonic X Shadow Generations] site showcases both sides of the game, interestingly teasing that another character may be playable (?) in Shadow Generations,” Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/TailsChannel/status/1808521435922514220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TailsChannel posted</a>. </p>

<p>The character tease appears on the Shadow side of the of the landing page while the Sonic page has both the modern and classic Sonic designs. The Shadow side of the website shows Shadow the Hedgehog with a blank box with the text “Coming Soon”.  Based on screenshots from the game, Metal Sonic will be in the game, but it’s unknown if there are plans to make him a playable character or just an NPC enemy. Nevertheless, there is plenty of speculation on the matter happening on social media.</p>



<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations launches on October 25 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and PC. The game features a brand-new story campaign for Shadow along with “iconic 2D and 3D stages” from past Sonic games.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/goddess-of-victory-nikke-announces-collaboration-event-with-dave-the-diver<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The third-person sci-fi shooter Goddess of Victory: Nikke is teaming up with Dave the Diver for a collaborative event. The event launches with the summer update on July 4, and perfect for summertime, it adds a brand-new minigame set underwater that combines the gameplay of Dave the Diver with the characters of Nikke.</p><p>If you haven’t had the chance to check out Goddess of Victory: Nikke yet, it’s a free-to-play RPG available on iOS, Android, and PC. You play as a commander leading a squad of soldiers called Nikkes into battle against alien invaders. You can switch between Nikkes to fire their respective guns or use their unique abilities to complete missions in an effort to take back Earth.</p><p>Nikke’s latest collab is with Dave the Diver, an action-adventure game that has you spend your days diving into an ever-changing body of water and using a harpoon gun to catch fish of varying types and sizes. You then spend your nights working at a local sushi restaurant, where you determine the menu based on what fish you caught.</p><p>To celebrate their new collaboration, Yoo HyungSuk — Director of Goddess of Victory: Nikke — and Jaeho Hwang — Director of Dave The Diver — answered some questions about what brought them together, their plans for the future, and more.</p><h3><strong>Can you share the story behind Nikke’s collaboration with Dave the Diver? How did this opportunity arise?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Nikke and Dave the Diver are both games developed in Korea. We happened to discuss a collaboration because our Nikke team generally loves creative games, and naturally, we also enjoyed playing Dave the Diver. Additionally, Dave the Diver combines casual management gameplay with its diving mechanics, making it an excellent fusion of different gameplay styles. Nikke has also continuously tried to bring new experiences to players through various types of casual minigames in different versions, including a survival minigame for its first anniversary and a tower defense minigame for its 1.5-year anniversary. We hope to bring players different experiences by collaborating with Dave the Diver and learning from their expertise. So we're honored to have this collaboration project.</p><h3><strong>Were your team members familiar with Nikke before the collaboration?</strong></h3><p><strong>Jaeho Hwang:</strong> Many of us in the team are players of Nikke, so when we received the collaboration proposal, it's fair to say we felt both anticipation and concern. This is because the platforms and art styles of the two games are quite different. Previously, Nikke collaborations have mainly focused on storytelling and characters, but we were curious about how this collaboration could integrate Dave’s gameplay into Nikke.</p><p>However, after receiving the test build, we saw that the Nikke development team had blended Dave and Nikke very well, creating a wonderful synergy between the two games. We are deeply grateful for this and are even more excited about this collaboration event.</p><h3><strong>What is the idea behind each collaboration with Nikke?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Our goal is to maximize the enjoyment of the collaborative IP as much as possible. While we are creators of these games and cultural content, we are first and foremost users of games and cultural content. We respect the works we collaborate with and hope that through Nikke, you can once again experience the intentions and fun of the original work. We look forward to more diverse and exciting collaboration opportunities in the future.</p><h3><strong>Will there be any special events or activities in Dave the Diver to complement this collaboration?</strong></h3><p><strong>Jaeho Hwang</strong>: Of course, we plan to bring Nikke-themed boat skin into Dave The Diver. Please look forward to it!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>What gameplay or characteristic elements are expected to be included that can bring players a new experience?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Since it is a collaboration between the two games, you'll be able to see scenes featuring both Dave the Diver and the Nikke characters together. Additionally, diving as a Nikke character instead of Dave will offer a different kind of fun. We incorporated the fishing and sushi restaurant operation gameplay of Dave the Diver into Nikke, designing a brand-new minigame that combines the characteristics of Nikke characters and weapons. We hope this will surprise and delight players.</p><h3><strong>How would you evaluate the special edition Diver Nikke (Mast, Anchor, Helm) released by Nikke?</strong></h3><p><strong>Jaeho Hwang: </strong>Dave the Diver doesn't have many female characters, so we're delighted to see the charming  female diver characters in Nikke. In particular, the team responded very well to Mast's outfit. It turns out that a wetsuit can be both cute and sexy! Who knows, maybe Duff will end up liking Nikke's characters more than Leahs!</p><h3><strong>What were some of the biggest challenges you encountered during the game's development, particularly with the Dave the Diver crossover?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> We put in a lot of effort to present Dave the Diver in the world of Nikke faithfully. Nikke is available on both PC and mobile platforms, so it was challenging and rewarding at the same time to produce an enjoyable Dave the Diver experience on mobile platforms as well.</p><h3><strong>Given the distinct styles of Nikke and Dave the Diver, how did you manage to merge them seamlessly?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> The gameplay of Nikke and Dave the Diver may seem significantly different from each other, but they are in fact similar in some ways. For example, both games feature shooting elements to some extent. This time, we have combined Dave's underwater weapons with the unique characteristics of Nikke characters' weapons, allowing players to experience a differentiated diving and fishing experience by operating different Nikkes. In terms of art style, we retained the original style of Dave the Diver, aiming to provide a visual experience that is different from Nikke.</p><h3><strong>Can you talk about your design ideas for the minigame of this collaboration?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Dave's game content is vast and rich, while Nikke's minigames lean toward providing a lightweight experience. Therefore, the challenge in the design process was how to simplify the framework while retaining the essence of the original gameplay, and at the same time, incorporate Nikke's unique elements. We hope the outcome can bring you enjoyment and a different gaming experience from before.</p><h3><strong>What else can Nikke players expect from this collaboration?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> In the collaborative minigame, you can catch various kinds of fish. Separately, you can enjoy a fishing minigame in the Nikke event field. We believe many of you may find it fun to compare the types of fish you can catch in each minigame.</p><h3><strong>What considerations led to incorporating the new minigame into Nikke?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Although Goddess of Victory: Nikke is based on arcade shooting gameplay, we've always strived to offer various fun elements beyond that, including storylines, character collection and growth, decoration, puzzle games, explorations, and co-op mode. Therefore, we have developed many different types of minigames to provide all Commanders with a richer and more diversified experience.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/26/1-5-year-anniversary-minigame-1719423237550.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>How does this collaboration and minigame compare to what you’ve done in the past?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> The minigames we have developed so far have been fast-paced, light-weighted ones (e.g. grilling skewers), while Dave the Diver is actually a larger-scale game with more comprehensive gameplay. In this collaboration, we have integrated the settings of both games so that you can fully enjoy the fun of Dave the Diver in Nikke. Besides, we will strive to cover more diverse and exciting genres in the Nikke minigames.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/02/kv2-1719937718536.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>What are your thoughts on how this collaboration aligns with the summer event's theme?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> While collaborating with Dave the Diver, we will also launch Nikke's summer event — Beauty Full Shot. The event's storyline revolves around the player (commander) and several Nikkes spending their vacation at the seaside. We've prepared a variety of activities that allow you to fully enjoy your summer vacation both at the seaside and underwater. We hope everyone can have a refreshing summer together with Dave the Diver and Nikke.</p><h3><strong>What kind of collaborations do you foresee in the future?</strong></h3><p><strong>Yoo HyungSuk:</strong> Nikke has already engaged in various forms of collaborations and will continue to do so in the future. Especially, there is an unannounced collaboration plan for this year. Stay tuned for more updates!</p><h3><strong>Dave the Diver recently celebrated its anniversary. Could you tell us about the key activities and significant plans you have for the future of Dave the Diver?</strong></h3><p><strong>Jaeho Hwang:</strong> The new story of Dave the Diver will be released in the form of a DLC. We are working hard to develop it and will strive to release relevant information as soon as possible. Additionally, because many players like the characters in Dave, we are internally discussing the possibility of showing more of the stories of each character in the game. Please stay tuned!</p><p>The Goddess of Victory: Nikke and Dave the Diver collaboration will run in July and features a new story and new art for your favorite characters. You can download Nikke on the official site, on the App Store, or Google Play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blumhouse-games-james-wan-m3gan-indie-horror<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blumhouse-games-reveals-first-project-revealed-summer-games-fest">Blumhouse Games revealed its first six projects last month</a>, some familiar names were noticeably absent. Well known in Hollywood for breakout successes like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/23/get-out-review-2">Get Out</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/m3gan-review">M3GAN</a>, Blumhouse Games shied away from leaning on established properties with its new indie label at the jump... But that doesn't mean they're off the table.</p><p>"Certainly we will [incorporate established IP] eventually," Blumhouse Games president Zach Wood tells IGN in an interview following June's reveal. "So much of that I think comes down to the right timing. It's the right idea, it's the right creative partner, it's what else is happening with that IP in the world because we want to do it right, and we know that fans are going to come with their own expectations of what those games should be. We just want to do right by fans and the creators of those film properties. We're just being careful about it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Instead, Blumhouse Games is choosing to approach games as it has approached Hollywood: with a spirit of experimentation. The games it has signed so far run the gamut from well-known names (<a href="https://www.ign.com/games/project-c-sam-barlow-game">Project C</a>, from Her Story developer Sam Barlow and Infinity Pool director Brandon Cronenberg) to existing releases that Blumhouse Games intends to release on console (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fear-the-spotlight-presented-a-spooky-charming-retro-adventure">Fear the Spotlight</a>). </p><p>Other games include a horrific farming sim called <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grave-seasons">Grave Seasons</a>; a twisted folk tale called <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/crisol-theater-of-idols">Crisol Theater of Idols</a>; a horror game within a horror game called <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-simulation">The Simulation</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/sleep-awake">Sleep Awake</a>, a new game from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/26/spec-ops-the-line-review">Spec Ops: The Line</a> developers Cory Davis and Nine Inch Nails' Robin Finck. </p><h2>From horror movies to horror games</h2><p>First announced in 2023, Blumhouse Games is a logical extension of the studio's famous brand of horror. Wood came to Blumhouse Games after a long career spent producing games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/08/sound-shapes-review">Sound Shapes</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-unfinished-swan">The Unfinished Swan</a>, and now leads a team of around seven people. Assisting Wood is some of Blumhouse's Hollywood talent, with prolific horror producer James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring Universe, Insidious) — himself a big gamer — among those consulting on the pitches following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blumhouse-and-atomic-monster-complete-merger">Blumhouse's merger with his production company, Atomic Monster</a>. </p><p>"We meet fairly regularly and show him pitches that we receive, progress on games that are in development and get his feedback. But there's opportunity for more collaborations like Sam and Brandon Cronenberg. Certainly from a writing perspective, there's a stable of writers and directors that are big fans of games," Wood says. </p><p>"I think some of that too is just doing it the right way. It's real collaborations that bring value to elevating a really cool creative work that you couldn't normally achieve otherwise, versus just pairing with someone to put their name on a piece of key art or in a press release. There's an authenticity to it that's really important to us where we think we can really create some really exciting, fruitful collaborations."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The 12 Best Horror Games on PC</h3></div></output><p>The new Blumhouse initiative comes right as Hollywood is becoming more invested in video game adaptations, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-review">Blumhouse's take on Five Nights at Freddy's</a> among those proving to be a hit. In such an environment, Blumhouse Games would seem to be an ideal incubator for new ideas, and Wood acknowledges that Blumhouse is open to turning the games that prove to be especially successful into one of its signature horror movies, though he's not necessarily looking to spin up a new transmedia franchise.</p><p>"I guess what I would say is also just that it is coming from a real organic place with us," Wood says. "We don't think about it as our primary intent to extend game worlds through film and television, but we want to do it when the games resonate with the gaming audience and we think there are interesting stories to tell in those worlds. That's the exciting part."</p><p>Creative lead Louise Blaine adds, "Exploring those worlds in different ways, I think that's what is really exciting about when content does its transmedia thing and goes from game to film. I think people don't automatically want just a version of what they played, that never works. People want to experience those characters or even just the world or a spinoff of that world. I think there's really rich potential there, and I think as long as it's an authentic exploration that is story first, then it's a great thing."</p><p>Is there a world in which Blumhouse Games could work with Five Nights at Freddy's creator Scott Cawthon on publishing a new game?</p><p>"I think that's Scott's world, right? Certainly if Scott would reach out and want to collaborate on a game, I think that'd be exciting, but it's really Scott's world," Wood says.</p><h2>Scaring a decade's worth of people</h2><p>In the short-term and medium term, Wood stresses that Blumhouse Games is just trying to build a sustainable indie horror label in what has been an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-never-seen-it-this-bad-game-developers-explain-the-huge-layoffs-hitting-riot-epic-and-more">especially fraught year for games</a>. Private Division, which recently shuttered two studios and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division">may be on the verge of folding entirely</a>, could be considered a cautionary tale for Blumhouse Games.</p><p>"I think just for us, it's being conservative and being careful about growth and being careful about spend and being very methodical about how we look at our portfolio," Wood says. "As sales of our games increase and there's more desire for more games, then we will then increase the number of games per year that we release."</p><p>That largely precludes any studio acquisitions, though Wood says he's not taking anything off the table. The first potential area of growth, he says, would be releasing more games per year. In the meantime, if any developers want to pitch a M3GAN game of their own, Wood and Blaine say they would be more than happy to listen.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If we scare a decade's worth of people, that would be great</p></div><p>"It's all about that authenticity of that experience," Blaine says. "Because we love those IPs so much, I think it would be about finding the right fit for the right game for the right IP, and putting those together. That's exactly what we want; it's that love and everything to transfer because what people want is that authenticity of a linked product, whether that's a film of a game property or a game of a film property. It works both ways."</p><p>Blumhouse Games' first official release is Fear the Spotlight, which will launch on PS4, PS5, Switch, and Xbox Series X|S later this year with additional content. After that, Blumhouse Games is planning to release three more games in 2025, and three more after that in 2026. Beyond that, Blumhouse Games's main ambition is apparently to simply survive — a noble goal whether you're in the games industry or a horror movie.</p><p>"If we scare a decade's worth of people," Blaine finishes, "that would be great."</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

                <p>Out of the dozens of possible mods in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a>, there are a handful that can be ridden as a mount. However, there are some misconceptions when it comes to the process of acquiring a saddle in Minecraft. In the guide below, you can see all the possible ways to obtain a saddle and how to use it to ride mounts around the world.</p><h2>How to make a Saddle in Minecraft</h2><p>Let's start with the biggest misconception concerning saddles. Unfortunately, it is not possible to craft any kind of saddle in Minecraft. No matter what materials you find and combine together, none of them will make a saddle. This has always been slightly confusing to the player base, as you'd think that a combination of leather and some other materials would be enough to craft the item.</p><p>Now that we know it's impossible to make a saddle in Minecraft, let's go over all the actual ways to obtain one.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328319-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.02-23.55.05.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328319" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328319-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.02-23.55.05.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328319"></a><figcaption>Horses are the most common mounts that can take a saddle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328319-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.02-23.55.05.50.png"></figure><h2>How to get a Saddle in Minecraft</h2><p>There are four primary ways to obtain a saddle. All of these methods involve various world activities, some of which are certainly easier than others. However, for the most part, your chances of adding a saddle to your inventory come down to luck. The four ways to obtain a saddle are individually described below:</p><h3>Killing Mobs</h3><p>Perhaps the most straightforward way of obtaining a saddle is through killing specific mobs in Minecraft. While only a couple of mobs have the chance to drop a saddle as loot, there's a decent chance these mobs drop one relatively quickly. The most common mob to drop a saddle are <strong>Ravagers</strong>, as they drop one every time they die. Also, Zombified Piglins riding a Strider in the Nether have a chance to drop the saddle they're currently using as well.</p><h3>Opening Chests</h3><p>Depending on the edition of Minecraft you're playing, you can obtain a saddle through chest loot. The chest locations are the same, but the chances of obtaining a saddle from the chests vary slightly depending on the edition, Java or Bedrock. You can see a full list of chest locations that might contain a saddle for both Java and Bedrock below:</p><p>Chest locations that might hold a saddle:</p><ul><li>Dungeon</li><li>Ancient City</li><li>Bastion Remnant (Hoglin Satble Chest)</li><li>Desert Temple</li><li>End City</li><li>Jungle Temple</li><li>Nether Fortress</li><li>Stronghold (Altar Chest)</li><li>Village (Weaponsmith's house, Savanna house, Tanner's Chest)</li></ul><ul><li>Dungeon</li><li>Ancient City</li><li>Bastion Remnant (Hoglin Stable Chest)</li><li>Desert Temple</li><li>End City</li><li>Jungle Temple</li><li>Nether Fortress</li><li>Stronghold (Altar Chest)</li><li><p>Village (Weaponsmith's house, Savanna house, Tanner's Chest)</p></li></ul><h3>Fishing</h3><p>Arguably, the rarest way to obtain a saddle is through fishing. You have a roughly 1% chance to reel in a saddle as "treasure" when fishing with an unenchanted fishing rod. If you enchant the fishing rod, your odds go up, but not by much.</p><h3>Trading</h3><p>The final way to obtain a saddle in Minecraft is by trading with Master-Level Leatherworker Villagers. There's a 50% chance these Villagers sell a saddle in exchange for six emeralds on Bedrock while there's a 100% chance the Villagers have a saddle for sale for six emeralds. This is the easiest way to obtain a saddle, but only if you've done the legwork required with your Villagers.</p><h2>How to use a Saddle in Minecraft</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328318-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.02-23.57.06.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328318" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328318-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.02-23.57.06.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328318"></a><figcaption>Saddling a horse in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328318-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.02-23.57.06.06.png"></figure><p>Now that you know how to get a saddle, it's time you learned how to use one. For starters, only the following mobs can be saddled and ridden as a mount:</p><ul><li>Pigs</li><li>Camels</li><li>Horses</li><li>Donkeys</li><li>Mules</li><li>Striders</li></ul><p>There are different rules when it comes to applying a saddle and controlling different mounts. For example, you need a carrot on a stick in your inventory to control a pig after it's been saddled while you need to tame mounts like horses and camels before you're able to saddle them. Once a saddle is on a mount, you can climb on and ride them all across the world.</p>

			<p>A few minutes ago, the official Twitter/X Star Wars Outlaws account <a href="https://x.com/StarWarsOutlaws/status/1808531202632044579" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the open world game set in George Lucas' beloved science fantasy universe has gone gold well before its planned August 30 launch.</p>
<p>While it's not as much of an advance as Square Enix's Final Fantasy XVI, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-goes-gold-nearly-three-months-before-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went gold almost three months ahead of its planned debut</a>, it's still ahead of schedule compared to most recent games, which usually only reach the gold phase a few weeks before the release.</p>
<p>Traditionally, this phrase is used when a product is ready to be delivered and sent for mass disc duplication. Nowadays, some games even skip the retail release at launch, foregoing disc releases entirely in favor of digital-only stores, but the terminology has stuck and developers continue to describe this phase as such.</p>
<p>This also doesn't necessarily mean Star Wars Outlaws developer Ubisoft Massive won't continue working on fixing some potential bugs and issues with a day-one patch. However, it should inspire some confidence that the studio has started the duplication process fairly early because even this build is polished enough.</p>
<p>The game, powered by the studio's impressive Snowdrop engine, delivers seamless transitions between space and planet gameplay (although you won't be able to travel seamlessly between planets, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-wont-feature-freeform-space-travel-between-planets-reputation-system-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> by the development team). On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-dlss-3-5-marvel-rivals-to-feature-dlss-3-and-rtx-remix-goes-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will support NVIDIA DLSS 3.5</a> (Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction) for optimal performance and visuals.</p>
<p>Story-wise, Star Wars Outlaws is set between the original trilogy movies The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The setting was proposed by Lucasfilm, who felt this would be the perfect space in which to place an adventure about a scoundrel making her way through the criminal underworld of the galaxy's Outer Rim.

            <p>Surgent Studios, developers of this year’s fetching Afrofuturist <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a>, have laid off more than a dozen staff. The cuts come just over two months on from the release of the debut video game release from the multimedia studio founded by Assassin’s Creed Origins star Abubakar Salim.</p>

<p>Before Tales of Kenzera: Zau, Surgent contributed to a number of films starting with 2021’s The Whale, through to this year’s Wild Goat Surf. The studio bill themselves as focusing on storytelling across a variety of media, from games and film to podcasts, with Zau being their first video game project.</p>
<p>News of layoffs first broke via posts from former employees on LinkedIn (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-surgent-studios-is-cutting-jobs">Game Developer</a>), including a level designer and technical artist. Surgent <a href="https://x.com/surgentstudios/status/1808216664145576284">subsequently confirmed</a> the cuts by stating that “just over a dozen people” had been affected, with <a href="https://x.com/Abzybabzy/status/1808221598983544959">Salim listing</a> producers, artists and animators as among those laid off.</p>
<p>“It’s a difficult time in the games industry, but we remain incredibly proud of our entire team’s work on Zau and of the praise it has received from critics and players alike,” they continued, before adding that the studio’s focus would be on “supporting those affected, continuing our work on Zau, and looking to the future with our next creative projects”.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Zau was revealed at the end of last year as a moving <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> inspired both by African Bantu cultures and Salim’s own experiences of grief. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review">our review</a> around its release on April 23rd, Alice Bee (RPS in Peace) praised its sensitively-told story and beautiful design, while finding its platforming and combat to be a little imprecise at times.</p>
<p>Surgent are yet to announce their next project or future plans for Zau. Best of luck to those affected by the layoffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/more-activision-blizzard-games-are-reportedly-launching-on-game-pass-next-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been eight months since Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-closes-68-7-billion-activision-blizzard-deal-after-nearly-21-month-long-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed</a> the $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, following a lengthy legal battle with regulators worldwide.</p>
<p>Given that Microsoft had touted early on its intention to bring Activision Blizzard to its Game Pass subscription service, arguably the most important pillar of its gaming strategy, Xbox fans expected this to happen in relatively short order, but that wasn't the case. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-ceo-explains-why-game-pass-isnt-getting-activision-blizzard-games-before-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> at the time:</p>
<p><em>Frankly, there was a lot of uncertainty in that process up until really a week before we closed, or the week of, when the CMA finally came down to their decision, that we weren't able to get on that back catalog work. So now that the deal is closed, we're starting that work.</em></p>
<p><em>But there is work. And I think the Activision Twitter handle did put out a statement that talked about 2024. I think that's accurate. I would love it if there was some kind of secret celebration drop coming in the next couple of weeks. There's not.</em></p>
<p><em>Definitely, when we think about the new games that are there, I would be straight with people. If we were going to put them in the subscription this year, I would tell people. And I know there'll be some disappointment about that.</em></p>
<p><em>This acquisition is definitely long-term for Microsoft, so the fact that we're not hitting day one with a bunch of games dropping in to Game Pass is a little bit of a downer, but I'm very excited about the future.</em></p>
<p>Eventually, Diablo IV <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lands-on-game-pass-on-march-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined</a> Game Pass in late March. Again, Xbox users hoped that more titles would follow shortly, but that wasn't the case, and Microsoft didn't raise up the subject during its Xbox Games Showcase last month, either.</p>
<p>However, a new rumor <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/exclusive-new-details-regarding-activision-games-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-emerge.222/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> by insider extas1s reveals that Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, the remaster compilation that recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-has-sold-through-over-20-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit</a> the 20 million units sales milestone, will join Game Pass next month. According to extas1s, it won't be alone, as Spyro Reignited Trilogy and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2 will both be added to the subscription service shortly, though the insider couldn't confirm if that would happen in August.</p>
<p>Windows Central has since <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corroborated</a> the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy rumor, adding that Microsoft plans to slowly add back catalog games from Activision Blizzard to Game Pass. As such, it may be a while before every classic hit in the publisher's portfolio makes it to the subscription service.</p>
<p>As for when exactly Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy might be added to GP, it could be a good announcement to share with fans during Gamescom Opening Night Live (slated to air on Tuesday, August 20, between 8 and 10 PM CET), though that's just speculation on our part.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/halo-infinite-myrtle-broadway-bushwick-new-york<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Even if you don’t live in Bushwick, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York, you’ve probably seen the Myrtle/Broadway intersection. You know <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/050/183/Screenshot_2024-06-14_at_11.44.06_AM.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that one infamous photo</a> of an unholy Dunkin Donuts-Checkers-Popeyes trifecta next to a subway stop? Yep, that’s Myrtle/Broadway. It even has <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/myrtle-broadway-jmz-subway-stop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its own Know Your Meme page</a>. Now one <em>Halo </em>player, Corey Cash, is taking the meme a step further.</p><p>Cash, a Bushwick resident, is in the process of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bushwick/comments/1dpbxxf/in_the_process_of_making_the_myrtlebroadway/?share_id=dxiEfEJ6t4GAWi7Ix4KST&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recreating Myrtle/Broadway</a> using <em>Halo Infinite</em>’s versatile Forge mapmaking tool. Why? In part to honor a deceased friend who used to live in the area, but also because “Myrtle/Broadway offers the most dynamic, multilayer play experience for a big team FPS vs other Brooklyn intersections.”</p><p>“From the street level to the station platform, you have many vantage and hiding spots to keep the fight interesting,” he told Aftermath.</p><p>Cash, who builds restaurants for a living, isn’t just eyeballing it. He’s committed to accurately realizing the spirit of the place, if not every last detail.</p><p>“I pulled a lot of Google maps, Department of Building[s] plans, Department of Environmental Protections and ConEd diagrams to reference street layouts, building plans, and electrical and sewer system layouts,” Cash said. “Not all parts of the map are 1:1 scale, but referencing all this certainly helped. You’ll be able to run under Broadway via open manhole covers and ConEd’s underground maintenance tunnels and DEP’s sewers.”</p><p>Cash feels this is important because he wants Myrtle/Broadway to transcend time and space even more than it already has.</p><p>"I have a lot of the underbelly of this map exposed due to the fact that the map is built to look as though a fragment of Brooklyn was detached from Earth and is now an asteroid floating in space," said Cash. "I did this because I didn’t want to waste memory on a cityscape in the background that wasn’t playable, and the present Brooklyn timeline doesn’t line up with <em>Halo</em>’s timeline, so making it a remnant of Brooklyn floating in space seemed on brand."</p><p>As we’ve all suspected, the Dunkin-Checkers-Popeye hydra can survive anything, even the end of the world. But that’s not the only landmark Cash is focused on nailing the look and feel of.</p><p>“I felt the JZM [subway] stop was the most important to get down correctly – and the street layout,” he said. “Then the icons; the Dunkin-Checkers-Popeyes trifecta was a must. Mr Kiwi, Market Hotel, and all the bodegas are there and open as a part of the field of play. Bars like Alaska, Jade, and Skytown are due to be built. Little nuances and the community here give Myrtle/Broadway its character. Will certainly need to script the sock vendor’s soul and funk music into the map somehow. A must.”</p><p>Right now, Cash isn’t thinking too far ahead. He just wants “both Brooklyn and Xbox to have as much fun with the map as I am.” He does, however, plan on creating other iconic portions of Brooklyn in <em>Halo </em>once he’s finished with this map. It’s gonna be a tough act to follow, though.</p><p>"It’s hard to beat Myrtle/Broadway,” Cash said.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game stars Frank West, a photojournalist who has covered wars before, and his investigation of a massive zombie outbreak in and around a small-town mall.  In June, Capcom surprised fans with an announcement that it was remastering the original game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/xyZ7gagpgsU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/xyZ7gagpgsU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But that first teaser</a></span> featured a new look and voice for Frank West. Fans weren’t happy about it. And Capcom, who probably predicted such a reaction, has an offer for those fans: Pre-order the game to get classic Frank. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-has-classic-frank-and-even-chuck-skins-but-only-if-you-preorder&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-has-classic-frank-and-even-chuck-skins-but-only-if-you-preorder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by IGN</a></span>, Capcom is now taking pre-orders for<em> Dead Rising</em> on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.deadrising.com/1/en-us/#product&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.deadrising.com/1/en-us/#product" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its official website</a></span>. And as you might expect from a AAA video game publisher in 2024, pre-ordering <em>Dead Rising</em> comes with some bonuses. One of those perks is a skin for Frank West that turns him back into his more pudgy and younger-looking self as seen in the original 2006 version of <em>Dead Rising. </em></p><p>Now normally, a few tiny cosmetic bonuses included with a pre-order wouldn’t cause much alarm or anger. And I do think the other pre-order bonus skin—based on the main character from <em>Dead Rising 2</em>—is pretty cool! But some fans aren’t happy that the one big complaint they have with the upcoming remaster—the new, weird-looking Frank West—can only be fixed by giving Capcom some money now before reviews are out and people have had a chance to play the game. </p><p>And once the game is out, will it still be possible to get this classic skin? Will Capcom sell it to folks at a later date? Or will it get added to the game as a freebie down the line? For now, we don’t know, but the game’s official site does mention—in tiny text—that these pre-order bonuses may be “made available separately at a later date.”  </p><p>Oh, and don’t expect this classic model to sound like he did in the Xbox 360 game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/FrankByDaylight/status/1806716618699059583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/FrankByDaylight/status/1806716618699059583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as the original voice actor says Capcom never even asked him to return</a></span>.</p><p>Honestly, the OG Frank West model feels like something that you should unlock after beating the game once. Or after killing a specific number of zombies. It should be a fun reward for playing <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em> and not a way to get more people to pre-order something before they even have a chance to play it or read a few reviews. </p><p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster </em>launches September 19 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Arguing that it was an actual weapon, the police eventually detained Anthony Bray, who claims he bought the replica online as a fidget toy.</p><p>As first reported by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-fan-jailed-for-carrying-six-inch-master-sword-in-public&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-fan-jailed-for-carrying-six-inch-master-sword-in-public" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span>, Bray was spotted by CCTV operators with something visibly in his hand on June 8. It turns out that Bray was holding his Master Sword fidget toy while walking around the center of Nuneaton, a town in England. Considering the fact that the blade on the toy measures at six inches, the officers believed he was openly walking around with a weapon, and eventually arrested Bray for carrying a “bladed article” when he approached them.<br></p><p>According to the reports, the too-long Master Sword fidget toy was in its sheath, though it could come off with the press of a button. Bray admitted that he could understand how his toy could be mistaken for a weapon, but also protested that he would’ve ever used it as such to no avail. Per the UK’s knife laws, you cannot carry a knife with a blade longer than three inches, so you can see why the police would’ve been concerned.<br></p><p>A sergeant of the investigations unit stated, “We take a zero tolerance to bladed articles in public, and Bray has fallen afoul of this. It is possible to find fidget toys that aren’t six-inch blades. It is possible not to walk down the street holding them out in front of you.”<br></p><p>If you ask me, four months is a bit much. Not only will Bray be in prison for a third of a year, but he’s also being made to pay a fine for…walking around with a toy. I can absolutely recognize the threat of a <em>six-inch </em>blade, but at some point, it feels like intent, as well as the manufacturer’s responsibility, needs to be taken into account. If he’s a repeat offender with a history, I’d be more inclined to acquiesce, but he’s probably just a guy with anxiety who grew up liking <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, and now he’s got a record. Though I’ve repeatedly insisted that gamers <em>should </em>pay for their crimes, this isn’t what I meant.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Swinging into action to face off against fellow heroes and villains in the Timestream Entanglement crisis, Spider-Man does everything that you'd expect a hero possessing the proportionate speed, strength, and agility of a spider to be capable of. One fun twist here is that players can run along walls as Spidey, gaining a distinct traversal advantage in the heat of battle.</p><p>Beyond that, Spider-Man can swing around the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-will-let-you-destroy-maps-with-superpowers-just-not-completely/1100-6523370/" data-ref-id="1100-6523370">semi-destructible stages</a>, unleash a barrage of web-attacks, and ground opponents with his ultimate attack. The video also showed off some of the different outfits that Spidey can wear, as you'll be able to dress him up as the rebellious Spider-Punk or as the bombastic Bag-Man.</p>

<p>In case this Spidey sounds familiar, that's because Yuri Lowenthal--from Sony's recent Spider-Man games--is voicing him, adding another Spider-Man performance to his credits. This version isn't related to developer Insomniac's Spider-Man, and is a different webhead who finds himself caught up in the mess created by Dr. Doom and his 2099 counterpart.</p><p>First announced for PC earlier this year, Marvel Rivals will also be headed to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in the future. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-characters-every-superhero-and-supervillain/2900-5216/#2" data-ref-id="2900-5216">Spider-Man is just one of many playable characters</a> in the game, and if you're lucky, you might get to try some of them out when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-coming-to-consoles-ps5-beta-and-exclusive-spidey-costume-confirmed/1100-6523816/" data-ref-id="1100-6523816">Marvel Rivals PC and console closed beta</a> kicks off on July 23. This will be a "large-scale" test held in North America, Europe, and other unspecified regions, and the PS5 version will offer an exclusive Scarlet Spider costume for Spider-Man.</p>
