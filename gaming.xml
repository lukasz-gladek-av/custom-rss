            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mirthwood-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>V Publishing and Bad Ridge Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>release date, and the game, developed by a two-man indie outfit, will be out later this year.</p>
<p><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>is a life sim that offers a spicy dash of morality alongside the usual farming, getting to know the townspeople, and cozy adventuring, and it's launching on PC on September 11th. There's no word on a console version just yet.</p>
<p>The devs explicitly cite&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>&nbsp;(that's the originals, not the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fable-2025">new Xbox project</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rimworld"><em>RimWorld</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sims-4">The Sims</a>&nbsp;</em>as inspirations for&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>, so if any of those games are your jam, this one should be on your radar.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mirthwood-release-date-farmstead.jpg?itok=JGdbKIRo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mirthwood-release-date-farmstead.jpg?itok=fUVq8xkT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>will have a few unusual twists on top of its farming sim gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>You begin as an adventurer who's fleeing "a continent swept with war" and looking for a fresh start. However, somewhat unusually for a life sim, that fresh start doesn't have to be a morally upstanding one.</p>
<p><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>blends typical life sim gameplay - managing and upgrading a farmstead, exploring the local environs for monsters to slay (in a cozy way, obviously), and meeting townsfolk - with a morality system inspired by&nbsp;<em>inFamous&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>.</p>
<p>Bad Ridge says you'll be able to take either a good or an evil path through&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>, and presumably, villagers' responses to you will change depending on what kind of person you are.</p>
<p>You can add&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Don't Starve&nbsp;</em>to the list of inspirations&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>can claim, by the way, as this release date trailer will attest to.</p>

<p>When you interact with villagers, you'll do so via a&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-inspired interaction system that lets you choose from a variety of different conversation topics, and building relationships will also potentially unlock new quests for you to chase.</p>
<p>In short, while&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>offers yet more cozy game-style shenanigans, it looks like it's doing enough to differentiate itself from the legions of its peers currently harvesting their crops and romancing the townspeople.</p>
<p>You can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272900/Mirthwood/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">on Steam right now</a> ahead of its September 11th launch. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-7th-continent-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions.937767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/7th-continent-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>The 7th Continent, a game that emerged from a wildly successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/the-7th-continent-what-goes-up-must-come-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kickstarter</a> campaign, has not only met but exceeded the high expectations initially set for it. It's an immersive game that draws inspiration from choose-your-own-adventure novels, video games, as well as legendary authors Jules Verne and H.P. Lovecraft. It's not just one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games"><u>best cooperative board games</u></a> but also an exhilarating solo experience that has earned its place among the medium’s finest.</p><p>As with other successful board games, The 7th Continent has seen several expansions that further iterate upon the core gameplay and add more harrowing scenarios. Given the number of releases over the years, however, it might be difficult to decide which packages to consider and in which order. That’s why we have crafted this handy buying guide that will walk you through the various releases and what each offers. Luckily, starting isn’t too difficult as there is really only one place to begin, the base game.</p><h2>The Base Game</h2><p id="the-7th-continent"><h3 data-toc-title="The 7th Continent">The 7th Continent</h3></p><div catalogid="0337b024-a14d-4c5b-8a95-55c3c3d47e1e" id="205233"><div id="205233" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $69.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 14+</li><li>Players: 1-4</li><li>Play Time: 5-1000 mins</li></ul><p>The 7th Continent is a heavily thematic board game that immerses players in the story of explorers returning to the newly discovered titular land. Together, they must remove a curse placed upon them during their last expedition. The continent, still largely uncharted, remains treacherous and mysterious, unfolding before players as they explore. The game doesn’t give players much direction when it comes to lifting the curse. Instead, players are dropped into a dangerous world, asked to explore, and must deal with various perils as they appear. This enveloping narrative, combined with the game's unique mechanics, creates a challenging and captivating experience.</p><p>Mechanically speaking, The 7th Continent is a narrative-driven card game with an expanding board of tiles that are placed when players meet various requirements. Like other explorative survival board games, it features crafting, combat, and even RPG elements. However, it’s The 7th Continent’s unique mechanics that set it apart from other titles in the genre, making it an unforgettable experience. For example, the card deck players draw from to resolve actions and add to their respective hands also serves as their life force. Once players work their way through the deck, they risk pulling a curse card, ending the game and resulting in a loss. Also, you might notice that campaigns can run quite long; luckily, however, The 7th Continent includes a handy save feature that allows players to pause, pack up the contents, and pick up the story at a later time. Still, due to its length, it might be difficult to get the same group of players together, but you can also take The 7th Continent at your own pace as a single-player campaign, considering it is one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games"><u>best solo board games</u></a> currently available.</p><p>The various curses in the box make up the scenarios, and there are four alone in the base game—each of which takes players hours to complete. Multiple curses can be combined in the same campaign to add even more variability to the base game. With plenty of random events baked in, the Core Box offers plenty of replayability on its own, but players looking to revisit the mystifying world on multiple occasions may want to check out one of The 7th Continent’s several expansions.</p><h2>Main Expansions</h2></div><p id="crystals-songgame-modes-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Crystal's Song/Game Modes Expansion">The 7th Continent: The Crystal's Song &amp; Game Modes Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="ce12b08d-8d49-4133-93ac-48fa4e1c20b2" id="205235"><div id="205235" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: The Crystal's Song &amp; Game Modes Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $12.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Curse</li><li>3 New Game Modes</li><li>1 Divider</li><li>40 New Cards</li></ul><p>While The Voracious Goddess curse in the Core Box was initially the recommended starting point for new players, The Crystal’s Song curse in this expansion has since become the ideal first scenario thanks to its brief and tutorial-esque introduction to The 7th Continent’s mechanics. In fact, publisher Serious Poulp bundles The Crystal’s Song and the Core Box together as a starter pack. Additionally, the expansion includes an easier Prodigy Mode, an advanced Immortal Mode, and a tense Traitor Mode that gives players secret objectives. Not only is this the first expansion most players should pick up, but it’s actually a recommended purchase alongside the base game if possible.</p></div><p id="the-icy-maze-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="The Icy Maze Expansion">The 7th Continent: The Icy Maze Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="c8df1164-8e0a-4d52-a44d-00829d7f204e" id="205238"><div id="205238" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: The Icy Maze Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Curse</li><li>96 New Cards</li></ul><p>The 7th Continent Website actually recommends playing The Icy Maze before The Bloody Hunt – the last curse in the Core Box, which requires an in-depth knowledge of the map and mechanics. It’s certainly not a requirement to play The Icy Maze before finishing the base game, or at all, even, but if you feel that cutting your teeth on the more advanced Bloody Hunt is trying your patience, just know it’s designed too. The Icy Maze places an emphasis on movement, eventually giving players a greater understanding of the various corners of the continent.</p></div><p id="the-forbidden-sanctuary-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="The Forbidden Sanctuary Expansion">The 7th Continent: The Forbidden Sanctuary Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="6006ab1f-937c-49c8-9805-67d12c8bc070" id="205239"><div id="205239" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: The Forbidden Sanctuary Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Curse</li><li>96 New Cards</li></ul><p>The Forbidden Sanctuary is the next recommended curse from the makers of The 7th Continent. This curse takes players to a mysterious temple riddled with booby traps. Learning the secrets hidden inside can be treacherous, but it’s necessary to lift the curse. Like the other expansions listed here, The Forbidden Sanctuary is designed to fit right into the Core Box and requires the base game.</p></div><p id="the-veins-of-the-earth-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="The Veins of the Earth Expansion">The 7th Continent: The Veins of the Earth Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="af25c1a2-53b8-4a43-8249-1ece716cec6b" id="205240"><div id="205240" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: The Veins of the Earth Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $25.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Curse</li><li>149 New Cards</li><li>Barge Standee</li><li>4 Dividers</li></ul><p>The Veins of the Earth expansion gives players a look at what lurks below the continent. Underground waterways span the entire continent, which players will discover as they float along on their barge. The added layer to this mysterious land is accompanied by its own set of perils for explorers to stumble across. Initially, The Veins of the Earth was bundled with A Prison of Clouds, Forgotten Passages, and The Crystal’s Song in a collector’s expansion box available through Kickstarter. All of these, except for The Crystal’s Song, can still be purchased in the What Goes Up, Must Come Down bundle – a nod to the title of the original expansion title.</p></div><p id="a-prison-of-clouds-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="A Prison of Clouds Expansion">The 7th Continent: A Prison of Clouds Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="454603f2-2491-4269-99c0-8b2daf2dfe7a" id="205241"><div id="205241" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: A Prison of Clouds Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $25.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Curse</li><li>169 New Cards</li><li>Hot Air Baloon Standee</li><li>4 Dividers</li></ul><p>While The Veins of the Earth explored the underground passages of the continent, A Prison of Clouds has players taking to the skies in a hot air balloon. The two expansions together serve to expand the map vertically, and A Prison of Clouds even allows players to land on the continent whenever they choose and explore on foot. In fact, it’s a necessary excursion as you will certainly face strong headwinds and intense hunger along your journey that will require you to trek on foot for a bit.</p></div><p id="forgotten-passages-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Forgotten Passages Expansion">The 7th Continent: Forgotten Passages Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="a65f4dde-7f3d-49df-8f84-6dff2313cbdf" id="205242"><div id="205242" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: Forgotten Passages Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>3 New Explorers</li><li>115 New Cards</li><li>3 Character Standees</li></ul><p>While Forgotten Passages doesn’t include any new curses against which players can test their skills and luck, the expansion does include plenty of new cards and three new explorers with various abilities. Joining the cast are the skilled hunter Anjika, American aviator Amelia Earhart, and English Gentleman Phileas Fogg, along with his valet Jean Passerpartout. Not to mention, new alternate terrain cards change up the map enough to keep players on their toes.</p></div><p id="facing-the-elements-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Facing the Elements Expansion">The 7th Continent: Facing the Elements Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="33a51758-e1e8-43a7-8e36-ee6dc3e93e8f" id="205245"><div id="205245" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: Facing the Elements Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>40 New Cards</li><li>5 Cardboard Figures</li><li>5 Plastic Stands</li></ul><p>As if curses and traps weren’t enough, Facing the Elements adds various acts of nature to the world of The 7th Continent. These random events can throw a wrench in your excursion entirely, or they can perhaps aid you in your exploration. Again, there’s no new curse here, but these wild card events can help keep things interesting and add even more depth to an already content-rich game.</p></div><p id="fear-the-devourers-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Fear the Devourers Expansion">The 7th Continent: Fear the Devourers Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="d59ac834-1997-40b3-9029-e05a94dd27ad" id="205246"><div id="205246" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: Fear the Devourers Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>30 New Cards</li><li>7 Rock Worm Standees</li></ul><p>Fear the Devourers adds the fearsome Rockworm to The 7th Continent. These random exploration cards fold right into the base game and can pose quite a challenge. If not immediately dealt with, these creatures will remain a persistent threat. Players who want a bit of extra challenge added to the base game without a ton of extra rules should check out Fear the Devourers.</p></div><p id="the-flying-roots-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="The Flying Roots Expansion">The 7th Continent: The Flying Roots Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="fd1c2bf2-ba5a-4d18-8e66-849625fc1060" id="205247"><div id="205247" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: The Flying Roots Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $20.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>40 New Cards</li><li>6 Flying Roots Standees</li></ul><p>Like Fear the Devourers, The Flying Roots adds another interesting element to the base game. Unlike the Rockworms, however, it’s initially unclear what the flying roots’ intentions actually are. While these plants aren’t necessarily nefarious, their presence can serve as quite a hindrance. This new mysterious addition is perhaps a bit deeper and has more in store for players who choose to investigate them further.</p><h2>Mini-Expansions</h2></div><p id="path-of-repentance-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Path of Repentance Expansion">The 7th Continent: Path of Repentance Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="2f018944-4f91-4740-a540-3d87bdf1a905" id="205249"><div id="205249" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: Path of Repentance Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $10.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>30 New Cards</li></ul><p>Path of Repentance is a small but meaningful expansion that further deepens the thematic experience of The 7th Continent. This mini-expansion builds upon the sleep mechanic from the base game but goes the extra mile to illustrate just how mentally distraught the crew is over the looming curse. To speak too much about the Path of Repentance would spoil the experience, but just know that, especially at $10, this mini-expansion is well worth the price of admission.</p></div><p id="comfort-creatures-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Comfort Creatures Expansion">The 7th Continent: Comfort Creatures Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="7c9fcb34-e17f-4f6a-882f-a8c088f6a168" id="205250"><div id="205250" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The 7th Continent: Comfort Creatures Expansion</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $10.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>30 New Cards</li></ul><p>Comfort Creatures inserts a bit more randomness and fun into the 7th Continent experience. This mini-expansion adds an egg that will hatch into a mysterious creature if cared for. Hatch and raise the newborn beast to potentially gain a powerful companion to aid you on your journeys across the strange land.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>The 7th Continent is an excellent cooperative board game for small groups and a great solo experience as well. The base game is required for all expansions, many of which add new curses that can either replace or supplement the base scenarios. Other expansions add new players, foes, and mechanics. The Crystal’s Song is a great purchase alongside the base game, as it helps onboard new players with its streamlined tutorial scenario.</p><p>For even more great tabletop recommendations, see our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time"><u>best board games to play right now</u></a>.

The animation to go underwater takes about 30 in-game minutes and the same is true to come back up, so give yourself enough time to get home.</p><p dir="ltr">The Mermaid Show can be found on the east side of the market. Entering the boat will start the show, which lasts 1 hour and 40 minutes of in-game time.

                <p>Actor Kit Harington is returning to the world of Game of Thrones, but not in the way you'd expect or even probably hope for.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/what-are-warbands-in-world-of-warcraft-the-war-within/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/what-to-do-before-the-war-within-pre-patch-update-in-world-of-warcraft/">pre-patch</a> for the latest WoW expansion has been released, introducing the Warbands system to the game. For those who want to get stuck into the game but aren't sure what Warbands are, this guide will explain everything you need to know about the system.</p>
<p>While this <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24061008/the-war-within-warbands-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature is specific</a> to The War Within expansion for World of Warcraft, it has been released early to let players begin gearing up and preparing for the upcoming battles on August 26.</p>
<h2>What are Warbands?</h2>
<p>Warbands allow players to have account-wide progression across the characters in the Warband. Whether your characters are Horde or Alliance, in The War Within Renown, you gather one character that will transfer to all of your characters. There will also be a Warband bank to store items between all characters.</p>
<p>The most important thing to note about Warbands is that the characters are region-locked. For example, if you play across the EU and NA, you won't be able to put characters from both regions in the Warband. You can only have EU characters in an EU Warband and vice versa. However, suppose you have characters across multiple realms. In that case, you can have them all grouped in a Warband, eliminating the need to mail items and currencies between characters, which can be incredibly time-consuming.</p>
<p>Here is all of the shared content available across your Warband characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achievements</li>
<li>Reputation</li>
<li>Transmogs</li>
<li>Currencies</li>
<li>Warbound Gear</li>
<li>Flight Paths</li>
<li>Dedicated Bank Space</li>
</ul>
<p>Warbands are one of the most valuable additions to World of Warcraft, as they allow players who use alts to progress faster through the game. For example, suppose you're running Mythic+ dungeons across multiple characters as soon as you unlock the Keystone Dungeon teleporters on one character. In that case, you'll then have access to them on your other characters.</p>
<p>The biggest pro of Warbands is that it converts character-specific WoW elements into account-wide elements so that players' achievements can be acknowledged. With the addition of the Warband-specific bank, players will gain access to five tabs with 98 inventory slots on each tab. It's important to note that if you want to utilize the bank, you must purchase the tabs for more gold per tab.</p>
<p>Warbands also introduces a new keyword for gear. This is "Warbound until Equipped," which means the gear can be transferred between characters. However, once equipped, it becomes Soulbound, and can no longer be transferred between your characters.</p>
<p>That's everything you need to know about Warbands in World of Warcraft and how you can utilize them in the upcoming expansion for WoW, The War Within.</p>

Ultimately, budget issues and Verbinski’s insistence on an R-rating led to the project falling through. With new budget issues facing the Netflix adaptation attempt, I’m sure fans are feeling a bit worried.That might not be the only issue facing Netflix’s <em>BioShock</em>, as the schedule of director Francis Lawrence may also cause issues. </p><p>While Lawrence remains attached to the project, the director has an ever-growing list of other films on his plate.

Those are both closer on the horizon, but farther off projects like sequels to<em> I Am Legend</em> and <em>Constantine</em> could also mean <em>BioShock </em>may be in need of a new director before long. </p><p>With or without Lawrence, it seems that <em>BioShock </em>isn’t anywhere near shooting, let alone premiering in a theater near you, so fans will just have to wait and cross their fingers that even a smaller version of <em>BioShock </em>on the big screen will remain true to the game.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You have so many settings to tweak in 7 Days to Die before delving into the game for the first time. It can feel overwhelming. Here’s a complete rundown of the 7 Days to Die difficulty settings, along with which you should choose!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-7-days-to-die-difficulty-settings">What Are the 7 Days to Die Difficulty Settings?</h2>



<p>7 Days to Die launches into 1.0 with six difficulty settings, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Scavenger</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 50</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 200</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Adventurer</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 75</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 150</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Nomad</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 100</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 100</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Warrior</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 150</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 83</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Survivalist</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 200</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 66</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Insane</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 250</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 50</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Primarily, the various difficulty settings in the game alter the amount of damage you do to zombies and the amount of damage you take from zombies. You’ll absolutely notice the change in combat difficulty when increasing from Scavenger to Insane, for example.</p>



<p>Everything else about the game world remains the same, no matter the difficulty setting you choose!</p>







<h2 id="h-which-difficulty-is-right-for-you">Which Difficulty is Right For You?</h2>



<p>How much of a masochist are you? Playing on Survivalist or Insane is a sure way to wind up in a ditch somewhere before you visit the trader for the first time. But if you’re an experienced player, it might be the only challenge you eke out of the game these days.</p>



<p>For new players, I recommend playing no higher than Nomad. It’s essentially “Normal” in other games, though 7 Days to Die does recommend you play on Adventurer to start, which provides a slight buff.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-shouldnt-be-affected-by-video-game-strike/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6 appears to be safe from the video game strike.</p>



<p>When news broke that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game voice actors and performers</a> were going on strike on July 26, many gamers started to wonder about what it would mean for major games in development. Specifically, what would it mean for GTA 6? </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Grand Theft Auto 6 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c12j12N4yVU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1816829359878975818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ethan Gach of Kotaku</a>, not much at this moment.</p>



<p>Gach was told by a rep for the studios that GTA 6 is “exempt”  from the strike. </p>



<p>“While not struck, this game is produced by a struck company,” SAG-AFTRA says of work on GTA 6. “If you have been engaged under a daily contract for this game, you can show solidarity with your fellow union members by choosing not to sign new contracts on the game. However, you may work the game and will not be disciplined for doing so.”</p>



<p>Currently, GTA 6 is scheduled for a fall 2025 release. There had been rumors of a delay to 2026. However, at this moment, those remain just that, rumors.</p>

The calendar releases on September 10--but like all things Nintendo, this will probably sell out fast.</p><h2>Pikmin 2025 Wall Calendar</h2><h3>$16</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4341097-mixcollage-26-jul-2024-08-53-am-5726.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341097" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4341097-mixcollage-26-jul-2024-08-53-am-5726.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341097"></a><figcaption>The Pikmin 2025 Wall Calendar.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4341097-mixcollage-26-jul-2024-08-53-am-5726.jpg"></figure><p>What's unique about the Pikmin 2025 Wall Calendar is that it tells a story throughout the year. The creatures will begin to multiply over time, making each month a bit more exciting than the last. You'll start with just three Pikmin in January, but fast forward to June, and the entire calendar is overrun with diminutive creatures. It's a cool concept, and one that makes it more interactive than your standard wall calendar.</p><p>Along with pages for every month of 2025, you'll get a planning spread for September-December 2024 to help you roll into the new year. There's also plenty of grid space to jot down notes or appointments, as well as indicators for major holidays and for different moon phases.</p><p>If you haven't yet played Pikmin, you can pick up the remastered <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1812345747935746675%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-adorable-pikmin-calendar-is-now-up-for-preorder%2F1100-6525333%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pikmin 1 + 2</a> for Switch for $50 or <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1813071636702711255%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-adorable-pikmin-calendar-is-now-up-for-preorder%2F1100-6525333%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pikmin 4</a> (the latest entry in the series) for $60.

"A small puddle might seem like an impassable ocean to you and your Pikmin, but toss in a handful of Ice Pikmin and voila, the sea freezes up and you can cross it.

A spokesperson for the group representing game publishers in the labor negotiations confirmed this to <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>.</p><p>"I can confirm GTA VI is exempt," the representative said, adding that any game that was in development prior to September 2023 is exempt as well. Live-service games are unaffected by the strike situation, too, so content for games like Fortnite should continue to release normally.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">strike began today, July 26, at 12:01 AM</a>. It's the first time SAG-AFTRA video game actors have gone on strike since 2016, when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-video-game-voice-actor-strike-is-ending/1100-6453577/" data-ref-id="1100-6453577">work stoppage lasted for about one year. </a></p><p>SAG-AFTRA and game publishers like Warner Bros., Activision, Disney, and others, negotiated for about two years prior to the strike being called. The key sticking point appears to be regulation of generative AI technology.</p><p>The actors' union says protections against AI are necessary because without it, game companies could train AI to replace human talent. "We strike as a matter of last resort. We have given this process absolutely as much time as we responsibly can. We have exhausted the other possibilities, and that is why we’re doing it now," SAG-AFTRA chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez said, as reported by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sagaftra-video-game-performers-ai-strike-4f4c7d846040c24553dbc2604e5b6034" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Associated Press.</a></p><p>For its part, the video game publisher representative, Audrey Cooling, said the video game companies have offered "meaningful AI protections."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-yasuke-apology-sucks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this week Ubisoft, the company behind the <em>Assassin's Creed</em> series,<a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1815674592444187116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> felt the need to issue a lengthy statement</a> in response to complaints about its upcoming <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</p><p>The game, set in 16th-century Japan, has been embroiled in a number of controversies since its reveal a few months back, from<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a minor scuffle over a flag in an art book</a> to<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/assassins-creed-shadows-earns-ire-of-japanese-people-with-inaccurate-architecture-costumes-and-etiquette/#:~:text=In%20terms%20of%20Japanese%20architecture,%2C%20with%20non%2Duniform%20borders." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> some more valid concerns over the game's architecture</a> (which is normally a series strongpoint) to<a href="https://x.com/mrjeffu/status/1815993456579461156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a minor conservative party trying and very much failing to make the game a political scapegoat</a>.</p><p>Then, you know, there's a lot of people's main issue: that one of the game's two protagonists (Yasuke) is a black man,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> despite him being an <em>actual historical figure</em></a>, which instantly makes him more historically-accurate than...any other <em>Assassin's Creed</em> protagonist, ever.</p><p>Normally the guys complaining about a black man in a video game are the same ones crying foul over historical accuracy, so this is a wonderful example of just how uninterested these guys are in...actual historical accuracy,<a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-no-there-are-women-in-battlefield-v-1826275455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> as I've written about previously</a>:</p><blockquote><p>To truly present something “accurate” to the time period would probably result in a game you wouldn’t really enjoy playing. What we often see in a “historical” FPS action game is just the visual trappings. And that’s okay—it’s a mass-market action game, not a history lesson.</p><p>What angry dorks mean when they say “historical accuracy” is not a game that’s accurate to the time being presented, then, but accurate to the aspects of that time (or the popular historical re-telling of it) that are sympathetic to their current political and cultural beliefs.</p><p>It doesn’t bother them that a randomly-created soldier with no training can jump behind the controls of a complex fighter aircraft, or expertly handle a cross-section of enemy weapons. They don’t care that the streets of European cities aren’t recreated 1:1, or that uniform details aren’t strictly adhered to, or that&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>’s war is fought to time limits and kill counts.</p><p>Those things are acceptable compromises. It’s a video game, and those are video game things that the Second World War just needs to accommodate with its representation in order to work. Yet introduce something as relatively harmless (it has zero impact on gameplay!) as women or black soldiers where historically there were none, and suddenly the sky is falling.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The perfect response to dealing with shitheads like this is to simply live your life pretending they don't exist.<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Their opinions are ill-formed, bigoted and unsuitable for mainstream consumption, and so should be ignored at all costs</a>. Let them howl at the moon all they want, let their furious emails wash against the walls of your inbox, these people simply are not worth your time.</p><p>Those of us in the media learned that lesson a <em>long </em>time ago. A decade ago, in fact, when Gawker's Max Read wrote "<a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/how-we-got-rolled-by-the-dishonest-fascists-of-gamergat-1649496579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How We Got Rolled by the Dishonest Fascists of Gamergate</a>", an evergreen piece on the dangers of confusing a bunch of angry tweets with a movement of any significant size or importance. You do not, and should not, have to listen to these pricks!</p><p>Yet here we are, in 2024, and Ubisoft hasn't learned a damn thing. While the apology appears at first to be mostly addressed to the series' Japanese fans (<a href="https://x.com/JusticeKazzy_/status/1815820378482303058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most of whom, being actual fans of a series that has long played loose with history, won't care!</a>), it also touches on the matter of Yasuke's place in history, which is a <em>wild </em>thing to commit to public record.</p><p>As Trone Dowd<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-apology-yasuke-racist-trolls?s=03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> put so well on <em>Inverse</em></a>:</p><blockquote><p>...by issuing this weird, non-explanation for the very normal creative decision to tell its version of a popular historical figure’s story, Ubisoft only lent legitimacy to bad faith complaints seeped in racism. The vocal minority didn’t take issue with the many historical inaccuracies of the series past. For nearly two decades, they seemed perfectly satiated by a prompt telling them Assassin’s Creed is “inspired by historical events and characters,” not painstakingly recreating them. But these gamers launched a cultural battle once they knew they’d occasionally have to step into the shoes of a Black figure in Japan.</p><p>Ubisoft didn’t have to explain its creative decisions. It shouldn’t spoon-feed obvious answers to a delusional movement based on bigotry. But it did. And by doing so, it’s validated a straw man argument bolstered by people who have no zero interest in the quality of the game and the simpletons who’ve decided to fall for their grift. Instead of smothering it with logic and standing firmly by its artistic vision, Ubisoft has needlessly poured gasoline onto a smoldering fire. And now, the most annoying trolls on the internet will likely never shut up about it.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This fucking sucks. Ubisoft, you should know better, and for everyone creatively involved in the game who had no part in issuing this spineless statement, I'm sorry you're having to continue putting up with this.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-remasters-leaked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>remasters appear to have been leaked by merchandise spotted by eagle-eyed attendees at this year's San Diego Comic-Con.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-branding-seen-at-sdcc.937002/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ResetEra thread created by user Mama Robotnik</a>, cards bearing the legend "<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I &amp; II Remastered</em>" were spotted at Comic-Con. The cards also bear the logo of developer Crystal Dynamics, along with a QR code.</p>
<p>Scanning the code takes you to a page on which you can sign up for the newsletter of Dark Horse Comics, whose logo is also featured on the cards. Per a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soul-reaver-remasters-seemingly-confirmed-by-a-statue-at-comic-con/1100-6525310/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GameSpot report</a>, the cards were next to a statue depicting&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver</em>'s main characters Raziel and Kain, and Dark Horse will be handling that statue's launch in August.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-defiance-raziel.jpg?itok=RrjIgwa7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-defiance-raziel.jpg?itok=N5Yk-HNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The last proper&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain&nbsp;</em>game was 2003's&nbsp;<em>Defiance</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Per GameSpot, Dark Horse wouldn't say anything about the remasters, and the cards depicting the games' names had been taken away by the time the publication's staff arrived at the relevant booth.</p>
<p>Crystal Dynamics is one of the studios that survived the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter">great Embracer purge</a> of the last year or so, and the&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain&nbsp;</em>is still firmly under the studio's stewardship.</p>
<p>Remastered versions of&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>and its direct sequel would be a good way to test the waters for a potential new project, but honestly, I'd just be happy to see Raziel and Kain return again.</p>
<p>Who'll be handling the remaster is another matter entirely; Crystal Dynamics' logo being on the Comic-Con cards would seem to imply they'll be working on the games, but it could equally be a different studio entirely, as was the case for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered">this year's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>remasters</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-remasters-soul-reaver.jpg?itok=9dA-ocMU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-remasters-soul-reaver.jpg?itok=v03DEyLz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We've already had three remasters of beloved PlayStation-era platforming-heavy action-adventure games this year.</figcaption></figure><p>It's anyone's guess right now, but Aspyr would seem like a fairly obvious choice, although that studio's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-aspyr-response">work with the&nbsp;<em>Battlefront&nbsp;</em>remasters</a> might give Crystal Dynamics and Embracer pause for thought.</p>
<p>In any case, it looks like the revival of the&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain&nbsp;</em>franchise might be imminent after twenty years of dormancy. We don't talk about&nbsp;<em>Nosgoth</em>. Stay tuned for more!</p>

            <link>https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/26/fall-in-love-with-sexy-household-objects-in-date-everything</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/26/fall-in-love-with-sexy-household-objects-in-date-everything<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>In Date Everything, those looking for romance don’t need to look any further than their refrigerator, smoke alarm, or dining room table. That’s because this wacky sandbox dating sim by developer Sassy Chap is all about forming relationships with everyday household objects that, it turns out, are actually pretty hot.</p>

<p>The game bestows players with special “Dateviator” glasses that allow them to speak with objects and see them in their true, absurdly attractive forms. Dozens of objects await your affection – even elements like air and water can be courted – and branching dialogue can lead to three relationship resolutions for each character (Love, Friend, Hate). Whatever you decide will be reflected in the ever-changing 3D overworld that is your house.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dlxxzmOXRf0" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Date Everything boasts over 100 voiced characters played by performers that include Felicia Day (<em>Critical Role</em>, <em>Supernatural</em>), Johnny Yong Bosch (<em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</em>, <em>Bleach</em>), and Grey DeLisle (<em>Scooby-Doo, Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>). Given the huge amount of speaking roles, Date Everything boasts 1.2 million words and 70,000 voiced lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Date Everything looks delightfully silly, but it unfortunately doesn’t have a release window. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-360-digital-store-gets-swathe-of-discounts-ahead-of-closure">Microsoft announced a raft of discounts on Xbox 360 digital games</a> back in May.

			<p>New <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-resurfaces-with-new-footage-and-geforce-rtx-logo/">Lost Soul Aside</a> gameplay footage was shared today, providing a new look at the game by Ultizero Games that has been in development for quite a long time.</p>
<p>The new footage, which was shared today during a presentation held during Chinajoy 2024, showcases a tutorial fight as well as a fight against a new boss and a new weapon. Sadly, the game doesn't seem to be in great shape, as gameplay looks clunky and not particularly inspired. Hopefully, things will be improved before the game launches on a yet to be confirmed release date. You can check out the footage below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/07/lost-soul-aside-chinajoy-2024-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>.</p>

<p>Lost Soul Aside began development as a solo project by Yang Bing, who later created the development studio Ultizero Games to complete the development of the game. Inspired by Final Fantasy Versus XIII, which eventually became Final Fantasy XV, the game will be a character action game in the vein of Devil May Cry, where players will have to deal with powerful enemies using a variety of combat techniques.</p>
<p>Despite having been in development for a long time, Lost Soul Aside still lacks a release window. We will let you know when the game releases as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

However, that only included a purely cinematic trailer, and did not reveal gameplay footage of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</p>



<p>The new ChinaJoy 2024 demo also reveals coordinated enemy AI, and a map where players can select a battlefield. It further reveals how players can briefly assume control of popular characters nearby. Fans also widely praised the music, which plays a large role in the series’ beloved attitude.</p>



<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins still doesn’t have a concrete release date at this time, though it will launch in 2025. It will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Paradox Interactive isn’t doing to great right now. The company <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/financial-reports/interim-report-january-june-2024-correction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released its second quarter financial</a> results on Thursday, and with it came the revelation that Paradox Interactive’s profits have fallen from $27.1 million to just $2.6 million year over year.</p>



<p>That drop of 90% can be attributed to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paradox-cancels-life-by-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of the life simulator</a> Life By You. A write down of $19.3 million is included in the profits, leading to the collapse.</p>



<p>As far as year-over-year revenue, that fell 22% to $53.3 million from $68.3 million.</p>



<p>In his comments on the financial reports, Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester says that he, and the company, have mixed feelings about where things stand right now.</p>



<p>“On the one hand, our core business has performed very well, but on the other hand, we made the difficult decision to cancel the release of Life by You, as the game would not be able to meet our expectations,” he said. </p>



<p>“Looking at the quarter’s results, we’ve released several strong expansions with good quality to our core games, which has a positive impact on the top line and provides a good cash flow from operating activities. The bottom line is sadly weighed down by the write-down of Life by You. It is painful but gives us a strong motivation to further improve our operations.”</p>



<p>In addition to the cancellation of Life By You, Paradox has been trying to get back into the good graces of players after the launch of Cities: Skylines 2. The game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-rent-was-too-high-so-they-removed-landlords/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagued by various problems</a> since release, and the game’s console release has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-console-release-window-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been delayed time and time again</a>.</p>

It is an action game in which previous defeats can lead to victory.</p><p>The backstory has a simple, The Purge-adjacent premise: While once a luxury hotel, today Hotel Barcelona is a place where serial killers gather from all over the United States. It is a nightmarish place where the nastiest criminals come and do whatever they want.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I got to play a stage set at a camping site where I had to deal with a devilish homicidal maniac named Jacob. His face was covered by not only a hockey mask, but also a football face guard, reminiscent of Friday the 13th killer Jason Voorhees. </p><p>Hotel Barcelona’s base is an orthodox 2D action game. You place as Justine and can use both melee and long-range attacks to defeat enemies, until you reach a giant boss at the end of the stage. Collecting resources along the way allows you to permanently upgrade your character. Like a roguelite, Hotel Barcelona has a high difficulty and expects you to retry stages over and over. Those stages unfold over multiple branching paths, with healing items and stat buffs that can be obtained along the way. Hordes of normal enemies will stand in your way, and there are some additional foes hiding behind tufts of grass for surprise attacks as well. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When you die, you have a chance to make upgrades before embarking on your next run, with the ghost of your previous run fighting alongside you.</p></div><p>Luckily, Hotel Barcelona, due out later this year for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC,  introduces the Phantom mechanic to help you on your way. When you die, you have a chance to make upgrades before embarking on your next run, with the ghost of your previous run fighting alongside you. While you can’t control this phantom, it will attack enemies based on your previous life when you were controlling them, and it also draws aggro from your enemies. Since the phantom only repeats a previous run, its attacks can often miss as well, but since there are so many enemies on screen, it is often helpful. You can stack up a maximum of three phantoms based on your previous three lives alongside your current run.</p><p>You can use tactics such as staying behind the phantom to use it as a shield, or by luring enemies into your phantom’s attacks. I tried to be the decoy myself too, but this proved difficult as there is no skill that has the enemies focus on Justine’s attacks.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The special attack gauge decreases as time progresses, demanding the player to stay aggressive the whole time in order to fill the gauge.</p></div><p>Hotel Barcelona puts an emphasis on offensive tactics rather than defensive, with a gauge for special attacks that can be filled by gathering enemy blood. Once the gauge is full, a devastating attack against all enemies on screen can be utilized. This attack is not only effective against normal foes, but deals a lot of damage against a boss as well. The special attack gauge decreases as time progresses, demanding the player to stay aggressive the whole time in order to fill the gauge.</p><p>Jacob is a fierce boss with frequent wide range attacks. There’s not much you can do if you fight him by yourself, but your phantoms can lure or attack him, giving you a fighting chance. While I still wasn’t able to defeat him during my playtime, effective use of upgrades, special attacks and the Phantom mechanic should make it possible in the long run.</p><p><em>Written by Ryuichi Kataoka</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Valve has unveiled changes to how demos work on Steam, as the company is aiming to make them easier to discover. These updates will see demos redesigned to be more like standalone games on the platform, giving them their own store page separate from the main game's hub. The benefit to this is that the demo page can contain separate screenshots, trailers, and details on these slices of the full game to help set them apart and give potential players more accurate information. You'll also be able to add demos to your collection without needing to download it straight away, and when it's uninstalled, it'll also be removed from your library.</p><p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/6233628070477025191" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Valve</a>, these changes are driven by developer and player feedback, and players can expect to receive alerts for demos of wishlisted games. Pages for demos will include buttons to install the content, leave user reviews, and be redirected to the game's main page. Valve also plans to list demos more frequently on Steam's most-visited pages and include them alongside free-to-play games to "better balance them" with paid products.</p><p>The company also clarified that the Steam icon for game demos is not based on a dinner plate, but is instead a reference to ancient CD-ROM technology from a bygone era of gaming. "That classic icon, my friend, is from the days when demos were commonly distributed through the post office, contained in a bound package of game journalism printed on dead trees and imprinted on circular media known as Compact Discs," Valve explained.</p><p>Overall, these plans are designed to increase the visibility of demos, which will come in handy during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-25-steam-next-fest-game-demos-you-need-to-download-right-now/2900-5474/" data-ref-id="2900-5474">Steam Next Fest</a>. This is a week-long celebration where fans can try out demos from hundreds of games and give early feedback to developers, and the next instance of it will kick off on October 14. Next week will also see the launch of Tower Defense Fest on July 29, for PC gamers looking to try out previews of games in that genre.</p>

		<p><em>Image credit: SAG-AFTRA</em></p>
<p>The US Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) has called a strike by voice actors on work with key video game publishers and developers, pushing back against proposed contracts that would enable the use of AI generated voices and performances in video games. However, work can continue on games deep into production… for now.</p>


<p>The ten companies facing the strike are Activision, Blindlight, Disney Character Voices, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Formosa Interactive, Insomniac Games, Take 2 Productions, VoiceWorks Productions, and WB Games.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said, “We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.”</p>
<p>Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland added in a separate statement, “The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually. The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games. That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the AI use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year – that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to AI, and the public supports us in that.”</p>

<p>As a rebuttal, a spokesperson for the video game producers group said, “We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.”</p>
<p>It could take a while for the effects of this to be truly felt. Per Kotaku’s <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1816797825444753673">Ethan Gach</a>, games that have been in development for more than a year, and live service games can continue with union actors, though new and early projects cannot. Given that games can now very easily take 5 years to complete, there’s plenty room for this strike to escalate, especially as motion capture is a time consuming endeavour.</p>
<p>Given the timing, SAG-AFTRA has said that actors can take part in San Diego Comic Con panels which run through this weekend. Ordinarily all promotional work would also be halted, from awards shows to conventions and even social media posts.</p>
<p>The strike comes <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/09/sag-aftra-approve-strike-video-game-industry-1235555756/">ten months after members voted to authorise a strike</a>, and in the wake of the 2023 strike by SAG-AFTRA actors for TV and film, in which the use of generative AI and digital recreation were key points. Where the TV and film strike was also concerned with residual payments and the like, it’s the threat that generative AI poses to almost the entire video game voice actor industry that is really in the limelight here.</p>
<p>Generative AI has come on leaps and bounds in the last few years, and while still a million miles away from what we would traditionally think of as being AI – that’d be a self-aware computer, as opposed to what would more accurately be called ‘Machine Learning’ – it is already capable of synthesising a person’s voice from relatively few audio samples. There’s still things like needing to be able to convey emotion and the nuances of a performance and reading, but developers have already been using generative AI for things like the announcer in extraction shooter <a href="https://gamerant.com/the-finals-beta-criticized-ai-voices-voice-acting/">The Finals in open beta</a>, where a somewhat robotic performance is fairly in keeping with the tone of the game, and other titles have also used AI as placeholder until the latter stages of development.</p>
