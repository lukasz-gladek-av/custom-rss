		<p>Staff at development studio Spiders, developers of Greedfall and Steerlrising, have released an open letter to state they will be going on strike next week. The reasons for the strike action include management ignoring staff requests, pay disparity based on gender, high turnover, and poor employee support. In addition, staff have stated that the environment had led to problems on the development of Greedfall 2 and another, yet to be announced project.</p>
<p>The letter from the Spiders team, which can be read below, has been published by STJV, an independent French union which represents people working in the videogames industry.</p>


<p><em>This letter to our management follows an earlier open letter and a strike on January 19, which management has chosen not to ignore. Since then, new negotiations have begun on wages, and conditions in the studio have continued to deteriorate. Today, it is with regret that we speak out publicly, in the hope that this will finally push management to act in the best interests of employees and the company.</em></p>
<p><em>This document covers several years of known problems, which have been greatly amplified over the past year with the arrival of the current head of the company : instability, opposition to anticipating problems and securing working conditions, global mismanagement, turnover and recruitment problems, unacceptable delays in achieving gender equality and parity, important lack of transparency, denial of problems, refusal to acknowledge worker representation and blocked negotiations.</em></p>
<p><em>As of August 27, 2024, this letter has been signed by 44 workers at Spiders, out of 95.</em></p>

<p><em>We had demanded that the head of the company receive a delegation of Spiders’ workers to discuss all these points. She accepted, the delegation came to a meeting on August 27 and then waited in vain for the management to come, which it never did.</em></p>
<h2><em>Call for strike action during the week of September 2</em></h2>
<p><em>In light of management’s continued refusal to discuss, take the problems raised seriously and act to rectify them,&nbsp;we are calling on Spiders workers to go on strike during the week of September 2, 2024, on the basis of the demands set out above.</em></p>
<p><em>In particular, we will be organizing&nbsp;pickets on September 2 and 3 in front of the company’s offices and online on a Minecraft server&nbsp;created for the occasion.</em></p>
<p><em>We are inviting our relatives, friends, supporters, workers in the industry in general, journalists and political actors to join us at the pickets.</em></p>
<p><em>To help us strike, and if you have the means to do so, you can make a donation to the STJV strike fund, which has been activated for this strike at the request of the STJV section.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/08/stjv-strike-fund/">Instructions on how to donate can be found on this page</a>. Don’t hesitate to specify “Spiders” in the reference of your transfer. We’ll keep track of the sums paid to workers.</em></p>
<p><em>Workers at Spiders face many difficulties:</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>GROWING INSTABILITY</b>, because it is impossible for us to: know where we will be able to live in the future, know whether we will be able to have a fulfilling personal life, anticipate our long-term evolution at Spiders. But also because of low wages and a lack of certainty about increases over the next few years.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>A COMPLETE OPPOSITION TO ANTICIPATING PROBLEMS AND SECURING WORKING CONDITIONS</b>&nbsp;due to : an ideological stance held by the company’s management and its refusal to acknowledge issues, the rolling back, for no good reason, of arrangements that had been in place for years, as well as rising pressure on the workers’ shoulders.</em></p>
<p><em>►<b>&nbsp;GLOBAL MISMANAGEMENT:&nbsp;</b>the studio tripling in size in 3 years and the launch of two lines of production side-by-side were, in all likelihood, not anticipated or planned for by the company. Its structure has evolved very little, if at all.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>GROWING TURNOVER AND RECRUITMENT PROBLEMS:</b>&nbsp;many veteran workers are leaving the company. In response, the company is making little efforts to try and retain them, to find suitable in-house successors, or to make the company attractive to hiring prospects.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS IN ACHIEVING GENDER EQUALITY AND PARITY:</b>&nbsp;the gender balance at Spiders remains well below the already low industry average, and women employee’s average wage is considerably lower than men’s.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>A BLATANT LACK OF TRANSPARENCY ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANY:</b>&nbsp;its management, budgets, plannings, financial health, working conditions… The company’s strategy remains unknown, no explanation is given for decisions imposed, and their source is often hidden from us.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>PROBLEMS ARE NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, AND THEIR VERY EXISTENCE DENIED:</b>&nbsp;despite having been brought up with management for years through every possible channel, problems are either ignored or worse, their very existence is outright denied and questioned.</em></p>
<p><em>►<b>&nbsp;A DIFFICULT PRODUCTION CYCLE FOR GREEDFALL 2:&nbsp;</b>as a direct consequence of these problems, there is widespread anxiety and a loss of interest among employees. For many, it translates into a fear of releasing a disappointing game at the end and/or a feeling of shame over their own work. For some, it’s the last straw that pushes them to look for work elsewhere.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>MANAGEMENT’S ADAMANT REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE COLLECTIVE ACTION:&nbsp;</b>at the slightest opportunity, management is reducing everything to confidential individual negotiation, accentuating inequalities between workers and paving the way for discrimination and abuse.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>MANAGEMENT’S SENSELESS REFUSAL TO ACCEPT WORKER REPRESENTATION:&nbsp;</b>they challenge and belittle the legitimacy of staff representatives and collective expression in any shape or form, while also refusing to consult workers themselves.</em></p>
<p><em>►&nbsp;<b>NEGOTIATIONS WITH NO POSSIBLE COMPROMISES:&nbsp;</b>the mission of workers’ representatives, as well as negotiations on wages and work from home, are impeded by the management’s infantilizing contempt for workers and its refusal to enforce its obligations, particularly when it comes to sharing information.</em></p>
<p>A much longer and detailed letter has also been published by STJV, and t<a href="https://www.stjv.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Open-letter-to-Spiders-management-public-version.pdf">hat letter can be accessed at this link</a>. Spiders has been contacted for comment about the upcoming strike, and we will publish the studio’s response if and when we receive one.</p>

<div>



<div>
<div><p>Today, the Backerkit campaign for <em>Old Gods of Appalachia Deeper Still</em> went live. The campaign is to produce new expansions for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/old-gods-of-appalachia-ttrpg-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Old Gods of Appalachia</em> TTRPG</a>, which was successfully crowdfunded on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/old-gods-of-appalachia-ttrpg-backed-in-11-minutes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter last year</a>. Like that initial campaign, this campaign was fully funded on day one, doubling its initial funding goal.</p>

<p>According to the campaign page, <em>Old Gods of Appalachia Deeper Still</em> will produce three new books for the Old Gods of Appalachia TTRPG. In addition, the campaign provides new licensed accessories as add-ons.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/old-gods-of-appalachia-deeper-still-book-artwork.jpg?itok=zUteU-zP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/old-gods-of-appalachia-deeper-still-book-artwork.jpg?itok=1_tPvOX3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these new books is <em>Dig Your Own Grave</em>. It is a supplement with new player options, including new foci, backgrounds, equipment, and player intrusions. <em>All Your Gods Are Dead</em> is a GM supplement filled with new NPCs, cyphers, and artifacts. The third book is <em>Come Hell Or High Water</em>, a prewritten adventure book.</p>
<p>For hardcore fans, <em>Come Hell or High Water</em> will include new material on various sites from the original podcast. One of these sites are the Walker House, which was the focus of the show's inaugural story. This new material is personally written by co-creators Steve Shell and Cam Collins.</p>
<p>The add-ons in the <em>Old Gods of Appalachia Deeper Still</em> campaign are few but enticing. In addition to a new Resource Deck to help speed up play, there are paper props, a light-up witch jar, licensed t-shirts and hats, and a dice set with a tin branded by the Barrow &amp; Locke Mining Company.</p>
<p>The different pledge levels for <em>Old Gods of Appalachia Deeper Still</em> are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Shadows At The Threshold for $40:</strong> A physical book and PDF of either <em>Dig Your Own Grave</em>, <em>All Your Gods Are Dead</em>, or <em>Come Hell or High Water</em></li>
<li><strong>Echoes From The Dark for $110:</strong> PDFs and physical copies of all three supplements</li>
<li><strong>Into The Whispering Deep for $180:</strong> Physical copies and PDFS of all three supplements, Resource Deck 2, Prop Set, and dice set with tin.</li>
<li><strong>The Darkness Stares Back for $290:</strong> Everything in the Into The Whispering Deep level, a Jack's Fate Pendant, Witch Jar, a <em>Deeper Still</em> T-Shirt, and baseball cap.</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Old Gods of Appalachia Deeper Still</em> campaign has raised $238,962, more than double its initial funding goal of $100,000. The campaign ends September 20.</p>

<p>At Gamescom Opening Night Live on August 20, one of the biggest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcements was the confirmation</a> that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was heading to PlayStation 5 (PS5). Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Indiana Jones creative director Axel Torvenius and design director Jens Andersson spoke of the game coming to PS5 and their thoughts on the move.</p>



<p>Neither person would go into details on the decision making behind bringing the game to PS5 after its console exclusivity window with Xbox ends. Rather, they focused on the excitement of it simply happening.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-the-studio-thinks-of-indiana-jones-on-ps5">What The Studio Thinks Of Indiana Jones On PS5</h2>



<p>“From MachineGames’ point of view, we are super thrilled and excited over the fact we will be able to be on PlayStation next year as well,” Torvenius said. “The more people that can play the game – who can see all the passion and love we have put into this project and all the hard work – the merrier.”</p>



<p>Andersson added that it’s something the studio wanted to do from the start. He also said that the extra time after the game’s launch in December gives them more time to prepare it for the PS5 while clarifying that the technology used for development can handle multiple platforms.</p>



<p>“This is also the opportunity to mention our technology is based on id Tech,” he said. “We have our own, modified, version of id Tech, but it is originally a multi-platform engine. So we have a great start to it already.”</p>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on December 9</a> for Xbox Series X|S and PC.

<p>PGL has officially announced its Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) 2025 and 2026 schedules, preparing gamers for an intense two years of esports action with the popular shooter. Being one of the largest esports tournament-hosting organizations in the world, PGL plans to deliver the CS2 competition fans will want (and need).</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stand-aside-esl-pgl-plans-to-take-over-the-cs2-scene">Stand Aside ESL, PGL Plans To Take Over The CS2 Scene</h2>



<p>With ESL holding a large majority of the massive esports events, it seems like many other organizations, such as PGL, are planning to indulge in the CS2 scene. The popular first-person shooter has had a hold on gamers for over a decade now, making it one of the most popular esports out there. The game also has some of the largest prize pools in the industry.</p>



<p>PGL plans to host various Tier 1 tournaments throughout the globe starting in 2025. Here is their schedule for the next two years.</p>



<h4 id="h-pgl-2025-cs2-competitive-schedule">PGL 2025 CS2 Competitive Schedule:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>PGL on FiRe Buenos Aires 2025</strong>: February 13th – 23rd – Teatro Gran Rex</li>



<li><strong>PGL Bucharest 2025</strong>: April 3rd – 13th – PGL Studios</li>



<li><strong>PGL Astana 2025</strong>: May 8th – 18th – Barys Arena</li>



<li><strong>PGL Belgrade 2025</strong>: October 23rd – November 2nd – Belgrade Arena</li>



<li><strong>PW CAC 2025</strong>: October 1st – 23rd – Location TBD </li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<h4 id="h-pgl-2026-cs2-competitive-schedule">PGL 2026 CS2 Competitive Schedule:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>PGL on FiRe Buenos Aires 2026</strong>&nbsp;– February 12th – 22nd – Estadio Mary Terán de Weiss</li>



<li><strong>PGL Bucharest 2026</strong>&nbsp;– April 2nd – 12th – PGL Studios</li>



<li><strong>PGL Astana 2026</strong>: May 7th – 17th – Barys Arena</li>



<li><strong>PGL Belgrade 2026</strong>: August 6th – 16th – Belgrade Arena</li>



<li><strong>PGL on FiRe São Paulo</strong>: October 1st – 11th – Location TBD</li>



<li><strong>PGL Barcelona 2026:</strong>&nbsp;October 22nd – November 1st – Location TBD</li>
</ul>



<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>



<p>The competitive schedule begins this upcoming February (2025), with plenty of massive tournaments happening throughout the next few years. </p>



<p>With most major Counter-Strike tournaments transitioning to CS2, and many players quitting because of it, it will be interesting to see where the competitive season goes from here. </p>

It's now called Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, and it's coming out in spring of next year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Guardians of Azuma takes place in, well, Azuma, a land that underwent something called the "Celestial Collapse" some time ago. Since that time, the four seasons have yet to return to the land. You play as a hero who awakens with no memories and is greeted by Woolby, a creature with a connection to the dragon god. As an earth dancer, your job is to restore nature to Azuma and bring back the missing runes.</p><p>It's Rune Factory, so you'll spend a lot of time sprucing up a farm and various other locations, all while bringing back the seasons and the gods that govern them. You'll rebuild villages inspired by traditional Japan, and unlock various new and returning festivals. We got glimpses of what may be marriageable townsfolk and the marriage ceremony itself, too. And as usual, there are two possible protagonists, a man and a woman, but you can befriend or romance any eligible bachelor regardless of gender.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The 10 Best Tactics RPGs</h3></div></output><p>Unlike the numbered Rune Factory games, Guardians of Azuma seems to have far, far more of a combat-focus and the trailer showcases a number of action sequences and plots revolving around the conflict between two sides, and two dragons. It looks like we even get to ride one of them.</p><p>There's a lot to appreciate in the Guardians of Azuma trailer, and it certainly looks like an upgrade from Rune Factory 5, especially in the combat department. I <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rune-factory-5-review">gave Rune Factory 5 a 6/10 in my review</a>, saying it had "much of the mechanical depth that made its predecessor so enjoyable, but none of the improvements one would expect from a leap to a new, more powerful platform." </p><p>Hopefully Guardians of Azuma turns out to be an improvement in more than just appearance when it launches in the spring.

<p>A combination documentary and classic game compilation called <em>Tetris Forever</em> is headed to PC, Nintendo Switch, and other platforms later this year, according to an announcement.</p>
<p>The game will include 15 Tetris games, from an "accurate" version of the first <em>Tetris</em> for the Electronika 60 to an NES version of the game and more, including <em>Tetris 2 + Bombliss</em>, <em>Super Tetris 3</em>, and <em>Tetris Battle Gaiden</em>, among others.</p>
<p>In addition to that, it will feature a new take called <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>, which will see players jumping "between gameplay styles from across the series" in real time as they complete each board. The game will support up to four players.</p>
<p>The game is developed by Digital Eclipse, which previously made waves with a docu-game called <em>The Making of Karateka</em> that combined the classic game with documentary footage. It also made a remaster of the original <em>Wizardry</em>.
</p><p><em>Tetris Forever</em> is the latest in the same docu-game series that included <em>The Making of Karateka</em>. As such, the classic games will be presented in an interactive digital museum-like format and will be accompanied by over an hour of documentary clips "about the history of <em>Tetris</em> and its key players."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p><em>Tetris Forever</em> was announced as part of a Nintendo Direct stream this morning. The reveal focused on the experience of playing the game on the Nintendo Switch and also noted that the original NES version of <em>Tetris</em> is coming to Nintendo Switch Online's classic game library this winter.</p>
<p>However, the game also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180240/Tetris_Forever/">appeared on Steam</a>, so there will be a PC release. Releases on other consoles are likely as well. The Steam page says the game is coming sometime before the end of this year but doesn't get more specific than that. There's no pricing information yet, either.</p>

                <p>Comic book fans--and especially superhero fans--have a reputation for paying attention to even the smallest details of a hero's costume. But the latest update for Insomniac's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-2-review-web-warriors/1900-6418134/" data-ref-id="1900-6418134">Spider-Man 2</a> includes a detail that few superhero devotees would have even noticed. Yet some fans did notice, and Insomniac credits the community feedback for the change.</p><p>Via <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/29656891831309-Version-1-003-001-Release-Notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insomniac's home page</a>, Peter Parker's suit from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has been slightly modified. The soles of the costume have now been changed from red to black to better reflect the outfit as depicted in the film. It's a minor change in the grand scheme of things, but Insomniac still went ahead and made it alongside some other small fixes.</p><p>The current update also addresses an issue with Spider-Man's Last Stand and Webbed suits where the Spider logo clipped through the chest and back, respectively. Additionally, Insomniac states that the update has "additional stability and fixes" and should remedy a commonly reported crash. Beyond that, there isn't anything else cited in the current update.</p><p>Spider-Man 2 players are also eager to see if the game will be getting any additional DLC story drops. Marvel's Spider-Man launched in 2018 with an announcement that its three-part DLC, The City That Never Sleeps, would follow shortly thereafter. Sony and Insomniac have yet to announce any similar plans for Spider-Man 2. The inevitable sequel may still be a few years away, but Insomniac is working on its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/" data-ref-id="1100-6516081">Wolverine</a> game in the meantime..</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamescom-2024-a-record-breaking-year-for-the-world-s-largest-games-event<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamescom 2024, held from August 20th to 24th, once again affirmed its status as the world's premier gaming event. The event attracted a staggering 335,000 visitors from around 120 countries to Cologne, reflecting the increasingly globalized nature of the games industry. As well as the vast consumer show, Gamescom also welcomed over 32,000 trade visitors this year and featured close to 1,500 exhibitors from 64 countries, with 48 national pavilions showcasing the international diversity of the gaming ecosystem.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Devcom, Gamescom's sister event focused on the developer community, also hit new heights, with 5,000 visitors, representing over 1,600 companies from 83 countries. This was a 45% increase compared to 2023. Meanwhile, Gamescom boasted a record-breaking online engagement, particularly with its Opening Night Live, which garnered over 40 million video views – double the number from the previous year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The growth of the show has been greatly assisted by the increasing presence of a wider range of global companies. Whereas in the past, most of the interest in the show was driven by traditional Western and Japanese publishers, these days Chinese and Korean companies like Mihoyo, Kingsoft, and Krafton provide some of the biggest attractions on the show floor. The increased prominence of emerging players from regions like China, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia is signaling a shift in industry dynamics.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Global publishers take the lead">Global publishers take the lead</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The increasing presence of these new players has been particularly crucial in light of the decreasing focus on physical events by many of the industry's traditional giants. Both Sony and Nintendo opted to skip Gamescom this year, with Microsoft the only platform holder opting to invest in a large presence on the expo floor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In many ways, however, this was a sign of the increasingly divergent strategy being pursued by Xbox compared to the other two console platforms. The most striking aspect of Xbox's vast booth was the presence of numerous third-party games. Titles from Ubisoft, Epic Games, and Mihoyo were prominently featured, with no distinction drawn between first-party and third-party-games—a physical representation of Xbox's content-first strategy, which was further emphasized by the announcement that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will be released on PlayStation 5 a few months after its Xbox launch later this year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These moves are part of a steady shift from a hardware-centric approach to a broader focus on establishing Xbox as a leading games publisher. This is a move that feels very much in keeping with the content-first focus of Gamescom which has been enthusiastically embraced by Korean and Chinese publishers who have now firmly taken their place as leading draws for Gamescom visitors. This year's event saw Tencent-owned Funcom revealed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dune: Awakening</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, an open-world survival game based on the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dune</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> books and movies, and NetEase showcased </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Rivals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a multiplayer shooter leveraging Marvel's popular IP. Meanwhile forthcoming Korean releases </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The First Berserker: Khazan</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mecha BREAK</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> attracted large crowds despite having no existing IP to lean on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chinese games companies are increasingly focused on international expansion, driven in part by the uncertain regulatory environment at home. Unpredictable game approval processes and strict limits on playtime for younger players are major sources of volatility. To navigate these challenges, Chinese studios are pursuing a strategy of hedging against domestic uncertainty by marketing their games overseas and investing in and acquiring Western developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A more recent development is the direct launch of new titles by Chinese developers in international markets. However, this strategy comes with significant challenges, as localization requires more than just language translation. Adapting game design, user interfaces, and monetization strategies to suit Western tastes is crucial. While mobile gaming dominates in China, Western markets have a stronger focus on PC and console, further complicating these companies' global ambitions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A prime example of Chinese games making waves internationally is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was first showcased at Gamescom last year. The game generated significant buzz, with visitors waiting up to five hours to try the demo. Released during the week of Gamescom 2024, it quickly became the second-most popular title ever on Steam, reaching 2.1 million concurrent players on its launch date. Although Steam data indicates that most players are based in China, the game's global appeal is undeniable, marking a significant milestone in the international success of Chinese-developed games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="AI becomes increasingly visible">AI becomes increasingly visible</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many of these same players are also at the forefront of one of the biggest trends visible at Gamescom this year: the growing adoption of AI. While controversies around copyright, job replacement, and other issues has led most Western developers to take a cautious stance towards AI, it's increasingly clear that Asian companies are pursuing more aggressive experimentation with a variety of AI technologies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nvidia used the event to showcase its ACE "digital human" technology which has been used by Chinese developer Perfect World and Korea's Seasun to create player-facing conversational AI agents. Perfect World's implementation—which is just a tech demo for now—featured a fully-animated 3D character called Yun Ni capable of engaging in fairly complex conversation in English or Chinese and reading visual cues via webcam. However, the cloud-based model based on Open AI's GPT-4o introduced a large amount of latency, which together with Yun Ni's rather wooden delivery made anything approaching natural dialog impossible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another ACE demo featured a live production game, Seasun's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mecha BREAK</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which is set for release in 2025 and was one of the biggest attractions on the show floor this year. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mecha BREAK</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the AI model runs locally rather than from the cloud. But while this alleviates latency issues, it means relying on a significantly less powerful language model which is noticeably less accurate in understanding inputs and less able to offer relevant and naturalistic answers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given these limitations, Seasun has positioned its AI-powered character as an in-game assistant—more a replacement for wiki pages than a full-blown character. A similar implementation is being used in Krafton's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inzoi</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where the game's cat mascot leverages AI to answer player queries. Ultimately, this is a fairly limited first step towards conversational AI agents which will provide some novelty and perhaps a modicum of convenience but is clearly far short of revolutionary. It's notable too that the limiting factor in the above cases towards fuller application of player-facing is the capacity of the technology itself rather than the willingness of developers to leverage it. Krafton and Seasun are pushing the tech as far as it will go right now and the results at this point are not that exciting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead, it's far more likely that a bigger impact will be seen on game production rather than eye-catching live in-game implementations. A recent high-profile example is the use of AI voicework in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Finals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Embark Studios (which is majority-owned by South Korea's Nexon) controversially used AI to generate in-game voiceovers, but the AI-generated lines are pre-recorded, not generated on the fly. Whatever the ethics of this approach, it does have the major upsides of there being no need for the game to share resources with an AI model and ensuring the developers have full control over the in-game content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though most companies are opting for a low-profile approach to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamescom-2024-a-record-breaking-year-for-the-world-s-largest-games-event#_msocom_1">[GJ1]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamescom-2024-a-record-breaking-year-for-the-world-s-largest-games-event#_msocom_2">[LD2]</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;their AI experiments, there is no doubt that the use of various forms of AI in game development is spreading rapidly. There were several AI tool startups visible in the B2B area of the show like Scenario (asset generation) and X&amp;Immersion (voice and dialogue)—just two of more than 100 companies offering AI tools for game development tracked in Omdia's latest </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Games Tech Market Landscape.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a combined consumer and trade event, Gamescom's ability to crystalize a wide variety of trends from the globalization of the publishing landscape, to the growth and limits of AI at a single event is a key element of its continued success. While it may host fewer blockbuster announcements than the expos of the past, the show's value to the industry is in many ways greater than ever.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Authors</h2><div><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Principal Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">George is a regular contributor to Game Developer and a principal analyst at Omdia, leading research into games and AR/VR markets.

            <p>
Clive Sinclair's ZX Spectrum is a truly iconic bit of 80s computer design, and readers of a certain age will have the opportunity to relive a youth spent palpating its rubber keys this November, when it returns to homes - with a bunch of included classic games and modern niceties thrown in - courtesy of Retro Games, the team behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-an-atari-400-mini-coming-in-march-with-25-included-games">this year's Atari 400 Mini</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Spectrum (as Retro Games is calling its new bit of old-school-inspired hardware) takes its design cues from the unforgettable 48K, with its rubber keys and iconic rainbow stripe - but, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/hands-on-the-spectrum-is-a-modern-love-letter-to-an-80s-computer-legend-rubber-keys-and-all/">per VGC</a>, its innards are a little more multi-generational, capable of emulating all the classic Spectrum variants: the 16K, 48K, Spectrum+ (AKA my first home computer), and 128K.
</p>
<p>
Notably, The Spectrum's rubber keyboard is fully functional, and there's support for a wide variety of USB controller devices, meaning purchasers have a decent number of options when it comes to playing its 48 bundled games - which include bona fide classics such as Head Over Heels, Jack the Nipper, Manic Miner, The Hobbit, Auf Wiedersehen Monty, and Skool Daze.

<p>
And if you've got a personal favourite not on the included list (hi Kokotoni Wilf and Pyjamarama), The Spectrum can also play your legally acquired Spectrum ROMs from a USB stick, with the likes of .z80, .tap, and .tzx file formats all supported. Furthermore, BASIC programming is possible on the machine, meaning I can finally finish typing up <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxv0SsvibDMTZ0xkNW5Id3NLVVk/view?resourcekey=0-zd1AmVtIaboWogtXloOIxA">The Mystery of Silver Mountain</a> 40 years after I started.
</p>
<p>
In terms of more modern-day niceties, The Spectrum can output at 720p via HDMI, with PAL (50Hz) and NTSC (60Hz) compatibility, and it support 4:3 and pixel perfect aspect ratios. 12 frames are available to surround gameplay, and the machine also features CRT filters and configurable border sizes. Additionally, four save slots are available per game, and it's possible to rewind gameplay by up to 40 seconds - meaning <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-set-willy">Jet Set Willy</a>'s Entrance to Hades need no longer be a one-way trip.
</p>
<p>
And if all that's tickled your nostalgia nubbin, The Spectrum - which also comes bundled with a 32-page Crash mini-magazine featuring reviews and articles - will cost £89.99/€99.99 when it launches on 22nd November. And here's a full list of those included games:

		<p>Team17 has announced Worms Armageddon Anniversary Edition for Nintendo Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, celebrating the game’s 25th anniversary on 26th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Worms Armageddon Anniversary Edition" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w-EoD-bXDCk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having come out all the way back in 1999, Worms Armageddon is still considered by many Worms fans to be the high point of the series and it quite impressively still clings onto a daily player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/217200/charts/">a few hundred people on Steam</a>. It’s continued to outshine the potentially better for online play Worms World Party, which had a remaster a few years ago, and level pegs with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/08/22/worms-wmd-review/">Worms WMD</a>, which is also a fine take on the classic 2D form that is somehow already 8 years old!</p>
<p>This Anniversary Edition takes the PC game and gives it the once over with modern improvements and touches to work on console – the game has actually had periodic updates on PC <a href="https://www.tus-wa.com/forums/announcements/worms-armageddon-v3-8-1-released-33051/">as recently as 2022</a>.</p>
<p>These bonus features and upgrades include:</p>

<ul>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> Optimized controller support for all consoles.</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> Achievements and Trophies</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> New display features such as modern aspect ratios, custom screen filters, enhanced HD and graphics options.</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> Fully playable Game Boy Color version of Worms Armageddon</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> An interactive museum that charts the history of the entire series. Featuring never-before-seen interviews with developers of the original and current games.</span></li>
<li><span data-contrast="auto"> New save system</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to head online, you’ll be able to play with up to six players teaming up or competing. The only caveat is that there’s not cross-play, so Switch, PlayStation and Xbox gamers are being kept separate – cross-gen play is possible, though.</p>

<p>The original Epic Mickey was released in 2010 for the Nintendo Wii. It was developed by the now-closed Junction Point Studios. The remaster of the game is being developed by Purple Lamp and Disney Games. The game’s original director Warren Spector helped with this new version of the game. As part of the remake, the game was developed in Unreal Engine as opposed to the Gamebryo engine from the first title.</p>







<p>Epic Mickey: Rebrushed launches on September 24 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. </p>

<p>Aside from the numerous optimization issues plaguing the overall experience, one thing stood out when I first started playing Star Wars Outlaws. The controls felt awkward and strange for some reason, but I couldn’t quite understand why. Then, it hit me. They’ve swapped standard controls. You use the analog sticks to interact with everyone and everything, which feels cumbersome and unintuitive. Thankfully, you can change your controls in Star Outlaws, and yes, it does make a difference!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-change-controls-in-star-wars-outlaws">How to Change Controls in Star Wars Outlaws</h2>



<p>First and foremost, you can swap controls by opening your game’s pause menu, selecting <strong>Settings</strong>, and then navigating to <strong>Controls</strong>. From there, choose <strong>Show Controller Layout</strong>, and hit ‘RB” on your controller to switch from Default to <strong>Alternate</strong>. It’s a simple tweak that <strong>swaps the Melee from X to Right Stick and Interact from Right Stick to X</strong>.</p>



<p>By default, most games have the interact action tied to one of the face buttons, which makes it more intuitive to access quests, pick up items, and interact with the environment. But in Star Wars Outlaws, they opted for having the player click on the right analog stick, which doesn’t feel good, for lack of a better descriptor.</p>







<h2 id="h-should-you-use-a-controller-or-mouse-and-keyboard-for-star-wars-outlaws">Should You Use a Controller or Mouse and Keyboard for Star Wars Outlaws?</h2>



<p>If you’re playing on a PC, you have options. You can play with a controller or mouse and keyboard, both of which work well. However, from personal experience playing the game, I can tell you that it feels like Outlaws was designed from the ground up as a console title. As such, a controller feels more responsible and intuitive.</p>



<p>I recommend trying the game out with a controller to see how it feels. While you can certainly aim more accurately with a mouse and keyboard, movement, flying, and driving feel better with a controller. </p>



<hr>



<p>Much of the game revolves around understanding the various controls, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-lockpick-star-wars-outlaws/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockpicking mini-game</a>. Use what works best for you!</p>

                <p>At the Xbox Games Showcase this year, Microsoft officially announced the next entry in the Gears series, and it's going back in time. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day/" data-ref-id="5000-631971">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, as it's called, is coming to Xbox and PC in the future. Of all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5460/" data-ref-id="2900-5460">biggest reveals at the Xbox Games Showcase 2024</a>, this was arguably the biggest.</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement is good news for fans who wanted to see the series continue, even if it may be going in the opposite direction on the timeline compared to what fans may have expected. Gears 4 ended on a dramatic cliffhanger, so some fans were hoping to see Gears 5 instead of a prequel, but that could be a story that's being saved for another day.</p><p dir="ltr">In this post, we're rounding up everything we know so far about Gears of War: E-Day, including what the story involves, who's developing it, what platforms to expect the game to come to, and more.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_Gears_of_War__E_Day_be_released_">When will Gears of War: E-Day be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Preorder_Gears_of_War__E_Day">Preorder Gears of War: E-Day</a></li><li><a href="#Watch_the_Gears_of_War__E_Day_trailer">Watch the Gears of War: E-Day trailer</a></li><li><a href="#Gears_of_War__E_Day_platforms">Gears of War: E-Day platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Gears_of_War__E_Day_story__setting__and_characters">Gears of War: E-Day story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#Gears_of_War__E_Day_game_engine">Gears of War: E-Day game engine</a></li><li><a href="#Who_s_developing_Gears_of_War__E_Day_">Who's developing Gears of War: E-Day?</a></li><li><a href="#Gears_of_War__E_Day_development_news">Gears of War: E-Day development news</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_Gears_of_War__E_Day_be_released_">When will Gears of War: E-Day be released?</h2><p>The Gears of War: E-Day announcement trailer did not include a release date, or even a release window, for the game. That's not uncommon, however, as plenty of games are announced without any indication as to when they might release.</p><h2 id="Preorder_Gears_of_War__E_Day">Preorder Gears of War: E-Day</h2><p>It's still very early days, and fans cannot preorder Gears of War: E-Day anywhere just yet. Game Pass subscribers won't have to preorder, though, as the game will launch into the catalog like every other Microsoft game does.</p><h2 id="Watch_the_Gears_of_War__E_Day_trailer">Watch the Gears of War: E-Day trailer</h2><p>A trailer for Gears of War: E-Day aired during the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024, providing the first--and so far only--look at the upcoming third-person shooter. The somber and intense trailer, set to a version of "Mad World" that Gears fans no doubt recall, did a good job of setting the tone for what to expect.

X|S and PC. Microsoft is bringing some of its games these days to rival systems like PS5 and Switch, but for now, Gears of War: E-Day has been announced only for Xbox and PC. Microsoft is working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">next-generation Xbox console</a>, but it's too soon to say if this new Gears of War game will show up there.</p><h2 id="Gears_of_War__E_Day_story__setting__and_characters">Gears of War: E-Day story, setting, and characters</h2><p>The cinematic trailer shows a young Marcus Fenix struggling with a single Locust, something he's not prone to doing in the later games--but this a greener, less experienced Marcus.</p><p>Gears of War: E-Day takes place 14 years before the events of Gears of War. It focuses on Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago coming home to "face a new nightmare" in the Locust horde. The game serves as an origin story for the Gears of War series, and the name E-Day refers to Emergence Day. This is the day when the subterranean monsters rose up from below the surface to lay waste to humans.</p><p>While the game is called E-Day, referring to that one fateful day, the game itself will span multiple days and not just one, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gears-of-war/gears-of-war-e-day-director-says-the-new-shooter-will-absolutely-be-doing-more-linear-levels-instead-of-gear-5s-open-ended-maps/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to the developers.</a></p><h2 id="Gears_of_War__E_Day_game_engine">Gears of War: E-Day game engine</h2><p>Gears of War: E-Day is in the works at The Coalition using Unreal Engine 5, which is the latest version of Epic's game development toolsuite. Microsoft says Gears of War: E-Day will deliver "unprecedented graphical fidelity." As of yet, however, no gameplay footage has been revealed.</p><h2 id="Who_s_developing_Gears_of_War__E_Day_">Who's developing Gears of War: E-Day?</h2><p>Gears of War: E-Day is in development at the Microsoft-owned Canadian game studio The Coalition. The studio previously made Gears 5 and Gears of War 4. The studio also assisted 343 Industries with Halo Infinite.</p><h2 id="Gears_of_War__E_Day_development_news">Gears of War: E-Day development news</h2><p>Gears 5 changed things up with its more open-ended maps, but Gears of War: E-Day will pull that back somewhat and bring back the franchise's more traditional linear levels. Creative director Matt Searcy told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gears-of-war/gears-of-war-e-day-director-says-the-new-shooter-will-absolutely-be-doing-more-linear-levels-instead-of-gear-5s-open-ended-maps/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, "We know for sure that Gears, you know, has those linear, epic moments in them."</p><p>For Gears of War: E-Day, Searcy promised that the team will "absolutely be doing more of that" as it relates to more linear missions.</p><p>As for continuing the Gears of War story chronologically speaking, Microsoft said "other ongoing stories" in the franchise will be told... eventually. However, the "collective passion for such an iconic origin story was simply too great to ignore," <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft said.</a></p><p>Another important thing to know is Gears of War: E-Day is not a spin-off. "It's a completely new entry to the mainline series, set earlier in the timeline. The events of the game not only serve as an exciting origin tale of two beloved characters, but it also adds detail and context to this period that will resonate through stories that will follow," Microsoft said.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on Gears of War: E-Day as we learn more.</p>

As the hunter traipsed through maze-like jungles or arid deserts, they’d bump into creatures that fit those biomes, which made up the hierarchy of monster in a given region. Everything from the lowliest critter at the bottom of the food chain to the apex predator at the top was accounted for, and getting to see these monsters interact and even fight each other was (and still is) a thrill.</p><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>doubles down on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-trailer-scoutflies-classes-minimap-1851613731&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-trailer-scoutflies-classes-minimap-1851613731">many of these features</a></span>, especially the focus on living ecosystems, and expands on or refines just about everything else about the experience to make it the most razor sharp installment in the series yet. It refreshes the slinger—the hunter’s slingshot—into a much more dynamic tool in their repertoire, and even provides a mount (a feature introduced in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-rise-is-tough-to-get-into-as-a-newcomer-1846579126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-rise-is-tough-to-get-into-as-a-newcomer-1846579126"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a></span>) to ensure the game teems with life from the very get go.</p><h2 id="h158159"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>hands-on</strong></h2><p>After a few cutscenes established <em>Wilds </em>’primary characters , I was almost immediately launched directly into the action-packed opening which had me leaping onto a Seikret mount and pursuing a kid being hunted by a pack of sandworms through the desert. The heavily on-rails section does a pretty good job of introducing and highlighting many of the basic movements players will become used to, such as farming slinger ammo from small enemies, using its new grappleshot function to tear apart pieces of the environment, and using the mount to navigate tough terrain. That it manages to communicate these mechanics while keeping things exciting is key to <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. The <em>Monster Hunter </em>series is famous for its complexity and the sooner it can demystify that notion and get you straight into its top-notch combat, the better.</p><p>Speaking of which, after you manage to save the kid, you are sent on the game’s first proper hunt against the Chatacabara, a large amphibian monster that covers its weak points with protective rock armor. At this point, I grabbed my insect glaive (my chosen weapon of the past few <em>Monster Hunter </em>games) and immediately fell back into my old rhythm. For fans of the series who have played several games, don’t expect <em>Wilds </em>to be an immense departure from business as usual. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, y’know? Capcom reworked some of the weapons—and it breaks my heart that you can no longer bounce off of the end of an aerial glaive attack—but some time with it, the switch axe, and the light bowgun proves that the developers aren’t doing away with the solid foundation that’s been built over the series’ history.</p><p>Instead, <em>Wilds </em>is trying to streamline the often laborious process of hunting a monster to ensure that everyone who picks up the game can feel like they’re getting the best experience. You still need to track monsters down via scoutflies that emit a glowing trail, and fights are functionally the same as they always have been, with parties of up to four players picking away at massive creatures with the series’ 14 main weapons, and a slew of other tools and traps. There are some new things in <em>Wilds </em>though that should make players feel way more impactful, like the new Focus feature.</p><p>Focus allows the player to aim their attacks by holding down the left trigger and summoning a reticle, which <em>is </em>a significant change for folks who use melee weapons. By focusing, attacks can now be delivered with more precision than ever, which lends itself well to picking at weak spots and opening up wounds on monsters, which will glow red when in Focus mode. While focusing does little to change your moveset, it does provide a Focus Strike which is tied to the right bumper, and every weapon has its own. These high-powered moves are essential to targeting wounds to maximize damage, which can speed up hunts, break off parts of the monster that can be turned into gear, and even stagger them.</p><p><em>Monster Hunter </em>players have gotten by this far without such a tool, but I think it’s a game-changer. For beginners, it will be handy to be able to attack with more precision than is usually the case. I spent my first several hours of <em>Monster Hunter World </em>fumbling my attacks before I learned to read enemy patterns and pick my moments. For players at every level, Focus now tells you exactly where you should be targeting by highlighting wounds and it does so subtly. Any feature that communicates vital information without bludgeoning the player with a billion tooltips (or worse, a garish new bit of UI or overlay) is a win in my book, and I see no reason why everyone shouldn’t be using Focus by default in <em>Wilds</em>.</p><h2 id="h158160"><a id=""></a><strong>The thrill of the hunt</strong></h2><p>The hunt itself went smoothly. The Chatacabra’s a great first monster, because it’s just menacing enough to where if you don’t take it too seriously it could sneak up on you, but it’s also incredibly slow. That means that it telegraphs its moves significantly ahead of time, giving even the most nerve-wracked hunters enough time to dodge out of the way. The Seikret mount picks you up and immediately hauls ass when summoned, which is incredibly handy for getting out of a tough pickle like that, and their ability to hold a second weapon—which needs to be unlocked down the road— will massively streamline advanced hunts.</p><p>Soon after finishing that first hunt, we were dropped into a later point that did have more features unlocked, such as a mount with a second weapon, and allowed to hunt the Doshaguma, which has featured prominently in most of the game’s pre-release material. In an interesting change, the Doshaguma is actually a herd monster, and is surrounded by a pack of smaller versions of itself that are just as scrappy as the alpha. In what would turn out to be my favorite part of the preview, we had to actually fire large dung pods (yes, shit) from our slinger which exploded upon impact and sent the lesser Doshagumas scattering, isolating the leader. It’s a small but incredible touch that makes it feel like <em>Wilds </em>ecosystems really are as dense as they are billed and that every bit of it, including animal droppings, does in fact feed back into these intertwining environments.</p><p>With the Doshaguma backed into a corner, a tooltip suggested I fire an SOS flare, a mechanic that calls for players to join you in a multiplayer hunt, and gang up on the poor thing. Since my session was offline, I was instead immediately greeted by a full party of AI companions that admirably held their own and made fantastic use of their weapons and traps to aid me. Part-way through this really one-sided fight, the sky darkened, lightning began to come down, and the Doshaguma absconded into the darkness in a weakened state, where it probably hoped to escape any more hardship. Instead, it fled into the desert where it was greeted by a Rey Dau, a wyvern that spews lightning and did the job of weakening the Doshaguma with aplomb for me. After narrowly surviving the run-in with the apex predator of the region, the Doshaguma finally fell to a few more blows once I followed it back into a small cave. </p><p>All the while, <em>Wilds </em>was also the most seamless time I’ve had in one of these titles. A new dynamic healing option in the radial menu made it so that I didn’t have to dig through my item pouch for the right potion while the Doshaguma treated me like a chew toy. After wrapping up my second hunt, which more or less ended the planned bit of the preview, all the materials I picked up were sent to my storage and I was set loose on the Windward Plains, rather than being sent back to the village. I tracked down a second Chatacabra, changed to the light bowgun from my mount, and took it on just to see how quickly I could acclimate to a weapon I don’t typically use. The transition was buttery smooth, and I triumphed over the monster in no time. I did so well I actually had time to even track down the sandworm monster that plagued the kid in the game’s opening, known as a Balahara, and though I didn’t get to finish the fight, it was funny to watch it run into <em>another </em>Rey Dau. That thing just can’t stop inserting itself into beef!<br></p><p>I’m already dying to get back to those windswept dunes and see what further monster interactions I can find and exploit. I can’t wait to get more time with Focus mode on all the weapons and learn what the best loadouts are based on the monster I’m hunting.I’m excited at the prospect of apparently seamless multiplayer (and in the absence of that, competent AI companions) in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, especially since revisiting <em>World </em>recently reminded me of what a pain in the ass it could be. I’ve rarely left a preview so effusive, but <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>genuinely impressed me at just about every turn. Sure, it had some technical hitches, but given its ambitions, I don’t see how an in-progress build of the game wouldn’t have some small issues. On just about every other level though, <em>Wilds </em>is more than just solid, it’s immense. It cannot get here soon enough. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

These portals, dubbed Marvel Sparkle Circles by Deadpool, are the way characters traverse the cinematic multiverse, meaning that Gambit could make his way into the MCU proper. In a follow-up tweet Reynolds noted that a version of this scene can be seen in the movie on one of the TVA screens but that it was too small to notice the portal.</p><p>Gambit getting another chance would be a big win for fans and Tatum.

Tatum clearly has a passion for the character, and that movie remains one of the biggest what-if projects in Marvel cinematic history that fans constantly wish could have seen the light of day. His appearance in<em> Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> finally gave Tatum the chance to show off his take on the character, and it absolutely rocks. </p><p>The hope of this deleted scene is that <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> won’t be the end of Tatum’s tenure as Gambit, and that he could find his way into the larger MCU. With the appearance of the X-Men in the MCU only being a matter of time, it would make a lot of fans happy if Tatum could be part of that. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
