			<p>Today marked the first of <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-conducting-largest-franchise-playtests-to-ensure-the-games-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several public large-scale playtests</a> for Battlefield 6 and, inevitably, the first screenshots and gameplay leaked on the Web. We've embedded a couple of these leaks, which originated via Reddit, below. At the same time, the developers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j5jbil/battlefield_labs_community_update_gunplay_and/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a Community Update focused on gunplay and movement philosophy for the upcoming title.</p>
<p><em>We're designing the combat experience to ensure players of all skill levels can enjoy our gunplay and movement systems. Our goal is to offer gameplay that rewards skill with precise weapon feedback and movement options for veterans while providing an intuitive experience for new players to learn and enjoy.</em></p>
<p><em>For gunplay, we're exploring designs centered on helping you learn and develop skills and muscle memory through action, as weapons naturally signal their recoil direction. This feedback loop allows you to understand and adjust your aim, making it easier to handle different weapons. This system not only adds variety but also enhances each weapon's unique feel and play style.</em></p>
<p><em>Movement is also deeply integrated with gunplay, as your actions and targets are all part of the same cohesive combat experience. We aim to make movement both feel intuitive and rewarding to move within the world and during combat, but also when playing against someone using both the gunplay and movement systems to their maximum potential.</em></p>

<p><em>We’ve reduced the time it takes for bullets to appear on your screen from when you press fire. This change decreases input delay, makes shooting feel more responsive, and helps you better track and hit moving targets.</em></p>
<p><em>We're optimizing for a 60Hz tick rate, ensuring the game server more frequently updates the positions and actions for all players. This results in responsive gameplay across all platforms and inputs. You'll notice more precise shooting and movement, enhanced damage feedback, and more accurate representation of other players' positions and combat outcomes.</em></p>
<p><em>We've adjusted the recoil system to make the different weapon types feel unique when firing them. Through enhancements to gunplay recoil, camera shakes, and firing settles, each shot’s recoil direction now matches its gameplay angle. The weapon visually stabilizes the more accurate your handling is, making you feel like you're actually firing and controlling it.</em></p>
<p><em>To evolve the moment system we've revamped animations and reintroduced movement features such as crouch sprint, combat dive and landing roll, and added visual indicators to make it easier to understand when movements such as vaulting or leaning are possible.</em></p>

<p>As a reminder, Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has four studios</a> focused entirely on it. DICE is leading development on multiplayer; Motive (the studio behind the Dead Space remake) is crafting a 'meaty' single player campaign; Criterion is 'driving content experiences' across both single player and multiplayer; and Ripple Effect is working on what has only been described as a new experience fueled by the Battlefield DNA.</p>
<p>Following the underwhelming commercial launches of Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042, the third time has to be the charm for the franchise. The game doesn't have a release window yet, but it's likely EA will push to get it out at some point this Fall.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/625931/nintendo-switch-2-fcc-nfc-wi-fi-6-usb<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">is already official</a>, but there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24344718/nintendo-switch-2-specs-date-price-launch-games-mario-kart">a <em>lot</em> we still don’t know</a> — like, will Nintendo’s new handheld support the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/24/15041136/nintendo-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-amiibo-collectibles">NFC-equipped Amiibo figurines</a> that can wirelessly unlock content in games?</p></div><p>Today, it seems likely they will, because filings at the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) reveal the console will support NFC. They even specify that the RFID feature will be located in the right Joy-Con, just like it was in the original Switch.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is apparently designated the BEE-001, the company’s radio equipment test filings reveal, where “BEE” is Nintendo’s designator for the Switch 2 family of products, with “001” the main console, “014” the right Joy-Con, and “012” the left one.</p><p>Nintendo’s followed this pattern for decades; “DMG” was the original Game Boy, “DOL” was the GameCube, “RVL” was the Wii, and “HAC” was the original Nintendo Switch, as just a few examples.</p><p>You’ll also be able to charge the Nintendo Switch 2 from either its bottom USB-C port or its new top USB-C port, the filings reveal. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">Nintendo’s announcement tease</a> confirmed the Switch would have an extra USB-C port up top, but I think this is the first real confirmation of charging from both.</p><p>If you were hoping for faster Wi-Fi in your Switch 2, that’s pretty likely as well: the filings show it will support Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) networks with up to 80MHz of bandwidth, up from Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) on the original Switch. However, it doesn’t seem to have Wi-Fi 7 or Wi-Fi 6E, and it’s only crossed the FCC with tests for 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks, not the faster / shorter-range 6GHz band.</p><p>Just in case you have any doubts this might be some other <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251736/nintendo-mmwave-device-24ghz-fcc-filing">mystery Nintendo product</a> instead of a Switch, diagrams at the FCC show it being tested with and without attached controllers and with and without a dock:</p><p>It’s unclear from these tests whether the Nintendo Switch 2 has faster charging speed or more power when docked.</p><p>The original Switch shipped with an unusual adapter that charged at up to 15V and 2.6A. FCC filings show the Switch 2 is still rated for a maximum of 15V but also mention an AC adapter that goes up to 20V. Both or either of those could be USB-C PD, but we can’t properly guess at charging speed (in watts) without knowing the amperage.</p><p>We still don’t know exactly when the Switch 2 will be released, but Nintendo has said it’s coming sometime this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>It's nice to have alone time, at least until you have enough of that alone time to start wondering "okay, maybe I've had enough alone time?" </em></p><p><em>All of have spent our lives in different versions of being with and without people, be they friends, family, partners, or something else. And as one gets older, as those dynamics tend to become pretty familiar. </em></p><p><em>Safe. Predictable. Satisfying.</em></p><p><em>This week, Patrick's solo parenting while his wife is on a work trip, and it got him thinking about the way shifting into old ways of doing things—I'm single, baby!—don't always hold the same appeal as you get older.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>So Rob, my wife is away this week on a business trip. When I was younger, and especially so when I didn’t have kids, these kinds of moments were always a fun free-for-all. I’d shotgun television shows, burn through hours of video games, 100% slam a beer or two more than I should while out (or in), and absolutely and under no circumstances would I eat a salad.&nbsp;</p><p>My wife would always joke “so, what did you eat <em>today</em>” and the answer was almost certainly buffalo wings. Such antics are more reigned in now, because I’m in singularly in charge of shuttling two children to daycare and/or school, packing lunches, pick up and drop off for evening activities, and then finally juggling making dinner for three people, trying to understand how 3rd grade math works, and doing whatever it takes to make sure both kids are asleep by 9pm. By the end, my friend, all I want is a beer and to try and not fall asleep on the couch.</p><p>Oh, and I basically eat a side salad with every lunch and dinner these days.</p><p>Instead, what these weeks have become about is spending time with media that I do not have time for while my wife <em>is</em> around. We get, at best, an hour-ish of time to watch a show every night, before it’s time for me to play some video games and she heads to bed. We push that window open a little bigger on Friday and Saturday nights, where we usually watch a movie.&nbsp;</p><p>She is not, for example, a huge fan of watching exceptionally sad movies. You know, the kinds that people warn you about before watching? If it’s nominated for an Oscar, she’ll do it, but otherwise, those get stacked into a queue of movies I end up sneaking in when she’s away. This is how I will probably end up watching <em>We Live in Time</em>, the sad-sounding movie with Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield about deciding to have a kid even though she’s dying, this weekend.</p><p>But otherwise, our tastes are pretty in sync. With a few exceptions, we watch the same TV shows and watch the same movies because it means we get to spend more time together. I have a handful of shows (like, say, the terrific <em>Invincible</em>) I watch on my own because of work and she has her guilty pleasure shows (like, say, the apparently charming <em>Nobody Wants This</em>), but given our personal time constraints, finding overlap has huge benefits. It also means, however, I can’t watch shows I am deeply invested in (I’m looking at you, <em>Pitt</em>!!) until she returns.</p><p>Alas. There are other ways my life shifts, how my habits change, when my wife is gone for an extended period of time, but I’m curious what yours is like (or isn’t like) in the same situation.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@anthonytran?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Anthony Tran</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>I go through an arc. Day 1 and maybe into Day 2, it’s Rob Time, baby! Crank up the sound system, enjoy <em>Ronin </em>or <em>The Game </em>for the umpteenth time. Sorry, poodles, but dad’s going to be playing <em>Total War </em>in the living room tonight, or calling down strikes in <em>Helldivers</em>! Maybe in the evening, I’ll enjoy the coldest martini in history with a bowl of blood oranges on the side and watch <em>Deadwood </em>again. The world is my oyster!By Day 3, though, the novelty has worn off. The dogs are acting weird and sad, and evening video calls are not getting them back to their normal poodle-ish joys. I am probably already losing touch with normal schedules because now there’s less appeal in calling it a night rather than watching another episode of TV. So now I’m running on less sleep. There are things I want to watch but, like you alluded to, can’t really watch until MK is back. I have my hands completely full with the dogs and housework and so I’m more shut-in than usual. Outside of the people at the dog daycare and the people I record podcasts with, I’m not having conversations. </p><p>And let’s be real, the conversations you have with dog daycare folks are not like, super involving: “So her poop was good? Tilly was a little off her food this morning.”If the business trip is much longer than that, everything starts to go to seed a little bit. There’s not enough dishes to run the dishwasher, so naturally I just let things start piling up. I tell myself I should cook, feel unmotivated to cook just for myself, so eventually rummage in the fridge for something or make questionable delivery decisions.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-ep-8-sweet-vitriol-harmony-cobel-1851768452<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The term “filler” as it refers to television has its roots in anime, designating those episodes that either embellished upon the original manga source material or deviated from it entirely before returning to the main plot. It’s a specific phenomenon that highlights the complications of developing an animated series alongside a print version the show eventually outpaces. There are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/dragon-ball&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/dragon-ball" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entire online databases</a></span> built to guide those viewers who want to skip the padding and get to the good stuff. Nowadays, the term is routinely thrown at any episode of television that doesn’t drive the plot forward, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-apple-tv-mark-news-1851752137&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-apple-tv-mark-news-1851752137"><em>Severance</em></a></span>, Apple TV’s dystopian workplace mystery box show, is the latest series to have some of its fans slap the label on an excellent episode of television. The show’s second season is nearly complete, and its eighth episode, titled “Sweet Vitriol,” provided a key piece to its ongoing puzzle. But if you stick to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1j5dod3/severance_2x08_sweet_vitriol_episode_discussion/?sort=top&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1j5dod3/severance_2x08_sweet_vitriol_episode_discussion/?sort=top" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certain sides of the internet</a></span>, you’d think it was just 37 minutes of padding meant to fill this week’s slot in the release schedule and hold us back from learning the next great revelation. It’s like we’ve lost all sense of how to experience a story if it doesn’t constantly give us theory-crafting fodder.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In a way, this is a prison of <em>Severance</em>’s own making. The best mystery box shows are regimented and intentional, leading viewers by the hand through a dark hallway, illuminating only a few steps at a time before finally bringing us out the other side. <em>Severance</em>, not beholden to the 20+ episode season syndication deals that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-explained-dan-erickson-1851743150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-explained-dan-erickson-1851743150">undermined the pacing of shows like <em>Lost</em></a></span>, feels especially methodical, showing fans exactly what it wants them to see and letting them extrapolate over the next week about what it all means. Whereas a network show may be beholden to the whims of executives who decide to keep the story and its mysteries going beyond what its creators intended, the creators of <em>Severance </em>have the creative freedom to focus on a core mystery without worrying about such external pressures.</p><p>Series director Ben Stiller has been up front about how deliberately the <em>Severance </em>team has been developing the show. In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://collider.com/severance-season-3-plans-explained/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://collider.com/severance-season-3-plans-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Collider</em></a></span>, he explained that the team doesn’t want <em>Severance </em>to become a show that drags on forever just because it’s become successful, and that’s a key part of why its mystery works.</p><p>“You have a responsibility to the audience that you’re going somewhere with it,” Stiller told <em>Collider</em>. “That’s always been a part of it for us, really understanding where it’s heading to, and Apple’s been really supportive of that and been sensitive to what the story is and not saying, ‘Okay, this is something that has to keep going as long as it’s successful.’ It should go as long as the story goes, and that’s something we have an idea of, and we’re working towards as we’re starting up our Season 3 work.”</p><p>That intentionality is what makes the accusations that “Sweet Vitriol” is mere “filler” feel like missing the forest for the trees. At just 37 minutes, it’s the shortest episode in the show’s history, and it abandons the disconcerting severed floor at Lumon Industries entirely to focus on the exemplary Patricia Arquette’s Harmony Cobel. After fleeing Lumon following attempts by the company to remove her from her original position managing the MDR crew (or perhaps Lumon had something more permanent in mind), Cobel drives to a small, out-of-the-way factory town built by Lumon that’s practically deserted. It’s a haunting, dying reminder that a corporation will build up people and places just to abandon them the second they’re no longer useful. I’m sure the ex-manager found it clarifying to see the town where she was raised by Lumon as a child laborer desecrated and left to rot, even as its former citizens still praise Lumon founder Kier Eagan like a god.</p><p>But the rot runs deeper than a town left to die by its corporate overlords. Despite all the claims by fans that the episode is “filler” and offers nothing meaningful to the broader <em>Severance </em>mystery, it actually drops one of the biggest bombshells yet on the Lumon legacy, one that was worth an entire episode’s 37-minute runtime to lead into it. Cobel returns to her childhood home, which is on the outskirts of Lumon’s town and full of its own mysteries just like the Lumon Industries office. The difference is that most of those mysteries were explained by the end of an episode, rather than spread across a season and designed with theory-crafting in mind. Cobel’s aunt Sissy, a devout Lumon follower, is still here, still praising a corporate founder who left her and everyone else in this town for dead while chastising her niece for her apparent desertion of Lumon. Cobel takes a moment to grieve her lost mother, who she didn’t get to see in her final days because she was away devoting her life and labor to the company that raised her as their work dog.</p><p>All of this culminates in the revelation that it was Cobel herself who created the Severance chip, not the Eagans who have historically taken credit for the technology at the center of the show’s entire mystery. She gave up her mind, body, and soul to this company, and all it led to was her becoming a pariah erased from its history books. As Cobel claims her old schematics and leaves her childhood home once more, she essentially receives a phone call from the A plot as the main characters ask her to betray Lumon and help them dig deeper into its mysteries. After everything Cobel’s been through, how could she possibly say no?</p><p>If someone says “Sweet Vitriol” didn’t move the plot forward, I’d say, “My brother in Christ, this <em>is</em> the plot of <em>Severance</em>.” It’s as if some viewers only understand the concept of unraveling a mystery if it’s in the form of new facts that can be made into weekly theory-crafting TikToks in which they can guess what’s coming next. In a series like <em>Severance</em>,<em> </em>whose entire lore is built upon the fraught relationships people have to things like labor, corporate exploitation, and of course trying to find ways to avoid the unpleasant things in life by bisecting your brain, worldbuilding is done on the backs of characters, not the other way around. “Sweet Vitriol” is a character piece, revealing nearly everything there is to know about one of the most enigmatic figures in a series full of them, and these insights into her aren’t just some intrusive side story detracting from what <em>Severance </em>is “really” about. If your starting point when watching an episode of <em>Severance </em>is “What is Lumon doing?” you should also be asking “What has Lumon done?” and you’re not going to find answers to that by hanging out with people whose lives, most days, are only eight hours long. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following graduation, I make experimental games as a full-time job.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ginger</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The original prototype is an adaptation of the story of Jonah and the Whale. Jonah can’t visualize the world without the whale’s help and speech is the only thing Jonah can do. I set it up to discuss the relationship between body (the whale) and so-called soul (Jonah), but later on they were abstracted to organs and words.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I used Unity Engine with two plug-ins: Shapes by Freya Holmér and Book—Page Curl Pro by Abdullah Aldandarawy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Your previous IGF-nominated game, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/exploring-human-understanding-through-deciphering-kevin-1997-2077-s-invented-language">Kevin (1997-2077</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, explored language and meaning through a sprawling story told across notes in a made-up visual/hieroglyphic-like language players needed to decipher. In this game, the language players need to work through is words in a language you have created. What appealed to you about exploring language and meaning again? What drew you to do so with words players can say and pronounce? To do so with words at all?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I hope the world can be united together, but language barriers are everywhere. A well-known thing in one culture could be unknown to all elsewhere, which could cause difficulty with understanding others. The language in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kevin (1997-2077)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is emotionally personal as a result of pictorialization. After finishing it, I found a few questions about language remained unclear: Is it natural or artificial? Is it a carrier or an unseparated segment of knowledge? Is language essential to be loved?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To solve those questions, I made a general language this time which looks like a European language but with unconventional grammar (regarding regular perspective). The Latin alphabet and the languages within it play a significant role in the current world. A considerable portion of knowledge is only recorded in those languages. What if we completely stripped away all external references—for instance, we know the word “car,” but what if someone has never seen a car, like an alien?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I eagerly encourage the player to rebuild knowledge. Playing as a practical activity has the power of transformation. I believe the more the player ponders, the more tolerant the person will be.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What design challenges came from creating a whole new written language? What neat elements and gameplay possibilities came out of designing this language?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regarding this language, the design work was suffering at the beginning because every word longs to be defined by other words which haven’t been existent and defined yet. In addition, they are fundamental words that highly resonate with a designer’s philosophy, so I must be careful. I made the language environment self-sufficient when I hit around 300 words.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the early phase, I came up with an idea of talking with the voiced sounds and casting spells with the voiceless sounds. That’s why voiced and voiceless sounds appear as a pair in the game; all the conversions can become magic if you whisper.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Images give players many more clues about what a symbol might mean, but a letter-based language may not give any clues on what a word means without comparing it to another language. What thoughts go into giving players some hints on what a word might mean? Into creating the game's system of internal cross-references to start figuring out what this language means?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All internal cross-references, as a whole, were the most important aesthetic goal I was pursuing. Like a flowing being over the ground, the lake, the mountains. No power is supporting it, but it is just there, flowing silently.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To make the game more playable (in a regular way), I added a subtle tutorial/guide. However, to be honest, I can’t say I like it. If I have a chance to make a printed version, I will remove that part to immerse in the purity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to structure the narrative as a dictionary? And how did you create a story within the confines of a dictionary layout? How do you create a narrative through a reference book for a language?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I have a strong sense of the intensity between knowledge and a “beloved you.” A dictionary is about delineation and narrative is about intermingling. The dictionary prepares materials and the player blends them. As a designer, I devoted myself to the cookbook, not the cooking. Additionally, the kinds of words that are included and the frequency of them impact the emotion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to add the pronunciation elements at the top of the screen? Why was the pronunciation an important part of the player's experience with the game? Why was it so important to give such detailed information about mouth movements for the pronunciation?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the context of Jonah mentioned before, mouth movements are the representation of body. Tortuous simulation can bring a sense of awareness. Regarding general language, practically, pronunciation makes a book readable, not only seeable, then talkable, not tacit. With the help of the in-game vocabulary, pronunciation turns a btebr into a pdepr.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How has crafting this experience of language and understanding affected you? What have you taken away from creating this experience?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I quite dislike the idea that making games is creating experiences. "Experience" is more like a commercial term. The player wants to be more excited while shooting, so the designer improves the shooting experience via design. I don’t think designing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tetris</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Chess</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is designing experiences. Instead, I believe crafting games is forming a quality/characteristic/trait/personality, or even further, a being. Like biologically, while we bear a child and guide them, we don’t think we are carving an experience, but an interactable individual—and this is a game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the original goals of making this game was to clear my confusion. It did a good job on this purpose. Another goal was to craft the quality of tolerance. I hope I, by making the game, and the player, by playing the game, can become more tolerant. As some players said, they became more honest after playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kevin (1997-2077)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-ea-second-most-played-game-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and Hazelight Studios' latest release&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has already climbed its way through the publisher's Steam charts, and the co-op action-adventure game is now the second most-played EA game on the platform.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2001120/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s 24-hour Steam player peak sits at 197,434, which is pretty impressive; it's more than double what predecessor&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>achieved, and that game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">phenomenally successful in sales terms</a>.</p>

<p>The figure puts&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>in second place, and while that's certainly an achievement Hazelight and Josef Fares can celebrate, I don't think&nbsp;the game has a hope of beating the first-place record holder given that it's battle royale FPS&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-steam-count-platforming.jpg?itok=ihs7HF-e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-steam-count-platforming.jpg?itok=g1XKWRE- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hazelight's&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is doing pretty well at launch.</figcaption></figure><p>It is worth noting that since&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s Friend Pass allows players to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay" rel="nofollow">enjoy the game with a friend</a> even if they didn't buy it themselves, the Steam numbers don't necessarily translate into hard sales.</p>

<p>Still, the same is true of&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em>, so it's still a fair point of comparison in my books. It's fair to say that EA and Hazelight have a hit on their hands with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, and I wouldn't be surprised if the numbers climb even higher over the weekend.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game from&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight Studios, headed up by industry iconoclast and noted Oscars hater Josef Fares.</p>

<p>The game sees you and a friend (it doesn't support single-player, much like the aforementioned games) playing as Mio and Zoe, two writers who find themselves sucked into the worlds they've created and looking for a way out.</p>




<p>Much like&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em>,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>features a variety of co-op-focused activities, including platforming, combat, and various wacky setpieces. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a Hazelight game, it seems to me.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is available now for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

<p>Split Fiction upholds Hazelight Studios’ sterling reputation for delivering high-quality voice over work with a polished production. If you’re wondering who provides the voices for Mio, Zoe, and several other key figures, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<p>A Way Out and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-hazelight-studios-next-game-it-takes-two-sequel-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a> are considered iconic because of their co-op-focused action. But I find anything with a Hazelight Studios logo comes with a certain level of quality seldom seen in AAA games. A tight script and endearing characters further enhance the variety of the gameplay. </p>



<p>In years past, Leo and Vincent’s no-nonsense approach in A Way Out caught the eye, and May and Cody’s strangled relationship was painful but engaging. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> introduces the butting heads of Zoe and Mio, and they are backed up by a stellar cast of characters.</p>

<figure><figcaption>So much happening at once. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Elsie Bennett voices Zoe in Split Fiction, whereas the role of Mio is assumed by actress Kaja Chan.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-kaja-chan">Kaja Chan</h3>



<p>Kaja has recently shifted into the video game art. After several TV appearances, she provided voice over work in CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty DLC. She moved on to have casting credits in Foamstars and The First Descendant, before landing what is sure to be a breakthrough role as Mio in Split Fiction.</p>



<h3 id="h-elsie-bennett">Elsie Bennett</h3>



<p>Split Fiction’s Zoe is handled brilliantly by Elsie Bennett. She built up a consistent video game profile by lending her talents to IO Interactive’s Hitman games. She added more acting credits to her portfolio by providing several voices for Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Breakpoint and Control, before actualizing the character of Zoe.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-voice-actors-in-split-fiction">All Voice Actors in Split Fiction</h2>



<p><strong>Split Fiction has over 40 actors and actresses working hard to bring every hero and enemy to life.</strong></p>



<p>From the Mr. Hammer boss to J.D Rader himself, every role has a voice, along with distinct character and personality. According to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt34996975/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_cst_sm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDB</a>, the cast has <strong>42 roles in total</strong>.

                <p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that Killing Floor 3, which had been scheduled to release on March 25, has been delayed to an unspecified date later this year. A number of changes will be made to the game both for the new launch date and afterward.</p><p>Chief among those changes is a post-release update that will separate perk classes from characters, letting the two be chosen independently. The initial change to tie your class choice to a character proved to be contentious with some fans, mirroring similar complaints about Battlefield 2042's debut with hero-style classes.</p><p>"With the full support of our parent company, Embracer Group, we're working together on a timeline to address many of the common issues players had during the beta, including performance/stability, UI/UX, lighting, and weapon feel," the studio said in a <a href="https://x.com/KillingFloor/status/1898029813773836551/photo/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "We can confirm that an update allowing you to independently select your perk class and character is planned for post-release."</p><p>Refunds for preorders will <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/killing-floor-3-general-faq.2340844/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">vary between platforms</a>. US-based PlayStation preorders will have the option to keep it or cancel, with non-responses being automatically canceled and refunded. Global PlayStation preorders will be automatically canceled and refunded too.</p><p>Xbox will automatically cancel all preorders and refunds are not necessary because the storefront only charges a user's account  7-10 days before launch.</p><p>On PC, Epic Games Store preorders are automatically canceled and refunded while Steam preorders will remain active unless a user cancels and refunds theirs manually.</p><p>Killing Floor 3 is a multiplayer survival horror game. It takes place in 2091, 70 years after the events of Killing Floor 2. The mega-corporation Horzine has created a race of subservient and bioengineered zombies called Zeds. Nightfall, a rebel group, must fight back against the Zeds in order to save humanity.</p><p>Killing Floor 3 can be played solo or with up to five other people, and the game offers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-release-date-confirmed-for-march-2025/1100-6528441/" data-ref-id="1100-6528441">cross-play across all platforms</a>. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-launches-in-march-closed-beta-coming-in-february/1100-6529171/" data-ref-id="1100-6529171">beta occurred last month</a>, and GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-looks-like-2025s-killer-co-op-game/1100-6529407/" data-ref-id="1100-6529407">Killing Floor 3 hands-on impressions</a> have been positive so far. We said, "Killing Floor 3 paints a terrific first impression, with impactful, gore-filled shooting and a promising glimpse of what can sustain it long-term."</p>

		<p>After spending the 2010s almost wholly dedicated to the Castlevania genre, it’s time for MercurySteam to test themselves with something a little bit different. Heck, it’s been a good while since they’ve even dealt in three dimensions, after a pair of side-scrolling Metroid games that included the excellent Metroid Dread. The studio is leaping out of that genre as they look to forge their own original IP with Blades of Fire, creating a new alloy that infuses the Soulslike with some fresh and invigorating new ideas of their own.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blades of Fire Preview – The blacksmithing action adventure you didn't know you needed" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PgoiKXgYQp0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>MercurySteam CEO &amp; Game Director Enric Álvarez told us, “We started this adventure four years ago with the guys at 505 Games, who trusted that this was an interesting proposal. It’s an original IP, we own it, and it will allow us hopefully to fly with our own wings, which is something that independent developers are always looking for.”</p>


<p>There’s something decidedly PS3/Xbox 360 about the look and feel of the world that Blades of Fire conjures, but I mean that in the best possible way. It has that style to the fantasy world and characters, but with a modern game engine and level of detail through the environments that feels contemporary.</p>
<p>Our hero Aran de Lira is a blacksmith turned warrior, but you’d be forgiven for thinking that he’s been working out full time at the Chris Redfield School of Bodybuilding – his hands in particular, look like they’re the size of his head! Right at the start of the game, he rescues the young and studious waif that is Adso from being ambushed by the Queen’s Guard, though comes to the commotion just a little too late to save Adso’s mentor and Aran’s friend Abbot Dorin. The pair of them must set off across the lands to battle through the Queen’s forces, rediscover the magic of the Forgers, and ultimately end the Queen’s tyrannical reign.</p>


<p>Key to doing this is Aran’s ability to forge new and increasingly powerful weapons. The Queen’s magics have turned all her enemies’ weapons from metal to stone, so Aran is now the de facto hero to save these lands. The magical hammer he now holds transports Aran to The Forge, a pocket realm where he can craft new weapons in isolation. It’s a fantastically engaging idea, nowhere near as vague as blacksmithing in Kingdom Come: Deliverance, not as obtuse as a rhythm action minigame that you might expect, and instead more of a puzzle that you can take your time over.</p>
<p>It starts with a Forge Scroll, a blueprint for the weapon you’re about to create, and for which you then need to choose and provide the metals, wood and other components needed to craft it. You can choose different metal variants for different parts of a weapon, lending it different attributes from this, trading off strength for speed, weight and durability for stamina depletion, and more.</p>
<p>From there, you need to actually forge the steel, starting with a glowing block of heated metal that needs hammering into shape. This is represented by what looks like a Hi-Fi’s EQ as you move bars back and forth with each hammer blow.</p>
<p>“We found this kind of minigame very close to the reality,” Enric said. “The possibilities it gives you, how hard you strike, the direction you strike, you’re moving metal in reality. So the bars are just a representation of the metal moving in one direction or the other. You always end up with a viable weapon […] the worst that can happen to you is that the weapon doesn’t have any stars, which is something that you don’t want, but it’s very easy to get a few.”</p>
<p>It’s a great active puzzle element; the closer that you get to completely matching the white line creating a higher quality weapon that can be repaired and reforged more times in future. It’s quite forgiving in how it rates your creation, and once you’ve forged a weapon once, you’re able to skip this process and get the same quality of weapon as you’ve made before.</p>

<p>I love this system, and it becomes a kind of surrogate for more in-depth RPG levelling and mechanics, outside of gathering pips of health and stamina, and a light skill tree earned through collecting cryptic Forger cylinders. There’s dozens of weapons in the game, each catering to different styles of play, and you can choose how to apply the rare metals that you gradually gather through the game.</p>
<p>While you can absolutely have a preference, you can’t just main in a single weapon. As you approach a fight with an enemy and lock on to them, they’ll be outlined in green, yellow, red, or a combination of colours. That immediately tells you whether your weapon is going to be effective against them, and if it isn’t, then you will want to switch weapons or even just your style of attack from slashing to stabbing in order to regain an advantage in battle. Basic enemies can often be offed by a single heavy strike or quickly following that up with a quick attack, but for the tougher enemies that you start to face after the opening hour or so, quick-switching to the right weapon is vital, and identifying if stabbing or slashing is stronger is as well.</p>
<p>Enric said, “This is primarily an action adventure game, it is not an RPG. Combat is a central piece and I think that the combat in this game, the fact that you can attack different parts of the body, this is an idea that came naturally from the Forge.”</p>
<p>“If you have a Forge where you can express yourself – I could say I like spears, I’m going to use this steel, I’m going to put the weight on the tip so I can deal more damage. If you have several ways to attack enemies, it’s mandatory that enemies have several ways to counteract that […] so it forces you to think. It’s not just that you get a brand new hammer and just button-mash it. You’re going to be in pieces in seconds.”</p>

<p>There’s a really pleasing weight and heft to the combat here, and some great, individualistic twists on action RPG hack ‘n’ slashing. Yes, it’s stamina-based, and heavier weapons drain this quicker, so you will be slowed if you attack too much without backing off, but regaining stamina is accelerated if you hold to block, putting you in a defensive stance. While blocking is universal, attacks are directional, using the four face buttons to aim for head, each side and from below. Some armoured enemies are without helmets, for example, so you want to aim there, and there’s other enemies that have weak areas as they build up to unleash spores, which you can prevent and deal extra damage by targeting. Heavy attacks are dished out by holding instead of tapping an attack, and some bigger enemies need this for a finishing move or they’ll regenerate and come at you again.</p>
<p>There’s a delightful amount of cartoonish gore throughout. Smashing enemies with a large hammer just obliterates their head with a spurt of blood, arms get lopped off if you land a final blow from the side, and there’s a troll with multiple health bars that will continue fighting, regardless of the limb you remove first.</p>
<p>Beating enemies will gradually unlock their weapons for you to craft – defeat 40 claymore wielding zombies, for example –&nbsp;and they will drop materials upon death, in addition to those you gather from smashing up the environment. Taking these to the regular anvils in the game let you transport yourself to The Forge, and these also act like Soulslike bonfires. If you die, the weapon you were wielding is left behind, and you need to trek back to that spot from the nearest anvil to retrieve it or risk losing it for good. If the game is too challenging, then there’s multiple difficulty levels below the standard one to ease off a touch.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed my few hours with Blades of Fire. The original fantasy setting, the characters, and their voice acting and script all work for me –&nbsp;Aran’s voice acting reminds me of a cross between Matt Berry and Henry Cavill –&nbsp;but it’s really the unique touches for the combat and the puzzle-like forging that stand out. This is definitely one to keep an eye on when it launches in May.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-delayed-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tripwire Interactive has announced that upcoming multiplayer-focused zombie shooter&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>has been delayed, and the game has no new specific release date.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1430190/view/499441143215293470" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on Steam, Tripwire says the decision to delay the game was made following feedback it received from&nbsp;a recent closed beta period. That feedback made Tripwire realize it had "missed the mark" with regards to&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>.</p>

<p>According to Tripwire, the delay will afford the development team time to address some of the most pressing issues raised during the closed beta, including "performance/stability, UI/UX, lighting, and weapon feel". Those are some pretty fundamental issues.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/killing-floor-3-delayed-zeds.jpg?itok=ImxiDZCp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/killing-floor-3-delayed-zeds.jpg?itok=fDxNUMMj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>needs a little more time in the oven, Tripwire says.</figcaption></figure><p>Tripwire goes on to say that it has the "full support" of its parent company Embracer Group when it comes to addressing these issues, which will come as a relief given that the game was listed as one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">cornerstones of Embracer's 2025 lineup</a>.</p>

<p>The developer says it doesn't know which of these issues will be fixed by the time of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>'s launch, but that an update which will let you select your perk class and character independently "is planned for post-release".</p>

<p>The studio closes by saying that it intends to show "a more polished version of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>" later down the line, and that more information is coming "when [Tripwire is] ready to share more details".</p>

<p>This is where I'd normally trot out that misattributed Miyamoto quote about a rushed game being bad and a delayed game being good, but given that Tripwire doesn't seem to be able to promise all of the aforementioned issues will be fixed by launch, I'm not sure it's appropriate here.</p>




<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is the third major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>series of zombie-slaying shooters.</p>

<p>The game was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">slated for release this month</a>, but it now seems we'll have to wait a while before we learn exactly when it's coming. When it eventually does arrive,&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>will launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430190/Killing_Floor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/killing-floor-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/killing-floor-3/9pfzlckhc1vm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Do you like bonking enemies with those bonk sticks? Then maces might just be for you in <em>Avowed</em>. You’ll have quite a lot of them to choose from as you make your way through The Living Lands, but there’s one called Battletrance that’s a great choice, due to its excellent increases to cast speed and attack speed. Battletrance is only found relatively late in the game, but it’s worth the wait! Here’s what to know about it and where you can pick it up.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195326" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Diablo IV's Strongholds Are A Great Way To Level Up This Season" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="326" data-playlist="195326,195618,195752" data-current="195326"><div><p>Diablo IV's Strongholds Are A Great Way To Level Up This Season</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195326/195326_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195326/195326_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195326/195326_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195326/195326_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20784.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h1833588"><a id=""></a><strong>Battletrance passive bonus and enchantments</strong></h2><p>Battletrance comes with the Tactical Efficiency passive bonus, which grants you +20 percent ability cast speed.
