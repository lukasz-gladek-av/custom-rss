            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>You've been doing your best to save the others, but through luck or just pure stupidity, they just kept getting themselves killed, and now you're the only one left. You've collected some gear as best you can, but now it's time to face whatever has been hunting you. Only one of you will leave. You are the final girl.</em></p>

<p><em>Final Girl</em>, by Van Ryder Games, was an acclaimed Kickstarter launched in 2020, based on their already successful <em>Hostage Negotiator</em>&nbsp;system. Since its release, it's had 2 more Kickstarters, each combined into a series of releases. In this review, we will look at the <em>Final Girl</em> Series 1 Ultimate Box, which incorporates everything from Series 1 available at retail into a single handy storage box. We'll look at how to play <em>Final Girl</em>, what's in the Ultimate Box, and what our favorite parts of it are.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-2.jpg?itok=mV0vQxpG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-2.jpg?itok=Fsajw-KV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>To play&nbsp;<em>Final Girl</em> you need to combine the Core Box with any Feature Film box.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Rules To Survive A Horror Movie</h2>

<p><i>Final Girl</i>&nbsp;is a modular system that begins with the <em>Final Girl</em> Core Box, which has the core rules and components. To play, a core box is combined with a feature film box, like Happy Trails Horror or Slaughter in the Groves. These feature film boxes include a unique killer, a unique location, and 2 final girls to choose from, which can all be mixed and matched with other feature film boxes in any combination of final girl, location, and killer to diversify your games as your collection expands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-3.jpg?itok=sD7nOB_Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-3.jpg?itok=8v1aItRX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can combine any <em>Final Girl&nbsp;</em>location board, with any killer from any set.</figcaption></figure><p>The game itself is designed for solo play only, and while there are a lot of elements to track, it follows a simple flow that means it's hard to get something wrong or miss an element, even in your early games. The core of the gameplay revolves around action cards, which your final girl can play each turn. These allow your final girl to move, collect, and try to save victims, search for useful items which give bonuses to other actions, or attack the killer. To take an action, you play the card and make a horror roll. The number of dice rolled for the action is determined by the horror track, and each action card has 3 possible results, varying from failure, which usually has bad consequences, a single success, or a double success.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-4.jpg?itok=pBGzfCxh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-4.jpg?itok=Pe1YXzBj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>During your turn in&nbsp;<em>Final Girl</em>&nbsp;you use action cards and make horror rolls using the custom dice.</figcaption></figure><p>The result of the horror roll against the action card shows how far the final girl can move, how many items you get when searching, or how much damage you can deal. The results for failing can be the final girl taking damage, the horror level rising, which means you roll fewer dice in future horror rolls, losing time, which can end your turn when the track reaches 0, or simply ending your turn immediately.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-5.jpg?itok=lKheYlnH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-5.jpg?itok=FYQkrzmH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The killer in&nbsp;<em>Final Girl</em> acts each turn with a set action and a random action from a terror card.</figcaption></figure><p>After the action phase, the killer acts with a predetermined action on their killer card, and also with a random action drawn from the terror deck. The killer will generally pick a target, either a victim or the final girl, and move and attack them. Every time the killer takes out a victim, they become more powerful, eventually unlocking a dark power. The final girl can also unlock an ultimate ability by saving victims, and saving victims also means there are fewer on the location map for the killer to attack and power themselves up.</p>

<p>Each killer and location has a unique feel, with cards specific for them with some randomization for location setup, items, the finale, and the killer's dark power, which offers some variety game to game, even with the same box. This, combined with the 2 final girls in each box, means you will get a lot of replayability.</p>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 1 Ultimate Box contains a huge amount of content. We'll detail here what each item contains and talk about our favorite products from the Ultimate Box below.</p>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Core Box contains the core components you will use from game to game, including the rulebook, action cards for the final girls, tokens, and meeples for victims, the killer (which can be replaced by the killer miniatures in the Ultimate Box) and final girl (which can also be replaced by the miniatures in the Ultimate Box). It also contains a player board and some thick cards for holding areas (which can be replaced by the higher-quality game mats in the Ultimate Box).</p>

<p>The Ultimate Box contains 5 feature film boxes, for a total of 5 locations, 5 killers, and 10 final girls (with 2 additional final girls and another killer we detail below) that can all be mixed and matched between sets. Each box also contains miniatures for the killer, to upgrade from the token in the core box and vehicles (that you can access with cards in the item and event decks), to upgrade from the tokens included in each feature film box. We'll discuss each feature film box below.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Happy Trails Horror</strong></p>

<p>Happy Trails Horror features Camp Happy Trails as the location, a lakeside area that also has a boat as an item. Hans is the killer here, a sledgehammer-wielding maniac with a pig mask. The final girls are Laurie and Reiko, whose ultimate abilities are combat-focused to take the fight to the killer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Haunting of Creech Manor</strong></p>

<p>Haunting of Creech Manor includes Creech Manor as the location, a spooky 5-floor house with a helicopter that might appear as an event item. The Poltergeist is the killer here, and the players have to find and save a young girl named Carolyn from it. Alice and Selena are the final girls. For their ultimate abilities, Selena gets a bonus to search actions, and Alice gets to choose a specific action card that always rolls maximum dice.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Slaughter in the Groves</strong></p>

<p>The Sacred Groves are the location for Slaughter in the Groves, and they are haunted by Inkanyamba the Avenger. When using this location and killer, players also track Divine Wrath and Killer Wrath, which have additional effects on the game as they try to take out the killer. The final girls are Adelaide and Barbara. As their ultimate abilities, Adelaide gets to choose from 3 immediate effects, which gives her great flexibility depending on the situation, and Barbara, who can bring victims with her into the killer's space and sacrifice them to boost her damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Carnage at the Carnival</strong></p>

<p>Carnage at the Carnival takes place at the Carnival of Blood, a trap-filled location where you can find a golf buggy as part of an event. Geppetto, the puppet master, is the killer and is upgraded with puppet miniatures to replace the tokens in the box as part of the Ultimate Box. The final girls are Asami, who's ultimate makes her immune to traps and can choose between 2 item cards when she draws 1, and Charlie, who for their ultimate, can take 3 damage to draw the Critical Blow action card for a risky finsher against the killer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Frightmare on Maple Lane</strong></p>

<p>Frightmare on Maple Lane has Maple Lane as its location, a group of houses around a suburban intersection. It features a bike as an item card and a police car miniature for an event. The killer here is Dr Fright, and games against him take place on the game board when you're awake, and in the boiler room when you're asleep. The final girls are Nancy, who, as her ultimate, can swap out her final health token with another when she takes normal damage, and Sheila, who, for their ultimate, gains 2 time when discarding action cards for time.</p>

<p>The game mat bundle includes 2 neoprene game mats that have space for all the game areas, including the killer and location boards, horror and time track, and card deck areas, and comes in a thematic VCR-style box.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-9.jpg?itok=bpwpDvOE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-9.jpg?itok=-zblYcsv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4><em>Final Girl</em>: S1 Bonus Features Box</h4>

<p>Along with the Feature and Core boxes, the Ultimate Box includes 2 other sets, the first is the Bonus Features Box, which includes several books:</p>

<ul><li><em>Final Girl</em>: S1 Feature Films Rulebook&nbsp;- This handy book features all the killer and location looseleaf rules inserts from each of the Series 1 feature films, along with some achievement sheets for each.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: S1 Gruesome Death Books - These 5&nbsp;books for each location contain gruesome details of kills for each terror card and some general death details, for each of the series 1 killers across all locations.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Lore Book Series 1 - The lore book contains background details for all of the series 1 killers and final girls, along with some detailed setup for some linked scenario games</li>
</ul><h4><em>Final Girl</em>: S1 Cast and Crew Box</h4>

<p>The other bonus set in the Ultimate Box is the The Series 1 Cast and Crew, which is a handy storage box for some additional components, and to gather up all the final girl stat cards and their secret envelopes (which you can open for a bonus card once you complete a game with that final girl). The box also contains:</p>

<ul><li><em>Final Girl </em>Miniatures - All of the killer miniatures are housed in their respective feature film boxes, but all of the final girl miniatures are here.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Terror From Above (vignette) - This fantastic little box contains a killer (the birds!) but doesn't include a specific location (and as with all killers, can be used with any location you wish). It also includes a new final girl (who also has a miniature in this box), Melanie, whose ultimate allows her to take damage to deal 2 damage divided as you choose to enemies in your space (handy for dealing with birds).</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Birds Miniatures Pack - These miniatures replace the tokens in the Terror from Above vignette pack.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Paula Promo Card - Paula is an additional final girl (who doesn't have a miniature here, but has a miniature&nbsp;included in a larger miniatures promo pack in the Series 3 Ultimate Box). This card allows you to play&nbsp;Paula Deming of YouTube&nbsp;Things Get Dicey fame.</li>
</ul><h2>Horror Movie Death Tropes</h2>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 1 Ultimate Box has a huge amount of content and replayability, but a few things stood out to me. Dr Fright and Maple Lane from&nbsp;Frightmare on Maple Lane are my favorite killer and location in this box. Both feel insanely thematic and capture the movie series (Nightmare on Elm Street) that they're based on very well. I tended to use the final girls from each box while playing the scenarios they came with, purely so I could get a feel for that box experience, but if I had to pick a favorite final girl, it would probably be Reiko for her combat prowess.</p>

<p>The Terror From Above and&nbsp;Lore Book Series 1 also stand out. Terror From Above for how simply and thematically well it captures the terror of bird attacks (you should also feel compelled to play Melanie in the scenario too, as she's rad), and the linked scenarios in the Lore book are my only way to play after a taster game for each killer and location. The setup and additional background for each scenario bring an already detailed experience to life, and when combined with the Grusome Deaths books, incredible.</p>



<p>If you've read the whole article above, you'll know I'm a huge fan of <em>Final Girl</em> and the sheer depth the Series 1 Ultimate Box gives you, but for a solo board game, the box is an investment, even for the sheer volume of content it gives you. If you've already tried <em>Final Girl </em>and love it, and solo gaming is your thing, then have at it, the sheer replayability you'll get out of this box is amazing. But if you've never tried it, it might be worth picking up the Core Box and a feature film to test the experience first, and either picking up all the elements separately once you know you're in, or trading them in, and picking up the Ultimate Box once you're sure.</p>

<p>Each of the feature films in the Ultimate Box is a great experience, and captures the theme very well, but when combined with the lore and scenarios book, the miniatures, and the gruesome deaths books, it all comes together to create the perfect horror gaming experience.</p>

			<p>Universal has reportedly partnered with director Michael Bay and actress Sydney Sweeney to develop a film adaptation of SEGA's 1980s-era Out Run.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/">Deadline</a>, Bay will direct the film while Sweeney has signed on to produce the movie, with Jayson Rothwell to write the script. Bay will also be a producer on the film with his partner Brad Fuller, and while there's the chance that Sweeney could act in the film, she's currently only on board as a producer.</p>
<p>When SEGA first launched Out Run in arcades in 1986, it was an instant hit and spawned several sequels both within and outside of arcades. The most recent Out Run game came to 3DS in 2014 with 3D OutRun, which makes it a little over a decade since the racer has returned in any meaningful fashion.</p>
<p>Popular as Out Run was for many years, Universal has gone with a bit of a deep cut here in a way that feels intentional. Out Run might not be the first thing players would think of as the next video game series that should be adapted into a movie or TV show, but that might be why it was chosen.</p>
<p>Universal could have made what it felt was a reasonable deal to add another video game adaptation to its portfolio, and at the same time, SEGA gets another chance to revitalize one of its older series.</p>
<p>Adding Michael Bay and current star Sydney Sweeney then adds some weight behind the film to hopefully make it a box-office smash, similar to how the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-surpassed-200-million-at-the-box-office/">Sonic</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-already-seeing-increased-sales-of-merchandise-and-games-thanks-to-the-super-mario-bros-movie/">Super Mario Bros</a>., and recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-movies-success-continues-the-trend-of-film-tv-adaptations-bolstering-game-sales-and-engagement/">Minecraft</a> movies have all been big commercial hits.</p>
<p>However, the key difference between Out Run and the rest of those series is that so many of the kids who drove their parents to see all those other films have at least heard of, if not played games from, those other series. The number of kids who have never heard of Out Run only grows the further away from 2014 we get.</p>
<p>Of course, there's the chance that Universal's marketing team, paired with a solid premise for the film, could whip up plenty of excitement around an adaptation of the classic racing series and make it a box-office hit. But that remains to be seen.</p>

            <p>At some point in their development of the most recent trilogy, someone at Id Software apparently decided that the most interesting thing about their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> was the character of the Doom Slayer himself - an odd though not entirely disastrous decision that I'd argue is mostly responsible for the design shape of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-eternal">Doom Eternal</a>. I'm a big fan, even despite this misplaced fascination with its unnecessarily fleshed out gun-numpad-with-legs. I'm hoping to be a fan of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> too, but based on the latest trailer, I'm still trying to tell whether they've scaled the Slayer lore back or are still banking on me being enraptured to learn the millenia-long backstory to why I'm yanking a Cacodemon's eyeball out like clogged hair from shower drain.</p>

<p>While I can absolutely do without top brass pacing around by control panels and chewing walkie talkies anywhere near my Doom, I'm actually quite on board with the vaguely modern military vibes for one reason: the true scale and threat of a hell invasion is much better felt with a front seat to the carnage these murderlopers can inflict on people who aren't the Slayer. When all you've got is the perspective of an invincible hammer, even the most fearsome demon looks like a squishy pissnail. It's just plain fun to feel like you're taking part in a war that's going disastrously for every idiot but you.</p>
<p>We're also shown a bit of what I'm assuming is the game's central antagonist. He uses at least a couple of differently pitched audio tracks to speak, so you know he's from one of the really bad circles of hell. I think he looks cool!  The contrast between the sleek if medieval future tech and the more organic and biblical looking demons makes for great art direction. He <em>sort of</em> looks like a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> boss, but art was one the few things about Diablo 4 that didn't make me want to weave my eyes shut forever with my own lashes.</p>
<p>It's not all story, though. There's a fair chunk of bulletous gut mulching in there too - although it's still a little hard to tell if the game's many combat options will flow together this smoothly, or if it's just being played by someone good. Perhaps you'd like to investigate further? Brendy went <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-threw-hands-with-doom-the-dark-ages-and-its-rock-em-sock-em-robot">hands-on with its giant mechs here</a>, and then got so cocky he decided to play with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-the-hell-not-lets-slide-all-doom-the-dark-ages-difficulty-options-to-max">all the difficulty sliders whacked up to max</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steel-seed-review.1170255/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/steel-seed-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With poorly lit metal halls, flickering neon lights, a larger than life mechanical sprawl, and a cyborg ninja protagonist, Steel Seed has a lot on the surface that piqued my interest, as I can be easily lured into B-tier sci-fi stories if things look weird enough. Unfortunately, this one is weird in all the wrong ways. Its stealth action and energetic platforming are its best traits, but they are uneven across the roughly 12-hour campaign. Some really cool moments and creatures end up lost amongst miles of dreary and uninspired spaces, overshadowed by frustrating combat and a flimsy story that sap whatever shuddering signs of life this machine had in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problems with Steel Seed start with its hero’s generic presentation. Zoe, awkwardly plucky and earnest daughter of the creator of the dystopia she woke up into, feels completely out of sync with the post-apocalyptic sci-fi world she is in. She’s well-voiced, but not well-written, relying heavily on some vapid self-reflection about a past she can’t fully remember and superhero movie-style banter with her robot pa. Ma’am, you’re the last living human on a planet overrun by killer robots and the only chance to bring humanity back from extinction. I need you to stop quipping and lock in.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Steel Seed Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Steel Seed is dense with lore about how some major corporation was humanity's last hope until the CEO (who is also Zoe’s father) got double crossed by whoever and whatever, but its plot is light on interesting happenings or compelling reasons to continue to the next objective outside of “because it’s telling me to.” There’s a part that technically satisfies the literary definition of a plot twist, but you see it coming so far in advance that it might as well be a naked man covered in gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll spend a great deal of your time navigating this post-human settlement by hopping on platforms and scurrying up walls. It’s all very reminiscent of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/11/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review">Uncharted</a> games, where shimmying across a ledge could be filled with enough mishaps and jump scares to make the process a tense one. Steel Seed even goes a step further, making its high stakes sequences of sliding through collapsing structures or outrunning gunfire feel way more precarious as it's pretty easy to fail some of the more intense sections.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s little about the world Zoe is saving even worth remembering.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Light puzzle mechanics can add some small speed bumps to your progress, often in the form of commanding your R2D2-coded companion, KOBY, to shoot unreachable buttons while your hands and feet are busy keeping you firmly attached to a wall. These were just dynamic enough to stay engaging, which is all I can ask for for a game that has platforming but isn’t entirely focused on that kind of gameplay, a la <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">Astrobot</a>. Things do get more clever in certain chase encounters, where your perspective changes from 3D to 2D in order to outrun enemy fire from the background – but these moments are scarce, and Steel Seed does nothing that clever anywhere else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The vast environments you’ll be doing all this poking around in are very hit and miss, visually speaking. There are quite a few stretches of pretty generic techno-hallways or oft-troped rust-chic junk yards that don't really inspire awe if you've seen any science fiction ever. But occasionally those halls will be filled with weird little robot bugs, or a X-story tall mech that rivals the scale of some of God of War’s largest creatures will rise to greet you, and you can’t help but think, “they cooked with this one, at least.” Generally, though, there’s very little about the world Zoe is tasked with saving even worth remembering, something me and the amnesiac protagonist have in common.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a lot of enemies in all of these spaces looking to stop you from saving the day, and you can take care of them with stealthy wit or brute force. The stages where you find most enemies are rife with nooks and crannies to hide in and precariously placed obstacles to use as distractions, or to cause killing blows themselves. At first stealth is pretty simple thanks to the very slim variety of different bad guys that patrol around, as well your limited starting skills. I was happy to see that blossom into something more robust as time went on, though. Even though you don’t really see more than five different enemy types in any given encounter throughout Steel Seed, each one is so different and they are mixed together well enough to create checkpoints that can be a real challenge to navigate safely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sections get larger and more dense with lookouts that have overlapping patrols and vision vectors, and while some of the mid-game scenarios hit the “just right” mix of enemies and area size, the late-game stealth sections drag on way too long. The fairly strict checkpoints also mean you need to start from the beginning of the section if you fail during it, sometimes throwing 15-20 minutes of patient stabbing and enemy hacking directly into the recycling bin when you slip up. You also run out of new ways to take down foes pretty early on, and I found myself setting a lot of the same traps throughout. So while the hunt started tense, it became stale sooner than I’d hoped.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Jarrett Green's Stealth Soiree</h3><p>A definitive group of very good stealth games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Zoe and KOBY gain more tricks as they progress, but you sort of have to earn the ability to buy them with the points you find by breaking containers or enemy robots,  completing what can often feel like busy work first. Kill five enemies without being seen and you’ll earn the privilege of buying the extremely useful glitch mine skill, which goes a long way towards killing bots without being seen. A lot of the skills have requirements that can come naturally through play, like scanning a number of enemies individually in order to unlock a version of the scan that hits everything of interest in a small zone – ,but others were more tedious tasks, such as searching the mostly bland locations for hidden pick-ups or completing more challenging skill tests like killing a certain amount of enemies a specific way in a small window of time, which were things I happily avoided.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I less than happily avoided outright combat like a computer virus, though. From the buggy lock-on that lets you focus on an enemy but will still pull you towards other nearby foes, to the mashy attack strings with mushy responsiveness, to the dry attack animations from both Zoe and all of her victims, confronting your foes directly is generally a mess. None of the skills you unlock make combat feel any better, despite giving you some admittedly strong options for late-game encounters that can spin out of control with the number of potential participants in any given melee, attacking from off screen with reckless abandon. By the end of the campaign, if I got caught during a stealth section, I'd more often just reload at the last checkpoint than clean up the foes that caught me because it was simply less boring that way. Zones where you have no choice but to fight in open combat were consistently my least favorite parts of the Steel Seed, but mercifully, they are few and far between.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Steel Seed is cursed by mediocrity. Its combat is a low point, so abrasive that I’d rather restart whole areas when I got caught rather than have to navigate its jank. But it’s real problem is that everything else, from the bland characters and predictable story, to the forgettable locations that the tale takes you through, to the initially fun stealth sections that eventually wear thin, will lose the fight for a spot in my memory as soon as I’m done with this review. That’s a real shame, because there are a small handful of shiny chrome moments to find here, but they are buried under a whole lot of rust.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"One of the biggest accessibility expansions coming to Days Gone Remastered is a fully customisable High Contrast Mode," wrote Bend Studio's Kevin McAllister, with the developer stating this "pairs with our High Contrast HUD that was implemented in the original game to assist with easier navigation and visibility".</p>
<p>Players will be able to make the most of this feature from the off, with subtitles, High Contrast Mode and more options available via Days Gone Remastered's initial setup screen, which is another new addition.</p>
<p>Speaking of subtitles, the development team has added 11 colours for users to choose from. These can be mixed and matched for things like the speaker's name and the subtitle text. Subtitle backgrounds can also be changed, with Bend adding more options for users than before. "Now, you can select between default (transparent), darkened, light, and black,"  McAllister explained.</p>
<p>On the audio side of things, Bend has added UI Narration and Collectible Audio Cues for Days Gone Remastered.</p>

We hope you enjoy the definitive version of our open world epic, and we can't wait to see you hop on the Drifter bike and experience all Days Gone Remastered has to offer."</p>
<p>Those on PC who want to make the most of these new features will need to update their game to a version higher than Build ID 10034136 via Patch 1.08. The developer added that UI Narration is <em>not </em>supported for Broken Road DLC on PC.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, users will need to make sure they have a compatible controller for things such as haptic feedback and customised controls.</p>

<p>Not played Days Gone for yourself yet? Our review from 2019 complimented its "frequently gorgeous" open world, however noted the game could often be "generic" and one that "runs out of steam well before its extended play-time is over".</p>
<p>"I wasn't expecting Days Gone to add anything new to the genre, but both in terms of its systems and its story it's uninspired, which is driven home by the fact that it's endlessly, needlessly long," Malindy Hetfeld wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-review-a-shallow-copy-of-many-better-open-world-action-games">Eurogamer's original Days Gone review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/days-gone-remastered-accessibility<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Bend Studio have revealed the kind of accessibility options and features you can expect from the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Days Gone Remastered</em>, and it's got plenty in store for all kinds of gamers.</p>

<p>The game, which lands exclusively on PS5 later this week, will feature a number of enhancements over the PS4 original, including new game modes, faster loading times, and improved visuals, among other things.</p>

<p>It'll also have a host of new accessibility features, including extra subtitle colors, a fully customizable high contrast mode to aid visibility, and new audio features. It looks like Sony is aiming for this to be the definitive version of&nbsp;<em>Days Gone</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/days-gone-remastered-accessibility-high-contrast.jpg?itok=o_KuKInW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/days-gone-remastered-accessibility-high-contrast.jpg?itok=85eH6dVA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Days Gone Remastered&nbsp;</em>will have tons of new accessibility features.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, eleven new subtitle colors have been added, and you can change them based on preference, mixing and matching them as you see fit.</p>

<p>The aforementioned high contrast mode will come complete with color choices for protagonist Deacon, the NPCs he meets, the enemies he fights, and interactable objects. Again, you'll have a choice of eleven colors to choose from.</p>

<p>In terms of audio, you can expect "a fully revised and improved audio mix" that should make sounds easier to pick out, as well as narration for the UI, audio cues for collectible objects, and increased haptics through your controller when a collectible is near.</p>

<p><em>Days Gone Remastered</em>'s controls will also be fully customizable, and you can even set the game's speed to lower it if you find yourself easily overwhelmed by&nbsp;<em>Days Gone</em>'s relentless zombie hordes.</p>




<p>If you're a PC player and you're worried you'll be missing out on these features, as well as a number of other accessibility tweaks coming to&nbsp;<em>Days Gone Remastered</em>, don't be; "most" of these features will also be coming to PC, although the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/days-gone" rel="nofollow">PS4 version</a> won't be getting them, by the sounds of things.</p>

<p><em>Days Gone Remastered&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/days-gone/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> on April 25th.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-nintendo-switch-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added another classic strategy RPG to Nintendo Switch Online in the form of&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</em>, and it's available to play as part of the service's Expansion Pack addon right now.</p>

<p><em>The Sacred Stones&nbsp;</em>is one of three&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em>games developed for the Game Boy Advance, alongside 2003's&nbsp;<em>The Blazing Blade</em>, which was released in the US as simply&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em>(and which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">added to Switch Online in 2023</a>).</p>

<p>The other GBA&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em>game, 2002's <i>The Binding Blade</i>, has never been released outside of Japan. However, while&nbsp;<em>The Blazing Blade&nbsp;</em>is technically a sequel to&nbsp;<em>The Binding Blade</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Sacred Stones&nbsp;</em>has nothing to do with either game from a narrative perspective.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-map.jpg?itok=LenipwgM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-map.jpg?itok=maSvNx6S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones&nbsp;</em>is the Game Boy Advance's third&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem</em>&nbsp;game.</figcaption></figure><p><em>The Sacred Stones&nbsp;</em>revolves around protagonists Ephraim and Eirika, a brother-and-sister duo who must defend their homeland from hostile invaders.</p>

<p>After a certain point in the game, you'll be able to choose which of the two siblings' stories you'd like to follow, with one route (Ephraim's) being significantly more challenging than the other. Eventually, however, the two lords' paths unite once again.</p>

<p>Otherwise,&nbsp;<em>The Sacred Stones&nbsp;</em>offers very similar turn-based strategy gameplay to its predecessors, and, indeed, to its successors as well. If you've played a&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em>game before, you'll probably feel right at home here.</p>

<p>If you haven't, <i>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</i>games take place on a square grid, and you must maneuver your characters in order to defeat enemy troops, protect vulnerable units from attack, and achieve whatever the current map's objective happens to be.</p>




<p>The action is spiced up by the fact that if you lose any of your units during combat, they're gone forever. Later&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fire-emblem-engage" rel="nofollow">games</a> would allow you to turn this feature off, but&nbsp;<em>The Sacred Stones&nbsp;</em>certainly doesn't, so be aware of that before you jump in.</p>

<p><em>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones&nbsp;</em>is available right now as part of a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. It'll also be fully playable on Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">when the console launches on June 5th</a>.</p>

cosmetics in the Berserk Reliquary, part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-is-getting-a-major-rework-for-season-8/1100-6530937/" data-ref-id="1100-6530937">Diablo 4's newly revamped battle-pass system</a>. Some of those items include a Brand of Sacrifice marking that can be used in character customization, as well as Skull Knight's shield as mount armor and Griffith's Helmet as a back trophy.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the cosmetics players are likely really looking for are all relegated to Diablo 4's in-game shop. That includes series protagonist Guts' Berserker armor, as well as looks for series antagonist Griffith, the mysterious Skull Knight, and an armor set inspired by Guts' mercenary days. Griffith's steed and accompanying mount armor will also be for sale, alongside a pet bundle featuring the all-nose Chimimoryo.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's free-to-play mobile game Diablo Immortal is also getting in on the Berserk action, and in many ways has more to do than Diablo 4. It will add a boss fight against the fearsome Nosferatu Zodd, and even let players participate in Berserk's most infamous moment: the Eclipse.</p><p dir="ltr">In the Berserk manga and anime, the Eclipse is the story's bleakest point, where just about everyone dies, to put things lightly. While the Eclipse is active in Diablo Immortal, players will be transported to a nightmarish hellscape where they will need to band together to fight for their lives as if they had been marked with the Brand of Sacrifice, and can even encounter a new boss sent to do the Godhand's bidding.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo Immortal is additionally introducing a new Legendary Gem inspired by the Crimson Behelit, which will increase damage dealt while above 50% health, reduce damage dealt when below 30% health, and can release a howl of terror to fear nearby enemies. New Golem familiar skins will also be added.</p><p dir="ltr">There will of course be cosmetic armor sets based on the Berserker armor and Griffith's armor for sale as well, in addition to some free Berserk-themed login rewards that can be claimed. Those free login rewards include a free weapon-appearance cosmetic, among them Guts' Dragonslayer greatsword, though the first weapon cosmetic claimed will be specific to the class currently being played--so choose wisely.</p><p>Diablo 4 Season 8 begins April 29, and will introduce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">Lair Boss system which overhauls much of Diablo 4's endgame</a> loop.

The "Sizzlin'" tracer pack, as it's called, includes a variety of cosmetics based on the salt-cured pork treat, along with a death effect that turns enemies into strips of bacon when eliminated.</p><p>The Sizzlin' tracer pack is one of COD's most expensive bundles, carrying a cost of 3,000 COD Points--that's about $30. For that, players get multiple weapon variants that add strips of bacon to your guns, along with a special skin, "Not Enough Bacon," which is basically a ghillie suit made of bacon.</p><p>The special bacon-themed death effect, meanwhile, turns enemies into strips of bacon, while the bundle also comes with a cast iron frying pan melee weapon.

            <p>OutRun is the next video game to be reportedly getting itself a movie adaptation.</p>
<p>As revealed by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/">Deadline</a>, sources say Universal is planning to release a film based on Sega's arcade video game, with with Michael Bay - known for the likes of Bad Boys, The Rock ("Welcome to The Rock!") and the first five films in the Transformers film series - acting as director.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Euphoria and The White Lotus actress Sydney Sweeney is attached to produce the film, with Jayson Rothwell on writing duties. Rothwell's previous credits include <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4139588/?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Polar (2019)</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2347497/?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Silent Night (2012)</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397753/?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Zemanovaload (2005)</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, further details are fairly thin on the ground. In the words of Deadline, "plot details are vague". Given its source material, though, we can assume that it will have something to do with racing. Perhaps, more specifically, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-of-the-best-cars">racing in a Ferrari</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Martin Robinson wrote a feature dedicated to OutRun back in 2019.</p>
<p>"I've made OutRun's journey countless times over the years, whether that's in one of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a>'s virtual Hong Kong arcades, via M2's phenomenal 3DS port or more recently its Switch effort," he wrote in his snappily titled article <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outrun-is-still-the-pinnacle-of-driving-games">OutRun is still the pinnacle of driving games</a>.</p>
<p>"Such platforms can only deliver a sliver of the full experience, though - playing OutRun on the deluxe cabinet is a revelation. It's an all-body experience, a kind of funky alternative to virtual reality that plays to all of your senses."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in video game to big screen news, earlier this month a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-teaser-for-five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sequel-is-here">new teaser trailer for Five Nights at Freddy's 2 was revealed</a>.

			<p>Steel Seed starts strong with an atmospheric cut scene with cinematic camera angles and a tease of something special. A woman is trapped in a lab, seemingly undergoing a medical procedure, with a scientist in the background who seems to be battling to save her life. While the rest of the game doesn’t reach these dramatic heights, it’s a solid, if generic, stealth action game which I really enjoyed playing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steel Seed - Extended Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/54GQWU6FHB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Skip forward a few millennia and our heroine, Zoe, wakes up in an underground facility and discovers she is now a cyborg. She seems to take this fact, along with the news that humankind is dead and she is the only one who can bring them back, rather matter-of-factly. I would have spent a good ten minutes freaking out if that happened to me, but nope, off she skips along with her new robot drone pal Koby to meet S4VI (or as it’s pronounced, Savi), a super buff AI who struts around a vast library with little more than a loin cloth covering his AI Ooh-I-Says.</p>


<p>More exposition reveals that Zoe’s dad has digitally stored humankind while the planet fixes itself, and to return to the good old days Zoe needs to go find her dead father who has inconveniently split himself into four digital shards. Each shard is located within a nest of mechs controlled the evil robot overlord Hogo, and you can tell he is the bad guy because he has red eyes and a very big gun.</p>
<p>Each of the four areas has a distinct visual style, but they all roughly follow the same format with sections of platforming followed by large open areas that require stealth. The platforming includes lots of clambering around ledges in an Uncharted style, but that’s joined by wall running, bounce pads, zip wires and timed puzzles. It’s usually obvious where you have to go next, and checkpoints are spaced quite generously, so while there’s nothing new or surprising, it’s well put together and usually lots of fun.</p>

<p>Like most action adventure games, as long as you are quite close to where the next platform or ledge is, you get a tiny boost to make sure you grab it even though gravity would suggest you would not. The exception here seems to be zip wires, some of which are located at the end of wall running sequences, which are annoyingly difficult to grab onto.</p>

<p>After a lengthy section of being athletic you will encounter a larger area patrolled by different types of robots, signalling that it’s time for stealth. Again, there’s little surprising or new here, with disruption fields substituted for long grass to hide in, sending out a pulse being the sci-fi equivalent of throwing a stone to attract an enemy – all things any stealth fan should be familiar with but with a technological twist.</p>
<p>It’s here where Koby, your sci-fi Assassin’s Creed Eagle, comes in to play as you can take control of him and use his vision to check out enemy locations and patrols. He can also flip switches, drop mines, glitch fields and attack enemies, but if he is spotted then he will get a good battering and become inactive for a minute or so.&nbsp; Zoe always utters an anguished cry of “Oh no! Koby!” when het gets knocked out, which seems a bit silly after then twentieth time, as by then she should know he’s always going to come back to life moments later.</p>
<p>When hidden, Zoe can stealth kill most enemies, but if she’s spotted, you may need to fight your way out. She has the usual light and heavy attacks and a dodge, and you can add in ground slams, perfect dodge attacks and more by buying upgrades. The enemies do have weak points, the game tells you, but as they are tiny and – going against convention – the same colour as the rest of the enemy. It was only through trial and error I worked what they were. Zoe herself can’t attack these points, but she can control Koby and use him as a rather rubbish gun that runs out of steam after a couple of shots. It’s a nice idea but badly explained, and only really useful near the end of the game when you have upgraded both Zoe and Koby. One nice feature is the ability to hack the enemy robots and turn them to your side, which is very satisfying when used on machine gun turrets that can can wipe out most of a level in seconds.</p>

<p>While there are only seven enemy types, they are placed strategically on the maps to give you a challenge, and if one is alerted many from the surrounding area will head into battle. Fighting, while fun, is really the last resort as the robots are vicious and will soon kill you. They are also quite clever,&nbsp; if they are chasing you and you hide in an air duct or on top of a platform they won’t just mill around, complain for 20 seconds and then go back on patrol, they will throw grenades to flush you out.</p>
<p>Sprinkled throughput the game are chase sections with Zoe rushing through platforming levels that are collapsing around her, side on scrolling sections, flying, and even a surfboard, all of which keep things from becoming too repetitive.</p>
<p>As the game comes to its conclusion, the plot twists shouldn’t really surprise anyone, but I did find it annoying that after making you stealth through pretty much the entire game the final boss battle is a hack and slash affair which is rather more difficult if you have been spending most of your upgrade points on stealth and utility mechanics.</p>

<p>I applaud the fact that Zoe’s father is not voiced but some posh English man as genius scientists usually are, instead he has a strong modern London accent which means “Nothing” is pronounced “Nuffink”. Unfortunately, the actor seems to have been hurried along as the lines are missing emotional depth. He sounds more robotic than the robots!</p>
<p>I finished the game in around 15 hours but only scratched the surface when it comes to secrets and collectables, so there’s a reason to replay if that’s you thing. I really enjoyed Steel Seed. It’s got rough edges but its packed full of ambition and with more time and a bigger budget the developers, Storm in a Tea Cup, are certainly ones to watch out for.</p>

			<p>In the recent past, we have seen the rise of titles heavily inspired by gaming greats that offer an enjoyable time thanks to the high quality of their experiences, which makes it easy to see past the almost complete lack of innovation. At the same time, some of these games allow fans of genres that don't see much representation nowadays to experience more of what they love. This is exactly what Storm in a Teacup's Steel Seed is: a very solid action-adventure game that immediately brings the Uncharted series, and in turn, other games that have been heavily inspired by it, like the Star Wars Jedi series, to mind that delivers a solid action-adventure experience that all fans of the genre will surely like.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250325135131_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Steel Seed is set in a dark sci-fi world dominated by machines where humanity is on the brink of destruction. Following a short dream-like sequence where the main character, Zoe, briefly converses with her father, the young woman wakes up in a world that feels all but alien to her eyes. And not just the world around her, as she has been turned into a robot without any explanation. The new capabilities this new body grants her, however, are just perfect for the journey that awaits her inside a hostile underground facility, at the end of which she will find the answer she seeks. This journey won't be easy, and it will only with the help of her drone companion Koby and the mysterious S4VI, who seems to be guiding her towards the answers her father, Dr. Archer, wanted her to find, that Zoes will be able to understand what happened to humanity, why every machine she encounters is intent on killing her and the involvement of her father in the events that led to the almost complete extinction of humanity.</p>
<p>The story of Steel Seed is narrated using both typical cutscenes and a series of optional data logs hidden inside the underground facility that provide additional information on the events that led to the current state of the world. In terms of character development, main character Zoe is mostly developed using dialogue sequences during gameplay, of which there are quite a few. The young woman often converses with the drone Koby, who speaks a language only Zoe can understand, while traversing the imposing underground facility, making these sequences feel like the monologues Aloy often launches into in the Horizon series.</p>
<p>The series developed by Guerrilla has obviously been a massive influence on Steel Seed, as shades of Zero Dawn's story can be easily spotted during the adventure, as can those of NieR Replicant's, although without the massive emotional impact the first entry in the series created by Yoko Taro has. Still, despite the feel of been-there-done-that, the story is entertaining enough, and provides enough motivation to continue plunging deeper into this dark, mostly mechanical world.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250325141017_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In terms of gameplay, Steel Seed doesn't stray too far from boundaries set by cinematic action-adventure games like the Uncharted series or, more closely, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (more than its sequel), due to the almost complete linear nature of the adventure. As such, those who played these games will find the experience rather familiar, with a balanced mix between not particularly challenging climbing/platforming sequences, which are made easier by ledges being visibly highlighted, and stealth and combat scenarios.</p>
<p>While the platforming sequences are not challenging at all, they are still enjoyable thanks to their varied design, some choice camera angles that provide stunning views of the mechanical world of the game, and Zoe's excellent mobility that makes her a joy to control, although jumps do feel a little too floaty. Platforming is, without a doubt, one of the strongest suits of the Steel Seed experience, as the vast majority of traversal challenges are well thought-out, and some even feel like proper puzzles that involve not only maneuvering Zoe but also using TOBY to activate switches, which also come in a time-sensitive variety, making every platforming sequence really nice to play.</p>
<p>If traversal and platforming in Steel Seed are heavily influenced by the Uncharted series, combat has been influenced by a slew of other games. Going from the footage released before the game's launch, Steel Seed may feel like a Soulslike, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Sure, the genre spawned by the FromSoftware series definitely influenced Steel Seed's combat in some ways, but aside from the weighty feel and the ability to use light and heavy attacks, the game by Storm in a Teacup feels nothing like the Souls series and the genre it has spawned. The lack of a stamina bar, for example, makes combat in Steel Seed feel very different from your typical Soulslike, as do the many abilities Zoe can use, including a perfect dodge which rewards players with buffs and other advantages. The lack of a stamina bar, however, also highlights what's, in my opinion, the biggest issue of combat in the game: the lack of depth. With only some exceptions, the vast majority of enemies, which include both long-ranged and melee fighters, can be defeated by mashing the light attack button, rendering most combat mechanics a little pointless. Some enemies will fight back and resist getting stagger-locked by multiple attacks, to be sure, but still, combat is definitely not the game's fortè.</p>
<p>The acceptable, but not particularly deep, combat highlights even more how Steel Seed is, first and foremost, a stealth game. In this regard, the game delivers a basic, yet solid, experience, providing Zoe with all the tools she needs to sneak past enemies unnoticed, which include the ability to use walls as cover and shoot different bullet types using TOBY that can be used to distract enemies, silent takedowns against unaware enemies, taking advantage of anything the environment offers, including some special fields that completely conceal Zoe's presence and so on. Thanks to a varied level design, stealth gameplay stays engaging from beginning to end, although the experience tends to drag a bit towards the end. Considering how stealth is never required to proceed, it is entirely possible to always fight enemies head-on, which is a nice touch that gives players more options regarding how they want to tackle the campaign.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250327132136_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Possibly attempting to address the repetition that inevitably settles in a few hours into Steel Seed, the game features an interesting take on character progression that also does a good job of teaching players how to use the many abilities at Zoe's disposal. During the course of the adventure, Zoe is able to collect Glitch, an experience points-like currency that can be used to unlock different skills available via three different skill trees. For skills to become unlockable, however, players will need to complete some very simple challenges that often involve using other skills properly, such as scanning the environment to tag enemies, use Perfect Dodges a certain amount of time and so on. This organic approach to character progression works extremely well, as it doesn't force grinding or anything else that doesn't fit right into the natural flow of the adventure, and it's a really great feature that I hope will make an appearance in other games to reduce the amount of tedious busy work that often gets rewarded poorly.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, Steel Seed takes full advantage of the engine's Lumen tech to deliver a great sense of scale and the sort of artificial illumination one expects to see in a world made of steel inhabited by machines, which look great not only during regular gameplay but also during the many cinematic setpieces the game features. The developer also used lighting in a rather clever way to implement the infamous "green paint" that is meant to guide players to their next objective. While I generally dislike this sort of hand-holding, I feel Steel Seed definitely required something of the sort, as navigating the world can get a little confusing at times, due to its design. Character models are far less advanced, but they do their job reasonably well, also thanks to solid animation work, and properly fit the world they roam.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Steel Seed 4K PC Gameplay - DLSS Quality" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Webz1jpyOcM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On PC, Steel Seed offers plenty of additional options over the console releases with support for NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR 3, Intel XeSS, and UE5 TSR in terms of upscaling solutions and plenty of graphics options to tweak, including post-processing effects. Both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR also supports Frame Generation, with the former also offering Multi Frame Generation on the RTX 5000 series, though top-end GPUs are unlikely to require any sort of frame generation to hit high frame rates. On my system (i7-13700F CPU, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), the game had no trouble running at above 100 FPS at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode and High quality preset. A benchmark session held in the Chained Towers area confirmed the generally solid performance of the game, returning an average FPS of 102, with a 60 FPS 1% low. Being a linear game, Unreal Engine 5 handles the experience well, as I have experienced no stuttering issues outside of some minor hiccups that had no major impact.</p>

<p>Steel Seed is not going to win any awards for innovation, but a game doesn't always need to be innovative to be engaging. While the vast majority of the game's core features have already been seen, when put together, they deliver a solid experience that fans of games like Uncharted and the Star Wars Jedi series will surely enjoy. Just don't expect to find deep combat, character customization, or anything too advanced: the game is all about Zoe's journey into the mysterious world she finds herself thrown into, and every game mechanic is at the service of this story, for better or worse.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Steel Seed may not be the most original game around, but its action-adventure formula serves as a solid tribute to the Uncharted and Star Wars Jedi series, offering an intriguing story and setting, engaging traversal and stealth mechanics, and impressive world design that captures the scale of a world overtaken by machines. Unfortunately, the lack of originality, along with a general lack of depth, does impact the experience, as the gameplay starts to feel repetitive a few hours in. Still, Zoe’s journey is one worth taking for those seeking an experience in the vein of Naughty Dog’s beloved dormant franchise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that a movie based on the classic Sega racing property&nbsp;<em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>is in the works, and two major Hollywood figures are apparently attached to the project.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadline</a>, the&nbsp;<em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>movie is in development at Universal, and attached to direct is none other than&nbsp;<em>Transformers&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;</em>director Michael Bay.</p>

<p>Deadline says that Bay will also serve as a producer, and he'll take that role alongside&nbsp;<em>Madame Web&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Immaculate&nbsp;</em>star Sydney Sweeney, although it's not clear whether she'll be starring in the movie as well.</p>

<p>It's likely that when it comes to developing <em>OutRun</em>, Universal has been buoyed by the phenomenal success of recent video game adaptations like A&nbsp;Minecraft Movie (the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer" rel="nofollow">terrible first trailer</a> for which did nothing to dent its box office)&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-movie-stats" rel="nofollow"><em>The Super Mario Bros.

<p>There's also a success closer to home to which Universal can look, namely that of&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>, the movie adaptations of which cumulatively&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">crossed $1 billion at the box office</a> back in January.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that video game movies are big business, but adapting&nbsp;<em>OutRun</em>, a franchise that has historically been very light indeed on story, might be a trickier prospect than doing the same for&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>or even&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>.</p>

<p>Still, if you just can't wait for more video game movies, there are plenty on the way. Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">set for 2027</a>, and movies based on the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report" rel="nofollow"><em>Split Fiction</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Shinobi</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">Kingmakers</a>&nbsp;</em>are all apparently also in the works.</p>

            <p>Ah, well thank heck for that. I thought I'd spent my weekend hunched over a screen in a goblinesque sweat-trance. No! Says <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> voice actor Andy Serkis: I was simply partaking in some vital culture; a veritable Wildean sophisticate. Film industry folks thought games were "not an art form in any stretch," <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/andy-serkis-says-the-film-industry-could-not-exist-without-video-games">Serkis told Game Watcher</a>, "and gradually it's taken over the film industry, which could not exist without it." Take that, Roger Ebert's dead wrong dead horse of a dead body.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have called myself a gamer at all,” said the Lord Of The Rings actor, who also worked on Enslaved: Odyssey to the West with Alex Garland. "But I was always very interested in next generation storytelling. Around 2004, when we made Heavenly Sword, I started our <a href="http://www.imaginariumuk.com/">performance capture studio</a> with a view to create immersive stories outside of traditional 2D experiences, like cinema or television.”</p>

<p>"There used to be a terrible snobbery from the film industry with [videogames] being the lesser cousin,” Serkis said. “That they didn’t really tell stories, it was just about the gameplay, hack ‘n’ slash, and killing people". But games have "come of age" since then, he says. "There are actors coming out of drama schools who want to be in videogames and see it as another part of the palate of what it is to be a performer.”</p>
<p>I assume Serkis is mostly referring to things like the importance of motion capture tech to modern filmmaking, though I'm always a little resistant to the easy gratification offered by these "games are legitimate art now" arguments. Since, you know, they always were and you don't need either filmmakers or actors to tell you that. But also: it's vitally important that no-one ever take a videogame remotely seriously under any circumstances. Please trust me on this. Anyway, here is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/nov/08/andy-serkis-enslaved-interview">fun Guardian interview from 2014</a>, in which Serkis reveals that he was first approached for Ninja Theory's Heavenly Sword by his mortgage broker. "He showed me a trailer after we'd discussed mortgage rates and I thought it was fantastic".</p>
<p>As for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 itself, I think I'm probably allowed to tell you that Serkis is very good in the turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, as are the entire voice cast, as is…oh, nope, skirting dangerously enclose to the embargo here. I'll have a review up tomorrow morning anyway. You may be able to piece together my feelings by reading my last two "what are we playing?" entries. Eep.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ahead of its launch on June 5, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">anyone looking to preorder a Switch 2 console</a> will be able to grab a few accessories to go along with it. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> Pro Controller will be one of the devices available to purchase, and while it looks very similar to the first-gen model that launched alongside the Switch in 2017, Nintendo says one aspect of it has been significantly improved.</p><p>On the official <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/hardware/nintendo-switch-2/tech-specs/">Nintendo website</a> (via <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-takes-50-less-time-to-charge-than-the-switch-pro-controller/" rel="nofollow ">NintendoSoup</a>), the company claims that the controller can now be charged in approximately three hours when the console is in sleep mode--around half the time of the original Pro Controller. What makes this interesting is that the new Pro Controller has a smaller 1070 mAh battery when compared to the original--it has a 1,300 mAh battery--and for overall battery life, Nintendo says that you can expect up to 40 hours of use depending on the game you're playing and usage conditions.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1645316666" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

                <p>Following the success of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-3-will-tease-new-character-at-the-end-of-the-movie/1100-6527743/" data-ref-id="1100-6527743">Sonic the Hedgehog movies</a>, another Sega franchise may be heading to the big screen. Director Michael Bay and actress Sydney Sweeney are reportedly working on an adaptation of Sega's 1986 arcade racing hit OutRun.</p><p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Bay is attached to direct OutRun from a script by Jayson Rothwell. However, Sweeney is only signed on as a producer, not a star. Sweeney is one of the busiest actresses in Hollywood, and her upcoming roles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sydney-sweeneys-barbarella-remake-targets-director-edgar-wright/1100-6523413/" data-ref-id="1100-6523413">include the Barbarella remake</a>. She has also shifted to producing her own projects.</p><p>The OutRun arcade game doesn't have any story to speak of, since it and all of its follow-up games are racing titles. There hasn't been a new game in the series since 2009's OutRun Online Arcade. Hollywood studios have previously attempted to adapt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shinobi-movie-is-in-the-works-drive-and-scott-pilg/1100-6439363/" data-ref-id="1100-6439363">Shinobi</a> and other classic Sega games, but only Sonic came to fruition on the big screen.</p><p>Universal does have a good track record for making successful video game movies. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-actually-awesome/1900-6418051/" data-ref-id="1900-6418051">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a> was one of the biggest hits of 2023 with $1.363 billion worldwide, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-review-too-much-plot/1900-6418144/" data-ref-id="1900-6418144">Five Nights At Freddy's</a> far exceeded expectations with its $297.1 million worldwide take.</p><p>The huge box office of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review/1900-6418350/" data-ref-id="1900-6418350">A Minecraft Movie</a> may also push more video game adaptations to the big screen. But few films could ever hope to match its $717.8 million box office to date, and it's likely to reach over $1 billion by the time A Minecraft Movie finishes its theatrical run.</p>

Its release sparked a player surge as fans flocked to test out the new subclasses as well as the brand new photo mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Baldur’s Gate 3 hit a player concurrent peak of 169,267 over the weekend — an incredible feat for a single-player focused role-playing game in its second year. Sony and Microsoft do not make PlayStation nor Xbox player numbers publicly available.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on the release of Patch 8, Larian chief Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1914637297946931379" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say he expects Baldur’s Gate 3 to “continue to do well for quite some time,” not just because of the Patch 8 player boost, but because of “thriving” mod support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This in turn gives Larian “room to focus on making our next big thing as good as we can,” Vincke continued. “We’ve got big shoes to fill.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Feeling good today about where we are with BG3," Vincke said. "Patch 8 got a lot of people playing again. It took a lot of development effort but I'm happy we did it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With mod support thriving, I think the game will now continue to do well for quite some time. It gives us room to focus on making our next big thing as good as we can and that focus is more than welcome. We've got big shoes to fill."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 8, as Larian has signalled, is the final major update for the game and draws a line under what has been a remarkable time for the developer. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review"><u>Baldur’s Gate 3 launched to critical acclaim</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larians-huge-2023-profits-revealed"><u>enormous commercial success</u></a> back in 2023, and has continued to sell strongly throughout 2024 and into 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian shocked the gaming world by confirming its intention to leave Baldur’s Gate 3 and Dungeons &amp; Dragons behind to work on a brand new game, which it teased at various points before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-says-its-full-attention-is-on-its-next-game-media-blackout-for-the-foreseeable"><u>announcing a media blackout to focus on the new mystery project</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">D&amp;D owner Hasbro, however, has teased plans to continue with the series. Speaking to IGN at the Game Developers Conference, SVP of digital games at Hasbro, Dan Ayoub, let on that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated"><u>with Larian moving on</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says"><u>Hasbro has "a lot of people very interested in Baldur's Gate."</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that," Ayoub said. "And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ayoub didn't offer any further information about whether this "stuff" would be a full-blown new Baldur's Gate in the works, or some sort of crossover like the characters had with Magic: The Gathering previously. However, he did acknowledge that he eventually <em>wants</em> a Baldur's Gate 4, but that making one will likely take a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he said. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
