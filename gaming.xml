During today's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-direct-showcase-announced-for-this-week-with-metal-gear-solid-and-silent-hill/1100-6532278/" data-ref-id="1100-6532278">Konami Direct Showcase</a>, the new online multiplayer mode was officially announced as Fox Hunt. However, it won't simply be a rehash of MGO.</p><p>During Konami's presentation, Fox Hunt director Yu Sahara described it as "camouflage and hide-and-go-seek to the next level," before adding that players will have the choice of remaining hidden with their advanced camo or attempting to find their own hidden foes. He added that it shares the same world as Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but the gameplay will be "completely different."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDLzPdKuOkE" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oDLzPdKuOkE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Metal Gear Online was originally released in 2008 alongside Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. While Sahara acknowledged the similarities between Fox Hunt and MGO, he added that the former "will be its own new type of mode" because the online landscape has drastically changed since changed since MGO in Metal Gear Solid 4 and Metal Gear Solid V.</p><p>Shara promised that more information about Fox Hunt will be released soon. In the meantime, Konami showed off Snake Eater's Ape Escape crossover, Snake vs. Monkey, which will be available on PS5 and PC. Xbox Series X|S is getting a Snake vs. Bomberman mode instead.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be released on PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on August 28.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Last year, the horror film titans at Blumhouse announced a video games label and brought its first game as a publisher, Fear The Spotlight, to Summer Game Fest. I eventually reviewed that one and found it to be a worthy entry-level horror game. It was creepy, but not overly scary, and made for a reasonable gateway into the genre for younger or less experienced players. At Summer Game Fest 2025, Blumhouse showed off two more games that, while perhaps not specifically for beginners, do well to express Blumhouse Games' publishing vision.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grave-seasons/" data-ref-id="5000-631819">Grave Seasons</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crisol-theater-of-idols/" data-ref-id="5000-601756">Crisol: Theater of Idols</a> are each horror games, but couldn't be more different otherwise. The former is 2D, the latter is 3D. Grave Seasons is presented in third-person, while Crisol is played in first-person. Grave Seasons is also a dark twist on farming sims, whereas Crisol blends elements of recent Resident Evil games with BioShock, all set in a world inspired by Spanish art and folklore. Blumhouse brought these two games to Summer Game Fest 2025, giving me a preview of what's to come from a publisher that is technically still in its infancy, but also carries the name recognition and reputation of one of modern horror's biggest brands.</p><p dir="ltr">In the movie world, it feels like one out of every two horror films displays Blumhouse's logo in their opening moments. While I'm sure that's not literally true, it's certainly the case that the production company has its hands in all kinds of horror productions, from major series like The Conjuring and Paranormal Activity to legendary one-offs like Get Out and 2020's remake of The Invisible Man. The prospect of the company getting into horror video games is an exciting one for me, as I hope the publisher can use a keen eye to lift notable projects out of obscurity.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gj9vincgw4" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Gj9vincgw4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We have this internal saying: 'We're making all different flavors of horror games for everyone,' Blumhouse's Ara Josefsson told me after my demos with the publisher's SGF 2025 slate. "People think of horror, and maybe they have a very siloed perception of what that would be based on where they come from. Is it body horror? Is it jump scares? But there's actually a pretty big spectrum of what horror games are. I think our future games will impress upon that as well."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Grave Seasons and Crisol, Blumhouse has already announced several future games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sleep-awake/" data-ref-id="5000-631820">Sleep Awake</a> is a first-person horror adventure from the interesting pairing of Spec Ops: The Line's director Cory Davis and Nine Inch Nails' guitarist Robin Finck about a dystopian world without sleep. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-simulation/" data-ref-id="5000-631821">The Simulation</a> is a VR title about investigating a horror game not known to have existed before. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-c/" data-ref-id="5000-615695">Project C</a>, admittedly the one I'm personally most excited about, is the next Sam Barlow game, and this time he's enlisted Brandon Cronenberg for what is likely to be something gruesome, if the latter's filmography is a reliable clue about the mysterious game.</p><p dir="ltr">Grave Seasons' pitch is perhaps the most compelling of the whole list so far, though. The game's Stardew-like setup soon gives way to a violent murder--and a murder mystery follows. Blending the gameplay elements of something like a Stardew Valley with a story about a serial killer seems poised to toy with the genre's usual romance angles and gamified friendships. I'm eager to see how the game might spin the neighborhood cast of characters into a whodunnit.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5oNGQ4KWPg" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y5oNGQ4KWPg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Crisol's art style was impressive, too, and I'm most looking forward to playing this one in the developers' native language, Spanish, once it releases. The gunplay was rough in my demo, as aiming down sights proved to be unreliable, but I'm hoping that gets improved before it releases later this year. Making up for that roughness was the game's clever wrinkle: You reload your gun with your own blood, so you'll have to balance your ammo against your own health. In my time with the game, I found myself having to combat my habit of reloading after every encounter, which added a challenging layer to the game.</p><p dir="ltr">There are two things I've found to be true about horror fans: rarely do they like just one kind of horror, and often they're obsessive about the genre. Blumhouse isn't the only games label pulling diverse, smaller-sized horror projects into the limelight--DreadXP has been doing it for years and Critical Reflex is a new label showing signs of similar intentions--but like Annapurna does for weird (complimentary) art games, Blumhouse's name recognition does some heavy lifting for the horror games it signs. Even if, like Blumhouse's movies, they don't all prove to be winners, I'm looking forward to experimenting with whatever projects they reveal for the foreseeable future.</p>

The 2.0 Storm's Brewing update adds deadly storms and new enemy types, and  it makes biomes harsher to survive. Here's everything you need to know about the 7 Days To Die 2.0 Storm's Brewing update, including how to watch early gameplay and join the beta build.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Storm's Brewing makes major environmental changes</h2><p dir="ltr">The 2.0 Storm's Brewing update adds a new layer to survival. The zombies won't be the only threat players need to fear, as the update adds new dynamic weather to survive. Each biome will have its own unique storm, and each one will feature a different scale of difficulty to survive. These are deadly and only give players a short amount of time to seek or build shelter before they start taking damage.</p>

			<p>How do you follow up a nigh on perfect video game? It’s a problem that Nintendo has faced more often than most, yet with each generation they release a game that brings new perspectives and twists while also refining the core ideas further. Mario Kart 8 in particular was the culmination of this iconic series first two decades. Sure, everyone might have their favourite that they grew up with or spent years playing in split-screen with siblings and friend, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/05/15/mario-kart-8-review/">Mario Kart 8</a> game refined and honed everything so, so brilliantly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> had to take a completely different approach for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, providing some brilliant and hugely fun new twists to the series. There’s the big open world that you can free roam around, and which provides the basis for all the races, there’s the 24-player races, and the Knockout Tour. It’s bigger, it’s bolder… and it’s also more inconsistent.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World Review –&nbsp;Big, Bold, Essential, Cow" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5OOlJ-7svmo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>From the off, the kart racing feels immediate and familiar in all the right ways. You boost start the same way, you drift the same, slipstream the same, still hold up to two items — so many of the core elements are instantly recognisable — but there have also been a lot of nips, tucks and tweaks along the way.</p>
<p>In general the driving is now much more expressive, the tilt and suspension travel as you drift through corners more cartoony, but also subtly more informative for what your kart is doing. This goes hand-in-hand with the renewed character designs and animations.</p>


<p>You will see your character’s jump boost animations a lot in Mario Kart World, whether it’s flying off a regular ramp, bouncing across waves on the open sea with the newly transforming vehicles, grinding along rails or wall-riding, you’re constantly tapping the shoulder button for mini-boosts. The latter two additions are nice to have, but difficult to master and feel fairly inessential compared to simply nailing your drifts. Getting onto a rail can be more difficult than it’s worth, as you either have to hit the start of the rail where it meets the ground or charge up a jump to hop on. This uses the same shoulder button as drifting, and will just start drifting if you put any steering in. It flummoxes muscle memory and makes going for a grind rail feel too risky.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World is a lot more forgiving when you get hit by items. You now keep some momentum when tumbling after getting hit by a shell, a Bullet Bill rampaging through will tilt people out of the way instead of spinning them out, and the lightning strike doesn’t keep you tiny for quite so long. That does make items that steal movement all the more punishing, most notably the Mega Mushroom squashing people flat.</p>

<p>A big reason for this general shift in the items is the boosted race size, which leaps from 12 to a whopping 24-players. Doubling the number of players means double the number of items being grabbed and fired off, leading to significantly more chaotic races. It’s still possible for the leading player to make a break for it while everyone behind descends into anarchy fighting over second, but wherever you are, it’s&nbsp;devastatingly easy to tumble from the leading positions to the back half of the field after getting hit by multiple items in quick succession. This can be brutal in the last few seconds of the race or just before a checkpoint.</p>
<p>That said, you can just as easily rampage up the leaderboard, with the game still favouring those toward the back with Bullet Bills, Mega Mushrooms and (perhaps most commonly) Golden Mushrooms.</p>

<p>While you feel all of these changes in the regular races and Grand Prix, it really comes together in Knockout Tour, the huge elimination mode that races all the way across the world map, knocking the last four racers out at each checkpoint until just four remain to race for victory. It’s a great mode, and my go-to for online play, but it is the embodiment of this even more chaotic style of Mario Kart racing. Knockout Tour is what all of this feels like it was designed for, and it has a knock on effect through the rest of the game as well.</p>
<p>Grand Prix is still a sequence of four races, but after zipping around the first track for three laps, all the subsequent races start with a drive through the open world to the next track, and then finish with generally one lap of that circuit. It dilutes the traditional Mario Kart experience, making Grand Prix into a training ground for Knockout Tour, replacing more bespoke race tracks with the arguably less exciting open world.</p>

<p>The open world is still great, in its own way. Nintendo and their partners have put in a lot of effort to fill it with different biomes, and stuffing it with nods and winks to everything Mario. When exploring in Free Roam, you’ll find collectables and P-Switch challenges to test both your exploration and driving skills, yet it cannot escape the curse that every open world has a boring areas you have to pass through to get to the next landmark. The jump to 24-players mean that roads must be wider and have huge banks of unmissable item boxes, and where bespoke circuits can do interesting loops and twists, there’s so many stretches in the open world sections that are just long straights or mild curves. No amount of Nintendo magic will make a highway not a highway.</p>
<p>One fix for this is would be to have a classic Grand Prix mode alongside the new. You can still do a pure 3-lap race of any track in Vs. mode, alongside point-to-point race combos that aren’t featured in the other modes, but the go-to for players will be Grand Prix, Knockout Tour.</p>

<p>The inherent messiness of this new direction is also found in the character list. The main cast are all here, looking better than ever, and have a bunch of costumes to unlock, but its like Nintendo took the franchise and shook it until everyone fell out. The field is littered with every creature and enemy that Mario has ever met, and they’re not given anywhere near the same amount of love. DK only has a single costume to find, and as beloved as Cow has become, she doesn’t even have a cute hat to find. And then there’s all the nonsensical inclusions of Sidestepper, Swoop the bat, Dolphin, Fish Bone and more. They’re funny, but they rarely make sense when sat on a bike and you can see that Fish Bone just sort of floats over the seat.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World is particularly good online. There’s Grand Prix, Knockout Tour and Battle, but you can also create a custom lobby for your friends to join and just share the world in Free Roam. It’s nice, and combines well with the Switch 2’s new GameChat feature, allowing you to play socially without jumping through hoops to talk to your friends. If you have a camera, then the game can also track your face and insert it as a marker for you in races, highlighting where your friends/enemies are for when you fancy whacking them with a shell.</p>
<p>But where partying up in Free Roam is easy, it’s annoying that you can’t jump directly into other modes with your lobby of friends. You can join your friends, but only when they’re already in a matchmaking lobby, and when lobbies fill up within seconds it adds a lot of faff where you then wait for the end of a race and then try to join up. Please make this easier in a patch, Nintendo.</p>

<p>And of course, there’s local split-screen, which works as well as you’d hope. Yes it will drop the frame rate to accommodate four players, but it’s still a lot of fun, and if you have a camera, that can add four player highlights to add to the shenanigans.</p>

			<p>MindsEye, the game developed by Build A Rocket Boy, the studio founded by former Rockstar Games producer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creators-mindseye-game-slated-to-launch-this-summer/">Leslie Benzies</a>, isn't exactly having the best launch. Even before the game launched, it wasn't having a good lead-up to release.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">Two chief executives at Build A Rocket Boy left the studio</a> a week before the game was due to release. The last major <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">trailer ahead of launch</a>, instead of getting people excited about the game, brought even more eyes to the game in a negative way, after early previews were less-than-enthusiastic. It also didn't help that the co-chief executive officer of the studio was claiming that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">anyone who had something negative to say about MindsEye was being paid to be negative</a>.</p>
<p>Then, less than a week before launch, physical copies of the game started to appear in the wild as retail stores broke street date. The studio warned players that <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">the game on the disc would be missing a "<em>major</em>" day-one patch</a>, but that warning didn't do much to quell players' concerns that the day-one patch would fix all the issues those who had early copies were already seeing.</p>
<p>Now, the game is out, and on PC, we're already seeing that it's poorly optimized on PC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-unreal-engine-5-gpu-destroyer/">only capable of hitting 60FPS at 4K, even with the beefiest of machines</a>, if NVIDIA's DLSS and Frame Generation technology are enabled. On consoles, things aren't much better, with the game being unable to hit 60FPS at all, and capped at 30 FPS.</p>
<p>And it's that last point that is causing PlayStation to give players refunds for their purchase of MindsEye. Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mindseye-players-refunds-playstation-5-ps5-like-cyberpunk-2077/">TheGamer</a>, a player on PlayStation <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/comments/1l8nl48/playstation_support_have_refunded_the_game_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">was given a refund for their purchase</a> when they pointed out to PlayStation Support that MindsEye was marketed as being playable on PS5 Pro at 60 FPS through a Pro-Enhanced mode. That's not the case, and a refund is being granted.</p>

<p>It's also not the only reason players are getting refunds, as <a href="https://x.com/WolfgangMishima/status/1932506058116759710">WolfgangMishima on X</a> was issued a refund for issues they had with the game, while PlayStation Support told them "<em>Usually, we are not allowed to process refunds for games that were downloaded because of the PlayStation Store cancellation policy. However, we understand that you are having issues with the game after the troubleshooting that you did and that you want to request a refund for it, so we'll do an exception and process your refund as a goodwill gesture on your account.</em>"</p>
<p>There's been no direct word yet from developer Build A Rocket Boy on the issues that players have been posting about beyond <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1932820162438218030">a statement that it is working on patches</a>, or the refunds, but it's clear that the studio is aware of the trouble the game is currently in. At least in one instance, the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lre7iutssk22">studio even canceled a sponsored stream it had organized,</a> almost as if it was trying to stop people from playing it publicly.</p>
<p>More accounts of refunds are appearing online, but for now, MindsEye hasn't yet gone full Cyberpunk 2077. PlayStation would have to issue a larger statement and delist it from the store for it to reach the depths that CD Projekt RED hit when Cyberpunk 2077 launched in 2020. But at least in that case, there was a good game to be played under all those bugs. If <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/">early reviews and previews</a> are anything to go off, then MindsEye is looking like<a href="https://kotaku.com/lord-rings-lotr-gollum-kotaku-review-worst-game-2023-1850606133"> 2025's Gollum.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/towa-and-guardians-of-sacred-tree-preview-mystical-japanese-hadeslike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree </em>was revealed at Summer Game Fest, and I had a chance to get my hands on the game. It has beautiful art, and the gameplay is a close sibling to <em>Hades </em>with its own twists.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Towa </em>is set in a mystical realm inspired by Japanese mythology and folklore. That is where we get one of the heroes being a human/koi fish hybrid. Someone more versed in the mythology will likely see references in many of the heroes and enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Towa Shares a lot of DNA with Hades</h2>

<p>It’s impossible not to bring up <em>Hades</em>, as so much of the framework of <em>Towa </em>is so heavily inspired by it. It’s a roguelite where you make runs to clear out rooms of enemies, make a selection based on a series of rewards you can get, then rinse and repeat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like selecting a powerup from a certain god you may want in <em>Hades</em>, Towa similarly has themed upgrade paths based around certain abilities or effects. You can try to build around that one set or go for a more varied approach.</p>



<p>You dash around the battlefield quickly, avoiding the many hazards enemies will throw your way by dodging and unleashing powerful abilities of your own. They are shown with the circles, arrows, and other indicators on where exactly to avoid.</p>

<p>Towa has a couple of big combat differences from something like <em>Hades</em>, however.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, no matter which guardian you choose to fight with (there are eight total), you’ll have a set of two swords to use in a run. You’ll be forced to constantly swap between the two as the more you use one, the more worn it gets and must be resharpened. Wear one down with some combos, swap, and repeat.</p>



<p>A lot of the upgrades are specific to one sword or another, so you can change the effects and abilities of any sword quite a bit. Moreover, it's something to make sure you keep an eye on, as it would be pretty easy to have one sword be the only effective one and the other needing some help as no upgrades have done anything to it.</p>

<p>You can also bring another guardian with you on a run. They are a little more passive and just follow you around, but have their own abilities that you can use on a cooldown to help out as well.</p>

<h2>Towa Follows the Guardians Over a Long Time</h2>

<p><em>Towa </em>takes place over a vast period of time, centered around Shinju Village. Over that course of time, as the guardians come back again and again to defend it, the village will evlove and the stories of those that live there will change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The village serves as your central hub where you’ll upgrade swords, abilities, and unlock new things over the course of time. It's where you'll learn more about the guardians, too.</p>

<p><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</em> is a competent roguelite that will certainly charm people into giving it a try with its great style. I’m also not going to complain about another excellent roguelite taking its cues from <em>Hades</em>.</p>

<hr><p>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree was previewed at Summer Game Fest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two studios were revealed to be working together on the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>remake during today's Konami Press Start livestream, where we also got some more info on upcoming games&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, both of which are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">launching</a> in the next few months.</p>

<p>While it wasn't officially revealed that the project would be a remake during the livestream, that news was subsequently confirmed by the official Japanese&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/silenthill_jp/status/1933156514614988898" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">X account</a>. The video was also accompanied by music from the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>.</p>

<p>Creating a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>makes perfect sense; it's no longer possible to play the first game on modern hardware. It is technically still available via the PlayStation 3 or PS Vita stores, but you can't play it on PC or modern consoles (without resorting to illegal methods, of course).</p>

<p>The announcement of the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>remake means that the horror franchise is officially back in full swing, having been on an extended hiatus prior to the release of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>back in October last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cronos-the-new-dawn-bloober-team-silent-hill.jpg?itok=TI1l-VE5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cronos-the-new-dawn-bloober-team-silent-hill.jpg?itok=x7wHqu24 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bloober Team is currently gearing up to release&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn&nbsp;</em>sometime this year.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>, Bloober Team is currently working on its own original horror game by the name of&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, a sci-fi spookfest that's due to launch sometime later this year.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why Konami would pick Bloober Team to work on the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill </em>remake, sales of the studio's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">topped two million back in January</a>, so that might give you some indication as to why Konami considers Bloober a safe pair of hands.</p>

Rather than compromise the Dude’s glorious return with a quick and dirty spit-shine, publisher Flat2VR Studios convinced Running With Scissors to authorize a full resurrection: preserve every scat‑splattered inch of Paradise, but rebuild the guts so the game actually boots on hardware manufactured this decade—without the aroma of burnt silicon.</p><p>The goal is simple: deliver the ultimate, no‑excuses <em>POSTAL 2</em> sandbox—rebuilt with no limits, ready for every screen you own, and still happy to let you finish your errands with a shovel. <em>POSTAL 2 Redux</em> will pack in enhanced visuals, new weapons, nastier physics, and enough Easter eggs to back‑up the porcelain at Uncle Dave’s Compound.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>High-Resolution Textures and Dynamic Lighting</strong> – Paradise’s warped billboards and puddles of questionable fluid finally get the razor‑sharp grime they deserve.</li><li><strong>Zero‑Load Streaming World</strong> – Sprint from one end of town to the other without a single elevator, door pause, or immersion‑breaker.</li><li><strong>Smarter, Freer Crowds</strong> – Civilians still snitch, cops still overreact, but improved path‑finding means riots spark faster and messier than ever.</li><li><strong>Re‑Forged Arsenal</strong> – Weighty ballistics, rag‑doll dismemberment, and rounds that punch clean through unlucky bystanders.</li><li><strong>Fully Propped, Breakable Interiors</strong> – Stores, <a title="Platforms > Arcade [378 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/arcade">arcades</a>, and alleyways are stuffed with physics‑enabled junk begging to be destroyed.</li><li><strong>Champ 2.0</strong> – Pet him, sic him, or let him photobomb your next headshot; Paradise’s goodest boy finally earns his kibble.</li></ul><p>Paradise itself will breathe: lighting shifts over the course of each in-game day—from sun-scorched afternoons to lamp-lit alleys come evening—and every junk-strewn corner bristles with physics-enabled debris begging to be destroyed.

                <p>A new Silent Hill game is in development, as Konami has announced that the studio behind the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/" data-ref-id="1900-6418296">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Bloober Team, will be remaking the very first game in the series. The reveal came at the end of the Konami Press Start Live showcase, as a short video was played and featured background music from the game. In a press release, Konami confirmed that it is the 1999 game being remade, and on social media, the company referenced an infamous quote from the game:</p><p>The original Silent Hill gave fans of survival-horror an alternative to Capcom's Resident Evil games. While it featured similar survival-horror themes, Silent Hill's deep focus on psychological terror made it stand out, and its sequel is still highly regarded as one of the best games of all time.</p><p>The franchise has made a big return, as in addition to Bloober Team's critically acclaimed remake of Silent Hill 2, a brand-new game in the series will launch in September. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-release-date-trailers-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6510045/" data-ref-id="1100-6510045">Silent Hill F marks a big departure</a> from previous games, as it shifts from the titular town of Silent Hill to Japan. The game will also focus heavily on Japanese horror, as it combines grotesque creatures pulled from local folklore with beautiful imagery.</p><p>Bloober is also busy working on a new game of its own--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-silent-hill-2-cronos-the-new-dawn-might-complete-bloober-teams-redemption-arc/1100-6532234/" data-ref-id="1100-6532234">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>--a sci-fi horror that looks like Dead Space with a time-travel twist. The studio announced earlier this year that it had signed a new deal with Konami, but at the time, it didn't specify what it was working on for the company.</p>

            <p>A Silent Hill remake has just been announced during Konami's Press Start showcase.</p>
<p>The game will be created by Bloober team in collaboration with Konami. As of writing, the only confirmed is that the game is "in development".</p>
<p>The brief reveal trailer was paired alongside the Silent Hill 1 intro theme, further confirming that this is the original game in the legendary horror series being remade.</p> <div>

<p>This remake of the original 1999 game by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>, the developer responsible for the excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>. That game received ample critical and commercial success, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">in Eurogamer's own review of the Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Vikki Blake noted: "Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves."
</p>
<p>This will be the first time Silent Hill 1 has gotten the remake treatment, although it was reimagined back in 2009 with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-shattered-memories-review">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a>. That game, released on the Wii and later ported to the PS2, was an interesting spin on the game that started it all. 
</p><p>
Bloober Team is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-release-window">which got a release date announcement at Summer Game Fest only a few days ago</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>, which was initially released four years ago (four years ago!), has a prototype mini game hidden away so well within it, that apparently nobody found it.</p>
<p>Senior designer Grant Parker showed the mini game off during a live stream on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, though developer Insomniac has since shared the clip on its social media. </p>
<p>
During this Rift Apart stream, Parker explained how to find the Easter egg for a prototype mini game, which would have allowed players to ride the mechanical bull inside Zurkie's (a bar-like establishment).</p>

<p>Like I said, the developer is pretty sure no one has discovered this Easter egg for themselves yet, and having listened to him explain it I can't say that I am surprised. To check it out, players need to head towards the entrance of Zurkie's, where they will see two signs beside the doorway informing patrons not to bring weapons inside. These are the key to unlocking the bull riding Easter egg.</p>
<p>What you have to do is shoot the left sign five times, then the right one four times, before shooting the left one 13 more times. Nothing will happen, or so it would seem as there isn't any mystical bell or anything like that that suddenly chimes to let you know you have uncovered something secret. There is literally "no confirmation, or anything," Parker explained in the video. However, if you mosey on into Zurkie's and head to the bull, you will get a prompt: Hold L2 to Ride Mechanical Bull.</p>
<p>You can check out the "super duper early" prototype mini game via the embed below. "It's just something fun that I thought I'd leave in the game," Parker said.</p> <div>

<p>Eurogamer was full of praise for Rift Apart on its PlayStation 5 release in 2021, with our Chris calling it "another lesson in laid-back, unpretentious fun".</p>
<p>"It's just pure craft, pure fun, pure video games - all the brilliant, bizarre ideas this studio has just thrown at the wall and all of them sticking. The only thing it lacks - apart from maybe a tiny bit of restraint - is pretence," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-review">Eurogamer's Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart review</a>. "There's no self-seriousness, no po-faced melodrama, no insecurity about the form. A game that's happy to be a game, in a familiar, cuddly shape.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not only that, Bloober Team – the studio that worked on the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> – is back on board.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill Remake Teaser 4K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OiYGWYd_FGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Japanese publisher didn’t give us any more information, other than announcing that the project is now in development. However, it did give us another good look at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill F</a>, with insights from the game’s developers.</p>
<p>They touched its core themes – namely the juxtaposition of gorgeous natural beauty with bone-chilling horror – and its Shōwa timeline, transporting players back to a Japan where customs and superstitions contrast the world of the original Silent Hill.</p>
<p>This new entry is being written by Ryūkishi07, a well known mangaka best known for his visual novel, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. Silent Hill F will feature a young female protagonist, Hinako, and delves into elements of psychological trauma, Japanese folklore, and health dose of trademark body horror.</p>

<p>It’s been a while since the last mainline Silent Hill games with various spin-offs and no shortage of misfires. Following games such as lukewarm Downpour, the blighted HD Collection, and the PlayStation Vita exclusive Book of Memories, there was a short break before Konami stunned us with P.T. which was the last project Hideo Kojima (Snatcher, Policenauts, Metal Gear Solid) worked on before his departure from the company. More recent Silent Hill games include the The Short Message and Ascension which were both experimental titles that ultimately went nowhere, followed by Bloober Team’s celebrated Silent Hill 2 remake.</p>
<p>Silent Hill F launches later this year on September 25th and will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store).</p>
<p>As for the Silent Hill Remake, it was likely greenlit shortly after the success of Bloober Team’s previous game, but there’s no indication on when it will release or on which platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/petal-runner-preview-pokemon-meets-warioware<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p lang="EN-US" paraeid="{280475d0-d510-4868-87d2-14c667b4b7b0}{184}" paraid="278375488" xml:lang="EN-US"><em>Petal Runner </em>is a balm for the soul in the form of the best kind of nostalgia. It’s a cozy slice of life game where you deliver artificial pets. There’s also a mystery to be solved.</p>

<h2 lang="EN-US" paraeid="{280475d0-d510-4868-87d2-14c667b4b7b0}{184}" paraid="278375488" xml:lang="EN-US">Petal Runner's Game Boy Visuals</h2>

<p paraeid="{c3d7e0ce-d02a-4e0b-bcc1-34ba4197aaac}{18}" paraid="447900538" xml:lang="EN-US">My first impressions of <em>Petal Runner</em> were that it looked just like the <em>Pokemon </em>games of my childhood. That is absolutely true and by design, as I was told by Creative Director Brandon Greer, who said he always loved the look of <em>Pokemon Red </em>and wanted to do something inspired by it.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{8730c49a-d8b5-4c50-96b8-acddb7a531f4}{236}" paraid="538743245" xml:lang="EN-US">Greer told me that he was always interested in pixel art and got into learning how to make it as a hobby. That turned into something more, which led to creating the art in <em>Petal Runner</em>. He even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BJGpixel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">runs a YouTube channel</a> with tutorials if you want to learn as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p paraeid="{4f21161a-8587-48e8-8bdb-14384b1328d0}{137}" paraid="191828718" xml:lang="EN-US">There’s no battling, but there’s also no shortage of Hanapets to befriend along the way. Delivering and calibrating, sometimes coming to repair them by recalibrating, is the name of the game as you play <em>Petal Runner</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{06b0ace7-5ed8-4943-9078-cc6c547b84be}{14}" paraid="1637422151" xml:lang="EN-US">HanaPets come in all shapes and sizes, with their own unique personalities as well. There’s your HanaPet Kira, who is quite cat-like and has a lot to say, and I saw one that was a shark swimming through the air. &nbsp;</p>



<p paraeid="{fe7086e1-21c3-4f2d-bdee-e599a2edc5dd}{106}" paraid="1797208579" xml:lang="EN-US">Instead of battles, you’ll calibrate HanaPets for people as you deliver them. Those come in the form of a series of minigames that are very reminiscent of <em>WarioWare</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{c4991f8b-ccd0-46c2-9c70-beea2366bfe4}{105}" paraid="239729365" xml:lang="EN-US">Each one only lasts a few seconds at most. For example, in one you have to land your parachute guy in the correct area. In another, you use a brush to clean up a dog quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 paraeid="{c4991f8b-ccd0-46c2-9c70-beea2366bfe4}{105}" paraid="239729365" xml:lang="EN-US">A Big Map To Explore</h2>

<p paraeid="{10032f3f-205f-48fd-9b21-b2e7c3a2efa8}{134}" paraid="718244314" xml:lang="EN-US">Most of your time, though, will be spent traveling around the fairly large world of Sapphire Valley. <em>Petal Runner </em>will feature four distinct neighborhoods that you drive through and to on your motorcycle. &nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{e7148687-3ba1-4081-a847-abe8dd14ea3e}{71}" paraid="764631281" xml:lang="EN-US">Each neighborhood will have its own sort of color palette and distinct design, too. It's not just one big sprawling city that is sort of samey, but each neighborhood will have its own personality and look to it.</p>

<p paraeid="{e7148687-3ba1-4081-a847-abe8dd14ea3e}{71}" paraid="764631281" xml:lang="EN-US">You'll have plenty of reason to travel in making deliveries, too, as there are a lot of secrets, sidequests, and side characters to befriend. Exploration is encouraged and rewarded, as just soaking in the world is the biggest appeal of these sort of games.</p>



<p paraeid="{e7148687-3ba1-4081-a847-abe8dd14ea3e}{188}" paraid="73521114" xml:lang="EN-US">I was only given access to a small portion of one neighborhood in my demo, but it had so much for me to see and do. People were boundless, shops and buildings all over, and little paths that are slightly hidden were everywhere Greer said it was a blast to design the world and fill its spaces with a lot of fun interactable characters and items.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{846fb01a-19d7-42b3-8579-091e419aa9e3}{25}" paraid="1917473999" xml:lang="EN-US">One of the areas I had access to was a mall, full of stores I could walk into and interact with customers and shopkeepers. There were shops for music, HanaPets, accessories, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{3d2877fa-b57c-4e2f-b241-0260da76da1b}{132}" paraid="1218408175" xml:lang="EN-US">It was a great nostalgic trip to the Game Boy years of something like <em>Pokemon</em>, with an elevated pixel art that they can get away with on today's technology. A lot of charm was packed into not a lot of pixels.</p>

<h2 paraeid="{3d2877fa-b57c-4e2f-b241-0260da76da1b}{132}" paraid="1218408175" xml:lang="EN-US">Petal Runner Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p paraeid="{93e5c2b2-ec51-4239-8178-e02d180a23db}{14}" paraid="1497635334" xml:lang="EN-US">I think <em>Petal Runner</em> is going to be the perfect game to sit back, relax, and just play. It’s something to vibe to, to soak in, and just be content to be immersed in its charming world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-press-start-live-june-2025-everything-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid publisher Konami is back with a bang, and to prove it, it hosted a livestream showcase on June 12 called Konami Press Start Live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The half-hour-long livestream featured game updates and appearances from Konami developers and producers, introducing us to the "creative minds behind some of Konami's most iconic franchises," as well as giving us an extended look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater"><u>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-revealed-as-a-new-game-set-in-1960s-japan"><u>Silent Hill f</u></a>, and more. Here's what was revealed…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Metal Gear Solid 3 Delta: Snake Eater</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Our passionate team of developers take us on an extended look into the creation of METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER and its bonus content 🐍 ❗<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KonamiPressStart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#KonamiPressStart</a> <a href="https://t.co/aIhW4HIAVM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aIhW4HIAVM</a></p>— KONAMI UK (@KONAMIUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/KONAMIUK/status/1933149598270267708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Surprising no one, it’s Solid Snake who kicks off the show. Konami shared an extended teaser from its upcoming Metal Gear Solid 3 remaster, Metal Gear Solid 3 Delta: Snake Eater, and reminded us that the Snake vs. Monkey minigame is on the way for PS5 players, with a Bomberman variant for Xbox consoles. And the Secret Theater, of course, but I don’t suppose any of us have forgotten about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though boss fights should feel very familiar, we can expect AI and animation improvements for boss fights. There’s also the Sneaking DLC Pack, which includes costumes that are “unique in appearance,” with some boasting special effects. You’ll also find items, weapons and uniforms in-game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Fox Hunt mode. It is a completely original, online multiplayer mode. Though it shares a world with Metal Gear Solid 3 Delta: Snake Eater, the “gameplay is completely different.” It’s not just a reskinned Metal Gear Online mode, however; expect it to be “its own, new type of mode” based on the series’ trademark stealth and infiltration mechanics. Expect more details soon ahead of its release on August 28.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Darwin’s Paradox</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Deep breath now! 🏊 <br>Take a plunge and meet our friends at ZDT Studio - the developers for our upcoming action-platformer: Darwin's Paradox! 🐙 🛢️ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KonamiPressStart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#KonamiPressStart</a> <a href="https://t.co/CQzPD7AdMZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/CQzPD7AdMZ</a></p>— KONAMI UK (@KONAMIUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/KONAMIUK/status/1933150165440844172?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t suppose any of us were expecting to see Darwin again, an octopus who is “suddenly torn from his ocean by a mysterious beam of light.” The inaugural game from ZDT Studio, Darwin’s Paradox sees poor Darwin wake up in an industrial complex and then sets off with just one goal — to get back home to the ocean again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect to explore a “multitude of environments, moods, challenges, and gameplay mechanics,” and while he sure does look cute, Darwin isn’t coasting on his looks alone; his natural abilities are amplified to create more “interesting gameplay mechanics and humorous touches.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">eFootball </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Barcelona’s iconic trio, MSN —Lionel Messi, Neymar Jr, and Luis Suarez — introduce us to the next season of eFootball. They may not play on the pitch for Barcelona together anymore, but they’re clearly united in their enthusiasm for Konami’s soccer sim for couch and online co-op.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We saw the trio back in action in their Catalonian hayday circa 2015, the same year they beat Juventus in the Champions League Final. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">eFootball is free-to-play now on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, PC via Windows and Steam, as well as mobile devices. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">eBaseball MLB Pro Spirit</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Pro Spirit is a mobile baseball game where you can play with all 30 MLB teams, and their real-life line-ups. Realistic graphics “make it easy to feel like you’re on the field, any time, anywhere.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year Konami has partnered with some of the sport’s biggest, including LA Dodgers’ and National League MVP Shohei Ohtani. Some of the MLB’s current star players have “chosen their own favorite players, and you can play them all in the game,” too. New this year, Baltimore Orioles’ Adley Rutschman and San Diego Padres’ Jackson Merrill are joining the MLB Pro Spirit lineup. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Yi-Gi-Oh!</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Real recognises real 🤝<br>Basketball player Grant Williams shares his Yu-Gi-Oh! origin story to celebrate players’ journeys ahead of the World Championship 2025.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KonamiPressStart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#KonamiPressStart</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ot0LPIRHkg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Ot0LPIRHkg</a></p>— KONAMI UK (@KONAMIUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/KONAMIUK/status/1933151580448022646?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Grant Dean Williams, Charlotte Hornets forward and former Boston Celtics basketball player is a <em>huge </em>Yi-Gi-Oh! Fan, playing the games and watching the anime growing up. In an undisputed “game recognizes game” moment, Williams says he’s experienced a lot of challenges, whether that’s “trying to find a new tweak on a new Exodia deck, or trying to take down a trap-tricks deck.” He says it takes a lot of skill and courage to build the right deck and be a skilled duellist. That’s why he stopped by wish all participants in the Duellist Cups, Road to Worlds, and World Championships the very best of luck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The South American world cup qualifiers have already taken place, but Central American WCQ is set for July 4-6, Oceania July 5-6, and North America July 11-13. European participants can step up July 25-27.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yu-Gi-Oh!

Furthermore, the game — which includes both the first and second games in Konami’s storied RPG series — is now coming to Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Nintendo Switch 2, the resolution and frame rate have been tweaked to “match the performance of the console,” as well as better sound and visual, a double-speed battle function, as well as a shortcut button for auto-battles.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s more.

It's also coming to Steam.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gradius Origins</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember Gradius?

            <title><![CDATA[The Alters Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alters-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-alters-review.1216575/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alters-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey, do you have any regrets in your life? The Alters knows that you do, and that’s why its sci-fi story about morally and ethically questionable cloning on a wildly inhospitable alien planet hits home. It’s comparable to a playable Black Mirror episode (no, not <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/28/netflixs-black-mirror-bandersnatch-review"><u>that one</u></a>) that envisions technology run amok, where science has granted us the ability to talk to versions of ourselves who took the road we didn’t travel. It then asks: what if some of those people hate your guts? Also, what if this is all the product of a mad scientist and/or corporate exploitation? Combined with a simple but effective resource harvesting and base management balancing act, as well as the constant specter of approaching death by a scorching sun, it’s an effective pressure cooker of both personal and environmental hazards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Jan (pronounced Yon) wakes up to find he is the only survivor of a crash landing on an uninhabitable planet, The Alters immediately sets an isolating and eerie tone. This planet is remarkably otherworldly – barren and gray with jagged rock formations, but splashed with shimmering colors from oily-looking water and distortions created by this universe’s brand of Unobtainium, called Rapidium. Soon there’s a striking feature on the horizon: the expedition’s mobile base, which is a distinctive towering wheel that suspends its habitat in the middle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a palpable urgency as you scrape together enough resources to survive and get the base moving before the sun comes up and broils the surface. It’s not difficult to extract enough organic resources to feed Jan and fuel the base – you simply gather chunks from the surface, build mining machines, and then network them back to your base with powerline towers in a light version of resource games like Satisfactory – but you have to keep an eye on the clock to make sure you’re not overworking him or exposing him to too much nighttime radiation. The planet’s surface is also littered with radioactive anomalies that are initially all but invisible until you’re right on top of them, so navigating the maze-like map has a fair bit of tension to it even though there are no aliens actively trying to eat you. You do soon develop tools to make those anomalies easier to deal with by zapping their moving cores with what feels like a Ghostbusters proton pack, reducing them to rolling balls of resources. However, new and unexpected types are soon introduced that mess with your perception and make you approach them in different ways to keep you on your toes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>New and unexpected anomaly types are soon introduced that keep you on your toes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When you enter the base, The Alters shifts perspective from over-the-shoulder third-person to a diorama-like view, and you move around like a 2.5D sidescroller. It instantly gave me XCOM vibes, except you can actually run around as a character within it, moving between floors with elevators. Laying out the base with the new room types you unlock is a flexible puzzle that usually has very low stakes: there’s no build time when you place a new social room or refinery or store room, you can freely move almost anything around to make the best use of your limited space at no cost, and you can delete rooms for a full (or very generous) refund of resources at any time, provided you have the storage space to accommodate the materials. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s fun to mess around with (for a bit I was moving rooms I needed to access right next to me rather than walking to them) but it does get disorienting: running around wondering “now where did I put that communications room?” got old quickly. You can zoom out to see everything, but can’t move while in that ant farm perspective, so I ended up trying to minimize how much I shifted things around so that I could memorize what was where. It eventually becomes a little tricky as you expand the base and cram in more large rooms and storage, working around an immovable block in the middle, and it can be convoluted to reach an essential room when you need to. But being able to basically start from scratch whenever you want means it’s never too frustrating.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a little silly at times in that each version of Jan has different hair and a different way of speaking.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the first and most important rooms you’ll build is The Womb, which fuzzy communications with your ethically questionable corporate middle managers tell you to set up to kick off The Alters’ big experiment. Combined with Rapidium and a quantum computer that reaches into a map of Jan’s formative memories and simulates the life he would’ve had if he’d made different choices, it creates clones of him with different specialties and philosophical differences. All of them share an abusive father, but where they go from there is drastically different based on choices like if they left home, went to school, sold their house, met their wife, and other pivotal moments. It’s a little silly at times in that each version of Jan has different hair and a different way of speaking – the gruff, blue-collar Miner and the nerdy Scientist being the product of a few different life choices seems a bit far-fetched – but it’s a fun idea to think about and a great and novel way to explore these characters. Alex Jordan, the actor who plays all the Jans, is clearly having a good time finding ways to set them apart from one another – it reminds me of Tatiana Maslany playing clones in Orphan Black.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I eventually created six clones across the 30 hours it took me to complete the third act, which is not all of the possibilities – you’ll have to play through at least a couple of times to meet the rest, and I’m looking forward to another run where I know all the goals in advance and can optimize my approach to gathering resources and unlocking new technologies. This turns The Alters into a management game that reminds me of Fallout Shelter, where you’re assigning your team of specialists to tasks according to their strengths, but rarely have enough people to do everything you want to as efficiently as you’d like, so you’re forced to come up with the best solution you can. Some of them are essential for every playthrough – you need the Scientist to unlock any new technologies, for instance – but most, like the Doctor or the Guard (who I have yet to create) are optional and will make playthroughs at least a bit different with their unique production bonuses and personality. I do wish the menu for selecting a crewmember to work a job would list where they’re currently working, though. I frequently had to back up a step to make sure I wasn’t taking someone away from an essential role, then go back into the menu and reassign them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Managing your relationships with your Alters is partially about satisfying their basic needs with good food, enough rest, and some entertainment (such as gathering to watch a series of legitimately funny live-action sketch comedy videos and a simple skippable beer pong minigame), but it’s also a game of getting to know which Jans value compassionate responses and which will thrive with some tough love and bluntness. Some of them have self-destructive tendencies that need to be kept in check – they’ll work fewer hours if they’re unhappy, and can permanently die if they’re abused or left to their own devices. In the first act of the story it’s easy enough to keep the peace, but naturally that can’t last. As wrenches are thrown in the gears of your plan to escape this planet with a stockpile of invaluable Rapidium, you’re forced to make legitimately tough moral decisions that some of your Alters will strongly disagree with. There may well be a way to get through it optimally, but from what I’ve seen it’s very much a Kobayashi Maru: a test of how you deal with a no-win scenario.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Alters certainly cuts corners in how it tells its story – anything that isn’t a one-on-one conversation between Jan and an Alter is shown as a storyboard with voiceover rather than an animated cutscene, and the few characters who aren’t clones are obscured by static in the transmission from Earth so we only hear their voices. Some voice lines are recycled often, like when you present an Alter with a personal item you’ve found among the wreckage of the crashed ship to butter them up. But it does a lot with a little in that respect, and very effectively gets across the moral dilemmas, relationships, and mood. There’s even a musical performance where all the Jans collaborate on a song, and it’s only a little bit cheesy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every time you move the base to stay ahead of the sun you come to a new map, and each of them is a visually distinct alien landscape and a maze of interconnected pathways to explore in order to open the way forward. There are obstacles to clear and work around, which means unlocking new tools and spending your suit’s limited energy and resources to grapple up high cliffs or vaporize rocks in your path. It’s not difficult, but some of the puzzles you have to solve to gather essential resources for high-level research unlocks require you to uncover and follow a winding trail around the map that can be time-consuming enough to span multiple in-game days. The fast-travel system is a clever way to let you cover more ground and avoid too much backtracking by building out your tower network like breadcrumbs as you explore, and there are special pylon types you can place that are specifically for teleporting around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mechanic for uncovering deep resource veins to place a mining machine on is a chore, though. You’re required to create polygonal shapes by placing probes, which lets you look through the ground. It’s not hard, but it feels pointless and fiddly because you can just gather your probes and try again if you miss. (I suspect that at one point in development you had to spend resources to make them but that idea was scrapped and the cost was removed.) All it consumes is time, which is a precious resource, and it isn’t a very entertaining use of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other hostile environmental hazards that can mess you up, too: The Alters very quickly reminded me of developer 11Bit’s other recent game, Frostpunk 2, with its occasional magnetic storms that make venturing outside for resources all but impossible and force you to rely on your stockpiles while you race to repair escalating damage to the base. Things like that keep the pressure on and force you to consider taking measures like making your team work overtime hours, and prevent you from putting too much of management on autopilot even as you unlock more automated resource extraction tools. Multiple times, gathering enough resources to move the base came down to the wire – I had to be ready to go before the sun caught me, and I made it out by hours, not days.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The Alters is a highly atmospheric sci-fi character study of one man who meets the effects of the formative choices he’s made throughout his life face to face. Managing Jan’s relationships with his alternate selves while extracting enough resources from a hostile alien environment to survive is a balancing act on top of a balancing act, and it cleverly builds up the pressure over the course of its story. Exploration of these barren but eye-catching maps presents a series of puzzles and threats without resorting to blasting aliens, and the conversations and moral dilemmas that arise from Jan’s clones are a novel way to approach a game like this. It’s clearly not a big-budget game with resources to throw at cinematics and character models, but it does a lot with a little to tell its story effectively, and its occasional interface quirks don’t get in the way of that.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When I was first asked to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/spine/" data-ref-id="5000-537140">Spine</a> at Summer Game Fest 2025, I hadn't heard of it yet. I <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1731290/SPINE__This_is_Gun_Fu/" rel="nofollow">looked it up on Steam</a> and thought it looked pretty rad, so I booked an appointment, though I also expected it would kick my butt. Sometimes that's the job, and that's okay. I compared it to Sifu in my mind, which I always found to be really difficult. However, once I got to go hands-on with it, I found it's more like a Batman Arkham game in terms of its combat gameplay. Those familiar mechanics helped me look stylish and deadly in my demo, and put Spine on my radar ahead of its launch next year.</p><p dir="ltr">Spine comes from Nekki, a team that has previously developed mobile games, including the popular Shadow Fight series. Even Spine originally began as a mobile game, but as the project grew and took on a different shape, the team realized it had an opportunity to make its debut on PC and consoles. Inspired by the career works of John Woo and other stylish action movies, Spine is a "gun-fu" combat game in a cyberpunk setting with a simple story setup.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl_9oQgLVLM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nl_9oQgLVLM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In it, you play as Redline, a character whose physical look is so cool in my opinion that it got me to book the demo. The punky street artist's origin story is much like John Wick's, though instead of a dead dog, it's her kidnapped brother who compels her to get into ass-kicking mode. The 15-20 hour game is said to start small in terms of Redline's motivation and increase the stakes from there. What she expects is a personal quest to save her brother soon pulls her into a criminal underworld of AI overlords and corrupt people in power across the colorful but troubled city.</p><p dir="ltr">In my time with the game, I lit up bad guys in bars, hallways, and rooftops with roundhouse kicks, haymakers, and blasts of my dual-wielded pistols. The game wears its inspirations on its sleeve. This is a game from people who unabashedly love movies like The Matrix and Hard Boiled. Nekki isn't shying away from that, perhaps best displayed in its hallway fight scene reminiscent of Oldboy. It's leaning into it. But I was happy to see the game uses combat systems more like the Batman Arkham series, in which it's not too tough to chain together attack combos, execute well-timed counters to keep chains alive, and periodically switch to finishing moves performed by pressing a pair of face buttons.</p><p dir="ltr">Redline was fierce and swift, taking down groups of four or more enemies at a time with regularity. I could also use a trigger button to spray-paint enemies huddled around me, much like Batman's cap stun attack. The paint would stick to the enemies and the environment, giving it a nice visual touch in which you literally left your mark on a brawl. I could shoot whenever I wanted to, but it's not a shooter. The guns were best used as combo finishers, which you can see stylish examples of in the trailer above.</p><p dir="ltr">While the game won't necessarily be "easy," it's not meant to send you beating your head into a wall. With people's busy schedules in mind, a developer told me the studio wants players to be able to play for just a short while and feel like they've made progress. If you come home from work and only have a little time to play games, you should be able to load up Spine, crack a few skulls, and feel like you've accomplished something in your short timeframe. And for players who do want more of a challenge, the game will offer a mode in which you have to avoid taking any damage <em>at all</em>. Good luck with that.</p><p dir="ltr">I liked Sifu, but more on the merits of its art direction, story, and, sure, how good the combat looked when I could pull it off. But Spine made me feel just as powerful without the accompanying frustrations, and personally, I'm way more up for that kind of experience. Whereas some games of this sort leave me feeling like a nameless goon at times, Spine made me feel like one of Keanu Reeves' punchiest roles.</p><p dir="ltr">Spine comes to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>

            <p>
The Chinese Room's impressively choreographed oil rig horror <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a> is making a return, in a brand-new bit of story DLC that'll pick up the action almost a decade after the events of the main game. It's called Siren's Rest, and it's coming to all platforms on 18th June.
</p>
<p>
Still Wakes the Deep's original story transported players back to 1975 and the wonderfully realised Beira D oil rig, located somewhere off the coast of Scotland in the churning North Sea. Eventually, it became clear that unknown forces had dubious designs on the Beira D's crew, and thus began a very difficult day in the life of electrician Cameron McLeary.
</p>
<p>
If you haven't played the main game, you might want to stop reading here, as introducing Siren's Rest requires revealing the fate of Beira D and its crew. You see, Still Wakes the Deep's story DLC time jumps forward over a decade to 1986 when a specialist diving team journeys to the site of the oil rig, now far below the waves. Armed with a cutting torch, crowbar, and camera, this new team is attempting to piece together the final moments of the Beira D, but it just might transpire those unknowable forces aren't quite done playing just yet.

"The Beira D is now a groaning steel catacomb interred in the inky depths of the North Sea," The Chinese Room teases in its announcement. "What really happened that December day in 1975, when communications to the mainland were severed and the rig sank without a trace? What answers can be given to families who still grieve, ten years on?"
</p>
<p>
Siren's Rest, which will supposedly offer around 1.5-2 hours of playtime, has a new writer in Sagar Beroshi (they previously served as narrative designer on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>), and a brand-new cast to go with its brand-new crew. Lois Chimimba (Doctor Who, Shetland) stars as protagonist Mhairi alongside Lorn Macdonald (Bridgerton, The Lazarus Project) and David Menkin (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>), and Kate Saxon is once again on voice directing duties, which bodes well given the stellar performances in the main game.

I wasn't entirely sold on Still Wakes the Deep's design <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-review">when I reviewed it last year</a>, but there was no questioning its often astonishing artistry - and I'd be lying if I said the haunting fate of the Beira D's crew hadn't stuck with me. So I'm genuinely intrigued to see how Siren's Rest expands on what's come before with its new team and some 80s swagger.
</p>
<p>
Still Wakes the Deep's Siren's Rest DLC launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and Epic) next Wednesday, 18th June, and it'll cost £9.99/€12.99/$12.99 USD.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/metal-gear-online-wont-return-for-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/metal-gear-online-wont-return-for-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/konami">Konami</a> has confirmed that <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-online">Metal Gear Online</a> isn’t making a comeback following speculation from its recent Summer Games Fest teaser. Instead, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> will see the debut of a new multiplayer experience within the MGS universe: Fox Hunt.</p>
<p><iframe title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - Gameplay Trailer 【Xbox version】 | KONAMI" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VifvSU5wlY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is a completely original mode and one that has a clear focus on hiding and using camouflage, no doubt inspired by the popular “prop hunt” subgenre. According to Konami, they assessed whether to created another Metal Gear Online title but ultimately decided against it due to the changing landscape of modern multiplayer games.</p>
<p>That’s not all that was revealed during Konami Press Start. The publisher fully revealed its Snake vs. Monkey crossover mode which will be exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Steam versions of the game. Meanwhile, Xbox users can test their skill in a new original Snake vs. Bomberman mode. In additional, the Secret Theatre feature will return with players able to collect special clips and videos dropped by enemies in-game.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is Konami’s hotly anticipated remake of 2004’s stealth action prequel, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Originally developed by Kojima Productions, the game is being rebuilt from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 by one of Konami’s internal studios, in collaboration with Virtuos who recently launched The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. Like any good remake, Delta will retain the iconic story, characters, and level designs of Snake Eater while significantly enhancing visuals and introducing gameplay improvements and quality of life features to better accommodate modern audiences.</p>

<p>MGS3 isn’t a direct sequel to Metal Gear Solid: Sons of Liberty. Instead it dials the clock way back to the times of Cold War tensions between Russia and the United States with Naked Snake (Big Boss) dropping behind enemy lines with little more than a survival knife.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on August 28th, 2025.</p>
