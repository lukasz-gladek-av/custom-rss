<p>It’s a we, Mario!</p>



<p>March 10 has become Mario Day (Mar 10) for many gamers. This year, a New York City GameStop is to celebrate the day by attempting to break a record for the largest gathering of people dressed as Mario. The current record for the largest gathering of people dressed as Mario is 230 participants. This was set on August 18, 2010, in Chifeng City, Inner Mongolia, China.</p>



<p>It will be an entire Mario-themed event. There will be prizes and many photo ops. The best Mario cosplayer will receive a free <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. All who participate will also receive $5 in bonus store credit to use on any item in the store. You’re free to come dressed as Luigi, but you won’t get the store credit.</p>



<p>Qualifications for the costume are simple. All you need is a red shirt, blue overalls, a red hat, and a mustache.</p>







<h2 id="h-mario-is-still-celebrating-his-40th-anniversary">Mario Is Still Celebrating His 40th Anniversary</h2>



<p>Through April, with the release of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/" id="3170">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, Mario continues to celebrate his 40th anniversary. As part of the anniversary, Nintendo has released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mario-tennis-fever-2/" id="170927">Mario Tennis Fever</a>. There’s also an upcoming Yoshi game, Yoshi and the Mysterious Book. However, most are wondering when the next 3D Mario experience will be released.</p>



<p>It has been almost 9 years since Nintendo released<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/super-mario-odyssey/" id="165895"> Super Mario Odyssey</a> on the original Nintendo Switch. This is easily the longest timeframe between brand-new 3D Mario releases. Nintendo released a port of Super Mario 3D World on the Nintendo Switch, which included a secondary mode in Bowser’s Fury. However, they have not released a full 3D Mario game since 2017.</p>







<p>With the latest Mario movie celebrating the legacy of one of the best-reviewed 3D Mario games of all time, many are dying to get back to the Mushroom Kingdom in a brand new experience. For now, maybe you can go to New York City and dress up like Mario and hope of winning a free Nintendo Switch 2 so that you’ll be ready whenever that new game does come.</p>



<p>RSVP for the gathering <a href="https://partiful.com/e/BhTQ2ZaAdQaLoiqX0Fb2">here.</a></p>

<p>Would you participate in an event like this? When do you think the next Mario game will be announced?</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/raven-software/" id="1897">Raven Software </a>has revealed <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2026/02/call-of-duty-bo7-warzone-season-02-patch-notes">patch notes</a> for the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" id="147395">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> Season 2 update. The patch includes an update to Killstreaks in multiple modes and other bug fixes.</p>



<p>Regarding Killstreaks, several updates have been made. They have adjusted the spawn rates of Killstreaks in loot. Resurgence modes have received a 50% reduction from Supply boxes and a 25% reduction from ground loot. This adjustment also counts for Ranked Play. Battle Royale modes have received a 10% reduction in Killstreaks overall.</p>



<p>They’ve also made specific adjustments to Precision Airstrikes, Napalm Strikes, Cluster Strikes, and Bunker Busters. The radius for Killstreak call-ins has gone down to 150 meters. It was originally 255 meters. They’ve also adjusted the limit from three to two. Additionally, they’ve made a change to where only one type of Killstreak is allowed in any given radius.</p>



<p>“Individually, you can deploy one Killstreak of a specific type every 20 seconds. Your squad is limited to one active Killstreak of that type as well. Once used, this allows opponents a window to retaliate. We will continue monitoring Killstreak usage and performance across all modes and make adjustments as needed,” the notes state.</p>







<h2 id="h-additional-bug-fixes-in-the-latest-call-of-duty-warzone-patch">Additional Bug Fixes in the Latest Call of Duty: Warzone Patch</h2>



<p>Additional bug fixes include a fix to an issue that prevented players from properly progressing the “Absolute Zero” mastery camo challenge for the NX Ravager. Also, an issue that allowed players to fall through maps in certain areas has been fixed. </p>

<figure><figcaption>Starring role. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Poodle Cabooble Timed Research during Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos is focused on Furfrou, offering the chance to obtain trims that are not usually available in your region.</strong></p>



<p>While some Furfrou designs are available worldwide, others are locked to a specific region, like the Kabuki Trim in Japan and the Debutante Trim in the Americas.</p>



<p>The tasks are relatively simple, requiring 1km of exploration at each level and changing a Furfrou’s trim, with the rewards being XP boosts. All the details are in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Research Task</th><th data-align="center">Reward</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Explore 1km</td><td data-align="center">676 XP</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Change a Furfrou’s Trim</td><td data-align="center">25 XP</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Explore 1km</td><td data-align="center">676 XP</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Change a Furfrou’s Trim</td><td data-align="center">25 XP</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Explore 1km</td><td data-align="center">676 XP</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Change a Furfrou’s Trim</td><td data-align="center">25 XP</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Explore 1km</td><td data-align="center">676 XP</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Change a Furfrou’s Trim</td><td data-align="center">25 XP</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Explore 1km</td><td data-align="center">676 XP</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Change a Furfrou’s Trim</td><td data-align="center">25 XP</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Explore 1km</td><td data-align="center">676 XP</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Change a Furfrou’s Trim</td><td data-align="center">25 XP</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p><strong>The A Beautiful Day To Celebrate Timed Research Tasks during Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos are based around the three starter Pokémon</strong> <strong>from the region.</strong></p>



<p>At the beginning of the Timed Research, you are given the choice between Chespin, Fennekin, and Froakie. Over the course of the Timed Research, you can encounter the starter Pokémon that you selected a total of six times.</p>



<p>All of the tasks are the same, no matter which Pokémon you opt for, and they won’t take too much focus to complete, as long as you’re active daily.</p>



<p>The table below shows the tasks, each of which provides a reward of an encounter with the Kalos starter you opted for.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Catch a Pokémon</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Catch a Pokémon on 2 different days</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Catch a Pokémon on 3 different days</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Catch a Pokémon on 4 different days</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Catch a Pokémon on 5 different days</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Catch a Pokémon on 6 different days</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <guid>1449271</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO and Pokémon were my childhood (well, those and TMNT, but that’s for another time). I grew up building everything from simple cars and unrealistic houses to whatever amalgamation my creative mind could imagine. Never, as a kid, did I expect to see a fully licensed Pokémon set like the one we have now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I was a child, Pokémon was a game that, even now 30 years later, still has its claws in me with no sign of letting up. My younger siblings and I spent hours as kids, sitting with our Link Cables and GameBoys, trading Pokémon back and forth while we restarted one of our games enough times so we could each start with all three starter Pokémon. I knew I was hooked after spending an afternoon at my grandfather's house manually typing out my own Pokémon guide listing every Pokémon, their evolution levels, and what level they learned each move.</p><div id="234362"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234362" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pikachu and Poké Ball - LEGO Pokemon</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no Pokémon more iconic to the franchise than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-scarlet-violet/Pikachu">Pikachu</a>, and while this set's first images weren’t as impressive as I’d hoped, I've changed my mind after building it and seeing it up close. As I gaze at it sitting on my shelf surrounded by other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-plushies">Pokémon plushes</a>, statues, and numerous other Pokémon collectibles, I have to admit that it looks great! Is it perfect? No, but man, it’s a very welcome addition to my collection.</p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>With Pokémon celebrating its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/pokemon-presents-30th-anniversary-livestream-watch-party-post-show">30th anniversary</a>, it’s the perfect time to build this latest collaboration and go back to the series' roots, even though Pikachu wouldn’t be a selectable starter until Pokémon Yellow’s 1997/1998 release. LEGO provided IGN with a review set for a test build, and I was excited and fortunate enough to be the one to put it together. This 2,050-piece build took me around six hours to complete, which was long enough to revisit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/pokemon-the-first-movie">Pokémon: The First Movie</a> (that big final moment still brings tears to my eyes), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/detective-pikachu-the-movie">Detective Pikachu</a>, and a couple of other Pokémon movies that were available to stream. </p><p>In the earlier steps, I was confused as to why our favorite little yellow mouse had so many vibrant pinks, teals, and other non-Pikachu-specific colors while building. However, as I finished the steps and his torso began to take shape, I realized all the additional colors would be hidden in the final build, and were there to make piecing together the inside easier. </p></div><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Lego Pikachu Build Slideshow</h3></div></span></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It showed me how far LEGO has come in reducing complications and making larger builds faster to complete. I couldn’t help but smile after hitting major milestones in the build, and had the biggest one of them all when I settled Pikachu into his final resting position surrounded by the plastic lightning, making his action pose even more dynamic.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest drawback to this LEGO Pikachu set is the $199.99 price tag; it's not much larger (size-wise) than its more affordable counterpart, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-pokemon-eevee-set-72151">Eevee</a>, and it doesn’t feel as epic as the much more expensive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-pokemon-venusaur-charizard-and-blastoise-set-72153">Kanto starters set</a>. Pikachu’s set comes with 16 bags. The first nine build the electric mouse #25 (National Pokédex) himself, while the remaining seven build his Poke Ball and the base to attach him to. The instruction manual is the same as the other Pokémon sets and comes with a Pokédex entry for Pikachu, as well as a look back on his history with the franchise, which was fun to remind myself of how far he and this franchise have come. Steps are well organized throughout the building process, and while the first few steps may look nothing like Pikachu, they quickly take shape as you move into the middle steps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to the Eevee build, as you progress, you will assemble sections, leaving small pockets open to eventually attach its articulable arms, legs, ears, and tail. Pikachu’s build starts with the internal portions of his torso, neck, and head, then adds the external rounded pieces to give him his iconic look. His lightning bolt-shaped tail and base were the highlights of the build for me, and they look great in LEGO form, accentuating Pikachu’s design. These steps were the simplest parts of the build, but they were also the most satisfying for me. Pikachu also features a few fun, swappable parts that can easily be adjusted for a new look. Swapping a hinge inside the pokeball converts it from open to closed. Pikachu can stand on his own or attach to his slanted stand (my preference), and you can swap the endcap pieces on Pikachu’s tail, swapping between heart-shaped (female) and pointed (male). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not perfect, Pikachu’s feet are surprisingly pose-able to help with balancing him. Just take precautions during the build, because mine did take a tumble or two. His arms, however, are limited to vertical mobility and are prone to detaching if you try to adjust them too far outside that range. The good news is they are extremely easy to reattach should that occur, as it did to me a few times while rotating to attach new pieces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">His ears are also fantastic for articulation, as they can be rotated and angled freely, allowing you to quickly change his look. I only wish the set had a few more alternate pieces, like his mouth, to change his expression. There were only a few steps throughout the build process that gave me some trouble, and one of them was attaching the single round pieces to the center of another round piece. This made sense as one of the last words that comes to mind for me when I hear the word LEGO is round, which made these complications understandable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final portion of most steps is adorning Pikachu with pieces that help distinguish him from any other pile of yellow bricks. Thankfully, Pikachu’s eyes and mouth are printed on pieces, so no worries about ruining a set with a slightly misplaced sticker or anything of that nature. The eyes and mouth are both singular pieces to attach while his cheeks are a simple combination of pieces to give them their rounded appearance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After completing Pikachu himself, the last things to build are his Poké Ball and lightning bolt-shaped stand, which made up the last seven bags of pieces. Though that's 40% of the bags, it's also filled with lots of larger flat pieces and was the quickest part of the build. This was great because I built it in two sittings, making getting to the finish line easier and all the more enjoyable. </p><p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"><div data-cy="poll-content-block"><form action="#" data-cy="poll-content"><fieldset role="radiogroup" aria-labelledby="poll-question"><legend><span><h2 data-cy="poll-question" id="poll-question">What generation of Pokemon Starters should get a Lego set next? </h2></span></legend><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64792" id="answerId64792-label"><span>Gen 1 (Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64793" id="answerId64793-label"><span>Gen 2 (Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64794" id="answerId64794-label"><span>Gen 3 (Treecko, Torchic, Mudkip)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64795" id="answerId64795-label"><span>Gen 4 (Turtwig, Chimchar, Piplup)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64796" id="answerId64796-label"><span>Gen 5 ( Snivy, Tepig, Oshawott)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64797" id="answerId64797-label"><span>Gen 6 (Chespin, Fennekin, Froakie)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64798" id="answerId64798-label"><span>Gen 7 (Rowlett, Litten, Popplio)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64799" id="answerId64799-label"><span>Gen 8 ( Grookey, Scorbunny, Sobble)</span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64800" id="answerId64800-label"><span>Gen 9 (Sprigatito, Fuecoco, Quaxly) </span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div><div data-cy="poll-answer"><p><label for="answerId64801" id="answerId64801-label"><span>Gen 10 (Browt, Ponbon, Gecqua) </span><span data-cy="left-justified"><span></span></span></label></p></div></fieldset><span></span></form></div></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pikachu may not be my favorite Pokémon (Bulbasaur, you know, I had to include him in here at least once), but it was still an incredibly fun build and a wonderful addition to my collection. Each step after the first few clearly showcases what you're building, from the memorable stripes on its back to its lightning-bolt-shaped tail. For those who love Pikachu, I think this is an easy recommendation if you have the cash to spare. The pictures and marketing don’t really do this one justice; it's one of those sets that look much better in person. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jada Griffin is IGN's Community Lead.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Go fans have an action-packed weekend ahead with Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos, including an important decision on whether to opt for the X or Y path of Special Research.</p>



<p>The latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-go/" id="1345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a> Tour continues the passage through the generations of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> by focusing on the Kalos region, the sixth generation, landing in a period where the region has received a wealth of attention after Lumiose City’s return in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a-2/" id="3627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re unsure of whether to choose the X or Y path in Pokémon Go, Insider Gaming can help you to decide.</p>







<h2 id="h-should-you-choose-x-or-y-in-pokemon-go-tour-kalos">Should You Choose X or Y in Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Choices to make. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The decision on whether to choose the X or Y path during Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos ultimately comes down to which Legendary Pokémon you want to encounter.</strong></p>



<p>Completing all of the Special Research Tasks from the event provides an encounter with one of the two major Legendary Pokémon of the Kalos region, Xerneas or Yveltal. Both are extremely powerful and handy additions to your squad.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-tour-kalos-an-x-ceptional-yarn-special-research-tasks-rewards/" id="181117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All Pokémon Go An X-Ceptional Yarn Special Research Tasks &amp; Rewards</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If you have already caught one of the Pokémon, but not the other, the best choice is to opt for the one that is missing from your Pokédex. If you already have both, it might be worth checking the stats to see which is weaker and trying to get a stronger version.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-x-amp-y-version-reward-differences">All X &amp; Y Version Reward Differences</h2>



<p><strong>Encounters with Xerneas and Yveltal are the headline rewards for completing the Special Research Tasks during Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos, but they’re not the only reward that varies based on your choice.</strong></p>



<p>The rewards are extremely similar, with the main differences being the Pokémon encounters you will earn, including two different forms of Unown.</p>

</ul>



<p>Opting for the Y path provides slightly more Stardust and XP, but the difference is minimal. During the Research Tasks, one specific Stardust and XP reward is based on the Pokédex numbers, with Yveltal’s, 717, being one higher than Xerneas at 716.</p>



<p>The table below shows the rewards that are exclusive to the choice you make during Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos.</p>

    <article>
      <p>For the ten year anniversary of farming simulator <em>Stardew Valley</em>, developer Eric Barone <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-10-year-anniversary/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>revealed two new marriage candidates for the upcoming 1.7 update</u></a>. One of them is a fan favorite that people have wanted to date for years. The other is about as far from that as you can get.</p><p>Let me tell you about Clint: he sucks. He is the blacksmith in Pelican Town, he has a weird goatee, and he is extremely obsessed with another woman in town in a way that creeps me out. If you befriend him, you’ll soon realize that he doesn’t really think about women as people, and has no regard for the feelings of the woman he keeps pursuing. When you get his relationship meter up to three hearts, you’re able to tell him that he just needs to treat women the same as he treats men in his life. Maybe this is a little extreme, but the idea of voluntarily having a friendship with a person who needs to be told that makes me want to throw up.</p><p>The other new marriage candidate, Sandy, is a shopkeeper in the desert area of the game. She’s cute and has pink hair. As friend of Aftermath Nico Deyo put it on Bluesky, “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/applecider.bsky.social/post/3mfubbht5g22m?ref=aftermath.site"><u>here are the two new marriage options in <em>Stardew Valley</em>: Town Sweetheart and Dr. Pervert.</u></a>”</p><p>While it’s likely that Barone is about to reveal a storyline that redeems Clint’s character, he will have a long way to go. Personally I look forward to continuing to not date Clint as I pursue my new pink-haired wife.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/treyarch-games/" id="52220">Treyarch </a>has revealed patch notes for the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" id="2795">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> Season 2 update. The patch includes an update to the XM325 Titan Wield, along with changes to gameplay, UI, and more.</p>



<p>The weapon’s updates include adjustments to reduce some of its power. It’s said that the TTK should still be extremely competitive, but now with a heavier falloff that can be felt when missing shots at range. They say they went this route rather than hitting the spread “in order to maintain the viability of the ‘turret’ build that comes from combining this with the Prestige Attachment.”</p>



<p>Treyarch announced plans for another damage adjustment targeting scorestreaks to better balance this weapon with other anti-streak builds. The weapon’s maximum damage range has decreased from 23 to 13. The medium damage range has decreased from 18 to 11. Lastly, the minimum damage range has decreased to 10. It’s down from 16.</p>







<h2 id="h-additional-updates-in-the-latest-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-patch">Additional Updates in the Latest Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Patch</h2>



<p>Multiplayer features an update to Safeguard mode that slightly reduces speed and increases the robot’s health. An Overload mode issue has been addressed. The issue previously allowed weapons other than a pistol to be carried while the device was held.</p>



<p>There are also Ranked Play updates. Gameplay-wise, Treyarch has reduced the Trophy System’s charge rate to match normal multiplayer gameplay. Also, they have adjusted the “Forfeit” vote text to specify that the input must be held.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-winds-waves-region-explained/</link>
            <guid>1449226</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new adventure in the world of Pokémon is on the horizon following the reveal of Pokémon Winds and Waves, and questions are already being asked about the inspiration for the title and the region it is based on.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Winds and Waves will release exclusively on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2027, marking the tenth generation of the Pokémon franchise.</p>



<p>If you’ve got questions on the region and inspiration for Pokémon Winds and Waves, Insider Gaming has shared everything known so far.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-region-is-pokemon-winds-and-waves-based-on">What Region Is Pokémon Winds And Waves Based On?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Volcanic. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The region that Pokémon</strong> <strong>Winds and Waves is based on has not been officially announced, but it’s widely understood to be based on Indonesia and the surrounding islands</strong> <strong>of Southeast Asia.</strong></p>



<p>Winds and Waves looks set to be a sprawling adventure across multiple islands, lush jungles, and the depths of the ocean, with the trailer offering a hint of what fans can expect from the game.</p>



<p>Additional details on the Winds and Waves official website confirm this, stating that the titles “feature an open world to explore, with beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves that ebb and flow.” The description also states the region has a “lush environment” that has seen Pokémon “develop their own unique ecosystems.”</p>

</ul>



<p>That description also connects to Indonesia and Southeast Asia, which have a variety of animals and creatures that cannot be found anywhere else in the world.</p>



<p>Although Pokémon may never officially confirm the region as the inspiration for Winds and Waves, the real world has always served as inspiration for Pokémon games, including Scarlet and Violet being based on Spain, Sword and Shield based on England, and Sun and Moon based on Hawaii.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-other-inspiration-is-in-pokemon-gen-10">What Other Inspiration Is In Pokémon Gen 10?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>often appears to take inspiration from real-world creatures, mythicalogically beast, and elements of nature when developing games, which again seems to be present in Winds and Waves.</strong></p>



<p>Although the reveals so far have been limited, the starter Pokémon all have strong resemblances to familiar creatures.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-30th-anniversary-tcg-set-release/" id="181040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon 30th Anniversary TCG Set Release Period &amp; What To Expect</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Pombon, the Puppy Pokémon, has striking similarities to a Pomeranian, while Gecqua’s basis is clear with the category of the “Water Gecko Pokémon.” Finally, Browt is clearly based on a baby bird.</p>



<p>Given the names of the titles, the legendary Pokémon that headline Winds and Waves could well be tied to the sky and the sea. While there have already been Pokémon that fit those areas, Gen 10 could delve deeper into the world of Legendary Pokémon, tying the wind and the waves specifically to these new creatures.</p>

But he doesn’t want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [49,687 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> team would respect his wishes.”</p><p>The original&nbsp;<em>Demon’s Souls</em> was also developed by FromSoftware. Miyazaki, speaking to Edge magazine in 2022 (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/miyazaki-says-elden-rings-graphics-team-felt-extra-pressure-due-to-demons-souls-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VGC</a>), said that while he had not played the remake by Bluepoint Games, he was happy to see it renewed for a new generation—supporting Yoshida’s theory that <em>Bloodborne</em> may be a special case.</p><p>“As you say, I was not directly involved in it, and I haven’t actually played the <em>Demon’s</em> remake,” Miyazaki said at the time. “But this is because I just don’t enjoy playing the games that I’ve made in the past. It brings up a lot of old emotions, a lot of old memories, and this gets a little bit overwhelming, and it doesn’t feel like playing any more. So I have not played the <em>Demon’s</em> remake, but I am very glad to see it get this fresh look, these brand-new current-gen graphics.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“It was an old game, so to see it get remade in this way and have new players playing it was obviously something that made me very happy.</p><p>“It was a rough game back in the day, with a relatively rough development, so I was anxious that new players would not enjoy it in that same way. That was a cause of concern for me when it was re-released but, you know, in the end, I’m just happy to see the reaction and happy to see people enjoying it.</p><p>“One thing that was really fun was seeing [Bluepoint Games] come up with things we didn’t consider and to approach certain elements of the game its visuals and its mechanics in a way that we either couldn’t or didn’t back in the day. So to see them researching and applying these new thought processes and new techniques, this was something that was really exciting and interesting for me.”</p><p>Unrelated to Bluepoint Games, Brandon Sheffield, director at <em><a title="Games > Demonschool [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/demonschool">Demonschool</a></em> developer <a title="Companies > Necrosoft Games [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/necrosoft-games">Necrosoft Games</a>, said his studio also pitched a <em>Bloodborne</em>-related project to Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p><p>“I could find you 10 companies that have pitched a <em>Bloodborne</em> sequel, spinoff, or remake, including my own,” Sheffield said on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532/post/3mfumxivzgc2t" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>. “It’s just not going to happen unless [FromSoftware] decides they want to do it.”</p><p><strong>Bluepoint’s Closure</strong></p><p>The <em>Bloodborne</em> pitch is a small part in a larger report surrounding Bluepoint Games’ closure. According to Bloomberg, following its acquisition by Sony Interactive Entertainment, Bluepoint Games continued its work assisting <a title="Companies > Santa Monica Studio [191 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/santa-monica-studio">Santa Monica Studio</a> on <em><a title="Games > God of War Ragnarok [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a></em>.</p><p>After 2022, the studio began work on a live-service game set in the <em><a title="Games > God of War (2018) [176 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-2018">God of War</a></em> universe, in which the character Atreus falls into Hades. A loose idea was for players to control different versions or aspects of Atreus as they battled through Greek hell, and to include some form of <a title="Genres > Co-Op [379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative game</a>play and ongoing support, but much of the game’s design was still in flux.</p><p>Bluepoint Games struggled to develop a live-service game, being a small team mostly skilled in art and engineering rather than design. Some Bluepoint Games staff wanted to work on a traditional <a title="Genres > Action [3,445 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> rather than a live-service project.</p><p>After several years of struggling development, even with help from Santa Monica Studio, Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/01/sony-interactive-entertainment-cancels-live-service-games-from-bluepoint-games-and-bend-studio">canceled</a> the <em>God of War</em> live-service project in January 2025.</p><p>It was around then that, in searching for its next project, Bluepoint Games pitched a remake of <em>Bloodborne</em>. After that was turned down, it spent some time pitching an updated version of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, the <a title="Platforms > PS2 [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps2">PlayStation 2</a> game it had previously remade in 2018, but that was also turned down. It also pitched other studios under the Sony Interactive Entertainment umbrella about developing new projects in other franchises, such as a spin-off of <em><a title="Games > Ghost of Tsushima [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a></em>, but nothing was greenlit.</p><p>By February 2026, Bluepoint Games had gone more than a year without securing a new project. After Sony announced plans on February 12 to remake the original <em>God of War</em> trilogy without Bluepoint Games’ involvement, some employees at the studio grew uneasy. One week later, it was announced that the studio was shutting down.</p><p>According to people familiar with Sony Interactive Entertainment’s thinking, the company no longer believed Bluepoint Games was equipped to make its own game and was unable to find a partnership that made sense.</p><p>Recently, as Bluepoint Games’ former staff look for jobs—including opportunities to apply for positions at other studios within Sony Interactive Entertainment— other companies were making phone calls to see if there might be a way to salvage the studio, according to people familiar with the situation, as unlikely as the prospect may be.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/bloomberg-bluepoint-games-pitched-a-bloodborne-remake-but-was-turned-down]]></content:encoded>

<p>Well, Nintendo kindly sent one over to Nintendo Life Towers and we can confirm that it is indeed a Switch 2 Pro Controller — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">a pad we absolutely love</a> — now with some pleasantly subtle RE-detailing. What's not to like?</p>
<p>Back in the day, sure, we were <em>all about</em> the gorily OTT RE chainsaw controller for GameCube, but two decades on? We're a little more sophisticated than we used to be, perhaps. We don't <em>need</em> blood splatter over every prong of our pad, and this new one could sit on the side quite comfortably without alarming pets or family members.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at those little details, courtesy of our lovely video chap Alex, shall we? First, some close-ups, then a handful of moody shots that may well have been snapped in a Raccoon City warehouse! Or possibly Alex's garage:</p>


<p>Tasty, no? Itchy, right?...</p>
<p>If you're interested in seeing how it compares to the regular Pro Controller colour-wise (it <em>is</em> a little different), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hjhZXoQ8OhI">check out Alex's short below</a>, and our review of the non-Evil version.</p>
<p><em>Let us know below if you've picked up one of these pads.</em></p>

<p>Pokémon is set to venture into a new generation following the reveal of Gen 10, Pokémon Winds and Waves, and, naturally, questions are emerging on whether players with a Nintendo Switch 1 will be able to play.</p>



<p>Revealed as part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Day, celebrating the 30th anniversary of the franchise, Pokémon Winds and Waves is the landmark tenth generation of the beloved franchise, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/game-freak/" id="95185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Freak</a> once again handling development.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for details on whether Winds and Waves will be available on the original <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a>, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-pokemon-winds-amp-waves-be-available-on-nintendo-switch-1">Will Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves Be Available On Nintendo Switch 1?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New Gen. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Pokémon</strong> <strong>Winds and Waves will not be available on the original Nintendo Switch console, with confirmation already available that it won’t be on the old-gen console.</strong></p>



<p>This should not come as a surprise, as Pokémon Pokopia is also not available on the original Nintendo Switch, although it can be played online with a friend who has a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> via the GameShare feature.</p>

</ul>



<p>By the time Pokémon Winds and Waves releases in 2027, Nintendo will be several years deep into the next generation of console, and the original Switch will be slowly eased out of releases. </p>



<p>As the year progresses, you should expect to see more and more games not available on the original Switch, as Nintendo jumps into the next era.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-platforms-will-pokemon-winds-amp-waves-be-available-on">What Platforms Will Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves Be Available On?</h2>



<p><strong>The Pokémon</strong> <strong>Company has announced that Pokémon</strong> <strong>Winds and Waves will be a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, developed by Game Freak.</strong></p>



<p>Pokémon titles have largely always been exclusive to Nintendo platforms, with a few exceptions for mobile releases. As such, it’s not surprising to see Winds and Waves limited to Switch 2.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/free-pokemon-legends-z-a-update-reveals-mega-garchomp-z-at-pokemon-presents-2026/" id="180871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Finally Adds Mega Garchomp Z</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Further details on Pokémon Winds and Waves exclusivity status on Switch 2 are expected in the months ahead, with it expected that the system requirements of the game will be much more powerful than the original console could handle.</p>



<p>Pokémon had a shaky release with Scarlet and Violet, which did not perform well on the original Switch console at launch, and from what’s been shown from Winds and Waves so far, the performance demands are significantly higher.</p>

As Bloomberg shares, Bluepoint was working on a live-service God of War game, following its acquisition by Sony, and support work on God of War Ragnarok. The God of War game would have involved Atreus falling into Hades and different "versions" of him battling through it with some kind of cooperative element.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea didn't really coalesce and Bluepoint, famous for more traditional action games, was a poor fit for the project, so it was canceled in January 2025. The studio was encouraged to pitch other ideas, and the one that made the most sense was a remake of 2015's amazing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review">IGN 9.1/10</a>, Bloodborne.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/another-bloodborne-state-of-play-no-show-leaves-fans-questioning-if-ps5-port-will-ever-happen">Fans have begged for a Bloodborne remake or sequel for years</a>, with all sorts of rumors cropping up that one might be in the works at any given time. Popular belief has been that Sony, as the IP owner, is what stands in the way of FromSoftware actually making one. But according to Bloomberg, that may not be the case. According to those working at the studio, they were told that while Sony was interested in a Bloodborne remake, FromSoftware was not, and the idea was scrapped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne's status has long been in limbo, with various individuals with ties to the project sharing conflicting thoughts on what can be made of it. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">Back in 2024</a>, FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki said it was "not in my place" to talk about a Bloodborne remake because FromSoftware does not own the IP. He also told Eurogamer at the time that the game would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benefit from a release on modern hardware</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, the following year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory">PlayStation's Shuhei Yoshida offered a theory on KindaFunny</a> as to what was going on with Bloodborne that may match up with what happened to Bluepoint's pitch:</p><blockquote>Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing. And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.</blockquote><blockquote>I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The question of why no one seems to want to hit such an obvious home run, or let someone like Bluepoint hit it for them, remains. FromSoftware is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-is-making-a-new-vampire-game-for-nintendo-switch-2-but-its-not-bloodborne-2">currently hard at work on The Duskbloods</a>, a similarly vampire-themed game exclusive to Nintendo Switch 2. As for Bluepoint, it reportedly went on to pitch other ideas, such as an updated Shadow of the Colossus and a spin-off of Ghost of Tsushima, before it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-demons-souls-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-games">tragically shut down by Sony</a>, with leaders believing the studio was not equipped to make its own game and was unable to find a sensible partnership. Per Bloomberg, some companies are currently in talks to see if they can save the studio and take it off Sony's hands, but no word yet as to how successful that might be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>1449166</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">You may have clicked into this review thinking, “A review of Under Night In-Birth 2 Sys:Celes? In the year of our Lord 2026?!” And you know what, that’s fair. This fighting game came out at the beginning of 2024, and it’s one that builds off a foundation laid by the 2012 original, which we also never reviewed<em>.</em> Well, I’ve decided better late than never, because Under Night In-Birth 2 is quite simply one of the best 2D fighters on the market right now – especially for fighting game fans that pine for the days of fast-paced anime fighters but with all the modern conveniences we’ve come to expect. It’s full of gorgeous pixel art and completely outlandish character designs alongside things like exceptional netcode and the ability to take control of a character during a replay, making its satisfyingly steep learning curve a joy to try and overcome, and its online play a staple of my fighting game rotation well past its initial launch.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Favorite Fighting Games</h3></p><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/Mitchell-IGN/lists/mitchells-favorite-fighting-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">For those completely unfamiliar, Under Night In-Birth (or just UNI for short) is the first wholly original series from Japanese developer French Bread, which was previously known mostly for Melty Blood, a 2D fighter based on the world and characters of the visual novel Tsukihime. The UNI games are four-button fighters with light, medium, and heavy attack buttons, as well as the Exs Action button, which has a number of uses ranging from short hops, to defensive shields, to meter management, etc. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s really cool about this fighting system at a basic level is that while most fighting games have a linear sort of logic to their combo system, allowing you to chain lights into mediums into heavies, UNI kind of just says “screw it, do what you want, it’ll work.” You can chain heavies into lights and lights into heavies, or convert big combos off of little pokes. Anytime you land any sort of touch in UNI, you can get big damage off of it, which is a very liberating feeling.</p><p>You can get big damage off any touch, which is a very liberating feeling.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also makes jumping into the shallow end of a new character very intuitive, even though they’re all <em>so </em>different from each other. I wouldn’t dare take a brand new character into online play and try to get by  using simple combos alone, but if all you’re going to do is play through Arcade mode or mash some buttons against a similarly skilled friend, UNI’s flexible fighting system makes it very easy to do so on a casual level without relying solely on auto-combos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t let any of that fool you into thinking UNI is easy, though. The game speed is lightning fast, its zoning can feel utterly oppressive if you don't know how to deal with it, and the mixups certain characters can do will make you feel like you just got utterly blended. You really need to make use of its many different mechanics to be able to fight on an even playing field, and learning those is going to take some time – and for the more casual fighting game fan, it may even feel a bit like homework.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the heart of UNI is the GRD system, and there’s really nothing else quite like it in the expansive world of 2D fighters. Basically, imagine it as a tug-of-war-style minigame that runs parallel to the actual fighting, with the winner being granted a pretty massive advantage for a limited amount of time. At the bottom of the screen, you’ll see a meter comprised of six diamonds on either side. You fill your side of the meter by moving forward, landing attacks, blocking, using the riskier (but more rewarding) shield block, and by holding down the Exs Action button to sit still and charge it up like you’re a Dragon Ball Z character raising your power level. You can also lose meter by moving backwards, getting hit, or having your own attacks blocked by the opponent’s shield block. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this push and pull is happening, a timer will continue to circle around the middle of the meter, and once it’s up, the person with more of that meter filled wins the minigame and will enter the Vorpal State. While in the Vorpal State, you deal 10% more damage and gain the ability to use a technique called Chain Shift, which allows you to cancel the recovery of any move – much like a Roman Cancel in the Guilty Gear series – and also convert some of your diamonds from the GRD meter into your EXS meter, which governs your ability to use super moves and EX special moves. </p><p>GRD is unusual, it's complicated, but it's also kind of brilliant. <span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unusual, it’s complicated, but it’s also kind of brilliant. It encourages aggressive play while equally rewarding skillful defense; it’s largely negligible at lower levels of play, so newcomers don’t even have to worry about it, while more skilled fighters must split their focus between attacking the opponent in front of them and consider how their actions affect the GRD meter. It also further encourages careful meter and resource management, which is something every great modern fighting game benefits from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I love the way fighting games look these days; Arc System Works, in particular, does an incredible job of blending 3D characters in 2D environments and reaping the benefits of both dimensions. But  I’m also just a huge sucker for incredible 2D sprite art, and UNI’s characters rank up there among the best. Whether it’s the wild flowing hair and flailing limbs of Minerva, the lightning-fast speed and rapid slashes of Seth, or the hilariously gargantuan arms of Waldstein, the 24 characters (plus three more as paid DLC) of UNI2 absolutely brim with personality and flair. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/2026-02-27-10-00-44-3-1772215670346.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m a big fan of rushdown characters, so Linne was the first one I gravitated towards, and I was initially taken aback by just how “rushdown” she actually was. Her run speed is incredibly fast, allowing her to close the distance from full screen in basically the blink of an eye. Even without learning her big damage combos, it’s a ton of fun to look for that slight opening to get in and then utterly blitzing my opponent with a fairly basic strike/throw gameplan. I’m at the point now where I definitely need to dig a little deeper into her moveset and find better ways to open people up, and fortunately, the teaching tools that UNI2 provides are stellar as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a mission mode that gives you a basic overview of how to play each character, along with a wide variety of combos that cover just about every situation you could imagine sorted by difficulty. You’ve got quick, low-hitting combos you can use from point-blank range, overhead combos, combos that come out of your farthest reaching poke, anti-air combos, corner combos, and better versions of previous combos that build upon what you’ve already learned to squeeze out just a bit more damage. Once you get all the way down to the bottom, that’s where you’ll learn the big damage combos that incorporate Chain Shifts, super moves, and other high level techniques. It’s pretty much everything you need to build a full game plan with a character, all packed within the actual game itself, which should be the standard for any modern fighting game. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The unfortunate thing for anyone looking to learn about these characters by playing through their story mode, however, is that you’re going to feel buried under a mountain of jargon and names that won’t mean anything to you if you didn’t play the previous games in the series. The world and lore of Under Night is extensive, and there’s no effort made in this version to catch new players up on what “The Hollow Night” is, what the heck “EXS” is, or even what an “In-Birth” means. You are getting dropped into the supposed final chapter of a story, after all. Still, some sort of index or compendium would have gone a long way toward making these otherwise fairly dry arcade mode stories a bit easier to follow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In general, UNI2 is lacking in content outside of its central modes. If you’re not a serious fighting game player who wants to grind online play and make use of its fantastic teaching tools to get better, there’s not going to be a ton here to hold your interest. Fortunately, if you <em>are </em>one of those people, UNI2 does have a feature that many AAA fighting games still don’t: Replay Takeover. While watching a replay, you’re able to take control of one of the characters at any point. This allows you to repeat something that gave you trouble in a match and try to find a way to learn from it. Like, for example, an offensive sequence that you got hit with that seemed air tight when you were in the moment – when you run it back, you might be able to find a spot where you could use an invincible reversal attack, or maybe your shield to push the opponent back far enough that their next attack wouldn’t have landed. Just like in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-review">Street Fighter 6</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, and the scant few other fighting games that have this feature, it’s an absolute godsend when it comes to improving your matchup knowledge. </p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Under Night In-Birth 2 Sys:Celes is a 2D fighter for people who love 2D Fighters, myself included. It’s incredibly deep, has a rich and well-rounded roster with some of the coolest looking characters around, features excellent teaching tools to give you everything you need to improve, and even comes with replay takeover for the truly hardcore that intend to watch their matches back and learn from their mistakes. A lot of those excellent features (as well as its great rollback netcode) may go completely unnoticed for the more casual audience, and the lack of context in story mode will no doubt make newcomers feel lost without a flashlight when it comes to navigating it’s dense lore. But as far as the most important aspects of a 2D fighter go, Under Night In-Birth 2 ranks up there with the best of them.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/under-night-in-birth-2-sysceles-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is a new Bungie game upon us, and if its previously released Halo and Destiny games are any indication, it’d be quite silly to outright ignore it. I mention that because, unlike Halo and Destiny, understanding what Marathon is attempting to do in the shooter genre is tougher to parse (and easy to ignore as a result). It’s an extraction live-service shooter, a niche variant in a genre that a lot of people turn their noses up to by default. That’s all well and good (and understandable if you already know this isn’t for you), but if you’re interested in seeing what one of the industry’s best shooter-makers is doing in the extraction genre, which itself is on the rise thanks to games like Arc Raiders, I recommend checking out Marathon – for free! – via this weekend’s Server Slam.</p><p>Download the Marathon Server Slam Client and hop in. That’s what I did last night, and I’ll be honest, I really struggled to parse through its UI, menus, and in-game action, but the visual-audio experience of Marathon is worth checking out alone. It is a gorgeously mixed soundscape of alien sci-fi rumbles, instruments, and tech-based beeps and boops that sounds great in a headset. And visually, it’s one of the most distinct games I’ve played in some time. As for the gameplay itself, you drop into a map, collect as much valuable loot as possible, and exfil from the map to secure said loot and reap the rewards for doing so. Moment to moment, that means you’re going to be searching around cyberpunk-esque environments for things to scavenge while avoiding (or seeking out) enemy AI and other players for firefights that play out via Bungie’s best-in-class first-person shooting.</p><p>I’m not so sure that Marathon is shaping up to be Bungie’s next Halo or Destiny, but it is, at the very least, something unique, and I’m excited to see if this extraction shooter clicks into place as I play more over the weekend. If it doesn’t, well, at least the Server Slam is free.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinion/2026/02/27/the-video-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-february-27]]></content:encoded>
