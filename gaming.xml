		<p>Valve has released a new feature for Steam so people can discover games they may be interested in, as well as keeping an eye on games that they are already interested in. The new feature is the Personal Calendar, which displays games that have been recently released and is also populated with games that you may be interested in based on playtimes of similar users and the games they have been wishlisting. The feature is currently a Steam Labs experiment, so it will likely have changes made to it. You can check out your own <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/personalcalendar?snr=1_2108_9__2107">calendar at the link.</a></p>
<p>The Personal Calendar only has Monday to Friday showing due to games rarely being released on weekends, and it will cover a rolling eight week period so it is not overwhelming. You can further customise the calendar to filter out different tags and determine how many game recommendations it is showing, with the default set to 100. It is also already populated with games that you have wishlisted, so you can see when a game you are wanting to play is going to be released. The recommendations themselves will be updated daily, but Valve does not see the recommended games changing too often due to the parameters that have been set. This is because as well as using similar profiles to provide recommendations, Steam will also take into account the games you are and have been playing, using the most played ones to populate the calendar too.</p>


<p>When it comes to the feedback Valve is looking for, the company has said, <em>“Really, we’re interested to know whatever feedback you may have about this experiment. Do you find this format of recommendations to be useful? What do you think about this new set of recommendations and calendar view? Are there other things we should include on the calendar? Does it seem to be generating good recommendations for you?”</em></p>
<p>To give feedback you join the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamLabs/discussions/19/?snr=1_2108_9__2107">discussions for Experiment 16: Personal Calendar</a>.<wbr></p>

            <p>Maybe prepare to dig out your finest gaudy suit and mountains of, er, a certain substance. A PC re-release of Radical Entertainment's Scarface: The World Is Yours has suddenly popped up on the Epic Store and Steam. The Epic version is available already, having been "unintentionally pushed live" early due to backend issues, according to new publishers EC Digital Entertainment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Listings for the 2006 GTA-like were quickly spotted on both storefronts, with the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/scarface-the-world-is-yours-7c3e6f">Epic version</a> on sale for £23.79 / $29.99, while the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113570/Scarface_The_World_Is_Yours_2006/">Steam listing</a> says a release date's to be announced down the line. The company who look to be behind the resurrection, EC Digital Entertainment, have offered an explanation for this discrepancy in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4113570/view/542246264930041873?l=english">Steam announcement</a>.</p>
<p>"Due to a technical issue during backend configuration, the game was unintentionally pushed live on a different platform earlier than planned," the publishers wrote. "We want to clarify that our intended long-term release platform includes Steam, and we're now accelerating our efforts to finalize this version. As such, you may notice that the current Steam page includes placeholder content. This will be updated leading up to the official release."</p>
<p>"When the game officially launches on Steam, it will include an optional HD graphics upgrade, offered as a free DLC," EC Digital continued, adding a disclaimer that the graphical upgrade may be "subject to change". As for what it entails, they explained: "This enhanced mode uses AI-assisted techniques to improve certain visual elements while keeping the core experience intact. The use of AI is completely optional. Players can choose to play in original or enhanced visuals at any time."</p><p>Now, this is where things get a bit strange. My efforts to look into who are EC Digital Entertainment have borne very little fruit. <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/scarface-the-world-is-yours-pc-re-release-announced">Gematsu</a>'s report on the re-release cites them as a Hong Kong-based publisher, but following the link through to its info/category page on the site only sees you greeted with the Scarface story, a link to a <a href="https://www.ecdeasia.com/">website</a> that's pinging up an access block notification for me, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ecdeasia/featured">YouTube channel</a> with three subscribers which has a sole video uploaded in 2009.</p>
<p>It's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwGZe9uvAFk">20 second trailer</a> for seemingly defunct prehistoric RPG <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/stoneage-2">Stone Age 2</a>, with the description linking a website for it that doesn't appear to exist anymore. A quick Google search of their name hasn't immediately turned up any other info about the publishers and their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=EC%20Digital">Steam profile</a> doesn't list any other games they've published.</p>
<p>One user in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ocxf5r/comment/nkq6bwc/">Reddit thread</a> about the re-release has claimed that the new Epic version of Scarface: The World Is Yours comes with the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/669045-silentpatch/">SilentPatch</a> and <a href="https://fusionfix.io/wfp">Fusion Fix</a> mods pre-installed. Sadly, <a href="https://x.com/__silent_/status/1980894088913383823">according to</a> one of the modders behind the two, who goes by the handle Silent, if this is the case it's happened without permission. "None of us were contacted about this in advance (which isn't necessary as per the license, but would be nice)," they wrote. "I KNOW that the holder of the Scarface license wasn't willing to re-release the game, so this is suspect. I'm going to inquire for further information to the best of my abilities, but so far I doubt that release was cleared with Universal."</p>
<p>So yeah, that's why I was hesitant to encourage the digging out of Al Pacino outfits earlier. There's a chance EC Digital Entertainment have done a proper deal for the game's rights, but if this re-release is of the unapproved or dodgy variety, odds are a takedown could be incoming.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-roadmap-explained%E2%80%94all-future-arc-raiders-plans.1331167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New extraction shooter ARC Raiders is looking to ‘Embark’ on a long journey. Whether it has the legs remains to be seen, but we’ve extracted some new information about the shooter and the potential ARC Raiders roadmap of future content.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is one of the big, new multiplayer dogs in 2025. With Call of Duty unable to crack the DMZ nut, Escape From Tarkov has largely had the genre to itself. Say hello to Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders!</p>



<p>The extraction shooter has had multiple betas—including the late-on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-been-extended-playtest-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Slam playtest</a>—and it’s time to look forward instead of back.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-have-a-roadmap">Does ARC Raiders Have A Roadmap?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We expect to travel and go everywhere. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, ARC Raiders doesn’t officially have a roadmap yet, as Embark Studios is unwilling to commit to additional content plans for the time being.</strong></p>



<p>However, it doesn’t mean the developer isn’t thinking about the future, and this is evident with he shocking reveal that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-add-10-years-worth-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders devs are already planning 10 years worth of content</a>.</p>



<p>Embark Studios design lead Virgil Watkins said: “I think internally, for a very long time, we referred to this [ARC Raiders] as a 10-year game. That is the ambition we are aiming for and that dictates the type and quantity of content we want to put into it.”</p>



<p>We often see multiplayer games and single-player games with season passes announce future content before the current chunk of gameplay is out! <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Raiders</a> isn’t going down this path anytime soon, as these plans can “Spiral into promises that can go unfulfilled if things change.”</p>



<h2 id="h-what-new-content-is-coming-to-arc-raiders">What New Content Is Coming To ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>Virgil Watkins has stated that ARC Raiders is likely to add fresh maps, more quests, and additional common-sense content throughout the game’s lifespan.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the design lead’s words in full: “Of course, adding things over time like new maps, extending questlines, and introducing new enemies and new weapons, and things like that. We’ll have some stuff lined up post-launch and for a little bit after, but then it will be based on what we see out of the launch and thereafter.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It sounds like the typical content you’d come to expect from a post-game launch for an extraction shooter. We respect the fact that the team doesn’t want to put a timeframe on the new content and see how the launch plays out first.</p>



<p>Based on your time in any of the game’s playtests, what do you think ARC Raiders is lacking? It’s time to let us know via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> and the comments section below.</p>



<hr>



<p>We have much more ARC Raiders content, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-price-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its price and whether it’s free to play</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-early-access-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if there’s Launch Early Access</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-have-optional-progression-wipes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders has optional progression wipes</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> is a "good game" but it failed to match the Fallout and Elder Scrolls games because of its use of procedural generation and the fact "space is inherently boring".</p>
<p>That's according to former Starfield systems designer Bruce Nesmith, who discussed the game with <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/starfield-designer-says-sci-fi-rpg-still-a-great-game-but-procedural-generation-stopped-fallout-elder-scrolls/">FRVR</a>.</p>
<p>Starfield was Bethesda's first new series in over 25 years, following its work on Fallout and Elder Scrolls, but its critical and commercial reception was below expectations of the beloved studio.</p>

<p>"I think it's a good game," said Nesmith. "I don't think it's in the same calibre as the other two, you know, Fallout or Skyrim, or Elder Scrolls rather, but I think it's a good game. I worked on it, I'm proud of the work I did. I'm proud of the work that the people I knew did on it. I think they made a great game."</p>
<p>As such, Nesmith believes Starfield "would have been received differently" had it been released by a different company without the same expectations.</p>
<p>He "leans towards procedural generation" as the game's biggest problem, which was used to generate the various extraneous planets players can explore.</p>
<p>"I'm an enormous space fan, I'm an amateur astronomer, I'm up on all that stuff, a lot of the work I did on Starfield was on the astronomical data," said Nesmith, "but space is inherently boring. It's literally described as nothingness. So moving throughout that isn't where the excitement is, in my opinion.</p><p>"But when the planets start to feel very samey and you don't start to feel the excitement on the planets, that's to me where it falls apart," he continued. "I was also disappointed when, pretty much, the only serious enemy you fought were people… there's lots of cool alien creatures, but they're like the wolves in Skyrim. They're just there, they don't contribute, you don't have the variety of serious opponents that are story generators."</p>
<p>In the same podcast, as Eurogamer previously reported, Nesmith stated he's "eternally shocked" at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyrims-lead-designer-eternally-shocked-at-games-popularity-but-its-open-world-is-like-nothing-else">continued popularity of Skyrim</a>, on which he was lead designer.</p>
<p>"I think Skyrim did the open world in a way that nobody had ever done before and very few people have really tried to do since," he said. "And one of those things that we accepted, which a lot of developers struggle to accept, is that this means you're going to have quirkiness. You're going to have weird stuff happen. And if you say that's okay, you can get this diamond."</p>
<p>Last month Bethesda marked the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-marks-two-year-anniversary-with-a-secret-message">two year anniversary of Starfield with a secret message</a> on social media, with fans speculating about further DLC.</p>
<p>Bethesda has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-teases-starfield-space-travel-update-after-datamined-leak">teased a forthcoming update to add an overhauled "cruise mode"</a> to space travel, following a datamined leak.</p>
<p>What's still expected is a release of Starfield on PS5, which could give it a new lease of life.</p>

            <p>
Steam is getting a new eight-week calendar feature for both games you've wishlisted and recommended games based on your previous playtime. No longer will you have to source recommendations by reading tea leaves, or visualise your wishlist by labelling different-shaped food in your fridge. Now, you'll get a proper, personalised Monday-to-Friday chart that refreshes every day. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Why doesn't the calendar cover weekends? Because Valve think most developers don't release games at the weekend, and they want to avoid cluttering up the view with empty squares. Any calendar recommendations that do have the insolence to materialise on a Saturday or Sunday will appear in the following Monday box instead.
</p>
<p>
Valve have published <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/507342099205587495">a blog</a> for this latest "Steam Labs Experiment", explaining how the calendar's recommendations functionality works. "This new calendar finds people with similar playtime profiles to you, and then looks at the games those players have been adding to their wishlist," the platform holders write. 
</p>
<p>
They add that trying out a bunch of games, as when panning the demo deluge during Next Fests, won't affect your recommendations much, as the system is "more focused on games that you play the most (relative to other players), and spend most of your playtime in. So, a few minutes trying out a couple of new games or demos won't have much impact on your recommendations, but sinking a bunch of time into a new favorite will."
</p><p>
As for the daily calender refreshes, "in reality you aren't likely to see your recommendations change all that much from day to day, but as time goes by you will obviously see new things pop up as the 8-week horizon of the calendar marches forward, or as games lock in their release dates."
</p>
<p>
The calendar includes a round-up of already-released recommended games, covering the past week and the past month. These aren't organised by day or date, as Valve don't think you're bothered about specifics once a game has launched. There are also filters for adjusting the number of games displayed, hiding owned games, and selecting them by tag. As with Steam's upcoming feeds, the calendar also filters out games based on your wider content settings.
</p>
<p>
As ever, this kind of platform level adjustment could make a huge difference to the fortunes of any number of developers. Steam carries a vast quantity of games, and 'discoverability' is a perennial bugbear.</p>
<p>I've never been hugely impressed by Steam's recommendation systems, which seem far too cautious. "Mayhap if you liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> you will like [consults notes, sweating] <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-spider-man-remastered">Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered</a>?" I've also never really gotten along with calendars - paper ones have to be replaced, and digital ones have all this widgety bullshit in them. Still, the new all-in-one Steam calendars feel like an advance over filtering my wishlist.
</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> studio Pocketpair won't be publishing games with AI, Web3, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a> in them, because the company "doesn't believe in it".</p>
<p>After the success of Palworld, Pocketpair launched a publishing arm earlier this year. Communications director and publishing manager John Buckley spoke to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-don-t-believe-in-it-palworld-maker-pocketpair-wont-be-publishing-games-that-use-generative-ai">Game Developer</a> at Gamescom Asia about the use of controversial technology.</p>
<p>"People are going to say I'm lying, but these are just the hard facts," he said. "We don't believe in it. We're very upfront about it. If you're big on AI stuff or your game is Web3 or uses NFTs, there are lots of publishers out there [who'll talk to you], but we're not the right partner for that."</p>

<p>Pocketpair has been falsely accused of using AI in its games, particularly due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">perceived similarity between its Pal monsters and the pocket monsters of Pokémon</a>.</p>
<p>Buckley admitted it's hard to quash such rumours, despite the company's stance against the technology.</p>
<p>Recently, Pocketpair was accused on social media of using machine translation tools to localise Palworld for a handful of countries. Buckley said this was incorrect and based on an incomplete list of credits, but sometimes it's best to ignore social media noise.</p>
<p>"You know, I can't just come out and start fighting with these people [who make the AI accusations] because that just fuels what's going on," said Buckley.</p>
<p>"[Regarding the translation accusation], one of their biggest pieces of 'evidence' was that because we hadn't published the individual names of the translators it must be AI. Well, no, this is just poor Japanese culture in general. A lot of Japanese games, the credits will say localisation was handled by a company.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying [that it is] right. It's unfortunate. We don't like it as much as anybody else. But it's how a lot of these companies want to operate."</p>
<p>Following the accusations, Pocketpair acquired individual names from the localisation company used and updated the credits accordingly.</p>
<p>"A lot of the people in that thread said 'we appreciate you taking the time' but of course there are still some people in that thread who say 'it's not enough, it's AI'," said Buckley. "That's when I feel there's nothing more we can do here. I can say 'it's not, we made it' and they can say 'it is, you didn't make it' and what are we going to do? Just go back and forth forever."</p>
<p>AI is an ongoing hot topic in the industry - according to a report from Japan's Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association, organiser of the Tokyo Games Show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in development</a>.</p>
<p>Pocketpair published <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-newbon-and-ben-starr-lead-surgent-studios-new-live-action-psychological-horror-blurring-film-and-game-boundaries">Dead Take from Tales of Kenzer developer Surgent Studios</a>, which was released in the summer.</p>
<p>Now it's looking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pocketpair-to-fix-jank-in-hugely-successful-pokemon-alike-palworld-as-it-pushes-past-nintendos-controversial-lawsuit-towards-full-10-release-in-2026">fix "jank" in Palworld as it pushes towards a full 1.0 release</a> in 2026, in the wake of an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo</a>.</p>

		<p>Paper Cult has announced that following feedback from players that played the Tears of Metal Steam Next Fest demo, the decision has been made to push the game’s release back. The new release window that has been given is Q1 2026, allowing the development team to take on board the feedback and use the additional time to polish up later parts of Tears of Metal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tears of Metal - Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kdt4o55qMG0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post, Paper Cult Games said, <em>“First off, a massive thank you to everyone who played the demo, shared feedback, ideas, and reviews! Your support has been incredible, we’re honestly blown away. During Steam Next Fest, Tears of Metal climbed all the way to #16 in player count, earning a spot in Steam’s “50 Most-Played Demos of the October 2025 Event.” That’s huge for us and it’s all thanks to you!Even more heartwarming was earning the “Overwhelmingly Positive” review rating on the demo. It’s been an incredible boost to our morale, and we can’t wait to get the full game into your hands.</em></p>
<p><em>With all this momentum and plenty (or dare I say infinite) of new feedback in hand, we’ve decided to shift our release window to Q1 2026. We mostly want to take the extra time to polish the experience in the later part of the game. We promise, the wait will be worth it! Thanks again for marching with us. Your support truly gives us the final push to make Tears of Metal everything it deserves to be.”</em></p>

<p>Tears of Metal is a hack and slash co-op roguelike set in the Scottish Highlands. Hordes of enemies have invaded your home island, so it is up to you and your battalion of Scottish warriors to cleave through this vast number of soldiers to take back the island, and discover more about the Dragon Stone Meteor which caused the invasion to begin with. Tears of Metal has been confirmed for PC.</p>

		<p>Ahead of this weekend’s Galaxies Gaming Showcase, Fumi Games and PlaySide Studios have tempered expectations around the release date for Mouse: P.I For Hire, the 1930’s cartoon inspired first person shooter. A little while ago, the studio said that there would be a release date announcement for the game this weekend, but now that has changed with Mouse: P.I. For Hire now no longer releasing in 2025, but in early 2026 instead.</p>
<p><iframe title="MOUSE: P.I. For Hire - Troy Baker is Jack Pepper | Summer Game Fest Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2QhWXpfjBjQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement Fumi Games and PlaySide Studios said, <em>“Hey everyone. We know that you are excited for the release date announcement of Mouse: P.I. For Hire at the Galaxies Gaming Showcase this week 23 October. Ahead of the reveal, we wanted to let you know that we have made the decision to move the launch of Mouse: P.I. For Hire from 2025 to early 2026. The support you have shown over the years has meant the world to us. Our single highest priority is for the game to deliver you the best possible experience, and this will help ensure we can live up to that goal. Thanks for everything and we will see you at Galaxies!”</em></p>
<p>In Mouse: P.I. For Hire you play private investigator Jack Pepper, who is being voiced by Troy Baker, in a noir inspired first person shooter drawing on 1930’s animation. The setting is the city of Mouseburg and Jack is initially hired to help a “damsel in distress”. However, things take a turn as the case dives deep into the criminal and corrupt world that lays beneath the surface of the city. There will be numerous areas to explore including the city streets, the sewers, a casino, a film studio, and the docks. All of these locations will have loot and collectibles to gather, along with clues to help Jack solve the case.</p>

<p>Mouse: P.I. For Hire is due to be released for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox One.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Remedy <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=49a7f7db-a1c3-400f-948b-f25b3b7426f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that its CEO of nine years, Tero Virtala, will step down from the position, although he will continue to work for the Finnish developer while the studio finds a new leader. Co-founder and Chief Product Officer Markus Mäki has already assumed the temporary position of interim CEO. In a statement, Mäki (who acted as the Chairman of the Board until his new appointment and has now been replaced in that role by Henri Österlund) said:</p>



<p><em>I want to thank Tero Virtala for his substantial contribution to the management of Remedy since 2016. I personally thank Tero for good cooperation and wish him all the best for the future.</em></p>



<p>The brief press release does not mention why Virtala stepped down, but this is likely related to the financial disaster that was the launch of FBC: Firebreak. Remedy attempted to break into the cooperative multiplayer segment for the first time but failed spectacularly. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our review</a>, we had already noted that the game quickly became repetitive and just couldn't keep the players interested for an extended period of time.</p>



<p>In August, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-admits-disappointing-sales-fbc-firebreak-control-sold-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> that the game was underperforming compared to the studio's expectations. The developers tried to stage a comeback <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-first-big-update-september-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a big free update called Breakpoint</a>, but it wasn't nearly enough. Earlier this month, the Finnish developer had to issue a warning to investors about the lower long-term sales that are now expected from the game. Additionally, they recognized a non-cash impairment of €14.9 million, representing most of the game’s capitalized development costs and allocated purchased publishing and distribution rights. Consequently, they had to adjust the 2025 operating profit to be negative and below that of 2024.</p>



<p>Remedy will post the full Q3 2025 Business Review in exactly a week, on Wednesday, October 29. Hopefully, the studio won't have to resort to layoffs. Alan Wake 2, although critically acclaimed, also did not sell a lot of copies. The studio's next projects include Control 2 (which is being done <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a lower budget than Alan Wake 2</a>) and the Max Payne remakes for Rockstar. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, modder mstewart401 uploaded UnrealRTX, a remaster of the classic 1998 first-person shooter game powered by NVIDIA's RTX Remix platform, <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/unrealrtx/downloads/unrealrtx-full-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on ModDB</a>.</p>



<p>UnrealRTX allows players to experience the full single player campaign (no multiplayer, unfortunately) with fully ray-traced global illumination, dynamic shadows, volumetric lighting and stunning emissive effects that, according to the modder, bring a whole new atmosphere to every level.</p>



<p>The addition of PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials means that the surfaces now respond to light with realistic metallics, roughness, subsurface scattering and depth. Specific world geometry and props have also been replaced to enhance fidelity.</p>



<p>The modder revealed that most of the texture replacements were generated using RTX Remix's AI tools. They also used NVIDIA assets from NVIDIA Omniverse to replace the vegetation and add grass to outdoor areas. To do that, they extensively used UnrealED to insert dummy objects, which were later replaced with custom grass models. UnrealED was also used to place new light sources where the original maps had unmotivated lighting. As RTX Remix generally replaces assets globally, mstewart401 used UnrealED to create texture variants that enabled the implementation of emissive lights with different colours and properties to achieve the same in-game texture variation. The modder said that nearly all the emissive maps and around 90% of the height maps were crafted manually in MS Paint by blacking out non-emissive pixels and outlining textures.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The UnrealRTX modder admits the file size (currently at 48.29 GB) is a bit much. The goal is to reduce it by using lower resolution roughness and normal maps, as both are currently set to 8K each, which is probably overkill.</p>



<p>More and more PC classics are being remastered with RTX Remix. Just recently, we covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ndt-remakes-no-mercy-campaign-rtx-remix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NDT</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-look-path-traced-gta-4-rtx-remix-test-build/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA IV</a> (although the latter is still not available to the public).</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/scarface-world-is-yours-coming-to-steam-and-epic/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/legendary-gta-competitor-%E2%80%98scarface%E2%80%99-coming-to-steam-and-epic-with-hd-graphics-mode.1331128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent hours, eagle-eyed gamers have scoured repositories on Steam and Epic Games on PC to find out everything they can about a reappearance of 2006’s <strong>Scarface: The World is Yours</strong>. The open-world title emerged as a competitor to Grand Theft Auto on the PlayStation 2, but due to complex licensing issues, it was never revisited.</p>



<p>It now <span>appears to be being brought back to life by a new publisher,&nbsp;<strong>and&nbsp;</strong>it is being given a new face with an HD graphics mode added</span> as a DLC. In case you’re unfamiliar, The World is Yours puts players in the shoes of Tony Montana from the 1983 Scarface movie, presenting an alternate universe in which he survives an assassination attempt and must rebuild his drug empire.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-scarface-the-world-is-yours-coming-back">Is Scarface: The World is Yours Coming Back?</h2>



<p>Scarface: The World is Yours has always been one of those games that fans have desperately sought a remaster of. It was released in 2006 and offered a large open-world map of Miami, customization options, the ability to rebuild and decorate Tony Montana’s iconic mansion, and the gameplay loop facilitated the construction of an <strong>empire</strong>.</p>



<p>It was buggy as hell in many ways, and the PC port that was released way back when was a shambles, but on PlayStation 2, the game was a certified banger that still sits firmly in my mind twenty years later. It was originally pieced together by Radical Entertainment, the same studio that made The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run and the Prototype games.</p>



<p>Scarface: The World is Yours was a heavily licensed game that featured Al Pacino’s likeness as Tony Montana, dialogue, direct-to-game story elements, a top soundtrack, and branding. This long presented a licensing concern when the discussion came about remastering or re-releasing the game.</p>



<p>Now, Hong Kong-based publisher EC Digital Entertainment appears to be floating the game on digital platforms <strong>for the first time</strong>. The unheard-of publisher seems to be backing a re-release of Scarface: The World is Yours on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/scarface-the-world-is-yours-7c3e6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Store</a> and on Valve’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113570/Scarface_The_World_Is_Yours_2006/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> storefront, but no release date has been given.</p>



<p>It has been suggested by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ocxf5r/scarface_the_world_is_yours_store_page_shows_up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">some users on social media</a> that the Epic Games store, especially, has been ‘released early’ in what looks like some twisted backend glitch.</p>



<p>Scarface: The World is Yours is a game that all Grand Theft Auto fans should check out. It might have twenty years on it by now, but it’s a phenomenal title that was overshadowed by the earlier launch of GTA: San Andreas in late 2004 and the later launch of GTA: IV in 2008.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re hoping for a resurgence of Scarface: The World is Yours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Meghan Morgan Juinio says AI is a tool that’s “going to evolve whether you’re onboard with it or not.”</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no question that one of the biggest talking points during last week’s Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show came out of Dead Space creator Glen Schofield’s opening keynote address, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered">regarding his plans to “fix” the industry in part via the use of generative AI in games development</a>. In addition to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners">speaking with Schofield</a>, IGN managed to get some time with another industry veteran, Meghan Morgan Juinio, to ask for her thoughts on the controversial practice that has previously been met with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash">anger from Call of Duty fans</a>, but also major support from games industry executives like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">EA CEO Andrew Wilson</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think if we don’t embrace it, I think we’re selling ourselves short,” said Juinio, who recently vacated her role as director of product development at Santa Monica Studio after 10 years and two hugely successful God of War games. “AI is a tool, and something that will augment us. At least for right now, that’s how I see it. It’s going to evolve whether you’re onboard with it or not, so I want to be at the forefront of helping to guide how that goes and how we use it.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">God of War Games in Chronological Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Juinio went on to compare the use of generative AI to the procedurally-generated content that's been a part of games development for decades now, pointing to SpeedTree – a tool for generating trees in real time – which was used as early as 2002 for the foliage in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. She also recalled a time when animators were pushing back against motion capture and the use of procedural generation to blend animation frames rather than key them by hand. Both procedurally generated assets and animations have long become standard practices in games development, and Juinio seems just as confident that generative AI will also find its place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Personally, I’m super positive,” said Juinio. “Like [Glen Schofield said in his keynote address], this is the next big technological advancement that’s coming. In fact it’s here already, and I think as leaders in the video game industry it is on us to figure out not just <em>can </em>we do it with AI, but <em>should </em>we? And it’s a case-by-case type of decision making process and what's true for game X might not be true next year for game Y.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked if she thought the increasing adoption of generative AI might help mitigate the swelling costs of AAA-games development, Juinio was clear that the use of AI in games development is unlikely to be the be-all end-all solution to the post-pandemic pattern of regular studio closures and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blockbuster-games-bubble-has-burst">the bursting of the blockbuster game bubble</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I wouldn’t necessarily put it into an either/or kind of scenario in that way, because to me the size and scale and beauty of the game isn’t the main thing,” said Juinio. “At its heart, the game [needs] to be fun.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Persona 3 Reload is bringing back the original’s singer with a new update celebrating the Nintendo Switch 2 release.</p>



<p>Released in 2024, Persona 3 Reload served as the series’ first remake, bringing the 2006 original back to life for newer generations. With the changes, the original vocalist, Yumi Kawamura, did not return. Instead, the music was sung by Azumi Takahashi, as well as returning contributor Lotus Juice. Upon its release, it received tons of praise for its reinvention of the game and dedication to the original. An expansion, titled Project Aigis, came out later that year and acted as an epilogue to the game’s narrative. A port of Persona 3 Reload is launching on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/persona-3-reload-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on October 23rd and, as celebration, a nostalgic voice is making her return.</p>



<h2 id="h-yumi-kawamura-s-original-persona-3-songs-returning-for-persona-3-reload-in-upcoming-update">Yumi Kawamura’s Original Persona 3 Songs Returning for Persona 3 Reload in Upcoming Update</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>An iconic voice returns to Persona 3 Reload… 🎤🎶</p><p>Listen to eight dungeon and battle BGM tracks by the original Persona 3 vocalist – Yumi Kawamura – when the game launches on Nintendo Switch 2! </p><p>Patch will be available on all platforms. <a href="https://t.co/cZKpuVTWyP">pic.twitter.com/cZKpuVTWyP</a></p></div>— Official ATLUS West (@Atlus_West) <a href="https://twitter.com/Atlus_West/status/1980787484729430169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1980787484729430169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a>, Atlus West revealed that songs from the original Persona 3 and FES will be coming to Reload on October 23rd, when the Nintendo Switch 2 version is released. To celebrate the occasion, vocalist Yumi Kawamura, who performed the songs for the 2006 JRPG, spoke about the addition. In a statement below, she says</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It’s been a while!” Kawamura states. “I’m truly overjoyed and grateful to be reunited with everyone again. Persona 3 is a treasure to me as well—I can’t help but feel excited. Old friends, will you fight alongside me once more? New friends, how about letting my songs aid you in battle? Let’s celebrate together. Thank you for your continued support!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The songs being added to Persona 3 Reload from Persona 3 and FES are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>“Burn My Dread -Last Battle-“</li>



<li>“Mass Destruction”</li>



<li>“Deep Mentality”</li>



<li>“When The Moon’s&nbsp;Reaching Out Stars”</li>



<li>“Want to Be Close”</li>



<li>“Memories of You”</li>



<li>“Mass Destruction -P3fes Version-“</li>



<li>“Brand New Days”</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s important to note that the songs will only be available during exploration in Tartarus and in battles. The songs, as mentioned before, will come to Persona 3 Reload on October 23rd via a new patch. Luckily, all consoles, like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will get to listen to Yumi’s iconic tracks then, too. While Azumi’s versions of Persona 3’s songs were great, Yumi’s rasp and range can’t be beat. As a fan of the series, it’s good to see her renditions return and add some nostalgia to the amazing turn-based gameplay.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Yumi’s versions come to Persona 3 Reload? Who do you prefer, Yumi or Azumi? Did you play the remake? What did you think of it?

<p>This updates the game to Version 2.0.2 and includes a fix tied to Pauline's voice when collecting fossils in the two previous updates. It also makes "several other changes" to improve the gameplay experience. If we hear anything else about this update going on behind the scenes, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown via Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h2>Donkey Kong Bananza: Ver. 2.0.2 (Released October 21, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fixed the issue causing Pauline's voice not to play at times when acquiring a fossil in Ver. 2.0.0 and Ver. 2.0.1.</p>
<p>Several other changes have been made and issues addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</p>

<p>The next in-game event will allow you to nab two new figures for DK Island. Of course, to access this content, you will need to have purchased the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a> DLC. If you're still not sure about it, you can check out our review. Here's a quick sample, and below this is the video review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush feels like a split banana. The new roguelike mode is a lot of fun, gelling surprisingly well with the game's core mechanics and giving me a welcome excuse to swing back into my beloved Bananza, but the other half of the deal, DK Island, left me feeling a little short-changed with its lack of appeal outside of the new game mode."</p>

<p>Luigi’s Mansion is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 via Nintendo Switch Online just in time for Halloween.</p>



<p>As a benefit of Nintendo Switch Online, many nostalgic games from Nintendo’s past are available to play. From NES classics like Donkey Kong to Game Boy hits like Tetris, there’s a lot to enjoy for fans. With the newly released Nintendo Switch 2, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-upgrade-pack-details-revealed-for-nintendo-switch-online-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Expansion Pack</a> including GameCube, Nintendo 64, and Game Boy Advance titles was released. As the catalog grows, with recent additions including Forsaken 64 and Chibi-Robo, a spooky hit from the 2000s is coming just in time for Halloween.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-online-adding-luigi-s-mansion-releasing-october-30th">Nintendo Switch Online Adding Luigi’s Mansion, Releasing October 30th</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/GvN4hHpfVqQ?si=YMZmjm1kbZz5gIyG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new video</a> from Nintendo, the company announced that Luigi’s Mansion is headed to Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack. Furthermore, you won’t have to wait long to play it, as it releases on October 30th, 2025, the day before Halloween. The iconic 2001 title, released on the Nintendo GameCube, has since gone on to have a 3DS re-release and two other mainline entries.&nbsp;Luigi’s Mansion follows Mario’s brother, Luigi, as he navigates a ghost-infested mansion in search of his brother and friends. With a handy Poltergust 3000 and the kooky Prof. E. Gadd, you’ll take down the many ghosts and specters you’ll encounter.</p>



<p>The most recent title from the Luigi’s Mansion series was a re-release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-luigis-mansion-2-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a> for the Nintendo Switch in 2024. As for the last mainline entry, that was Luigi’s Mansion 3 in 2019, also for the Nintendo Switch. Its success as a Mario spinoff has made it a household name and one many hope makes a return with a new game. Perhaps the addition to Nintendo Switch Online could be a sign it’s in the works or if interest is there? In any case, Luigi’s Mansion’s addition is a scare we all can enjoy.</p>

<p>Horrifyingly good news for Luigi fans</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Switch 2's 'Nintendo Classics' GameCube library for Switch Online expands next week with the return of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>.</p>
<p>This spooky GameCube launch title will drop on <strong>30th October 2025</strong>, so just in time for Halloween. It made its debut in 2001 and puts Luigi in the spotlight as the main character. After winning a mansion filled with ghosts, he's now got to save the day with the help of Professor E. Gadd and his trusty Poltergust 3000.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer (which highlights how you can now play all three titles on the Switch 2) and here's the official PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luigi wins a stately mansion, but he’s in for a ghastly surprise when he creeps through its front door and learns that his magnificent manor is teeming with ghosts. And worse yet, Mario is nowhere to be found!</p>
<p>Enter <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em>, where a gallery of ghouls haunt the halls, secrets wait to be unearthed, and Luigi is … not the most courageous character around. Luckily, Professor E. Gadd is on the scene, and he has the perfect tools for the occasion! Play as Luigi, capture ghosts with the Poltergust 3000, track his items and whereabouts with the Game Boy<sup>™</sup> Horror device, and help save Mario from a frightening fate in this action-adventure game originally released for the Nintendo GameCube system in 2001.</p>
<p>With <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> joining Nintendo Classics, all three games in the series can now be played on Nintendo Switch 2, including <em>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</em> and <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em>. Take all three adventures for a spooky spin this Halloween!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This next update follows games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Mario Smash Football</a>. This is also one of ten titles originally announced alongside the Nintendo Classics GameCube library. Some other titles planned for the service include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pokemon_colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>.</p>

<p>Just keep in mind, to play Switch Online GameCube games, you need access to a Switch 2 and the Expansion Pack Tier. Japan will receive the same update next week. Apart from Luigi's Mansion, earlier this month, Nintendo also added three more games to the SNES library.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Splinter Cell Remake Loses Another Director]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-remake-no-director-job-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splinter-cell-remake-loses-another-director.1331020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new job listing from Ubisoft, the Splinter Cell remake has lost its director again.</p>



<p>Based on the Tom Clancy brand, Splinter Cell brings the stealth espionage action to gaming. With six mainline titles and a dozen novelizations, the series was a hit in the 2000s/2010s. Unfortunately, we last played as Sam Fisher back in 2013 with the cool yet controversial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-adds-steam-achievements-for-splinter-cell-blacklist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blacklist</a>. Having been over a decade since the last entry, a remake of the franchise’s first title was in order and announced in 2021. Sadly, all the news surrounding the project since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t been the best</a>, with no updates and the original director leaving. Now, it seems whoever came after them has quit the remake, according to a new Ubisoft job listing.</p>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-hiring-new-director-for-splinter-cell-remake">Ubisoft Hiring New Director for Splinter Cell Remake</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/splinter-cell-remake-lost-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, a job listing, which has since been taken down, was available on Ubisoft’s website. The position, Game Director, was for the Ubisoft Toronto office and would be for the Splinter Cell remake. The description for the job states that the person would be part of the Splinter Cell development team, leading workers and coming up with new features. </p>



<p>In 2022, the original director, David Grivel, left the project and Ubisoft after more than a decade at the company. Given we haven’t seen any gameplay or updates like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a>, things look a bit unsteady. Just recently, the series did get a small revival with Netflix’s Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, an animated series from John Wick creator Derek Kolstad. The show <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-season-two-renewed-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was renewed</a> for a second season shortly after premiering, so it seems the hype for a new entry is very much present. Hopefully, things will work out and we’ll finally put on those night-vision goggles again.</p>



<p>What do you make of the news of the director’s departure? Did you watch Splinter Cell: Deathwatch? What did you think? Do you want to see a new Splinter Cell game in the future?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is a new story, in that there is a new story <em>today </em>about it, but this is also a very <em>old </em>story, in that the same shit has been happening in video games for as long as there have been video games.</p><p>That story is crediting. Or, to be clear, the lack of proper crediting. The issue is back in the headlines today after staffers at Ridgeline Games, who worked on <em>Battlefield 6</em> in some cases for <em>years</em>,<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ridgeline-games-creative-director-disappointed-in-ea-s-uneven-staff-crediting-in-battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> found that they had either been shuffled to the very end of the game's credits (in a 'special thanks' section) or had been left off entirely</a>.</p><p>Like I said, this is not a new problem;<a href="https://kotaku.com/everyone-who-worked-on-a-game-should-be-in-the-credits-1847669211" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I wrote about it in 2021</a>, with the headline 'Everyone Who Worked On A Game Should Be In The Credits', followed by 'I am once again asking you to respect people's time and work', which pretty much sums up the whole deal. And yet here I am again, writing about it in 2025, saying the exact same thing.</p><p>A game's credits should be a comprehensive list of everyone who worked on the game. Everyone. It doesn't matter if they worked on it for five minutes or five years, if they contributed to the game, or to the businesses <em>making </em>the game, they need to be in there. The fact workers are continually left off credits, whether it be for petty political reasons, even pettier "well they didn't <em>really </em>work on it" reasons or even just administrative oversight, is inexcusable.</p><p>You can't say crediting everyone is "too hard" when you have <em>made a video game</em>, a task that is infinitely harder than writing down everyone who worked on it. You can't say anyone from an external provider being left off was a case of them not really developing the game when <em>they worked on the game</em>, doing something the core team either didn't have the time or experience to do. And leaving people off because they left the team before the game shipped, or in Ridgeline's case above were shut down before <em>Battlefield 6</em> was released, is the most teen drama shit imaginable.</p><p>And that’s just touching on the credits themselves, that form part of the shipped game, not the broader issues of how studios use crediting as a means of coercing people–whether that be to reward or punish workers–<a href="https://kotaku.com/how-game-companies-use-credits-to-reward-or-punish-de-1840905129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as detailed in Forest Lassman's 2020 story about the practice</a>.</p><p>It shouldn't matter if someone applied the final polish or were there at the "ideas on a napkin" stage, put them in the credits. To not do so, for whatever reason, makes you look like an asshole.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/criterion-mobile-closet-picks-peter-decker-interview-chicago-international-film-festival"><h3>Criterion’s Mobile Closet Wasn’t About The Van—It Was About IRL Friendships We Made Along The (Five-Hour) Way</h3></a><p>Criterion president Peter Becker reflects on how Closet Picks evolved from a spontaneous idea into a beloved ritual among cinephiles for its 40th anniversary roadshow celebration.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bluesky-resistance-bots"><h3>Why Are My Bluesky Bots So Into Irish</h3></a><p>If I have to have uncomfortable social interactions, they should at least be with real people</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/matt-leone-shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history-aftermath-hours"><h3>A History of Histories</h3></a><p>" I don't think there is always a canonical version of, like, the development story of a game."</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/video-game-credits-battlefield]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-laptop-40gb-ram-1tb-ssd-i7-down-74-on-amazon-and-its-not-refurbished-2000637810</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-laptop-40gb-ram-1tb-ssd-i7-down-74-on-amazon-and-it%E2%80%99s-not-refurbished.1330990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lenovo would never dare slash 74% off one of its premium laptops on its official website: That kind of discount would damage brand perception and upset customers who paid full price last month. But Amazon operates differently, quietly listing this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4919/">Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 with Intel Core i7-13620H, 40GB RAM, and 1TB SSD for $799, down from $2,999</a>. This <strong>isn’t refurbished or open-box merchandise</strong>, it’s brand new and it hits an all-time low that makes high-performance computing accessible to people who’ve been priced out of serious laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4919/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Intel Core i7-13620H is a significant leap in processing power with its <strong>10-core architecture split between six performance cores and four efficiency cores</strong>. The performance cores handle heavy tasks like video editing, 3D rendering and complex spreadsheets by running <strong>at speeds up to 4.9GHz</strong> when you need maximum power.</p>
<h2>Memory and Storage Designed for Hard Work</h2>
<p>The <strong>40GB DDR5 RAM configuration is where this laptop separates itself from budget machines</strong> that struggle with basic multitasking. DDR5 represents the latest memory standard with faster data transfer rates and improved power efficiency compared to DDR4. With 40GB available, you can run virtual machines for software testing, keep Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro open simultaneously, work with massive Excel files containing thousands of rows or maintain fifty browser tabs without the system grinding to a halt.</p>



<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides storage</strong> that’s fast enough to be thought of as instantaneous. Boot times are under seconds, programs launch instantly when you click on them, and large files transfer in a snap. PCIe NVMe technology reads and writes your files several times faster than older SATA SSDs so your laptop feels fast with every command you give it.</p>
<p><strong>15.3-inch WUXGA display with 1920×1200 resolution</strong> gives you extra vertical room compared to 1920×1080 standard displays. The extra 120 pixels of height makes it easier to handle docs, spreadsheets, or source code as you are able to see more content without having to scroll down. The IPS display shows you accurate colors with stable viewing angles that never diminish when tilting your monitor, while 300 nits of brightness ensures that you are always able to see the screen with clarity even under well-lit office space.</p>



<p>Connectivity is comprehensive with <strong>two USB-A ports for older devices, one USB-C jack that supports USB Power Delivery 3.0</strong> for chargin<strong>g purposes as well as DisplayPort 1.2 for external monitor support, HDMI 1.4 output for presentations and extra monitors,</strong> a headphone jack, and an SD card reader for fast transfer of photos from digital cameras.</p>
<p>At $799, this laptop beats mid-range offerings while offering specs that rival machines in the $2,000 to $2,500 range. Lenovo is not going to be trumpeting this discount publicly without jeopardizing brand position, but Amazon’s subtle listing makes it possible for anyone frustrated with paying top-of-the-line prices for high-performance computing to take advantage of it.</p>

Now, publisher Starbreeze has lined up Sidetrack Games to work on Payday 2 updates on PC and keep those players satisfied.</p><p>Sidetrack was previously known as the M.U.G.

According to <a href="https://www.paydaythegame.com/news/payday2/2025/10/next-chapter/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Starbreeze</a>, Sidetrack's first Payday 2 update will go live on October 23, with a focus "on the stability of the game and improving the overall player experience." Future updates are planned for "quality-of-life improvements and general game fixes."</p><p>Starbreeze will host a livestream on October 23 that lays out the details of the patch and invites the player community to "help shape future improvements." With Payday 2 now in the hands of Sidetrack going forward, Starbreeze will primarily be working on updates for Payday 3. Payday 2 still has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has tens of thousands of players</a> at any given time, according to SteamDB. However, Payday 3 has trouble <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cracking 1,000 concurrent players</a>.</p><p>Earlier this month, Starbreeze <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-studio-cancels-dd-game-focusing-on-payday-and-new-heisting-games/1100-6535161/" data-ref-id="1100-6535161">canceled its Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a> and laid off workers in a renewed push towards the Payday franchise and other heist games.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-25000mah-laptop-power-bank-with-triple-100w-usb-c-is-now-selling-for-pennies-on-amazon.1330963/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running out of battery during a long flight, a full day of meetings or a cross-country train ride turns your expensive laptop into a glorified paperweight. Power outlets at airports and coffee shops are either occupied or nonexistent and watching your battery percentage drop below 10% creates anxiety when you’re in the middle of important work. The Anker 25,000mAh laptop power bank solves this problem by <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/">carrying enough juice to fully charge a MacBook Pro multiple times, and it’s now available for $91, down from $134</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This power bank is unique in that it’s<strong> designed with laptops and high-power devices specifically in mind</strong> which is not usually possible with portable chargers. The <strong>25,000mAh capacity is equivalent to about 90 watt-hours of onboard energy storage</strong>, which means you can top off a standard 13-inch MacBook Air 1.5 times, a MacBook Pro 14-inch a single time fully or sustain an iPad Pro through several workdays’ worth of usage. <strong>With phones, you can expect six to eight complete charges</strong> on an iPhone 17 or Samsung Galaxy.</p>
<h2>Comparable Power Output as your Laptop Charger</h2>
<p><strong>Every one of its three USB-C ports can output up to 100W of power</strong>&nbsp;which is what most laptop chargers are capable of outputting. It makes a difference because lower-watt power banks may advertise that they can charge laptops but output power so slowly that your Battery still drains as you work. With 100W to output per port, you can fast-charge a MacBook Pro while charging a tablet and phone at top speed at the same time. <strong>Maximum output is 165W when both ports are engaged</strong>, outputting power smartly across devices that are connected.</p>



<p>The<strong> twin built-in cables</strong> eradicate portable charging’s most annoying aspect: remembering to pack the appropriate cables. One USB-C cable stretches up 2.3 feet, allowing you flexibility to keep the power bank in your bag while your laptop is on a tray table or desk top. This retractable cable is good for over 20,000 retractions so you are not working with a mechanism that fails after several months’ usage. The second USB-C cable is 0.98 feet long and serves as a carry strap as well.</p>
<p>Having four devices you can power at once changes your travel and remote-working adventures. The two onboard USB-C ports accommodate your laptop and your tablet, with <strong>another USB-C and another USB-A</strong> accommodating phones, wireless headphones, e-readers, portable gaming handhelds, or any other USB-powered devices you might want to power on your travels. In effect, you are carrying your own mobile charging depot that keeps your entire tech universe juiced up for the whole day.</p>



<p>The 100W ultra-fast recharging can therefore mean that the power bank itself is never a bottleneck. Insert it in a 100W charger and it’s up to 30% capacity in 22 minutes – quick enough to top up on a lunch break or flight layover. <strong>Recharge to 100% is 90 minutes</strong> with a suitable charger compared to lower-grade power banks which require five to six hours to fully recharge.</p>
<p>Anker made this power bank <strong>travel-friendly with airline rules in mind, holding it to 90Wh capacity, only slightly below 100Wh of capacity that most airlines place on carry-on batteries</strong>. It can be taken on planes without special permission which makes it truly practical for vacations as well as business travel.</p>
<p>At $91, this power bank costs less than many basic 10,000mAh models that can’t even charge a laptop properly. You’re getting triple the capacity, actual laptop-grade power output, built-in cables that eliminate the packing hassle, and the ability to charge multiple devices at full speed.</p>
