            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed that profits from&nbsp;tentpole releases&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>, which launched last year and earlier this year respectively,&nbsp;"did not meet [its] expectations".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/library/pdf/24q4outline.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial results outline released earlier today</a> (but pertaining to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-profits-down">presentation from May of this year</a>), Square Enix simply says that profits from both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rebirth&nbsp;</em>didn't meet expectations, but CEO Takashi Kiryu doesn't go into any further detail.</p>
<p>He does, however, say later in the outline that Square Enix plans to "establish a development footprint" aimed at "consistently and regularly releasing titles that beat our customers' expectations".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-combat.jpg?itok=1V0n8UmT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-combat.jpg?itok=u9nVpcTi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>didn't meet expectations, according to Square Enix.</figcaption></figure><p>This being a relatively public-facing presentation and outline, Square Enix doesn't state exactly what its expectations were for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rebirth</em>, so it's hard to say exactly by how much the two games missed the mark.</p>
<p>The company hasn't publicly disclosed sales for&nbsp;<em>Rebirth</em>, but back in September last year, Square Enix said that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-expectations-square-enix">were in line with its expectations</a>&nbsp;(a statement issued the month before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-ceos-reported-statement-on-final-fantasy-xvi-sales-is-widely-misinterpreted">having apparently been widely misinterpreted</a>).</p>
<p>We also know that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>shipments <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-shipments">topped three million</a> within the game's first week on sale, so whatever Square Enix's expectations were for the game, they must be pretty high.</p>
<p>It's worth noting, too, that Square Enix doesn't say the two games weren't profitable; not meeting expectations isn't the same as not making a profit, so it's entirely possible that while both games made money for Square Enix, they simply didn't make enough.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-profits-combat.jpg?itok=ZLwHWNGn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-profits-combat.jpg?itok=Ll1rTFOQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>'s sales were also disappointing, according to Square Enix.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>, either. In the presentation, Kiryu admits that&nbsp;<em>Foamstars</em>, Square Enix's entry into the&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em>-style family-friendly shooter market, didn't perform quite as well as expected, which is probably why <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/foamstars-free-to-play-october">the game is going free-to-play</a>.</p>
<p>To reiterate, this outline pertains to a presentation from a few months ago, but the document was made public today. As such, this doesn't necessarily reflect Square Enix's current standing;&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 16&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-requirements-demo">since launched on PC</a>, although<i>&nbsp;Rebirth&nbsp;</i>remains a PS5 exclusive, at least for now.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of impact this has on Square Enix's strategy when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-prototype-designs-seemingly-leak.984270/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-prototype-designs-seemingly-leak/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The prototype designs for the Nintendo Switch 2 have seemingly leaked online. First appearing on Chinese social media before making <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1fjp352/photos_of_switch_2_factory_prototypes_have_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">their way to Reddit</a>, the images give a look at what could be the upcoming Nintendo Switch successor.</p>



<p>Based on the leaked design, the Nintendo Switch 2 will have a larger screen, new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">magnetic Joy-Cons</a>, and multiple USB-C ports. It’s general look will remain similar to the original Switch. It will also carry over the back stand design from the Switch OLED model compared to the small kickstand look of the base Switch.</p>



<p>With the aforementioned Joy-Cons, the images show that the way the attach will be different than the original. It also seems to support the earlier rumors of addition buttons on the back of each controller.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-nintendo-switch-2-specs">What About Nintendo Switch 2 Specs?</h2>



<p>In addition to the general design, some specs of the Nintendo Switch 2 have also reportedly been leaked. The Switch 2 will featured 12GB of RAM, HDMI 2.1 support, and even 256GB of internal storage. The system supporting HDMI 2.1 seems to back up earlier claims that the console <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will support 4K resolution</a> in some capacity.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that Insider Gaming has not been able to independently verify the legitimacy of the Nintendo Switch 2 design images. Until we can, or something is made official, the leaked images and reported specs should still be taken with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>Nintendo has yet to respond to requests for comment on the design leak. It’s unlikely they will, however. They are expected to reveal the console sometime later this year with a 2025 launch. If you want to see the images of the leaked design, you can do so below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-16-and-7-rebirth-profits-did-not-meet-our-expectations<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">What next for Final Fantasy?</h2></div><section><p>Square Enix has finally made public its dissatisfaction with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>’s commercial performance, admitting neither game met profit expectations.</p><p>In a financial results briefing held May 13 but only released today, September 18, Takashi Kiryu, president and representative director of Square Enix said: "In the HD Games sub-segment, we released multiple new titles, including major titles such as Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, but profits unfortunately did not meet our expectations."</p><p>Kiryu went on to suggest Square Enix cannibalized sales of its Final Fantasy games released during the financial year ending March 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Final Fantasy XVI Echoes of the Fallen and The Rising Tide Game Awards 2023 Trailer Gallery</h3></div></output><p>“We recognize that issues remain in the Digital Entertainment segment,” Kiryu admitted. “The HD Games sub-segment failed to better its profitability, posting operating losses in every year of our previous medium-term plan. In addition to this, we did not manage our title portfolio across the company as well as we could have, which I believe resulted in opportunity losses due to cannibalization between our own titles."</p><p>Square Enix released Final Fantasy 16 in June 2023, then Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth just over half a year later in February 2024. Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth both launched as PlayStation 5 exclusives, and while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-responds-to-final-fantasy-16-sales-concern-points-to-ps5-install-base">Square Enix <em>has</em> announced a sales figure for Final Fantasy 16</a>, it has yet to do so for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the second game in the company’s trilogy of Final Fantasy 7 remakes.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-maker-square-enix-will-aggressively-pursue-a-multiplatform-strategy-after-profits-tumble">The company has already announced a significant rework of its business</a> as it fights for profitability. It has a new multi-platform plan that encompasses PC and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-to-double-down-on-xbox-releases-final-fantasy-14-producer-says">potentially Xbox</a> and the next Nintendo console (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-pc-global-release-times-confirmed">Final Fantasy 16 launched on PC this week</a>). But it has also canceled a number of games, and, Kiryu revealed, taken steps to better curate its pipeline of games.</p><p>“In the case of the HD Game sub-segment, sales of individual games will remain the key variable, but we believe that we will be able to exercise some degree of control over that volatility by carefully curating our pipeline over the next three years,” Kiryu said. “By also working steadily to improve our profitability, we intend to offset the weakness in SD games to achieve overall profitability.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We did not manage our title portfolio across the company as well as we could have.</p></div><p>Square Enix has now extended the timelines for a portion of its pipeline, “in part because of the massive amount of time required to develop HD games, and in part because we determined that we should rethink how best to deliver some of the titles we had under development to our customers,” Kiryu revealed.</p><p>Final Fantasy isn’t the only Square Enix series struggling. Its Splatoon-style game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/foamstars">Foamstars</a> also flopped and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-makes-playstation-splatoon-shooter-foamstars-free-to-play-8-months-after-launch">has since gone free-to-play</a>.</p><p>So, what’s next for Square Enix? Square Enix has <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv"><u>Kingdom Hearts 4</u></a>, the third game in the Final Fantasy remake trilogy, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate"><u>Dragon Quest 12</u></a> in the works. In January, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-producer-naoki-yoshida-says-it-may-be-time-for-the-younger-generation-to-handle-final-fantasy-17"><u>it might be time for a younger generation to lead the franchise and helm Final Fantasy 17</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>The Switch 2 is claimed to have 12GB of RAM--up from the 4GB inside the current Switch--HDMI 2.1 support, and an internal storage capacity of 256GB. As for the controllers, the leaked design shows off revised SL/SR buttons and a different layout for LEDs. Nintendo has said nothing at all about what to expect from its next system, apart from how it is aiming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-nintendo-has-nothing-to-announce-but-says-next-console-aims-to-surprise-and-delight/1100-6512297/" data-ref-id="1100-6512297">"surprise and delight"</a> fans when it is officially revealed.</p><p>There have been a <em>lot </em>of rumors regarding the final design of the Switch 2, and recently, it was reported that <a href="https://x.com/gibbogame/status/1831250317805314457?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2 could be announced by late September or early October</a>. Nintendo has yet to provide specifics, but several months ago, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa did confirm that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-revealed-by-april-2025/1100-6523222/" data-ref-id="1100-6523222">Switch 2 will be announced before the end of the company's current fiscal year</a> that concludes on March 31, 2025.</p><p>While Nintendo is keeping quiet, My Time at Evershine developer Pathea Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-switch-2-game-has-been-revealed-in-an-unusual-way/1100-6526521/" data-ref-id="1100-6526521">revealed that its game will launch</a> for "future Nintendo platforms yet to be announced."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-spinoff-project-t-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff Project T has officially been canceled by publisher Behaviour Interactive, and not only that, but the game's development studio has also been shut down.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Behaviour/status/1836103012575781262" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Behaviour says that following a playtest for&nbsp;<em>Project T&nbsp;</em>in July, the studio "ran a thorough internal risk assessment from a product and commercial perspective".</p>
<p>Behaviour goes on to say that while players "expressed appreciation" for&nbsp;<em>Project T&nbsp;</em>during the playtest, the outcome of the studio's "deep analysis" ultimately yielded "unsatisfactory overall results", leading to the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Project T</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/project-t-dead-by-daylight-spinoff-gameplay.jpg?itok=1DxIWXu8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/project-t-dead-by-daylight-spinoff-gameplay.jpg?itok=7HCzoQMQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project T&nbsp;</em>is officially dead...by daylight.</figcaption></figure><p>Behaviour doesn't go into any more detail regarding why the results of its playtest were "unsatisfactory", and since that kind of information is likely to stay within the studio, we'll probably only find out if a former developer speaks out at some point.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we're not likely to be seeing anything from the developers in their current state, because according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dansalexander_sadly-after-nearly-7-years-my-time-with-activity-7241896961732182017-D77M/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multiple</a> former Midwinter <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7241867580527804417/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developers</a> on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gregory-marques-39a711_my-studio-abruptly-closed-today-midwinter-activity-7241917376005349376-pHsG/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, the studio has been closed down along with&nbsp;<em>Project T</em>'s cancellation.</p>
<p>One employee describes Midwinter's closure as "abrupt", possibly indicating that staffers perhaps weren't warned about the studio shutting down in advance, which could in turn suggest that Behaviour made the decision fairly abruptly.</p>
<p>In any case, <i>Project T</i>, which was first fully unveiled just a few months ago as part of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s eighth anniversary, is no more, and neither is Midwinter, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/project-t-canceled-dead-by-daylight-spinoff-environment.jpg?itok=OmuOpM7l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/project-t-canceled-dead-by-daylight-spinoff-environment.jpg?itok=8R0eduX8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project T&nbsp;</em>had some pretty convincingly spooky vibes, but it is sadly no more.</figcaption></figure><p>The game wasn't the only&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff shown during that anniversary celebration; we also got to see some of&nbsp;<em>The Casting of Frank Stone</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-casting-of-frank-stone-release-date">has since been released</a>, as well as cutesy-looking multiplayer spinoff&nbsp;<em>What the Fog</em>.</p>
<p><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>itself also remains active, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-release-date">two&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>characters</a> recently joining its roster and a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover"><em>Five Nights at Freddy</em><em>'s&nbsp;</em>collaboration</a> waiting in the wings as well.</p>
<p><em>Project T</em>'s cancellation and Midwinter's closure come against the backdrop of a brutal couple of years for the gaming industry, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">multiple studios being hit by layoffs, cancellations, and closures this year</a>.

But if you’ve beaten the main campaign and are craving more, we have you covered. </p><p>We’ve put together this list of 10 games that offer similar gameplay and/or vibes to <em>Space Marine 2.</em> Maybe you’re looking for a game that features more big, tough soldiers who fight monsters. Perhaps you want another co-op game that lets your buddies work together to kill large groups of aliens. Or maybe you just want to know which <em>W40k </em>games to play after <em>Space Marine 2.</em> Well, this list should point you in the right direction for what to play next.<br></p><hr></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3e36f433035dd7eb6b903a8d66b1cce2" data-recommend-id="image://3e36f433035dd7eb6b903a8d66b1cce2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->THQ</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3e36f433035dd7eb6b903a8d66b1cce2" data-recommend-id="image://3e36f433035dd7eb6b903a8d66b1cce2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Let’s get the obvious one out of the way: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40-000-space-marine-the-kotaku-review-5839870&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40-000-space-marine-the-kotaku-review-5839870">Play the original <em>Space Marine</em></a></span>. Sure, it might not look as good as the new sequel and it lacks the large hordes of aliens, but it’s still a damn fine third-person shooter that plays similarly to <em>Space Marine 2</em>. Plus, if you did skip the OG and dived right into the sequel, you probably weren’t sure who that was in the big reveal at the end of <em>Space Marine 2. </em>The first game will provide some context and let you kill plenty of Orks, too.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1a8894f49b3a4d130687f728d938ab87" data-recommend-id="image://1a8894f49b3a4d130687f728d938ab87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1a8894f49b3a4d130687f728d938ab87" data-recommend-id="image://1a8894f49b3a4d130687f728d938ab87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The large, hulking soldiers from the <em>Gears of War</em> franchise are practically knock-off <em>40K</em> Space Marines.

<p>Spotted by reliable Rockstar news source Tez2, the developers “accidentally included” Red Dead Redemption PC’s metadata in the latest launcher update that introduced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-anti-cheat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-cheat for GTA 5</a>. However, Rockstar has promptly removed the data, and players can no longer spot files about RDR1 PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tez2 has linked the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2668510/info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> page for Red Dead Redemption’s PC port. In the update history section, players will see that developers provided three updates for the listing yesterday, and the changelog shows regular updates over the past few months. However, it hasn’t been confirmed as the official SteamDB page for Red Dead Redemption’s PC port.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1836018840150458526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videotechuk_</a> is another reliable source for Rockstar Games news, and they recently provided more details about the launcher update. Based on the X post, the update included data for several games, including Americas, GTA III Definitive Edition, GTA IV, GTA San Andreas Definitive Edition, GTA V, GTAV Gen 9, GTA Vice City Definitive Edition, LA Noire, LA Noire VR, Max Payne, Red Dead Redemption, and Red Dead Redemption 2. It’s worth noting that “Project Americas” is believed to be the internal codename for GTA 6.</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption is Rockstar’s first entry that takes us on an expansive journey across the Wild West. The game was first released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2010 and received a port for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch in 2023. However, this top-rated single-player adventure has yet to receive a port for the PC and the current-gen consoles, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.&nbsp;Players speculate that the latest find might lead to an official announcement from Rockstar. </p>



<p>In other news, Rockstar Games reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-song-band/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offered $7500 to use a band’s song</a> in GTA 6. Also, check <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-gta-6-been-delayed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether the highly anticipated Rockstar release has been delayed to 2026</a>.

                <p>It's not uncommon for video game projects to be delayed by unexpected issues. But GSC Game World, the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stalker-clear-sky-review/1900-6198116/" data-ref-id="1900-6198116">STALKER</a> and its upcoming sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-delayed-to-november/1100-6525281/" data-ref-id="1100-6525281">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>, had the terrifying and unique experience of being disrupted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Now, the first trailer for a new documentary, War Game: The Making of STALKER 2, chronicles the struggle that the team had to go through in order to finish the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWyO6X3hQsQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PWyO6X3hQsQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Andrew Stephan directed War Game, which takes viewers behind the scenes at GSC Game World as their lives were upended by the invasion. Creative director Maria Grygorovych and her team were previously based in Kiev before the start of the war. But GSC Game World ultimately had to move development from Kiev to Prague while the fight for their homeland continues to this day. War Game was sponsored and produced by Microsoft, and it will be released on Xbox's official YouTube channel.</p><p>"It wasn't my dream to do this film," Grygorovych told <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/stalker-2-ukraine-war-developers-doc-xbox-1236146958/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>. "But I really think it's important to share... We are really not public people and it's hard to share something personal. But when this opportunity comes to us from Microsoft, we thought that it's important to share with the world a little bit more about how difficult it is to live in a wartime from the personal side... When you see specific people who can share some real story, maybe someone can imagine how hard it is and why any war is something bad. It's impossible for me to find some reason to start a war."</p><p>Not all of the team members fled the country, and some stayed behind in Ukraine to fight. One of STALKER 2's developers, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/how-the-developers-of-stalker-2-weathered-the-ukraine-war-to-make-their-game-the-deanbeat/#:~:text=One%20Stalker%202%20developer%2C%20Volodymyr,its%20web%20site%20as%20well" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Volodymyr Yezhov</a>, gave his life while defending the city of Bakhmut from Russian forces in December 2022. Grygorovych noted that some of GSC Game World's programmers, QA members, and community managers enlisted with the Ukrainian army despite not being professional soldiers, and she hopes to welcome them back to the company when the war comes to an end.</p><p>War Game: The Making of STALKER 2 will premiere on YouTube on October 3. STALKER 2 will be released on Xbox Series X|S and PC on November 20.</p>

If they can find them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer spoke with Konstantin Kopka, the game’s designer, to talk about how ecosystems and stages helped shape the game’s unique animals, the challenges that would lead to them adopting an on-rails movement style over an open world, and why they gave the player a tool to fidget with as they waited for that perfect photo opportunity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Penko Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> sees players snapping pictures of eerie creatures in an abandoned wildlife park. Can you tell us a bit about what inspired you to create this experience?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kopka: Our main inspiration was, obviously, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on the N64 and our childhood memories of playing that. We tried many different approaches to figure out the best design and ended up with our take on what we thought was the "heart" of that experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We took many mechanics and tried to improve on them to make the levels and monsters as interesting as possible and focused a lot on replayability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Penko Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> straddles the line between cute and creepy. What drew you to capture these two feelings with the game's visual style?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The art for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Penko Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was done by my brilliant sister, Elenor Kopka, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/elenorkopka/">who also does animated short films and ceramics</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Weird, ghostly things were a common obsession for all three of us, but Elenor brought the cuteness with her art style.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into designing the game's various creatures and creating a whole ecosystem filled with strange beings to photograph?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like all creative ventures, this was a very iterative process. We started with a small roster of creatures to see how they would look in-game and kind of just went from there. Over time, through the collaboration of Elenor (art) and Philip Feller (animation), the park's inhabitants grew to over 100 distinct creatures.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As soon as we had the vision for the different levels locked in, we tried to think about how the creatures would fit into the park's ecosystem, why they would be there, what they would do, and how we could set the scene for them.</span></p><p>Image via Ghostbutter.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Likewise, what ideas went into the creature's behaviors and the faces they make? How did you create and design all of the little actions and things they do so they felt natural to this world and would give the player interesting things to take pictures of?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elenor and Philip did a brilliant job with that. I am really happy with the uniqueness of them all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We designed a system of symbols (e.g. a smiley face, a frowny face, etc.) to give us a general guideline on what poses we would build. In the end, most creatures ended up with a mix of "standard" poses and one or two poses that are completely unique to this particular creature.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A very important design guideline we discovered was that it was important to have that ideal "photo moment" in the pose to give the player something to aim at.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to have the action take place on-rails? How did that affect the design of the game in ways both good and bad?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For a long time, initially, we actually had the game set in an open world, and we were very enthusiastic about this because it seemed cool and new.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We ran into tons of issues with this, however. The world felt very empty and confusing. As soon as we scrapped this aspect and made it a focused, on-rails experience, things just clicked into place and became much more fun to play. It was not an easy decision, but I think the game ended up better because of it.</span></p><p>Image via Ghostbutter.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>As the game plays on rails, what thoughts go into creating a world and inhabitants that offer interesting photo opportunities when movement and perspective are limited?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The on-rails aspect meant that our level design process was almost like designing a ride in an amusement park where you can exactly control when and where things happen. This made it easier for us to create suspense, and even (very light) jump scares.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The decision to have the player (eventually) be able to stop the cart entirely posed some challenges because it restricted what we could and could not do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The game rates the player' photos of the creatures as they snap pictures. What drew you to add this rating system? What thoughts went into choosing how this system would grade the pictures?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of our biggest frustrations when playing and re-playing the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game was the tedious, slow rating process that happened after you finished the ride. So, from the start, we knew that this was something we wanted to improve and make way more fluid.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The rating algorithm is actually quite sophisticated. It even detects things like "how much of the creature is actually visible in the photo and how much is obscured by the environment, grass, etc."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lastly, by having a one to three-star rating system, we allow for 100% completion of the game, which is important to some players.</span></p><p>Image via Ghostbutter.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into the design of the photo album and giving the player a nice place to put their pictures while also offering some useful gameplay elements?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We wanted the photo album to feel very rewarding and fun to browse, so we made sure that the process of putting the best snapshots into their slots would feel satisfying.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The camera has the ability to show the player a different take on the world with the Ghost-o-Vision. What drew you to add this functionality? What interesting elements do you feel it added to the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Ghost-o-Vision mechanic is introduced a bit later in the game and adds the new challenge of limiting the time the player has to find the ghost. It's also related to the lore of the park and I think it adds a nice bit of diversity to the overall mechanics.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to allow the player to interact with the world using the Grappling Hand? What do you feel this element added to the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We thought it would just feel good to shoot stuff with a huge grappling hook/hand thing, so that was the main reason we added it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over time, we figured out more and more how this would actually be used in the game. For example, the ability to shoot and destroy parts of the environments was added very late in the development but quickly became a favorite. It's also a nice "fidget" mechanic that allows players to do something while idle, especially if they already replayed the level a lot.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>EA CEO Andrew Wilson has stated AI is "the very core of our business" and the company has over a hundred "active novel AI projects" to assist with game development.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the company held its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsvX8NMGUxI">Investor Day 2024</a>, detailing its next games and innovations: including the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">The Sims</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedis-final-chapter-currently-in-development-at-respawn-says-ea">Star Wars Jedi</a> and Battlefield.</p>
<p>Yet AI was a major part of the presentation. Speaking of generative AI, Wilson said: "This remarkable technology is not merely a buzzword for us, it's the very core of our business."</p>

<p>The company has over a hundred AI projects, said Wilson, across three strategic categories.</p>
<p>Efficiency is not just about cost saving but "doing what we do today faster, cheaper, and at a higher quality", he said. Expansion is about "giving our creative teams an exponentially bigger canvas upon which to create" by adding depth and intelligence to characters and personalising stories. Lastly, the company will accelerate innovation and the creation of content through Transformation.</p>
<p>"For years we have talked about our games delivering experiences that are always new and different," said Wilson. "We predict that with generative AI we will truly be able to fulfil this promise for billions of people for billions and billions of hours."</p>
<p>So how are these AI projects being put into practice? Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment and Technology, spoke at length about AI opportunities - after briefly running through forthcoming single-player games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and the Star Wars Jedi games, as well as the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>.</p>
<p>At present, EA's current game-development infrastructure handles a billion AI requests daily, Miele said, while the company's AI tools power in-game features for stable game experience, personal recommendations, and create a fair and secure gaming environment.</p>
<p>One specific example of AI use is in The Sims for its forthcoming hub that acts as a central platform for all series games. AI is powering discovery tools so that Sims players can search for suitable in-game assets using photos rather than text.</p>
<p>Through photo-based searching, players can find housing elements or even upload a photo of a real human to create their likeness. While powerful, there's also potential for this sort of function to be abused.</p>
<p>Another example is EA's new Script to Scene tool, which essentially allows game development to be done through text or voice prompts. This includes creating characters and scenes, as well as direct performances, all using generative art, AI-enabled game development, and procedural generation.</p>
<p>These are clear examples of how AI is already impacting game development. Indeed, as Eurogamer reported in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">AI is already used by 62 percent of studios</a>, according to a report by Unity. Character animation was the biggest use case.</p>
<p>And just yesterday, Eurogamer reported on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidia-boss-we-cant-do-graphics-anymore-without-ai">Nvidia boss Jensen Huang who discussed the advantages of AI</a> as a key component for advancing graphical capabilities.</p>
<p>Other areas of AI use are for NPCs, scriptwriting, and voice acting, which have all received criticism.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-will-feature-new-storytelling-tech-that-will-be-used-across-various-ea-studios/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In July 2023, following several rumors, Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be working on a Black Panther game in development by Cliffhanger Games, a Seattle-based studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-new-studio-led-by-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-veteran-kevin-stephens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> in 2021 by Kevin Stephens. At the time, EA said it would be a third-person single player action/adventure game featuring an original story.</p>
<p>After quite a bit of silence on the project (which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-game-reportedly-in-development-at-motive-will-launch-before-black-panther/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to launch after Motive's Iron Man game</a>), Laura Miele (president of EA Entertainment and Technology) revealed some interesting tidbits about the Black Panther game while she discussed the company's efforts in the $20 billion action/adventure and action/RPG segment of the market during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsvX8NMGUxI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA's Investor Day 2024</a>.</p>
<p><em>Next is our studio in Seattle, Cliffhanger Games, and its renowned leadership team known for innovative action RPGs such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Black Panther will be a love letter to fans combining vibrant characters, the world of Wakanda, an original story, and all-new technology, delivering groundbreaking design and storytelling that will actually transfer across many games and studios in our company.</em></p>
<p>The most interesting piece of info is the new tech hinted at by Miele. The new technology will deliver 'groundbreaking design and storytelling' not only in the Black Panther game but also in future EA games, as it will be used by other internal teams, too.</p>
<p>No further details were shared at this time (the game is still in early production), but it's hard not to connect the dots. Kevin Stephens, the founder of Cliffhanger Games, was originally a Director of Engineering at Monolith Productions before becoming its Vice President and Studio Head. As such, he certainly had extensive knowledge of the <a href="http://wccftech.com/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-video-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nemesis system</a> featured in Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War.</p>
<p>At the time, the Nemesis system was praised for creating unique moments between the player and the NPCs; while far from flawless, it hasn't been replicated in any other game to date. It's possible Cliffhanger is working on a similar concept, perhaps empowered by generative AI (which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-ceo-says-generative-ai-is-the-very-core-of-business-not-a-buzzword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being used extensively at EA</a>). We'll have to wait for actual Black Panther game details to know for sure, but it is certainly an intriguing prospect.</p>

            <p>As per EA’s recent <a href="https://eainvestorday2024.q4ir.com/home/default.aspx">generative AI tugathon</a>, the third game in Respawn’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> adventure Star Wars trilogy has been confirmed again to be in development. According to EA, it’ll be the “final chapter" in the now-trilogy, following 2019’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Jedi Fallen Order</a> and 2023’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Jedi Survivor</a>.</p>
<p>The existence of the game was first confirmed by Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan, during an Ocala Comic Con panel. “We’re working on a third and we’re in the process of doing that right now,” said Monaghan, which is about as straightforward an affirmative as one could want. It was also double-confirmed this February, following news of layoffs at EA, via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedis-final-chapter-currently-in-development-at-respawn-says-ea">Eurogamer</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, EA’s s president of entertainment and technology, Laura Miele, had this to say during a presentation at the company’s investor day:</p>
<p>“Over 40 million Star Wars fans have connected with Cal Kestis and his arc of becoming a powerful Jedi. Respawn is working hard to bring the final chapter of this thrilling story to players."</p>
<p>The same series of presentations also saw EA CEO Andrew Wilson say that generative AI was at the “very core of our business”, and EA showcase some sort of <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1836190095910523025">horrific creativity-begone machine</a>.</p>
<p>Respawn’s previous two offerings were both well received, although Jedi Survivor has been plagued with performance issues on PC - although a recent patch looks to have helped.</p>
<p>Last September, series director Stig Asmussen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-jedi-survivors-director-is-leaving-ea">left EA after a decade at Respawn</a> - despite making <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-director-wants-to-make-cals-saga-a-trilogy">comments to IGN</a> earlier in the year that he has “always” seen the Jedi games as a trilogy.</p>
<p>“An undeniably fun Star Wars sequel with a suitably epic story and smart combat, but a hell of a lot of busywork alongside it,” was Alice Bell’s (RPS in peace) verdict in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review">Jedi Survivor review</a>. My own verdict is that I lasted an hour before having to change the spoken language from English because I disliked the main character so much. I also decided I didn’t want to play anymore at all an hour later, though, so don’t listen to me. Very good lightsaber hitting, though!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </p></div><div><p>The Entertainment Software Rating Board has <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40023/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rated</a> the unannounced <em><a title="Games > Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,945 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,240 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>. <span id="more-915199"></span></p><p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> first launched for <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,196 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a> on February 28, 2017, followed by PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> on August 7, 2020.</p><p>Here is the full description provided by the Entertainment Software Rating Board:</p><blockquote><p>This is an action / role-playing game in which players assume the role of a hunter (Aloy) surviving through a post-apocalyptic world. Players guide Aloy as she learns to hunt robotic creatures and animals in the wild. Aloy uses arrows, spears, and explosive traps to injure and kill machines, boar, and occasional human enemies. Animals and humans emit small puffs of red blood when struck; one sequence depicts an abandoned camp with large blood stains on rocks and trees. The game contains a brief reference to sexual material (e.g., “Eighteen months hard labor in exchange for thirty years lounging around Elysium watching porn?”). In text / audio files, characters sometimes reference fictional drugs, overdoses, and getting high: “…not even out of junior high and already a drug addict”; “…I ran across a pusher who was selling Razorwing for eight bucks a tab”; “I’d spend a few days getting high, then OD on Overcast.” The word “sh*t” appears in the text / dialogue.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

First released for the PS4 in 2017, Horizon Zero Dawn was later ported to PC in 2020 and received a sequel--Horizon Forbidden West--in 2023. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-ps5-remake-remaster-and-multiplayer-spin-off-reportedly-in-development/1100-6507954/" data-ref-id="1100-6507954">Rumors of a remaster first popped up in 2022</a>, as a report claimed that accessibility features, graphical modes, and quality-of-life improvements to the gameplay itself would bring the game up to the same standard as its sequel.</p><p><a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40023/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The listing</a>, which is still live at the time of writing, details the basic plot of the game, as well as small references to sexual material, fictional drugs, and at least one instance of salty language. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-horizon-forbidden-west-release-date-now-february-18-2022-zero-dawn-60fps-patch-out-now/1100-6495581/" data-ref-id="1100-6495581">Horizon Zero Dawn did receive a PS5 update in 2021</a> that added a 60fps performance and a 4K resolution, and this reveal comes shortly after Sony officially confirmed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorder-guide-price-release-date-amazon-best-buy-walmart/1100-6526406/" data-ref-id="1100-6526406">November launch date</a> for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">PS5 Pro console</a>.</p>

      </div>
<p>The recent first look at the PS5 Pro also showcased Horizon Forbidden West running on it, so another update for Horizon Zero Dawn wouldn't be an unusual move for Sony. On top of that, fans of Aloy and the post-robot-apocalypse can also look forward to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-release-trailer-story/1100-6526137/" data-ref-id="1100-6526137">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> later this year, as that game puts a more lighthearted spin on the series.</p><p>It's also rumored that Guerrilla is working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-horizon-online-co-op-game-confirmed-in-job-listing/1100-6510122/" data-ref-id="1100-6510122">Horizon multiplayer game</a>, so things are looking quite busy right now for the franchise.</p>

		<p>Achilles: Legends Untold is getting free DLC content today in the shape of Fates of Moira, a collection new gameplay modes that are available to play once the main story campaign is completed. The name is reference to the character Moira, who becomes a central part of this mode, and it also deals with the fates with different challenges awaiting Achilles.</p>
<p><iframe title="Achilles Legends Untold: Fates of Moriai - Update 1.5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q2ytN7qanH0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The three modes that Achilles: Legends Untold Fates of Moira brings are:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Inevitable Fate of Atropos: Precision and caution are your greatest allies. Every melee hit you land instantly kills any non-boss enemy, but the stakes are equally high for you—one hit and Achilles falls.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Fate of Clotho the Spinner: Achilles constantly loses HP, pushing you to play aggressively to stay alive. Using Hades Vision pauses the life drain, and you can heal by killing enemies with Drain Souls. However, you can’t attack or use weapon skills in Hades Vision, adding tension and strategy to every move.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Fate of Lachesis The Allotter: A relentless Laistrygon hunts you on every map, immune to conventional damage but can be slowed or debuffed. It grows stronger over time, forcing you to survive through strategy and cunning. The Ariadne’s Thread can temporarily remove the threat, but be prepared—it will return stronger than before.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the announcement of the free DLC, Dark Point Games has also confirmed that Achilles: Legends Untold is available from today on PS4 and Xbox One, with a Nintendo Switch release following later this year. Paweł Waszak, CEO of Dark Point Games, said, <em>“Given the strong demand and numerous requests we’ve received from our community, we decided it was important to make our game accessible to a wider audience. That’s why we’re excited to announce that we will be releasing the game on older-generation consoles, including Xbox One, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. We want everyone to be able to enjoy the experience, no matter what platform they’re on.”</em></p>


<p>In our Achilles: Legends Untold review, Adrian said, <em>“The Greek Myths have been plundered by video game developers to such a degree it’s hard to conceive that a fresh take could be even possible. Remarkably, Achilles: Legends Untold offers just that. This action-adventure might be a little rough around the edges, but that arguably adds to its charm. If you can put up with some nasty difficulty spikes then you’ll find a remarkable world of myths and legends to explore.”</em></p>

IGN also exclusively revealed the first concept art for the new Battlefield, below, which in turn set the game’s community off on a detective hunt to work out where in the real world it was set.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/16/battlefield-concept-art-1726502144551.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Now, fans reckon they have a pretty good idea where the concept art takes place.</p><p><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Potential Battlefield spoilers follow:</em></p><p>Video game content creator TacticalBrit tweeted to say the concept art shows a war-torn Gibraltar. Various points of interest in the concept art line up with shots of the real world Gibraltar, making this one nailed on.</p><p>“Makes perfect sense for any game with a theoretical conflict as Gibraltar acts as a strategic bridge between Europe and Africa,” TacticalBrit added.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>After doing more takes at the Battlefield Concept art.</p><p>I feel almost 80% certain this is infact Gibraltar.</p><p>Makes perfect sense for any game with a theoretical conflict as Gibraltar acts as a strategic bridge between Europe and Africa. <a href="https://t.co/RodDI4zq68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/RodDI4zq68</a></p></div>— TacticalBrit (@TheTacticalBrit) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTacticalBrit/status/1836116916806783077?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Gibraltar appeared in 2006’s Battlefield 2142 via the Camp Gibraltar Conquest-only map, so the franchise has featured the British Overseas Territory before. That’s all we really have on the new Battlefield though, save snippets of information Zampella gave to IGN, such as the unpopular Specialists system being ditched in favor of more traditional classes. The concept art also suggests ship-to-ship and helicopter combat will be part of the new game, and that it will feature natural disasters like wildfires.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Battlefield Review</h3></div></output><p>Four EA-owned studios are working on Battlefield: DICE for multiplayer, Criterion for single-player and multiplayer, Motive for single-player, and Ripple Effect for a "new experience."

Also in out interview, Zampella offered his thoughts on the recently announced PS5 Pro, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vince-zampella-defends-the-ps5-pro-price-battlefield">including on its $700 price</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

While Chemical Agents does not include any new weapons, it adds two stratagem variants — the TX-41 Sterilizer, which lets you spray a gas at the Terminids and Automatons, and the Guard Dog's ‘Dog Breath,’ which is a corrosive gas sprayer — and, in keeping with the alien exterminator theme, the G-4 Gas grenade, which covers the whole area in a cloud of noxious fumes.</p><p>Arrowhead will be hoping update 01.001.100 is the first step on Helldivers 2’s road to recovery, a road that will keep the game going for years to come.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xvi-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-heavily-underperformed-as-square-enix-reports-disappointing-profits.984174/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-underperformed-disappointing-profits/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy XVI and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> have heavily underperformed compared to previous entries in the series, further highlighting the flaws of Square Enix console-exclusive's strategy.</p>
<p>In its latest <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/library/pdf/24q4outline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial report</a>, the publisher reports that profits in its HD Games sub-segment for the current fiscal year did not meet expectations despite the release of Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Net sales in the MMO and Games for Smart Devices / PC were also lower than in the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>Talking specifically about Q4 of the current fiscal year, the report highlights how the two major publisher releases, the initial sales for Foamstars and the already mentioned Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, were not as strong as expected. In addition, an <em>"impairment made to the content production account"</em> resulted in an operating loss.</p>
<p>While Square Enix generally has sometimes unreasonable expectations, it seems like this is one of the rare cases when the publisher is reasonable, as both Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth really underperformed compared to previous entries in the series, as highlighted by analyst Daniel Ahmad on X.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is one of the rare cases where Square Enix is being reasonable, as both games really did underperform compared to past entries.</p>
<p>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1836334410477527294?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is a real shame that both games have underperformed on the market, as they are both very solid entries in the series. However, things could be turned around by their PC and potential Xbox console release. Final Fantasy XVI has been released this week on PC and seems to be doing well on Steam according to the current Top Sellers list, so hopefully, sales will end up being strong enough for the game not to be considered a commercial failure in the end. You can learn why the game deserves more in terms of sales by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review.</a></p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> yesterday received its latest update that massively buffs player weapons and rebalances the game in their favour.</p>
<p>However, players still aren't completely satisfied and are requesting a new harder difficulty level to compensate. And, creative director and Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt agrees.</p>
<p>A Helldivers 2 fan responded to Pilestedt's call for feedback on X (formerly Twitter), stating: "Everything is great but we need a new harder difficulty now." Pilestedt responded simply: "I agree!"</p>

<p>As part of re-balancing efforts, many primary weapons have received a damage boost, an increase to their magazine size, or a shorter cooldown, while support weapons and Stratagems have received significant damage boosts.</p>
<p>Further, partial damage dealt to enemies has been increased and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> now take less damage from headshots.</p>
<p>"With these changes, along with an upgraded Helldiver arsenal, enemy adjustments, and more consistent damage, the overall difficulty may slightly decrease. We'll be monitoring this closely and will listen to the community on how you think it feels," wrote the developers in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/7147864422081646859">update's extensive patch notes</a>.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Everything is great but we need a new harder difficulty now.</p>— Bunny Asap (@BunnyAsap) <a href="https://twitter.com/BunnyAsap/status/1836081872532541853?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>The update also brings a new Galactic War feature where strategically important assets are displayed on the map, as well as a new Emote Wheel feature, and other changes and bug fixes.</p>
<p>What's more, the update has brought back a surge in players.</p>
<p>In May, we reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-sees-huge-drop-in-player-numbers-since-release">game's peak concurrent players had taken a significant hit</a> and its average players had dropped by 62 percent.</p>
<p>Yesterday, with the update's release, Helldivers 2 reached a peak of 68,380 players (according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#1m">SteamDB</a>). That's a far cry from its launch days of 458,709 peak concurrent players, but still double the number of players from the last couple of months.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Thanks to some alleged pictures of factory prototypes, the first look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-official-name-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> design may have finally arrived.</p>
<p>The pictures, as reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1fjp352/photos_of_switch_2_factory_prototypes_have_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, were shared to an unspecified Discord server by a Chinese user who received them from someone under NDA, possibly a factory worker. Judging from the pictures, the console's design seems to line up with the rumors we have heard so far, as it is bigger than its predecessor, features a bigger screen, and has magnetic side rails for the new Joy-Con controllers.</p>
<p>Together with the pictures allegedly showing the system, the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Le8OI2i">Nintendo Switch 2 specs</a> were also leaked, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1fjp352/comment/lnpntd5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they</a>, too, line up with some of the rumors we have heard in the past few months, such as the 12 GB of LPDDR5X @7500 MT/s RAM and the 256 GB of flash memory. Sadly, no information can currently be gleaned from the SoC model name, but if all these specs are real, we are surely going to hear more about the system's capabilities shortly.</p>
<p>As the pictures and the leaked specs come from an anonymous source, we have to take everything above with the biggest grain of salt, especially as it seems to line up a little too well with the vast majority of Nintendo Switch 2 leaks from the past few months. Thankfully, the console is likely going to be revealed soon, so it won't take much longer to see what Nintendo has been working on for its next-generation system.</p>

            <p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate">skate</a>. game now has an (admittedly vague) early access release date of 2025, according to <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1836065157027402235">a post by the developers</a> on Xitter. It's difficult to write about the new skate. game because if you choose to write skate. with the imposed stylings which skate. publishers Electronic Arts insist, you end up putting a full stop after every instance of skate., which makes your sentences about skate. sound fucking stupid. and. belaboured. with. pauses. Game makers, please stop putting punctuation in your game names.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"we're incredibly stoked to announce that skate. will be launching in Early Access in 2025. we'll share more details on what to expect in the coming months," say developers Full Circle, fully embracing the lower case, except for the words "Early Access". </p>
<p>Punctuation chaos aside, the skateboarding game looks like great fun. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skates-chaotic-playtest-videos-are-the-best-marketing-the-game-could-ask-for">footage we've been shown</a> so far shows wonderful prototype sandboxes, and dozens of skaters bailing off rooftops and sailing down skyscrapers set up like a big human pachinko machine (see below). There's also whole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVjkBnQ2B1pIQWlUDDQLU_2Cnfzv3Cuxu">playlist of full of highlights from testers</a> and some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu0MY53Hz00">excellent bail compilations</a>. Meanwhile the developers have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaDU2afjG-w">regular informal chitchats</a> about what's happening in-house. </p>

<p>That sense of transparency hasn't always been 100% voluntary, mind. A multiplayer version of the game's alpha was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-multiplayer-version-of-the-leaked-skate-4-build-is-out-in-the-wild">leaked online in 2022</a>. But even this doesn't seem that big a deal for a studio who appears to lean into semi-open development. I quite like seeing blockouts of unfinished levels and work-in-progress animations that twist and contort in alien ways. It's a nice reminder that video games don't just appear fully baked. For a long time, they look like hilarious ad-hoc playgrounds made out of cardboard and brightly coloured string. It looks incomplete, yes. But there's something appealing about a level in prototype. Sometimes a sketch can be as pleasing as a finished piece. I once blocked out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azxLKXgH8bs">a  construction site</a> for skateboarding sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/session">Session</a>. It was basic as hell, but I was happy with my big cubes and simple colours.  </p>
<p>If EA's new game can replicate some of that fun - of building your own skate park - I'll be happy. For now, I have cautious hopes. Session was great for realistic foot physics. And the arcade high-scoring of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/olliolli-world">OlliOlli World</a> gave me <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/olliolli-world-review-so-good-it-will-give-you-blisters">thumb blisters</a>. But the return of this series will hopefully offer a wacky world somewhere between hardcore sim and cartoon kickflipper. The big caveat is that this remains <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skate-4-is-now-just-skate-and-will-be-free-to-play-with-microtransactions">a free-to-play game by EA with microtransactions</a>, and the live service model is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">not always wholesome</a>. </p>
<p>All that said, I'm not doing "skate." anymore. It's just Skate now. I don't care if that causes people to confuse this new entry with the original Skate from 2007. You should have thought about that when you decided Skate 4 wasn't good enough, EA. I am sticking to the longstanding RPS principle: if your game's name is formatted stupidly, we will either fix it, or make fun of it, or both.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players guide Aloy as she learns to hunt robotic creatures and animals in the wild. Aloy uses arrows, spears, and explosive traps to injure and kill machines, boar, and occasional human enemies. Animals and humans emit small puffs of red blood when struck; one sequence depicts an abandoned camp with large blood stains on rocks and trees. The game contains a brief reference to sexual material (e.g., “Eighteen months hard labor in exchange for thirty years lounging around Elysium watching porn?”). In text/audio files, characters sometimes reference fictional drugs, overdoses, and getting high: “...not even out of junior high and already a drug addict”; “...I ran across a pusher who was selling Razorwing for eight bucks a tab”; "I'd spend a few days getting high, then OD on Overcast." The word “sh*t” appears in the text/dialogue.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> is Guerrilla Games’ action role-playing game that launched in 2017 on PlayStation 4 and then on PC in 2020. It stars Aloy who battles dinosaur machines in a post-apocalyptic world. Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the best-selling PlayStation Studios games of all time, shifting over 24 million units since launch.</p><p>This remaster is sure to spark a vociferous debate about whether it’s needed in the first place, not just because Horizon Zero Dawn remains one of the most impressive-looking PlayStation games around, but because <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-60-fps-patch-ps5">it received a PS5 update</a> in 2021 that added a 60 frames per second mode and 4K checkerboard resolution. Word of the remaster’s imminent release comes ahead of the launch of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> in November.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has admitted that profits of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> "did not meet expectations".</p>
<p>The comment comes from its <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/library/explanatory.html">financial results briefing</a> held in May and finally made public today.</p>
<p>Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu shared the results, stating: "In the HD Games sub-segment, we released multiple new titles, including major titles such as Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, but profits unfortunately did not meet our expectations."</p>

<p>Further, he stated initial sales of Foamstars and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth - released in Q4 of the last financial year - were "not as strong as expected".</p>
<p>It's important to note these comments were made in May, at the same time Square Enix announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">"aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a>. Shortly after, reports it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-impacted-by-unknown-number-of-layoffs-across-us-and-european-offices">laid off a number of employees in its US and European offices</a> emerged.</p>
<p>At this point in time, Final Fantasy 16 had been out for a year and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth less than three months.</p>
<p>Still, there has been much speculation around the sales of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-underperforming-says-industry-analyst">reported underperformance according to industry analysts</a>.</p>
<p>Sales tracking from Circana previously stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-fourth-top-selling-game-in-the-us-this-year-but-reportedly-remains-far-behind-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the fourth top-selling game in the US</a>, but remains far behind sales of previous entry <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>.</p>
<p>The release of Kiryu's statement today, then, is the first official acknowledgement of the game's sales. Still, it's unclear by how much the game "underperformed" and Square Enix is notorious for its high expectations.</p>
<p>Much has also happened since this financial report. Firstly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-review">Final Fantasy 14 expansion Dawntrail</a> was released in July, which will likely have had a positive impact on overall company profits. We'll find out in the next financial briefing.</p>
<p>Secondly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-doesnt-want-offensive-or-inappropriate-mods-on-pc-release">Final Fantasy 16 was released yesterday on PC</a>, continuing the company's push towards multiplatform releases.</p>
<p>And while Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth remains a PS5 console-exclusive for now, it's likely it will follow Final Fantasy 7 Remake with a PC release in future.</p>
<p>Could these games also come to Xbox? Final Fantasy 14 producer and director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-to-further-deepen-the-relationship-with-xbox-gamers-says-final-fantasy-14s-naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida told Eurogamer</a> the company would like to "further deepen the relationship with Xbox gamers" following the release of the MMORPG on Microsoft's console.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The deckbuilding roguelike genre has been solved at this point. I don’t mean that in a bad way; it’s just that we’ve had a lot of takes on it since Slay the Spire really boosted the genre into the stratosphere. Demon’s Mirror, then, has a fairly large obstacle to overcome, because how do you stand out when there are already so many options to choose from? It turns out the answer is by also throwing in a match-3 game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demon's Mirror - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmwM3g188q8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It takes a little bit of time to adjust to the way that Demon’s Mirror does things, and it initially feels as though the card game and the puzzle game are essentially separate. The only thing that appears to connect them is that a couple of your cards can interact with the board, and that everything costs energy, which means you need to decide if you’re better off matching a bunch of tiles to attack, get energy, get armour, or get willpower, or if you should use a card to do one of those same things or something else.</p>


<p>However, as you get to grips with not only the three characters available, but also the core mechanics each of them has, and then start properly building around them, everything starts to mesh together to make for a smoother experience. My favourite character of the three is one who can apply a unique status effect called influence, which basically represents them talking to the enemies you’re fighting, and if you can apply more influence than they have health remaining, they get taken out of the fight.</p>


<p>Despite being my favourite, this was also the character I had the hardest time finishing the game with. I could see an incredibly cool build in there based on skill cards that cost 0 energy, a card that applied influence X amount of times (where X was the number of skill cards you’d played), and a card that allowed you to put any 0 energy cards back into your hand from your discard pile if you matched green tiles. I then just needed the right relics, which ended up being ones that could reduce the cost of green tile chains, and a couple of others that let you match for free if you played enough cards.</p>
<p>Once I had this working, it took maybe four runs for everything to properly coalesce in both my head and my hand, until I suddenly had a build that actually beat everything within the first two turns. I just needed to keep thinning out my deck until the combo was guaranteed, and then just play a lot of cards to draw more cards and keep doing so for free, until the card that allows you to inflict three influence for each skill card would hit upwards of 200 in total.</p>

<p>The reason I spent two paragraphs detailing that one specific combo is because Demon’s Mirror is full to the brim with different builds to explore and combinations to mess around with, and you can make the game harder or easier with special modifiers you unlock, as well. There’s not as much to do here as there is in some other examples of the genre, but what is here is a delight.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Demon's Mirror is a wonderfully refreshing take on the whole deckbuilding genre, and well worth a look if you want something that genuinely feels new. If you've never played one of these before, however, then it's probably going to feel pretty tough to begin with, but it'll be worth it.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sims-5-you-insolent-fools-only-a-sims-universe<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

        <p>A universe that includes a film and Project Rene, which is sort of Sims 5, maybe</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
People waiting impatiently for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a>: you have sinned against Simming and must do penance. In your temerity and ignorance, you have cried out unto developers Maxis and publisher EA for another sequential helping of the cuddly/sociopathic neighbourhood-building game - a "sequel", if you will. Know ye not that we live in the time of Disrupted Models? Sequels are archaisms devised by the old gods in their dotage. Let us all join hands and set forth into the sunny uplands of the Connected Cross-Media Cross-Platform Universe.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"The Sims will move beyond linear, sequential Sims releases and offer more options for players than ever before," explains <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/news/the-future-of-the-sims">an EA blog post about the future of the series</a>, published yesterday. "We're focused on creating a variety of games and experiences that will touch different categories across the simulated life genre including cozy games, social and collaborative based gameplay, mobile narrative games and continued depth, improvements, and modernization of The Sims 4, which will continue to be a foundational Sims experience."
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/">Variety</a> (ta <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">Eurogamer</a>), The Sims franchise general manager Kate Gorman explained the thinking in slightly more detail. "The way to think about it is, historically, The Sims franchise started with Sims 1 and then Sims 2, 3, and 4," she began, in a useful refresher for those of us still wrestling with the whole "sequel" concept. "And they were seen as replacements for the previous products. [But now,] we are not going to be working on replacements of previous projects; we're only going to be adding to our universe." 
</p>
<p>
But what could this mean??? "What this means is that we will continue to bring HD simulation experience and what people would want from a 5," Gorman continued, "but it doesn't mean that we're going to start you over... As we think about the future of it, we want you to continue all of those families and generations. Those creations are your progress, your attachment. 
</p>
<p>
"We don't want to reset your progress. And so it's not about... what the numbers are in the games, but know that the future of the franchise looks more like keeping your progress, keeping things across titles, and really having an ongoing experience, and not a start-and-stop experience between products." 
</p>
<p>
Beyond this point, the brain of the writer buckles and cannot reassemble the majesty of EA's vision into cogent paragraphs. I am forced to resort to the simplified, World War-era medium of bulletpoints. Here's roughly what the Sims universe will encompass, based on the blog post and the interview above.
</p>
<p>
- The mysterious Project Rene, which "is focused on building ways for friends to meet, connect, and share while playing together in an all-new world". There's a small invite-only playtest happening later this year, which will give "an early look at a multiplayer experience that explores joining friends and other players at a shared location". I guess this could be something approximating a "Sims 5", if you're desperate. EA have previously said that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-sims-game-will-be-free-to-play-with-paid-dlc">Project Rene would co-exist with The Sims 4</a>, and would be a free-to-play game with DLC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-5-devs-definitely-want-to-have-multiplayer-are-looking-at-animal-crossing-for-inspiration">multiplayer inspired by Animal Crossing</a><a></a>
</p>
<p>
- a Hollywood movie adaptation in partnership with Amazon MGM Studios, with Loki director Kate Herron directing and Dr Who scribe Briony Redman on the writing team. I think Margot Robbie is involved somehow. Make it like the Barbie film, please
</p>
<p>
- Continuing to improve and maintain The Sims 4, a venerable but very popular game. EA are "investing in meaningful new features and base game updates", so as "to evolve the game in both appearance and gameplay experience"
</p>
<p>
- expanding The Sims FreePlay, a mobile game spin-off, while developing another mobile experience or game, Project Stories
</p>
<p>
- "Reinvigorating the MySims product line, beginning with two lovable games available soon on Nintendo Switch", Nintendo's charming cut-price Steam Deck - the games in question are MySims and MySims Kingdom, which together form the MySims: Cozy Bundle. It burns, it burns!
</p>
<p>
- A set of creator tools, a player content gallery, a marketplace, and a social network, to be shared across Sims games
</p>
<p>EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/project-rene-aka-the-sims-5-shows-prototype-lighting-animation-routines-in-latest-video">revealed some strictly WIP footage of Project Rene last year</a>, with prototypes of daily routines around the neighbourhood and new animations for moods and reactions. I've popped a screenshot from one of those prototypes at the top of the page, there. Again, it does <em>sort</em> of feel like Project Rene will be something approximating a traditional Sims sequel, but I reckon I'll be struck by righteous lightning if I spell that out too avidly.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fairy-tail-2-interview-with-producer-hiroshi-kataoka-discussing-the-series-new-combat-system-additional-content/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In many ways, the announcement of Fairy Tail 2 was an unexpected but welcome surprise. While there's no denying the popularity of the series by Hiro Mashima, Koei Tecmo and Gust gave no indication that the franchise would continue to bring a close to the original manga's storyline.</p><div>
<p>During Gamescom 2024, I had the chance to try out the game before its <a href="https://wccftech.com/fairy-tail-2-december/">December release</a> and speak with Producer Hiroshi Kataoka, discussing the setting, characters, battle system, future content, and more. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>The interview was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>The original Fairy Tail was almost universally praised for being a very good adaptation of the manga by Hiro Mashima, but many found it difficult to keep up with the story and characters without any prior knowledge. Is there anything in the new game that addresses this issue?</strong></p>
<p>We have a few systems in place to address this issue. For starters, at the beginning of the game, there's an event that is specifically focused on looking back at the past story. We also implemented a glossary in the main menu, which allows players to check terminology as well as learn more about characters and their past, so it's easy to learn what happened before the Alvarez Empire Arc. During dialogues, there are also words highlighted in yellow, which can take the player straight to the glossary, even during gameplay. So, to enjoy Fairy Tail 2, it's not necessary to play the original.</p>
<p><strong>Fairy Tail 2 features an all-new original story called Key to the Unknown, set after the events of the Alvarez Empire Arc and the original story. Is there more original story besides this new epilogue?</strong></p>
<p>There is more original story, but it's not a lot, and it's mostly found in sidequests and optional content. Fairy Tail 2 is all about respecting the original IP, and we didn't want to break the flow of the original narrative. When it comes to the original story we added, including the epilogue, Mashima-sensei checked everything, so players and fans can look forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>One of the biggest changes featured in Fairy Tail 2 over the original is the battle system. Why go from a classic turn-based system to the new real-time one?</strong></p>
<p>There are a few reasons for the change. The first game featured a turn-based battle system to help newcomers to the genre and let them have fun right away, but its slow pace wouldn't have been suitable for what happens in the second game. The Alvarez Empire arc, which is the last arc of the original manga, features a lot of combat against some very powerful enemies, and I felt that a faster, more action-based combat system was better suited to properly adapt these battles. Being the final battle, it just had to be faster.</p>
<p><strong>Many role-playing game series are moving away from turn-based combat and employing more action-oriented systems. Do you think there's still a market for classic turn-based games?</strong></p>
<p>I don't think the market is shifting towards one or the other. It all depends on what kind of battles someone wants to have in their games. You can do interesting things with both turn-based and action-focused combat systems. Personally, I still find turn-based combat fun, but for Fairy Tail 2, I felt that an action-oriented combat system would have been best. It really depends on the game.</p>
<p><strong>Are there multiple difficulty settings?</strong></p>
<p>Fairy Tail 2 features multiple difficulty settings. We have an easy mode for beginners to enjoy the story, but we also have more battle-focused difficulties for those who find the other difficulties too easy. There's a total of four settings, so it's not either easy mode or normal mode.</p>
<p><strong>Fairy Tail features a lot of characters. How did you pick the playable characters? Are more coming after release?</strong></p>
<p>The playable characters were picked based on their role in the final battle against the Alvarez Empire. We picked those involved in the battle in the original story. There will be some additional characters coming after launch, but we can't specifically say who is coming right now.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about additional content, will there be more story added to the game after release?</strong></p>
<p>We will release additional free and paid content after the release. We're still deciding what to release specifically, but I can confirm that more content is coming.</p>
<p><strong>Looking ahead, will the Fairy Tail series continue? If so, would a new entry in the series feature an all-original story, or will it adapt the 100 Years Quest story?</strong></p>
<p>There's definitely the chance of more Fairy Tail in the future, but right now, it's hard to say if there's going to be another entry in the series and if it will adapt the new story or feature original content. It all depends on how Fairy Tail 2 is received. If players want more sequels, we will consider developing them and speak with Kodansha, who holds the IP, on how to proceed. So, there's definitely a possibility.</p>
<p><strong>If you could adapt any other manga series, which would it be?</strong></p>
<p>I like old manga series, and I would love to adapt some works from Leiji Matsumoto. I really like Space Battleship Yamato, and I would love to make a game based on it.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>
