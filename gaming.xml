            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-oblivion-remake-images-seemingly-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More images of the much-mooted&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake, which is seemingly becoming the industry's worst-kept secret, have apparently leaked, and from none other than the purported developer's very own website this time.</p>

<p>Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Taurnil</a>&nbsp;spotted the images in the backend of developer Virtuos' website. Although it hasn't been confirmed by Bethesda, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed" rel="nofollow">been reported</a> that Virtuos is working on the <i>Oblivion&nbsp;</i>remake, and these images rather seem to back up that claim.</p>

<p>ResetEra user Mattmo831 also <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/images-of-oblivion-remake-from-virtuos-games-%E2%80%9Cleak%E2%80%9D.1164534/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">collected a number of images</a> from the&nbsp;Virtuos website, so although the images are no longer accessible via Virtuos' page, it's looking pretty unlikely that they're fake at this point. We won't be including them in this article, but they're easily accessible via the above links at time of writing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remake-images-leaked-original-conversation.jpg?itok=zlfrXHOS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remake-images-leaked-original-conversation.jpg?itok=A0qXEBKB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Oblivion</em>'s upcoming remake now seems like a foregone conclusion.</figcaption></figure><p>The images depict a wide range of scenes from&nbsp;<em>Oblivion</em>, including one-to-one comparisons with the original, and surprise surprise, it looks like the new version will sport vastly improved visuals.</p>

<p>New key art has also seemingly been leaked, depicting an armored warrior standing in front of the game's logo, although there aren't any screenshots of the remake's conversation system yet, so we don't yet know if it's the same weird dead-eyed hoedown it was in the original.</p>

<p>Journalist Jeff Grubb <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-release-date-reportedly-narrowed-down/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suggested recently</a> that the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake will "shadowdrop" - that is, launch without any prior fanfare - sometime in April. The sudden appearance of these screenshots on Virtuos' website would seem to back up that claim.</p>

<p>It is, of course, worth bearing in mind that no announcement has officially been made by Bethesda or Virtuos, and so all of this is still technically speculation. Still, the evidence is mounting, so I'd be surprised if April passes with no word on the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/virtuos-metal-gear-solid-delta.jpg?itok=MDQy3q0u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/virtuos-metal-gear-solid-delta.jpg?itok=i94dF2l7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Virtuos has served as a co-development studio on games like&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If Virtuos is indeed working on the <i>Oblivion&nbsp;</i>remake, past form would indicate it's a good choice for the project. Previous games worked on by Virtuos as a co-development studio include&nbsp;<em>Dead Island 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">the upcoming</a>&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>(which, I suppose, would make the latter a Virtuos Mission).</p>

<p>We'll almost certainly hear something about the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake in the coming weeks (assuming, of course, it doesn't get shadowdropped tomorrow). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-launches-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-on-may-13-alongside-new-expansion-elderwood<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Singularity 6 is bringing its fantasy life sim adventure, <em>Palia</em>, to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series on May 13. While the game has already been available for PC and Nintendo Switch for a time, this new batch of console players will be able to join in with full cross-platform support.</p>

<p>Originally released n 2023, <em>Palia</em> has thrived on its free-to-play multiplayer model that encourages people to explore, craft, and live the life sim they’ve always wanted. <em>Palia</em> has released over 24 content updates to date, including 800 housing items, seasonal events and minigames, trading and building mechanics, and immersive storylines.</p>

<p>Alongside the PS5 and Xbox Series launch, <em>Palia</em> will release its new round of content with the introduction of the Elderwood – a new Adventure Zone filled with a magical forest that is set to be the largest release since the original launch. Elderwood offers up new ways to explore, alongside familiar characters such as Nai’o and Subira with new quests.</p>

<p>In Elderwood, there’s new collectables, hostile huntable creatures such as the Ogapuu, and elusive ones like the Shmole. Players can also try their hand looking for various artifacts, which unlock a new equipment type called Relics, which can help buff up your party.</p>

<p><em>Palia</em> strives to be an experience the player can play at their own pace, with enough content for years to come.</p>




<p>Elderwood in particular sets off to prove as much with all of its addition. A brief demo included a further look at housing, and all the colorful collectables one can hold within. Of course, there’s fishing and farming to do too.</p>

<p>Once into the actual forest of the Elderwood, things start to get a little mysterious with plenty of purples and blues. There’s a lot of exploration to be had outside of the town, with plenty more materials to find for crafting and housing.</p>

<p>Palia’s resident NPCs are there too, and have plenty to say about what’s going on in the Edlerwood. Characters such as Nai’o are useful for learning more about the world, and taking on quests marked on the map.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palia-01.jpg?itok=7zj2juD5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palia-01.jpg?itok=V5kKFJmQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There’s quite a lot to unpack with <em>Palia</em>’s latest, but again, the goal is to take things and play at a pace that feels comfortable.</p>

<p>All of this will be available on May 13 along with the return of the Refer a Friend program. Players can invite their friends to Palia to earn the Elderwood Fun Guy Plush in five different sizes.</p>

Well, we found out back in 2021's “The Matrix: Resurrections.” Despite other stars like Keanu Reaves and Carrie-Anne Moss returning and reprising their roles in the fourth film in the franchise, Laurence Fishburne, who played and helped shape the iconic role of Morpheus, did not return.<br></p><p>Instead, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II joined the film as an alternate “version” of both Morpheus and the franchise’s villain, Agent Smith. Fans, of course, were confused and many let down by the omission of the Emmy and Tony Award-winning actor in the film. Now, on a recent appearance on “The View,” Fishburne is finally opening up about why he was not involved in the film, and his answer will surprise you.</p><p>A fifth installment is currently in the works, and when asked by “The View” host Sara Haines asked if Fishburne would return, Fishburne replied, “It depends on the circumstances — who is involved, how well the script has been written, if they offer me.” He then said, “You know, I offered my services to the fourth <em>Matrix</em>, and they didn’t respond well.”</p><p>To the shock of the hosts including Sunny Hostin, Whoopi Goldberg and more, Fishburne continued, “So hey, it’s not like I didn’t say, ‘Oh, I’d like to offer my services.’ I did. And for whatever reason, that didn’t happen.”</p><p>He then called it,  “the truth” of the situation, before adding, “So we’ll see.” Hostin chimed in then, saying, “You need to come back!” Haines added, “It sounds like a decision as to whether they want it to be a great ‘Matrix’...”</p><p>At the time of the fourth film’s announcement, Fishburne did publicly state that he was not invited, though did not go into the depth the same way he went today on “The View.” He simply said at the time, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/there-is-no-spoon-and-no-laurence-fishburne-in-the-matr-1844763923&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/there-is-no-spoon-and-no-laurence-fishburne-in-the-matr-1844763923">we reported,</a></span> “I have not been invited. Maybe that will make me write another play. I wish them well. I hope it’s great.”</p><p>The fourth film was certainly a success and did well enough at the box office to justify a fifth installment. Hopefully this time the powers that be wake up and consider Fishburne’s offer, after all, he is all but synonymous with this series!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/648705/nvidias-rtx-5060-ti-gpu-pricing-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Frtx-5060-desktop-family-laptop-5060-coming-soon%2F" rel="sponsored">announcing</a> its RTX 5060 family of GPUs today, just a day before it releases the RTX 5060 Ti on April 16th. Two variants of the RTX 5060 Ti are launching, the $379 8GB of VRAM model and the $429 16GB version. The $299 RTX 5060 will launch at some point in May with 8GB of VRAM.</p><p>The RTX 5060 Ti will ship with 4,608 CUDA cores, a 2.4GHz base clock, 2.57GHz boost clock, and a 128-bit memory bus with either 8GB or 16GB of GDDR7. Nvidia says the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB is launching on April 16th, but that the 8GB model will follow “shortly afterwards.” The cheaper RTX 5060 features 3,840 CUDA cores and uses a 128-bit memory bus with 8GB of GDDR7 memory.</p><p>Both the RTX 5060 Ti and RTX 5060 will support <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation</a> (up to 4x), as well as PCI Express Gen 5 and DisplayPort 2.1b. The RTX 5060 Ti will have a total graphics power of 180 watts, while the RTX 5060 will consume up to 145 watts.</p><p>Nvidia is promising high RTX 5060 frame rates in a variety of games, thanks mainly to Multi Frame Generation. The GPU maker has tested games at 1080p with max Frame Gen levels, AMD’s Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU, and 1080p max settings:</p><div><ul><li><span><em>Half-Life 2 RTX</em> - 130fps</span></li><li><span><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> - 234fps</span></li><li><span><em>Alan Wake II</em> - 114fps</span></li><li><span><em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>- 130fps</span></li><li><span><em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>- 148fps</span></li><li><span><em>Stalker 2</em> - 208fps</span></li><li><span><em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>- 105fps</span></li><li><span><em>Marvel Rivals </em>- 330fps</span></li><li><span><em>Avowed</em> - 220fps</span></li></ul></div><p>While Nvidia is obviously pushing 4x Frame Gen with these new RTX 5060 cards, there will also be performance improvements to rasterization. “In a game that doesn’t support Multi Frame Gen, you’ll see about a 20-25 percent performance improvement gen over gen on the RTX 5060,” says Justin Walker, Nvidia’s senior director director of GeForce product management, in a press briefing. “You’ll see about 20 percent on the RTX 5060 Ti.“</p><p>Nvidia isn’t making Founders Edition versions of the RTX 5060 cards, so it won’t be able to directly impact the pricing its board partners set this time around with its own cards. That means it might be very difficult to find an RTX 5060 at $299, especially with the uncertainty around <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">Trump’s tariff situation</a> that changes almost daily.</p><p>That said, the pricing might not be the only uncertain aspect of these new cards. The choice to offer 8GB of VRAM will be controversial, I’m sure. “We are trying to optimize price and performance,” says Walker. “When you get to a GPU like the RTX 5060, you have to look really hard at trade offs.”</p><p>Nvidia argues that VRAM doesn’t have a big impact on GPU performance, and that it has optimized for pricing with the RTX 5060 series. But we’re still regularly seeing games consume a lot of memory, which really impacts 8GB cards. “The RTX 2060 was $349, and that was years ago,” says Walker. “The RTX 3060 was $329, and I bet even if you looked back and did the inflation math of the RTX 1660 and RTX 1060, I think you’ll find that $299 for a GPU is a pretty good price.”</p><p>Pricing and VRAM debates aside, the RTX 5060 will also be available in laptops in May. With prices starting at $1,099, Acer, Asus, Dell, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSI, and Razer will all have models with Nvidia’s latest RTX 5060 laptop GPUs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft has announced its next wave of Game Pass titles available in April 2025, including the return of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, a game you may have heard of. As announced previously, this return also brings with it the PC Game Pass debut of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-arrives-on-pc-game-pass-this-month-for-first-time-in-enhanced-edition">GTA 5's new Enhanced Edition for PC players</a> - the first time the game has been offered in any PC subscription service.
</p>
<p>Also included in these latest additions is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 - the more recent one from 2022 - although you'll only be getting access to that, for now, if you have Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass. It's the same deal as well for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, the turn-based RPG from France that we've been keeping a hopeful eye on.</p>

<ul>
<li>Grand Theft Auto 5 (Cloud, Console and PC, via Standard, Ultimate and PC) - available now</li>

As ever, whenever Microsoft giveth, so it taketh away. Games getting the chop this time include Rebellion's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sniper-elite-5">Sniper Elite 5</a> and the Annapurna-published <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thirsty-suitors">Thirsty Suitors</a>. </p>
<p>
The full list of titles leaving Xbox Game Pass on 30th April are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a Nice Death (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Kona II Brume (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Sniper Elite 5 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Last Case of Benedict Fox (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Thirsty Suitors (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Rewinder (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-talos-principle-reawakened-%E2%80%93-in-the-beginning-%E2%80%93-eclipse-puzzle-guide.1164642/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/the-talos-principle-reawakened-in-the-beginning-eclipse-puzzle-guide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-talos-principle-reawakened-launches-on-april-10-for-playstation-5-xbox-series-pc/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> was more than an Unreal Engine 5 remaster of Croteam's first-person philosophical puzzle-solving classic. It also included a whole new expansion for players, In the Beginning.</p>
<p>The new expansion includes 18 puzzles, 16 of which were made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858">in collaboration with a few of The Talos Principle's most dedicated fans</a> who'd been designing puzzles for years already. This is a key fact about this new expansion's development because these are some of the most challenging puzzles across the entire Talos Principle series. Who else besides the community's sickos (positive) could have designed them?</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through solving the puzzle Eclipse, which is located in the Egypt section of the In the Beginning expansion in The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Eclipse Puzzle Guide</h2>
<p>Part of what makes this puzzle challenging is that many of the components are only necessary for you to concern yourself with if you're trying to get the Gold Star.</p>
<p>If you want a big hint without looking at the rest of this guide for the solution, know that about half the puzzle area can be ignored if you want to grab the tetromino and be on your way. Another far more cryptic hint is that pause points and having items flying in the air while paused are part of how you solve this puzzle.</p>
<p>But if you're already here, I imagine you've spent long enough trying to solve this on your own and now want the solution. Keep reading to see how this puzzle can be solved.</p>
<h3>Phase One</h3>
<p>To start solving this puzzle, you first need to get the key to the locked door on the left side of the puzzle area.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Head towards the currently disabled barrier to the right. Grab the connector on the elevated step, connect it to the blue beam and the blue node immediately adjacent to each other, and place the connector to the left of the slightly elevated step. You should also angle it to stay connected to the node it was first connected to when you walked into the puzzle room. This will turn off the barrier, but a fan still blocks you from walking beyond the barrier.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>


<ul>
<li>Turn around, and you will see a hexahedron (box) on a weighted switch to your right. Grab the box, and while standing slightly on the other side of the barrier that you've turned off, place the box on the elevated step to turn off the fan.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the fan off the vent and use it on the weighted switch to turn off the barrier in front of you. Grab the box off the elevated step to allow the blue beam to re-connect, turning off the barrier on the left so both are off, and you can retrieve the fan. Grab it and place it down next to the box and connector.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Bring the box and the fan to the starting area, placing the fan on the vent on the ground to the right of the weighted switch in front of the puzzle entrance. Place the box on the weighted switch, activating the vent. Jump onto the vent to lift yourself in the air, and you'll see the keys on the platform in front of you. Jump on the platform to grab the keys.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<h3>Phase Two</h3>
<p>Now you have the keys to unlock the door and access the recorder. But you still need the connector, which is currently trapped on the wrong side of the barrier it is keeping disabled. This is where you'll start utilizing the recorder. Getting the connector on the right side of the barrier is the easy part. After that, it all gets much more complex. Let's start with getting the connector on the right side of the barrier.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>After unlocking the door with the keys, activate the recorder and create a pause point anywhere you like. Hit play on the recording.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Thanks to the duplicated version of the connector in the recording, you can now grab the connector without disconnecting the beams when the recording pauses. Place the connector next to the vents and weighted switch in the puzzle entrance before letting the rest of the recording play.</li>
</ul>
<p>Connector acquired. Here's where it gets trickier.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the connector and connect it to the red beam and the red node shown in the screenshot above. Place the connector down next to the vent.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Start a new recording and grab the fan to use as a weight on the weighted switch on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the connector and connect it to the red node, which you should be able to see through a window in the wall. Leave the connector there.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the fan off the weighted switch and place it back on the vent on the floor. After you've completed those actions, create a pause point.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the box, step on the weighted switch that activates the fans, and create another pause point.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Drop the box on the fan directly in front of the weighted switch, and once it has reached its peak height, make another pause point. You can now walk over to the recorder and stop the recording.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>As your recording begins to play, pick up the fan again, place it on the same weighted switch you placed it on in the recording, and leave it there. Once your recorded self has placed the fan back on the vent and hit the first pause point, put the box on top of the fan while keeping it paused. Grab the connector, connect it to the duplicated recording version of the connector, and place the connector on the box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>With the recording still paused, head over to the left side of the puzzle room and beyond the purple barrier. Play the recording, and the blue barrier in front of you should be lifted once the box and the connector are in the air. The recording will pause again; don't unpause it until you've walked beyond the blue barrier.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>At this point, you're nearly there. The barrier shield blocking your way to the tetromino should be lifted with the box and the connector in the air, but a fan blowing impedes you from walking to it.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Un-pause the recording again, and once everything is in the air, the duplicated recorded box should line up perfectly to block the red beam keeping the fan on, allowing you to grab the tetromino and complete the puzzle. It won't block the beam continuously, though, as the box with the connector on it bounces in the air. It's best to watch the box rise, and once you see it block the beam, make a break for the tetromino.</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll want to give the red beams enough time to properly activate each node, as long-time Talos Principle players know that nodes don't always activate immediately.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-releases-free-color-blindness-tool-for-developers.1164639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-chroma-color-blindness<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has released a free color blindness simulation tool to help developers understand how to make their games accessible to those with three major types of color blindness.</p>

<p>The tool's name is Chroma, and it's available on <a href="https://github.com/ubisoft/Chroma" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> as an open-source kit. It won't cost you anything to use it, either, so if you're a developer and you want to know how to make your game better for colorblind folks, Ubisoft's got you covered.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/72j7U131efodyDK64WTJua" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Ubisoft's official website, Chroma's purpose is to "accurately replicate" the experience of colorblind gamers and help developers to "create accessible content to meet [those players'] needs".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-chroma-color-blindness-tool-windows.jpg?itok=aumZzukO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-chroma-color-blindness-tool-windows.jpg?itok=xRgcz93m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft's Chroma color blindness tool is now free for all developers to use.</figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft's accessibility director David Tisserand says Chroma has been a "highly efficient" tool for Ubisoft when developing its own games, and that he and his team believe "accessibility is a journey, not a race", which is why they're sharing Chroma with the wider industry.</p>

<p>Since Chroma is open-source, developers are welcome to "benefit from it, provide feedback, and contribute to its future development", according to Tisserand. That's a pretty nice touch.</p>

<p>You can use Chroma on either single or dual screens, and it's hotkey-compatible as well. What's more, you can customize its overlay to make it look the way that works best for you.</p>

<p>QC product manager Jawad Shakil says Chroma was created to "mak[e] color blindness accessibility a natural part of the creative and testing process", and that the Chroma team's work is "already making a difference in how we design games with accessibility in mind".</p>

<p>Ubisoft's color blindness tool Chroma is available to download and use right now for free.</p>

            <p>The GeForce RTX 50 series – Nvidia’s hated, adored, but never ignored family of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">gaming GPUs</a> – could soon be complete, as the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti have been specced out ahead of their imminent releases. These are mostly as-expected replacements for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review">RTX 4060</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-review">RTX 4060 Ti</a>, with moderate performance bumps augmented by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation</a>, though the RTX 5060 Ti is getting a lowered MSRP on both its 8GB and 16GB variants.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While there won't be a Founders Edition for any of these, partner versions of the 8GB RTX 5060 Ti will start from £349 / $379 - £40 / $20 less than the 8GB 4060 Ti. Base-price 16GB models, meanwhile, will shed £80 / $70 from the last-gen equivalent, selling at £399 / $429. Both are officially launching this Wednesday, April 16th, though an Nvidia spokesperson told digitally gathered reporters last week (myself included) that a lot of 8GB RTX 5060 Ti models might not actually go on sale until later on.</p>
<p>As for the RTX 5060, that’s sticking solely to 8GB, and will start at $299 (UK pricing TBC) when it has its own as-yet-unspecified release in May. The lack of extra VRAM over the RTX 4060 will likely keep it limited to 1080p duties, though that’s evidently not been a problem for the latter, which currently sits second on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">Steam’s list of the most-used graphics cards</a>. Only after, funnily enough, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review">RTX 3060</a>. It does use newer GDDR7 memory, though, as does the RTX 5060 Ti.</p>

<p>Here be some Nvidia-provided benchmark graphs to peer over, and yes, you <em>can</em> click to make them human eye-sized. Predictably, they count MFG’s AI-generated frames in amongst the traditionally rendered ones, which trickifies the business of making core performance comparisons against previous generations. Except, that is, in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-requiem">A Plague Tale: Requiem</a>, which lacks MFG support and is thus comparable with the RTX 4060’s lowly 2x frame gen. Nvidia, you fools! Now it’s laid bare that, uh, both 5060 GPUs are about 20% faster over their 4060 counterparts, which doesn’t sound all that bad. Especially right after the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review">RTX 5070</a>, which is essentially just an RTX 4070 Super <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaOgZwk9rN8">with a new hat</a>.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/RTX-5060-official-benchmarks.JPG?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nvidia</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Frame generation remains as contentious a subject as the RTX 50 range itself, and to be honest, I’m still not sure how it’s perceived and used by the majority of ordinary players. Maybe you’d like to answer the poll below and educate me on that point. I will say that all frame gen systems – MFG, DLSS 3, FSR, the lot – work best when your PC is already churning out a healthy supply of ordinary frames, so cheaper GPUs like the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti might not be able to rely on them as much as a hulking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a>. Here’s hoping the pre-generation framerate boost over the RTX 40 series is real, though obviously we have but the one rat-dodging stealth game for data points.</p>
<p>It's also unclear whether those (otherwise very agreeable) RTX 5060 Ti price drops will actually hold. Most of the previous RTX 50 GPU launches have been marred by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidias-rtx-5070-founders-editions-will-be-a-few-weeks-late-as-punters-and-sellers-brace-for-launch-day-shortages">stock shortages and resultant gouging</a>, and as the most mainstream-friendly of the pack, the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti seem especially vulnerable to instant sellouts. It's also too early to judge the impact of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-us-tariffs-hit-pc-hardware-is-joining-the-switch-2-in-pre-order-delay-limbo">US tariffs</a>: these were mostly paused/rolled back/wussed out of last week, though a base 10% tax remains, and Nvidia’s Taiwan-made GPUs aren’t counted among exemptions. Guess those <a href="https://www.theregister.com/AMP/2025/04/09/nvidia_us_export_ban_change/">$1m Mar-a-Lago dinners</a> only go so far.</p>

Images of what looks very much like that long-rumoured <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> remake or remaster have leaked online care of Virtuos Games, the Singapore-based game developer reported to be handling the project.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The pics were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/">dug up</a> by enterprising Redditor Taurnil, who inspected a random element on <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/">the Virtuos Games website</a>, and wangled his way to a Wordpress folder containing a bunch of images labelled “Elder Scrolls IV” and “Oblivion”, which were uploaded just today (15th April). 
</p>
<p>
I’ve been able to retrace Taurnil’s steps and access said folder. It appears somebody has Virtuos has spotted the leak, because the images in question are no longer accessible, but the filenames are still there at the time of writing. I’ve asked Virtuos for comment.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, somebody else claims to have uploaded a few images to <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">Imgur</a> – that's one of them up there in my article header. While they seem pretty credible, there is just the daintiest smidgeon of a ghostly possibility that they’ve been faked and posted for the lulz, so handle with caution. They show a few locations, including the Imperial City at Cyrodiil and a flaming Oblivion gate, together with a formal title, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.
</p>
<p>Is this just a remaster, then, or more of a remake? Earlier rumours have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">suggested</a> that the new version of Oblivion will make fairly robust changes to the original 2006 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s stealth, stamina and blocking systems. Assuming all of this is legit, it doesn't sound like they've just bumped up the resolution.</p>
<p>
Oblivion remake gossip is currently at fever pitch, alleviated not at all by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-have-no-official-information-on-an-oblivion-remake-say-bethesda-which-isnt-a-denial-is-it">a chancy-sounding Bethesda support statement that “we have no official information on an Oblivion remake”</a>. If I were Bethesda and had an announcement trailer in the offing, I’d probably think about running it early at this stage.

I think if you’re a Like a Dragon fan, this is an easy preorder.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Jour">Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together - Sleeved Booster</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218703"><div id="218703" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together - Sleeved Booster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I threw one of these in my cart last week just to hit the free shipping minimum. One pack, random art, decent discount. There’s no reason to expect anything big, but the price is finally low enough that I don’t feel bad if I just pull a Furret. And if you happen to land something like Articuno’s Illustration Rare (now $18.69) or Wailord (around $14.55), it’s a nice win from a $10 impulse buy.</p></div><p id="train-sim-world-5-route-remix-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Train Sim world 5 Route Remix Bundle">Train Sim world 5 Route Remix Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218704"><div id="218704" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Train Sim world 5 Route Remix Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t know how many people wake up wanting ten train simulator add-ons, but if you’re one of them, today is your day. For $15, you get Train Sim World 5’s Starter Pack plus nine routes and loco add-ons. Antelope Valley, Cajon Pass, Thameslink, Santa Fe F7—the whole diesel buffet. It’s Steam keys, it supports CALM, and the value is so off the rails (pun fully intended) that I bought it just to mess around with the Railpool BR193 Vectron. Don’t judge me.</p></div><p id="lepro-o1-ai-floor-lamp"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp">Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218705"><div id="218705" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of those “tech that doesn’t make sense until you try it” products. It’s a smart LED floor lamp with AI-generated lighting modes, music sync, voice control, app scheduling, and a vibe for every mood. It’s absurdly bright at 2300 lumens, and it looks clean in any corner setup. The AI stuff isn’t just fluff either. Say “I want relaxing light” and it’ll give you ten preset scenes. I think it’s great if you want one light to do everything without fiddling with settings for half an hour.</p></div><p id="lepro-b2-ai-smart-light-bulbs"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lepro B2 AI Smart Light Bulbs">Lepro B2 AI Smart Light Bulbs</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218706"><div id="218706" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lepro B2 AI Smart Light Bulbs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the same AI bulbs as the ones in the floor lamp, but in classic 75W-equivalent LED form. They’re bright, colorful, and weirdly helpful if you’re too tired to fine-tune your lighting manually. The music sync is fun, the AI scenes work well, and the voice commands actually feel smart instead of gimmicky. I bought a set of these last month and haven’t touched the wall switch since. At $8 per bulb, it’s kind of a no-brainer.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-surg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surg">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218606"><div id="218606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up Surging Sparks because six booster packs under $50 is lower than what Amazon has been charging recently (It's still above MSRP though) Honestly, I wanted something new to crack open. It’s part of the latest Scarlet &amp; Violet expansion, so if you’re trying to keep up with current sets or just enjoy the chaos of pulling a good card, this one’s a smart grab.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-ionos-bellibolt-ex-pre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Pre">Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218607"><div id="218607" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s for the collectors who care as much about presentation as they do the pulls.

It's also a cool way to snag Journey Together packs with a fantastic promo card.</p></div><div id="218685" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="e3df206f-2b99-4347-afac-38395c81c6ca"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Free to Play VR Sandbox Game: DigiGods on Meta Quest</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>DigiGods is a free-to-play, physics-based, VR game that allows players to create, play, and share in a sandbox environment.

I pre-ordered Jack immediately because, well, it felt necessary. The line includes Shepard, Tali, Legion, and others, and they look good enough that I’ve already made space for them on the shelf.

I paid the $12, added the games to my backlog like I always do, and immediately booted up The Pale Beyond. It’s a strong lineup if you like character-driven games and don’t mind occasionally being emotionally wrecked by minimalist storytelling.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-shr"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shr"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218611"><div id="218611" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think of this one as the all-in-one box for when you want cards <em>and</em> a bunch of gear you probably won’t use but still want around. Nine booster packs, a promo, sleeves, dice, and enough extras to make you feel like you’re doing more than just opening packs. It’s a solid option if you like having a little structure with your chaos.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-terapagos-ex-ultra-pre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Pre"> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218612"><div id="218612" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I hesitated on this one, then immediately remembered it includes 18 booster packs and a playmat. It’s definitely a big spend, but if you’ve been waiting for a premium bundle that actually justifies the price, this checks out. I picked it up more for the experience than the individual cards, and that’s the right way to approach it.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-shining-fates-collectio"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collectio">Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218613"><div id="218613" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed Shining Fates Pikachu V mostly because I never actually opened it when it first dropped, and now seemed like a good excuse.

Over time, the house’s simmering hatred for humanity has manifested as a living, pulsating stone heart at its core. Fueled by this dark power, the house now lures unsuspecting humans into its twisted halls, feeding on their fear—and their very bodies—to satiate its hunger and grow ever more powerful.</p><p>In <em>Deck of Haunts</em>, players strategically construct their haunted house by day, setting deadly traps to protect their Heart room, the core of their supernatural power. By night, they must use a deck of terrifying cards to unleash spirits and <a title="Genres > Horror [594 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s that gradually drive unassuming explorers insane, or kill them.

As night falls, lure unwitting explorers into your home, where you’ll use a deck of terrifying cards to summon spirits, shift hallways, and unleash spine-chilling horrors.

                <p>Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida has shared his thoughts on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, saying Nintendo is "losing their identity" with the console due to its lack of new and exciting features. Appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTzHlC_vrE&amp;ab_channel=EasyAllies">Easy Allies podcast</a>, Yoshida said, "I have to be polite," adding, "To me it was a bit [of a] mixed message from Nintendo. In a sense I think Nintendo is losing their identity, in my opinion."</p><p>Yoshida, in his decades of experience working in the video game industry, said he observed over the years that Nintendo always stood out by creating some kind of "new experience" that no one saw coming.</p><p>"But Switch 2, as we all anticipated, is a better Switch, right? It's a larger screen, more powerful processor, higher resolution, 4K 120fps. They even had their hardware person starting the stream as other platforms do," he said. "And because it's a better Switch, the core premise of the whole Switch 2 is, 'We made things better.' And that's something other companies have been doing all the time."</p><p>Yoshida did, however, praise Nintendo for the Switch 2's new mouse controls, saying the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/drag-x-drive/" data-ref-id="5000-671279">Drag X Drive</a> game is "very Nintendo." But overall, Yoshida said he was "a bit disappointed" with the Switch 2 and the response from fans. People were not generally disappointed, Yoshida observed, and this suggests that all people really wanted was a "better Switch."</p><p>The Switch is the No. 2 best-selling console ever, with more than 150 million units sold. </p><p>When the Switch 2 was unveiled in January, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-was-surprising-due-to-lack-of-surprises-says-former-playstation-boss/1100-6529203/" data-ref-id="1100-6529203">Yoshida said he was surprised by the console's lack of surprises</a>, so hearing him double down on that line of thinking makes sense.</p><p>For what it's worth, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-what-the-switch-2-could-have-been-called/1100-6530565/" data-ref-id="1100-6530565">maintained from the onset</a> that the Switch 2 is "a new system with improved performance." The company said the aim is that it becomes "the new standard for Nintendo Switch," which is why the company named it Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>The Switch 2's development director, Takuhiro Dohta, went on to say that the Switch 2 is not aimed at people who prefer "high-performance hardware," but instead its ambition is to be a product that can appeal to the widest possible audience. "So, we wanted a name that would communicate simply to potential customers that, if you're considering buying a Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 is the newest system," Dohta said.</p><p>Another Switch 2 designer, Tetsuya Sasaki, said the name "Switch 2" is "simple and easy to understand." Sasaki added that it was always the plan for the system to be a "proper successor to Switch," so keeping the same name made sense.</p><p>Yoshida left PlayStation in early 2025 after 30 years with the company. Since leaving Sony he's been very outspoken in interviews, freely speaking his mind on a range of topics.</p><p>Yoshida also made headlines recently for saying he would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-he-would-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push/1100-6528881/" data-ref-id="1100-6528881">"resisted" Sony's push into live-service games</a> and that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-on-the-one-playstation-game-he-was-surprised-didnt-sell-like-he-thought-it-would/1100-6528860/" data-ref-id="1100-6528860">surprised Horizon Forbidden West didn't sell as well as expected.</a> Yoshida also talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">why there hasn't been a Bloodborne remaster yet.</a></p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5. Nintendo announced a $450 price point for the console, but some fear Nintendo may <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">raise the price due to Trump's tariffs</a>. Other experts believe <a href="https://nikopartners.com/nikos-opinion-on-tariffs-video-games-and-us-china-trade/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo will not.</a></p>

                <p>Bungie finally lifted the lid on its extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/">Marathon</a> this week, and while the game looks like a vibrant entry in the genre, it has been negatively compared to Sony's live-service flop Concord. Both games share similar elements, being live-service sci-fi shooters with a colorful art direction, but one former Concord developer wants people to not only give Bungie's project a chance when it launches later this year, but to also show some compassion for the people working on it.</p><p>"After reading the comments about Marathon being Concord 2.0 on Reddit, YouTube, and Twitch, I just wanted to share a little insight into what a 40-year-old man is feeling after dedicating a large portion of his life to making videogames," former Firewalk Studios senior VFX artist Stephan Williams wrote on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon/comments/1jyr8dm/former_firewalkconcord_dev_talks_marathon/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marathon subreddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.vg247.com/marathon-concord-comparisons-ex-firewalk-dev-weighs-in" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VG247</a>). "Seeing the faces of the developers on the Bungie stream gave me hope and excitement for what is to come for Marathon," Williams added. "I commend them for taking a chance, trying something foreign to them, that isn't proven, nor guaranteed to succeed. It takes a lot of courage."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8eLy_C5lOM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e8eLy_C5lOM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Williams explained that while Concord "failed to inspire players," there were lessons to be learned from that "gut-wrenching" failure. Now a senior VFX artist at Warframe studio Digital Extremes, Williams stressed that video games are meant to be fun and that people need to be kinder to the developers working on them behind the scenes.</p><p>After its big livestream, Bungie revealed quite a few details on Marathon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-releases-in-september-on-same-day-as-another-big-game/1100-6530810/">from its September 23 release date</a> to a closer look at the maps players will battle each other on as they hunt down some loot. The big question surrounding the game for now is its price, as while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-wont-be-full-price-though-bungie-says-it-will-be-a-premium-title/1100-6530835/">Bungie says that Marathon won't be a full-priced game</a>, it is promising a "premium" experience. If you're one of the people who'd like to give it a chance, you can try your luck at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-closed-alpha-begins-in-april-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6530808/">snagging a key to join the game's closed alpha playtest</a> later this month.</p><p>"Marathon could launch as a solid multiplayer shooter that is brimming with potential but thin on content. And in the dog-eat-dog world of multiplayer games, that could be a major issue," Tamoor Hussain wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">GameSpot's hands-on preview of Marathon</a></p>
