            <p>Brace yourself, Half-Life fans – rumours of Half-Life 3 have been resurrected once again, this time originating from the unassuming resume of a voice actor.</p>
<p>There's a chance that by the time you read this,  Natasha Chandel's <a href="https://www.natashachandel.com/resume/">website</a> has already been, uh, revised, but right now, if you scroll down to the "voice over" section, you'll see reference "Project White Sands (video game)".</p>
<p>Chandel did not name the character(s) she provided voice work for, but the project is clearly marked as belonging to Valve.</p>

<p>Is this all-out proof? Nope. Sorry.

<p>Court documents recently revealed detailed employment statistics for Valve, the company behind the ubiquitous PC storefront Steam, the Steam Deck handheld, and - yes, still - a team dedicated to game development.</p>
<p>Altogether, that's just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-is-massive-but-far-fewer-people-work-at-valve-than-you-might-think">371 people employed by Valve in 2021</a>, for a company believed to bring in around $6.5bn a year. EA, home to FIFA/FC, which also generates around $6.5bn annually, had 13,700 staff on the payroll this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Images of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 have leaked online, including multiplayer maps, menu screens, and perks.</p>
<p>Within hours, the screenshots were hit with copyright claims from Activision, adding credence to the claims they come from an in-development build. However, this is the internet, which means nothing's ever truly gone, and the images are still going up faster than Activision can remove them.</p>

<p>According to the leaker – who distributed the images via a throwaway Twitter/X account – they were unable to secure images or information about the single-player campaign or Black Ops 6's  zombies mode.</p>
<p>Other images hint at a reworked UI and menu system, although it's possible the menus only look that way because it's an in-development build.</p> <div>

		<p>This morning is yet another where we have woken up to the news that the far right continues to riot across the UK, and it is anxiety inducing. For the first time in my 35 years of life, I feel, like many other, unsettled in the country we call home. Disinformation, dishonesty, and dishonourable acts have led to the violent disorder perpetrated by a loud, violent, minority, and it is time that there is a reckoning against all of this.</p>
<p>Growing up, I was told by my family members who were born here in the 60s and 70s, of the violence they faced due to groups such as the National Front, and after decades of hard work to stamp this prejudice out and make our society more equal and equitable, it seems that we are sliding back to those dark times. To see the reports of the far-right and – let’s not beat around the bush here – of racists co-opting a tragedy as an excuse to attack anyone who is not white is disgusting and rage inducing. But we did not get here in a vacuum.</p>
<p>For years, we have seen traditional media, social media, and algorithm-led platforms pushing far-right figures to the fore on a regular basis. This is despite warnings from individuals and groups that doing so emboldens these figures and spreads their message. Challenging them in the social media space does not work, especially if some of those spaces are owned by those that agree with such views. I point to the traditional media groups, both broadcast and newspapers, that have have barely challenged far right talking points, and instead used them to validate their own messages instead. We have seen headlines from the likes of the Daily Mail and The Sun constantly attack those from non-white and non-Christian backgrounds, fuelling hate.&nbsp; Even the likes of the BBC have not helped in this matter, platforming Nigel Farage a record 32 times on Question Time under the pretence of providing balanced opinions, while ITV featured him in I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!, which might have made him seem more affable to some.</p>
<p>All of this has led to massive changes to our society, most significantly propelling us toward Brexit, and now in the most recent General Election, to Reform snatching 14% of the vote, and attracting members of the far-right to it in the process. Even now, reporting on the riots is still being framed as protest across the media landscape, conflating legitimate protest with actual violent disorder and thuggery. Every single reporter and editor in our media should have a frank and open discussion on how they report on issues that affect people from minority backgrounds, and how their reporting over the years has fuelled what has now happened, instead of acting surprised at the result. Will it happen? That is unlikely.</p>
<p>Our politicians have not helped either. Over the last 14 years, all we have really had is culture wars and divisive politics. Asylum seekers have been othered by the very highest of offices, and now are under violent attack. What is worse is a lot of this rhetoric has come from people who are from minority backgrounds, pandering to the far right for a grip on power. They think that moving even further right will get them in the top jobs again. The reality is that once the far right is done with them, they will be discarded and grouped in with the rest of us as an other. Social media is also to blame, allowing constant disinformation to spread faster than the truth and featuring algorithms that push far-right content. On my own Facebook feed I am constantly shown posts from such groups even though I am not a member of any of them, nor do I want to see them. Social media companies need to be held to account and disinformation needs to be stamped out at the source.</p>

<p>Reversing this trend will take a huge amount of effort, and our education system has a large role tackling the narrative that people from minority backgrounds are only recent arrivals to this country or that they are not British. The British Empire lasted hundreds of years and saw people from all over move across it. The first Indian MP elected to the UK Parliament was Dadabhai Naoroji in 1892, something that is not taught in schools. Britain has been quick to show pride that it was the leader in abolishing slavery, while not giving credence to folks like Ottobah Cugoano, Mary Prince, Olaudah Equiano, and Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, all of whom are Black Britons that lived during the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. Our education system skips over Empire, ignoring the hard truths that at one stage in this country’s history there was a huge dark period that saw millions suffer, while a few benefited.</p>
<p>We have to remember that the far-right is loud and often violent, but it is a minority. That lesson needs to especially be learned by those that platform them regularly. Even though they are a minority, the far right has to be guarded against and pushed back against over the long term. This morning I signed up as a member to <a href="https://www.rota.org.uk/">ROTA – Race on the Agenda</a> and<a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/blogs/campaigns-blog/anti-racism-network"> Amnesty International Anti Racism Network</a>, to better educate myself and to get involved in ways to counter the racism that perpetuates across our society. I would ask that, if you are tired of racism rearing its head again and again, you do the same.</p>
<p>A final thing in case any disinformation is spread by the far-right about me. My family settled in the UK 70 years ago. I was born and raised here. I work full time. I come from a Punjabi Sikh background. I am British.</p>

			<p>Sony Santa Monica, the studio known mainly for the God of War franchise, might be working on a brand new IP. Fans have been speculating as much for a while, given that Cory Barlog <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-cory-barlog-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> his desire to create a new franchise after he successfully directed the enormously successful God of War reboot. At the time, Barlog stressed he'd need to convince Sony first, but a LinkedIn resume of a Sony Santa Monica Character Supervisor (<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/according-to-a-developer-at-santa-monica-studio-the-studios-next-game-is-a-new-ip.943911/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> on the ResetEra board) suggests he succeeded in his endeavor.</p>
<p>This developer worked on both God of War and God of War Ragnarok before leaving to join Striking Distance Studios to make The Callisto Protocol. Next, they worked for Unknown Worlds on an upcoming installment in the Subnautica franchise before coming back to SSM:</p>
<p><em>Santa Monica Studios presented the opportunity of coming back as Character Supervisor, looking after the entire Character Development pipeline on their new IP, so here I am, thrilled to be back, working again with the crew and pushing Characters in videogames together.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Cory Barlog did <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-not-directed-cory-barlog-atreus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not</a> direct the most recent God of War entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ragnarok</a>, which launched in October 2022 to critical and commercial acclaim. Barlog only worked on it as a producer, so he might have already been cooking something else. As such, the new intellectual property might not be too far away from being revealed.</p>
<p>It's anyone's guess at this point what that might be about, though rumors suggest it might be set in a sci-fi setting. Whatever they're making, fans will surely be eager to learn more, given Sony Santa Monica's excellent pedigree. We'll keep you abreast of any further rumors and/or official news as they appear.</p>
<p>By the way, God of War fans should not fret: the Californian studio surely is not abandoning its prized IP. On the contrary, they appear to have set up separate teams to handle two franchises at once.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nzxt-function-2-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nzxt-function-2-review-fast-full-sized-and-formidable.944271/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nzxt-function-2-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>NZXT perhaps isn’t the most common name you’ll see in the PC peripherals market. It has a fantastic reputation for PC cases, components, and hardware, but did you also know it has a solid lineup of gaming accessories that range from audio equipment to keyboards? I do now – and I recently had the opportunity to trial the pinnacle of NZXT’s keyboard range.</p>



<p>As I put together my NZXT Function 2 review, I found myself falling in love with this relatively unassuming but ultimately very powerful and capable keyboard. Read on to get the full scope of this mid-range, full-sized, and versatile Function 2 keyboard.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-light-touch-heavy-potential">Light Touch, Heavy Potential</h2>



<p>The NZXT Function 2 is an attractive enough keyboard at first blush, particularly in white, but when you plug it in, it comes to life. The RGB that runs under the ‘lightning fast’ keys and switches is bright and customisable with the NZXT CAM software, which is brilliant for a gamer with a penchant for <strong>pretty lights</strong>.</p>



<p>On the topic of those lightning-fast keys, NZXT has done brilliantly integrating proprietary optical switches with a linear motion into the Function 2. They’re some of the lightest keys I’ve ever used – but they are adjustable, if you prefer something a little heavier. They’re also hot-swappable, and in the box, you’ll find some extra switches that you can use to test-run something different. </p>



<p>I’ve found that on <strong>some </strong>rare occasions, I’ll press a key and it’s such a light touch that it’ll register the input more than once, but it’s not an issue for me.</p>



<p>This keyboard feels blissful to type with – I’m using it now to write this NZXT Function 2 review. It’s relatively quiet, the doubleshot PBT keycaps feel nice to the touch, and the massive 8,000 Hz polling rate means that inputs are so sharp and reliable.</p>



<h2 id="h-feeling-practical">Feeling Practical</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s function by name and functional by nature. On the Function 2, everything I look for in a keyboard is present, even if some of the location choices are a little strange. For instance, there’s a Windows lock key, a mute button, and the RGB control button all located on the left-hand side of the keyboard, and I find that I keep accidentally pressing them when I’m moving the keyboard around to get comfortable.</p>



<p>This is also where the volume roller is, and while it feels nice and responsive, I’m used to it being in the top-right of the keyboard, which is where most competing products tend to have it located. Instead, the top-right of the board is simply home to the status lights and an NZXT flash. There are also media controls located on shared keys, taking up spots on the PrtSc, ScrLk, and Pause keys.</p>



<p>One of the biggest wins with the NZXT Function 2 is the wrist rest that comes with it. It connects to the keyboard via a couple of magnets, and instead of being cushioned, it’s topped with a harder-wearing, grippy rubber surface. It feels much more durable than the faux leather and plastic wrist rest you tend to get with Razer keyboards, for example.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-nzxt-function-2-good">Is The NZXT Function 2 Good?</h2>



<p>It’s great – I love using mine for working rather than playing because I prefer a TKL keyboard, but this is still a solid device for those with a little more space to play. It’s flawless for typing on, which matters to me, and the RGB and style of the keyboard are nice, but I don’t think I’d price it quite as high as it’s on the market for. </p>



<p>Presently, you’ll need to pay around £139.99 to <a href="https://nzxt.com/en-GB/product/function-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">secure an NZXT Function 2</a>. That does make it more affordable than the Razer Deathstalker or Huntsman, the Logitech G815 or the G713, or the SteelSeries Apex Pro, among many others, so that’s an advantage.</p>



<p>My opinion? If you can secure it in a sale, it’s well worth buying – but if you don’t mind paying the premium price, then there’s no reason why I couldn’t recommend it <strong>now</strong>.  </p>

            <p>Humble Games' last release before the studio was "restructured" last week, Bõ: Path of the Teal Lotus, has launched a Patreon to support the game "in these uncertain times".</p>
<p>Writing on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, developer Squid Shock said that whilst it did not fault the team's work, Humble's changes "have meant we have missed out on critical post-launch support, which may put our studio's future at risk".</p>

<p>Although Humble has disputed the statements of former staff that characterised the layoffs as a shutdown, instead insisting laying off its staff is merely a "restructuring", Squid Shock also describes the changes as "shutting down".</p>
<p>Squid Shock also revealed that within hours of Humble's news breaking, it "lost access to the pipeline of critical systems without warning". Whilst it still manages the game on Steam and was able to push out a patch, "the same can’t be said for consoles".</p>
<p>"At the time of writing we still do not have that pipeline restored," the team admitted.</p>
<p>"It has been a hectic two weeks since we launched our first game Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus. We are delighted with the overall reception Bo has had, and we’re already responding to player feedback to further improve the experience," the team said.</p> <div>

<p>"Despite this, our launch was not without its challenges, our publisher shutting down has meant we have missed out on critical post-launch support which may put our studio’s future at risk. We want to make it crystal clear that this was in no way the fault of the Humble Games team we worked with. It is just a sad time in the industry and ultimately, we understand," the statement continued.</p>
<p>It confirmed that it was currently taking "steps" to restore access to its console editions, and as it began as a "community endeavour", it was turning to its community again to help secure its future via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/squidshock">Patreon</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-confirms-restructuring-amid-reports-all-staff-have-been-laid-off">several Humble Games employees took to social media with reports of layoffs</a> at Humble Games.</p>
<p>"At 9AM this morning," business development manager Nicola Kwan wrote in a post on LinkedIn, "36 employees of Humble Games were told that we were being let go and that the company is shutting down".</p>
<p>In response to those initial claims, a Humble Games spokesperson later confirmed "restructuring" at the company, but insisted it was "not shutting down". Former employees, however, intimate otherwise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
