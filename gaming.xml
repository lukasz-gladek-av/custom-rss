            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/19/the-final-splatoon-3-splatfest-takes-place-in-september-and-it-could-have-big-implications/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has announced the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> Grand Festival, a final Splatfest for their ink-splatting online shooter that will take place in September and run for an extended 72-hour period.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splatoon 3 – Grand Festival is coming! (Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TAZohLilNjM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Beginning on 13th September and running for three straight days:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start date &amp; time</strong> – Friday 13th September 1AM UK time</li>
<li><strong>End date &amp; time</strong> – Monday 16th September 00:59AM UK time</li>
</ul>
<p>The Grand Festival is the biggest ever Splatfest that the series has featured, and from the announcement trailer, it absolutely leans into that with a grand music festival taking place with all the music acts from the series to date dancing and singing on stage to a huge crowd.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s really all about the battling, and the three-way question that the Grand Festival will ask is: What is the most important to you? Past, Present or Future?</p>

<p>In a twist to the usual Splatfest questions, it’s the idol groups that will represent the three themes. The past is the Squid Sisters, the present is Off the Hook, and the future is Deep Cut.</p>
<p>The deep suspicion is that, as with the final Splatfest for Splatoon 2, the community-driven answer to this question will determine the future of the series. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/09/splatoon-2-final-splatfest-july-order-chaos/">Splatoon 2’s finale asked players to choose between order and chaos</a>, and with chaos winning, Splatoon 3 moved the story to a rather desolate new location of Splatsville, AKA the “City of Chaos”. If past or future win, we could see a potential Splatoon 4 go in some really wild new directions.</p>
<p>To mark the moment, Nintendo is also releasing <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1814212474263994518">two new sets of Splatoon amiibo</a> on 5th September: the Side Order Set featuring Pearl &amp; Marina, and the Alterna Set with recoloured Callie &amp; Marie.</p>
<p>It will be bittersweet to say goodbye to these regular events for the Splatoon community, and I admittedly regret not playing enough of the game in the past couple years, as good as the game is.&nbsp;For our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/07/splatoon-3-review/">Splatoon 3 review</a>, I wrote: “Splatoon 3 is a bit like your mum making your favourite meal when you head home for the holidays. It’s been a few years since the last game —&nbsp;while there have been some great improvements and additions, it’s the same old Splatoon we know and love, and that’s still pretty great.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/honkai-star-rail-version-2-4-release-date-and-new-content-revealed.931878/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-24-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.4 release date, along with some of the new content that's coming your way when the turn-based gacha RPG's latest update drops.</p>
<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-23-release-date">June's Version 2.3</a>, Version 2.4 arrives on July 31st, bringing with it a new map in the form of The Shackling Prison, along with the chance to recruit two new five-star characters into your team.</p>
<p>The Shackling Prison is a "formidable facility" whose entrance lies hidden beneath the water's surface. It's where Xueyi and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-reveals-new-playable-character-hanya">Hanya</a> carry out their duties, and it's also the home of many of the realm's most notorious criminals, not to mention wolflike monsters known as the Borisin.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.4-release-date-the-shackling-prison.jpg?itok=m-B9shGl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-2.4-release-date-the-shackling-prison.jpg?itok=OnygzUoH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Shackling Prison is home to some of&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>'s most notorious criminals, and you'll get to explore it in Version 2.4.</figcaption></figure><p>Two new characters are also making their debut in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.4, and they're both five-star characters, too.</p>
<p>First up is Yunli, a Physical-type swordswoman who follows the Path of Destruction. Her Counter ability allows her to deal damage to enemies when she's attacked, and she also gains access to a Parry state after using her ultimate, taunting enemies and reducing the damage she takes.</p>
<p>The second new character in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.4 is Jiaoqiu, a Fire-type foxian healer following the Path of Nihility. His attacks have a chance to burn enemies, and his ultimate exacerbates the effects of his regular attacks' burn.</p>
<p>These characters will debut during this Version, alongside reruns for five-star characters <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-five-star-character-huohuo">Huohuo</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-character-sparkle-and-she-goes-from-cute-to-crazy">Sparkle</a>.</p>

<p>HoYoverse has also announced a collaboration with the anime&nbsp;<em>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works</em>, which is due to debut some time in the third quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>Sadly, we don't know the details of that collaboration yet, but HoYoverse says more will be revealed in the coming weeks, so watch this space.</p>
<p>In the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.4 arrives on July 31st across <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

Additionally, only single-player functionality is part of this offer, meaning co-op isn't available. An online connection is a requirement, as well.</p>

                <p>Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is set for release in 2025, and given how massive the game's launch is expected to be, many are wondering how it could affect titles from competing companies. Ubisoft, for its part, has said it's looking forward to GTA VI's release because when a game as big as GTA VI comes out, it helps the market overall.</p><p>"What we see, generally, when GTA is coming, is that more people come to play. So generally it's positive on the overall market," CEO Yves Guillemot <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/atyzrozr/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said during Ubisoft's latest earnings call</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Guillemot went on to say that historical trends for Ubisoft's business bear this out. He said Ubisoft's games enjoyed "very good sales" around the time that GTA V came out in 2013, while its titles also performed well when the GTA V re-release for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S launched in March 2022.</p><p>"It is something that is counter-intuitive but is working for us in general," Guillemot said.</p><p>The company went on to say that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/" data-ref-id="5000-172624">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a>, which was released a month after GTA V in 2013, enjoyed record sales for the series at the time. Ubisoft's overall philosophy is to focus on delivering high-quality game experiences even when the competition is strong, the company said.</p><p>Ubisoft has not, however, announced its full game release pipeline for 2025, so it's too soon to say what Ubisoft game might be competing with GTA VI. The game is set for release during Fall 2025, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">every Rockstar game in the past decade has been delayed</a> so there is a chance this happens again with GTA VI.</p>

		<p>Mr. Blue Sky is out and about as we head into the weekend, so I’ve got fans pushing air around to try and keep the house cool enough to consider making more heat with consoles and PC gaming. Thankfully I’m not playing the most graphically intensive games, continuing on with SteamWorld Heist 2 and dabbling with a few other things that you’ll hear about soon…</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> reported in first to say that he’s played a pretty smorgasbord of The Lord of the Rings The Third Age, Neverwinter Nights 2, Mount and Blade: Bannerlord, and The Last of Us Part 2. That’s a lot of fantasy and gritty battling!</p>

<p>Even more varied and in very different ways was <strong>Aran’s</strong> week, which featured a preview for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/ea-sports-fc-25-preview-what-a-rush/">EA Sports FC 25</a>, which is “more of the same, but Rush is fantastic”, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/tmnt-splintered-fate-review-nintendo-switch/">TMNT: Splintered Fate</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/19/rack-and-slay-review/">Rack and Slay</a> for review – a decent Hades clone and a billiards-bashing roguelike respectively. For his own enjoyment, he bored himself with The Turing Test, continued picking up collectibles in AC Mirage, and has started to replay&nbsp;Enslaved Odyssey to The West, “which is just as good as I remember.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> beat Skyrim for the very first time, after more than a decade of varying attempts, but he’s tempted to go back in to complete some of the side quests. That’s bumped Cyberpunk 2077 to the top of his playlist, where he’s kept chipping away at the story, and in search of something different to play on Steam Deck, he’s started Dragon Quest XI and is eyeing up Fallout: New Vegas.</p>


<p>It was the “excellent but traumatic” Conscript for <strong>Steve</strong>, a survival horror game where surviving is just as horrific as not. He countered that with the review of the bitesized speedrunning delights of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/nintendo-world-championship-nes-edition-review/">Nintendo World Championship: NES Edition</a>. He also had his Retroid Pocket out to play the “underrated” Breath of Fire series, and is preparing to play Flintlock off Game Pass.</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2, of course, but he’s also been reviewing Thank Goodness You’re Here!, which you’ll hear more about later this month, and stomping deeper into RoboCop: Rogue City – “It’s <em>exactly</em> what a RoboCop game should be like. It’s slow, clunky, and plays like something from the 80’s, but also makes you feel like RoboCop with his thundering pistol that literally minces punks.”</p>

<p><strong>Reu</strong> has been rampaging through everything that Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail to wrap up our review of the game, which you’ll get to see very soon, and we’ll rounding things out with <strong>Dom</strong> for this week. He’s been a busy little bee jumping between shadows for our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/15/schim-review/">SCHiM</a> review, as well as working towards reviews of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, which he’s been playing quite “merrily” and Hot Lap Racing.</p>
<p>And with that, what have you been playing this week?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-45-parabellum-bloodhound-trailer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-45-parabellum-bloodhound-trailer-shows-off-va-11-hall-a-devs-new-game.931836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-45-parabellum-bloodhound-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>VA-11 Hall-A&nbsp;</em>developer Sukeban Games has released the debut trailer for its newest project&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound</em>, and it looks exactly as strange and wonderful as you'd expect.</p>
<p><em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound&nbsp;</em>was first unveiled by Sukeban Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/45-parabellum-bloodhound-sukeban-games">earlier this month</a>, with the developer unveiling the project alongside a host of GIFs and images showing off its aesthetic.</p>
<p>Now, however, the first trailer for the game has been revealed, giving us a glimpse of a game that looks like it's inspired not only by Square Enix's classic survival horror-RPG&nbsp;<em>Parasite Eve</em>, but also by Suda51's cult hit&nbsp;<em>Killer7</em>.</p>

<p>We also get to see a glimpse of the combat, which, in keeping with the game's "Active Time Action" tagline, seems heavily inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Parasite Eve&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Vagrant Story</em>.</p>
<p>It's all soundtracked by music that put me in mind of the likes of&nbsp;<em>El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron</em>, or perhaps the work of&nbsp;<em>NieR</em>'s Keiichi Okabe. In short, this is one you're going to want to play if, like me, you're unashamedly and constantly drowning in PS1 nostalgia.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the&nbsp;debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound&nbsp;</em>below. If it doesn't make you want to play the game, just watch it again until it does!</p>

<p>Sadly, we don't have any kind of release date or window for&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound</em>; back when it was announced, Sukeban said it would be finished when it was ready, so it might be a while before we get to play this one.</p>
<p>It's also the project on which Sukeban has chosen to focus its energies, which means that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/n1rv-ann-release-date-delayed-indefinitely"><em>N1RV Ann-A&nbsp;</em>release date you've been waiting for</a> is probably not going to materialize anytime soon, either.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/flintlock-siege-of-dawn-review">Edwin’s been appreciating</a> the acrobatic twist that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn">Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</a> puts on the Soulslite formula, but not everybody’s magical zip-zooping has been going as smoothly. Following the Steam and PC Game Pass releases yesterday, there are widespread reports of heavy stuttering spoiling the fun; I’ve given both versions a test, and indeed, Flintlock does have a serious case of the framerate stammers. Especially the Game Pass build, which is <em>significantly</em> worse for it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Steam version sees occasional hitching, usually when you and your god-fox mate enter a new area for the first time. Classic shader compilation stutter, looks like. On Game Pass, though, performance can also hiccup on attacks, dodges, and double-jumps, more keenly impacting the game’s flow. That’s all on an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review">RTX 4060</a> with the game running at 1080p, by the by, so well above Flintlock’s recommended settings.</p>
<p>What’s to be done? A <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1832040/discussions/0/4518882879955578724/">pinned thread</a> on the game’s Steam forums suggest any of three remedies: disabling Nvidia Reflex, updating your graphics drivers, and "selecting different Super Sampling options", these being upscalers like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/confirmed-ray-tracing-and-dlss-games">DLSS</a>. The latter will raise average framerates versus native-rez rendering, which might at least hide the stutters a bit better, though I was playing on the very latest GeForce drivers and was still stuttering on an all-too-regular basis. Of the three fixes, the one I had the most unqualified success with was disabling Nvidia Reflex, meaning Flintlock gets to join <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a> in the Games That Allow Input Latency Reducers To Hurt Performance Somehow club. Hopefully the former can find a fix <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/latest-horizon-forbidden-west-pc-patch-finally-fixes-its-weirdest-issue">like the latter did</a>.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/20240716150122_1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kepler Interactive / Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Also – and this is just from my own testing on a single GPU, so your results may vary – I found that reducing Shadow Quality can both soothe the stuttering and deliver a huge boost to performance in general. Starting with Ultra quality, my PC was averaging 55-60fps in most areas, which lept to a mostly wobble-free 90-100fps with shadows on Medium. Consider giving that a go, before cutting back on upscaling quality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not a new problem, even for Flintlock specifically – the action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>’s June demo was prone to shuddering as well. And as for why the Game Pass version performs worse than Steam’s, this is at least partly explained by the fact that they are literally different versions, owing to Microsoft’s policy of forcing all games available on the Xbox app to go through their own certification process. This can hold up performance patches, and in extreme cases even lead to PC games lacking entire features in their Game Pass build – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> being a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-update-fixes-blackscreen-and-controller-bugs-but-multiplayer-issues-persist-on-game-pass">recent, though no less silly, example</a>.</p>

The show’s second season premiered on Paramount+ earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to <em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-2-seasons-1235952581/">The Hollywood Reporter</a></em>’s sources, <em>Halo</em> showrunners Amblin, Xbox, and 343 Industries are seeking a new outlet for a potential third season, with Paramount reportedly supporting the move.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Paramount+ can confirm that ‘Halo’ will not move forward with a third season on the service,” Paramount said in a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.”</p>

<p>After years of development, <em>Halo</em> premiered on Paramount+ on March 24, 2022, and stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief. Season 1 received a mixed reception from critics and fans, with many lambasting it for deviating from the games’ established lore and characterizations. Season 2, which premiered earlier this year on February 8 and concluded on March 21, was received more positively, with several critics and viewers hailing it as a dramatic improvement. Season 1 currently sits at 70% on Rotten Tomatoes/61 on Metacritic. Season 2 garnered a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes/64 on Metacritic.&nbsp;</p>

Instead, they’ve served primarily as support characters for the male narrative. So Sabrina’s episode is the one I’ve been waiting for, as it brings her superpowered struggles into the spotlight. And it turns out she does what many of us would do, especially as a healthcare worker—she consults a physician to check on her brain.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h126095"><a id=""></a>A powerful narrative for Sabrina—almost</h2><p>Sabrina’s powers—being able to push and move objects, or telekinetic abilities— often manifest in anger. While the narrative of Black women being socially unable to express anger is an important one to explore in a superhero narrative, it’s frustrating to see that Sabrina’s powers and related anxiety also make her careless and spaced out. It’s annoying to see that trope as a big part of the powers and the narrative of the only main non-male character.</p><h2 id="h126096"><a id=""></a>Dionne: Not in charge of her own destiny</h2><p>The episode also centers women more as it follows Dionne (Adelayo Adedayo) on her workday, away from Michael (Tosin Cole). In her role as a social worker, Dionne connects more threads between superhuman people as she discovers information about a missing woman who wasn’t acting human.<br></p><p>However, as Dionne continues her investigation and fills Michael in, he dismisses her and argues with her for being involved, all while refusing to fill her in on the real reason for his concern and anger: that he’s seen her gravestone. He refuses to give Dionne agency in her own survival, and that makes our golden boy superhero entirely less appealing. It’s hard to root for him if you’re viewing the show through a feminist lens.</p><h2 id="h126097"><a id=""></a>Cliffhanger resolved</h2><p>The second episode, which focused on Tazer (Josh Tedeku), ended on a cliffhanger with an imminent threat of violence. The third episode shows the resolution of this scene, with a maze of surprises. This makes the story feel more connected and less episodic, which is increasingly important as Michael uses his time-traveling powers more often. The tighter narrative allows Michael’s disorienting and disruptive powers to enhance the story rather than make it more confusing.</p><h2 id="h126098"><a id=""></a>Acceleration and more “random” encounters</h2><p>Michael’s powers also accelerate the narrative of the story, and we experience his confusion whenever he tries to figure out how far ahead he’s jumped. </p><p>As the show goes on, we see the characters have near-misses with each other, then interact more and more directly each episode. In episode 2, we see Andre (Eric Kofi Abrefa) assist Sabrina in an absent-minded moment that could have been fatal. These increasingly tighter connections show how interwoven the characters’ survival, safety—and possibly powers—may be.<br></p><p>Additionally, the increased presence of villain Krazy (Ghetts) moves Sabrina into protective mode, and makes the overall level of violence escalate. The villain exists to further tie the characters’ stories together.<br></p><h2 id="h126099"><a id=""></a>Lack of control: powers at will</h2><p>One theme <em>Supacell </em>has explored since the first episode is the characters’ agency over their powers. Some characters, in some instances, can control their powers at will. Other times, those powers seem to work randomly, when they’re near another character more, or as the result of an emotional reaction.</p><p>This lack of control or agency in using the powers they’re given reflects the racial and socio-economic concerns all of the characters discussed in the first episode. In this way, show creator and executive producer Rapman makes a powerful statement about stratification in England and in general.</p><h2 id="h126100"><a id=""></a>Sickle cell comes back into focus</h2><p>After the sickle cell plot thread disappeared in episode two, it returns in this installment. Michael again assists his mother at the sickle cell clinic, and Andre speaks with his son AJ (Ky-Mani Carty) about the disease as well. This again draws the connection between the name of the show and the disease, which primarily affects Black people, as AJ points out.</p><p>This confirms the connection between the characters as being genetic, though the show name also reinforces how the characters need to rely on each other for their survival, a message about Black community. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-1896-gets-esrb-rating-possibly-for-next-gen-upgrade/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-1896-gets-esrb-rating-possibly-for-next-gen-upgrade/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>On the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39965/hunt-showdown-1896/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB website</a>, Hunt: Showdown 1896 from Crytek now has an official M Rating for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series platforms.</p>



<p>The rating describes Hunt: Showdown 1896 as “a first-person monster hunting game set in a fantastical version of the Victorian era.” </p>



<p>The ESRB update is likely referring to the impending <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-ps4-xbox-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free update to Hunt: Showdown</a>, rather than a new sequel title. In a <a href="https://press.crytek.com/hunt-showdown-reveals-upgrade-coming-15th-august-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, Crytek previously announced the upgrade is coming August 15, 2024.</p>



<p>This timeline would line up with the new ESRB rating, despite the “1896” addition to the title. But it does imply the next-gen update still appears to be on schedule. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Crytek originally launched Hunt: Showdown in August 2019, an open world shooter that earned ‘Very Positive’ Steam reviews early on. It seemed to be part of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/age-of-the-extraction-shooter-approaching/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surge of extraction-style shooters</a>, with over a dozen under way.</p>



<p>Following the next-gen update, Hunt: Showdown will not operate on the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One. Crytek confirmed the update will offer a “new map, CRYENGINE version 5.11, performance improvements,” a new UX design, and more.</p>



<p>Most recently, Crytek released From the Wilds DLC for Hunt: Showdown on June 27, 2024. The DLC still has ‘Mostly Negative’ reviews from fans, though likely due to widespread reports of technical issues. It added new Hunter variations, weapons, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-grand-festival<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>Grand Festival, a three-day event that's set to be the online shooter's "biggest Splatfest yet". It could also mark the final major event for&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3</em>, if&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 2&nbsp;</em>is anything to go by.</p>
<p>As with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-pokemon-splatfest-kicks-off-next-month">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>Splatfest <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-zelda-splatfest-ink-coming-ahead-of-tears-of-kingdom-launch">events</a>, the Grand Festival will ask you to choose between one of three teams and to duke it out with the others to decide which team is superior. In this case, you're choosing between Past, Present, and Future.</p>
<p>This time around, however, there's a little twist: the teams are represented by some of&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em>'s most iconic characters in the form of the Squid Sisters, Deep Cut, and Off the Hook.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splatoon-3-grand-festival-splatfest-past-present-future.jpeg?itok=yyt-B1fc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splatoon-3-grand-festival-splatfest-past-present-future.jpeg?itok=7pbXjXKv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Get ready to choose your side in the new&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>Splatfest.</figcaption></figure><p>While Nintendo certainly hasn't given any indication that this will be the final&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>event, past form might lead us to believe that it could be.</p>
<p><em>Splatoon 2&nbsp;</em>was released in July 2017, and its final Splatfest (barring a few reruns of older Splatfest events) took place in July 2019.</p>
<p>The timing doesn't quite line up as well for&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3</em>, since the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-release-date-revealed-for-september">released in September 2022</a>, but this 72-hour event is landing almost two years after&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3</em>'s release, so it could be the game's last big hurrah.</p>
<p>Of course, Nintendo hasn't made any kind of official announcement on this front, so it could also just be a big Splatfest event to celebrate the summer. We'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p><em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>is, as you might surmise from its title, the third game in the&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>series of multiplayer-focused third-person shooters.</p>
<p>The game continues the franchise's emphasis on territory control via covering ground with your team's color rather than focusing on kills, and it's also got an expanded single-player campaign and a brand new hub to explore.</p>
<p>Two major DLC packs have been released for&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3</em>. The first reintroduces the Inkopolis Plaza hub from the original&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em>, while the second, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-side-order-dlc-release-date"><em>Side Order</em></a>, adds a roguelite-style tower-climbing campaign.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/splatoon-3-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right now on Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/splatoon-3-review-nintendo-online-multiplayer-at-its-best">take a look at our review here</a> to find out whether you're ink-terested.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo has announced a new Pikmin game, but no - it's not Pikmin 5. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Japanese Pikmin fans can enjoy Pikmin Counting, a web-based edutainment game where you count from 1 to 100 using Nintendo's colourful garden characters. (It's primarily designed for young kids.)
</p>
<p>
Pikmin Counting is one of several mini-games available on Nintendo's Japanese website Pikmin Garden, a hub of information on the series with regular news updates of things going on in mobile game Pikmin Bloom, quizzes, and cute Pikmin wallpaper.

</figure>
<p>
Another mini-game available on Pikmin Garden features rhythm-based gameplay, and has you playing Guitar Hero-style falling notes.
</p>
<p>
After 10 minutes playing Pikmin Counting, I have counted my way to 100 and seen my growing horde of creatures display some of their in-game characteristics - Yellow Pikmin disabling an electric obstacle, Blue Pikmin sorting out a water jet, Ice Pikmin freezing a lake solid. 
</p>
<p>
Rock Pikmin get stomped on by enemies - but it's okay because they're sturdy! Even Pikmin 4's Glowmin show up to help get you over the 100 line.
</p>
<p>
If you fancy giving it a go, you'll just need to head to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/character/pikmin/try/counting/index.html">Pikmin Counting</a> page on a mobile device - and also be signed in to your Nintendo Account.
</p>
<p>
Pikmin is a really big deal in Japan, where last year's excellent Pikmin 4 shifted the bulk of its copies. As of March, the game had sold 3.48m copies worldwide, including 1.87m in Japan alone - the most of any in the franchise so far. 
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo's oft-overlooked garden strategy reaches near-perfect evolution," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pikmin-4-review-nintendos-oft-overlooked-garden-strategy-reaches-near-perfect-evolution">Eurogamer's Pikmin 4 review</a>, dubbing it a "a bouquet of fresh gameplay alongside the best bits from the series' roots".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/splatoon-3-grand-festival-splatfest-is-coming-september-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akJ_qZ44sWE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Nintendo announced that an epic Grand Festival Splatfest will launch in Splatoon 3 on September 12, 2024.</p>



<p>Nintendo’s announcement coincided with a new cinematic trailer, teasing a massive music festival. It elaborates that the event begins at 5 PM PT on September 12, and it will end at the same time on September 15, 2024. </p>



<p>The trailer description also describes Grand Festival as “the biggest Splatfest ever.” It intends to celebrate “the two-year anniversary” of the game. However, many fans speculate that Grand Festival could be the final new content coming to Splatoon 3. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Splatoon 3 - Grand Festival - Nintendo Switch" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/akJ_qZ44sWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Nintendo’s new Grand Festival trailer does end by asking players if the past, present, or future for its Splatfest query. </p>



<p>Today’s announcement also closely follows the August 2024 Splatfest details, which Nintendo only just revealed earlier this week. In a new <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1814287891109163374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Nintendo also revealed some new amiibo figures coming September 5, 2024. These decisions may hint that big changes could be on the way.</p>



<p>Nintendo previously confirmed that it plans to reveal the anticipated Switch successor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-successor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime this fiscal year</a>. With a new device on the way, it would make sense for the Splatoon series to move into a new title. </p>



<p>At this time, Nintendo did not confirm that Grand Festival is in fact the end of new content coming to Splatoon 3. And Nintendo could still support Splatoon 3 with regular technical updates, and the return of previous content.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ftc-xbox-game-pass-standard</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ftc-slams-new-xbox-game-pass-tier-as-degraded-product-after-changes.931764/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ftc-xbox-game-pass-standard<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The FTC has branded Microsoft's new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier a "degraded product", suggesting that recent Game Pass changes are hallmarks of a company "exercising market power post-merger".</p>
<p>In a US Court of Appeals filing (via <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1814070576987713699" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Verge's Tom Warren</a>), the FTC describes the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier">new Game Pass Standard tier</a>, which omits day-one releases from its lineup, as "product degradation" and "exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ftc-seeks-restraining-order-preliminary-injunction-to-hinder-microsofts-acquisition-of">has alleged</a>".</p>
<p>As the FTC's filing points out, the Standard tier's $14.99-per-month cost represents an increase of 36% over the now-retired Console tier's $10.99, but it offers fewer benefits thanks to its omission of day-one titles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass-ftc.jpg?itok=r_rwklC8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass-ftc.jpg?itok=ithcq98Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox Game Pass Standard is raising eyebrows thanks to its omission of day-one games.</figcaption></figure><p>The FTC's filing goes on to say that Microsoft's "price increases and product degradation", combined with the "reduced investments in output and product quality" <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-fires-back-at-ftcs-accusation-on-layoffs-in-activision-blizzard-legal-battle">represented by </a><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">recent layoffs</a>, are an example of the company flexing its market muscle post-<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">Activision Blizzard merger</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the FTC says the introduction of this new tier, as well as the Game Pass price increases, are inconsistent with previous assurances made by Microsoft regarding&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>and its availability on the subscription service.</p>
<p>According to the FTC, Microsoft previously stated that the Activision-Blizzard merger would allow the company to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1">make the latest&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game available</a> on Game Pass on day one with "no price increase" as a result of said decision.</p>
<p>The timing of this announcement, and the discontinuation of the Game Pass Console tier, are very close indeed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-revealed">the launch of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></a>, and the FTC isn't happy about what that might represent.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-game-pass-ftc.jpg?itok=Y-PZSKMG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-game-pass-ftc.jpg?itok=RsBkby6M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Day-one Xbox Game Pass titles like&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>will only be available with certain Game Pass tiers.</figcaption></figure><p>It's been something of a rough year for Xbox so far, especially when it comes to the court of public opinion.</p>
<p>These Game Pass changes haven't exactly proven popular, and they follow hot on the heels of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">closure of two major studios</a> in the form of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin.</p>
<p>That's despite the fact that the former's&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>was, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-was-break-out-hit-for-microsoft-according-to-aaron-greenberg">according to Xbox exec Aaron Greenberg</a>, a "breakout hit", leading to questions regarding exactly what a studio has to do to be considered "successful" in the modern era of gaming.</p>
<p>Those closures became especially galling shortly after they were announced, when Xbox head Matt Booty <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-smaller-games-comment-hi-fi-rush">suggested the brand needed "smaller games"</a>&nbsp;that attract "prestige and awards", a description that most certainly applies to&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>.</p>
<p>In any case, we'll have to wait and see where this newest battle between the FTC and Microsoft goes. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflixs-multiplayer-squid-game-title-gets-2024-release-window/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix%E2%80%99s-multiplayer-squid-game-title-gets-2024-release-window.931761/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/netflixs-multiplayer-squid-game-title-gets-2024-release-window/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a letter to shareholders regarding <a href="https://ir.netflix.net/financials/quarterly-earnings/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second quarter earnings</a>, Netflix confirmed that its video game adaptation of Squid Game will launch “later this year.”</p>



<p>The letter further clarifies that the multiplayer game will coincide with the premiere of the Squid Game series’ new season. </p>



<p>However, the second season of the show still doesn’t have a release date. So, at this time, there’s nothing concrete for the video game either. But the game is now due by the end of the year. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/squid-game-season-2-confirmed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season two</a> of Netflix’s Squid Game show will “follow hero Gi-hun as he abandons his plans to go to the United States.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the same letter, Netflix also elaborated on its “separate” gaming slate schedule. It specifically addressed interactive games for Netflix Stories. The letter states that “starting in July we’ll launch about one new title per month like Emily in Paris and Selling Sunset.” </p>



<p>Netflix made an ambitious push into gaming in December 2023, confirming there were nearly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-has-90-games-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90 games in development</a>. </p>



<p>Some gamers may not realize Netflix offers gaming options. However, its GTA Trilogy reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-trilogy-has-been-downloaded-30-million-times-on-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached 30 million downloads</a> as of last month. </p>



<p>Netflix also has a variety of shows based on video games coming soon. That includes the animated Tomb Raider series <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hayley-atwell-lara-croft-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starring Hayley Atwell</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-announces-animated-minecraft-series-is-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft animated series</a>. Its Minecraft series is unrelated to the live-action film, which recent rumors suggest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might have a ‘creepy’ look</a>.</p>

                <p>Netflix has outlined its strategy around gaming, and the company is going big. The streamer <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_events/2024/Jul/18/netflix-inc-usa-244e80f7-c939-40a1-a316-82d7d29f8a40.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said during its latest earnings</a> briefing that it has 80+ games in development currently, with the aim of releasing at least one new game per month into the Netflix Stories app.</p><p>Netflix co-CEO and president Greg Peters began by telling people why Netflix is involved in gaming in the first place, and that's to make money. He said the global gaming market, minus Russia and China, accounts for $150 billion in annual revenue--and that's also excluding revenue from ads. A key differentiator for Netflix's video game releases is that they have no microtransactions or ads. Peters, however, alluded to the possibility of ad-based games in the future, saying ad-based revenue for games is not part of the "current" Netflix model. He didn't rule anything out for the future.</p><p>Netflix Games launched around three years ago, and so far, Peters said Netflix "happy with the progress" that the company has seen. "We've set ourselves pretty aggressive engagement growth targets. And we've met those, exceeded those in many cases," he said.</p><p>The impact of Netflix Games on Netflix's overall business remains "quite small," Peters mentioned, adding that Netflix's investment level in games relative to its overall content spend is also "quite small." In 2022, it was reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/less-than-1-of-netflix-subscribers-play-its-games/1100-6506242/" data-ref-id="1100-6506242">less than 1% of Netflix's userbase</a> has played a game on the platform. Starting slow was always the plan, Peters said, but growth is expected in the future.</p><p>"We've calibrated the growth in investment with the growth in the business impact. So we're being disciplined about how we scale that. So now obviously, the job is to continue to grow that engagement to the place where it has a material impact on the business," he said. "I think you've seen this trajectory with us before, whether it's been a new content genre like unscripted or film or maybe getting the content mix right for a particular country, you can think about Japan or India, which we're now in an amazing place through the hard work of our teams there. We continually iterate. We refine our programming based on the signals we get from our members."</p><p>Netflix has released more than 100 games thus far, and the company has taken aboard learnings from this so far in terms of "what works, what doesn't work."</p><p>"We're refining our program to do more of what is working with the 80-plus games that we currently have in development," Peters said.</p><p>The executive went on to say Netflix users are particularly enjoying "interactive narrative games," which are good for business, too, because they are "easier to build," Peters said. These games are part of the Netflix Stores hub, and some of the top releases have been the games based on the series Virgin River and Perfect Match.</p><p>"Starting this month in July, we're going to launch about one new title per month into Netflix Stories, and this is amazing IP like Emily in Paris and Selling Sunset. And we have lots more, including very different types of games yet to come in the quarters and years ahead," he said.</p><p>Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos added that the company is particularly excited about games because they represent a rare opportunity to give fans of a Netflix property even more ways to engage with it between seasons of the show. He also teased that perhaps one day a Netflix game will include characters and storylines that could pay off in the next season of a show or a movie sequel.</p><p>"I think our opportunity here to serve super fandom with games is really fun and remarkable. I think the idea of being able to take a show and give the superfan a place to be in between seasons and even beyond that, to be able to use the game platform to introduce new characters and new storylines or new plot twist events, now you could do those kind of things and then they can then materialize in the next season or in the sequel to the film," he said.</p><p>One of Netflix's next big game releases is a Squid Game multiplayer game coming this year alongside Season 2 of the popular show. Beyond that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-halo-boss-joseph-staten-joins-netflix-to-make-aaa-multiplatform-game/1100-6513315/" data-ref-id="1100-6513315">former Halo and Destiny boss Joseph Staten is working with Netflix on a AAA multiplatform game.</a></p><p>One of the most high-profile releases for Netflix Games so far was Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, which came to the catalog at the end of 2023.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/19/rack-and-slay-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Roguelikes are a pretty diverse bunch, even if there’s a glut of action RPGs and deckbuilders in the form, but using billiards as inspiration stands out as particularly unique, introducing some entertaining ideas. In Rack and Slay, you navigate a dungeon as a billiard ball, encountering treasures, traps, enemies, and various power-ups along the way.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rack and Slay - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Un1CHEXAZnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s no deep storytelling in Rack and Slay, the game firmly set in the casual, pickup and play category. The controls will be familiar to anyone who has played a pool or snooker game before – you aim where you want the ball to go and then power up the shot, releasing the ball to hopefully do what you want – but this is not your standard game of billiards.</p>


<p>For one thing, pockets are located in random places, sometimes the traditional corners, and sometimes in the middle of the table, and they can be different sizes. For another, there’s other hazards to watch out for, with wall spikes, bombs, bear traps, and portals all posing a risk to your billiard ball. Your billiard ball has a health bar too, with any unwanted impact doing a point damage.</p>


<p>The aim is to pot all of the enemy balls within a set number of shots and without incurring too much damage. If you run out of shots, each of the remaining enemy balls does a point of damage to you. If you do not have enough health points, then your run is over. If you do survive this final attack, you will move onto the next dungeon with your reduced health.</p>
<p>Rack and Slay is a roguelike though, and with that comes upgrades and abilities. Between each dungeon you will be able to select random ability cards, as well as use any gold you have collected to recover health, increase your shot power, increase the number of shots you have per level, and add more abilities. These abilities include being able shoot out mini billiard balls when you launch the main ball, become invulnerable to traps, gain health and gold, and increase shot power. There are dozens of ability cards to unlock, and some also stack.</p>

<p>The main game has you rolling through a maximum of ten dungeons, at the end of which is a boss 8 ball that has to be pocketed last to be defeated. Once you beat the ten dungeons, an endless mode option is presented, challenging you to make as much progress as possible. There is even a warning that you could break the game as you can keep unlocking and stacking abilities on this run.</p>
<p>Speaking of challenges, Rack and Slay does have a challenge mode with specific modifiers enabled. For example, the Drunken Master challenge will sometimes see your ball go in the opposite direction than the one you intended, while Bouncyland makes level obstacles all bouncy. These challenges are fun to play through and, just like a normal run, you can enter an endless mode on these too.</p>
<p>There are different enemy billiard types present in Rack and Slay, and these are perhaps the most disappointing part of the game. Just like your ball, the majority cannot move unless they are hit, including bosses. There are a couple that can move of their own accord, but they won’t hit you the majority of the time. &nbsp;Some enemies can fire projectiles, but most of these won’t hit you either. The only enemy that stood out as giving a challenge is the blinding enemy. Hit this, and for the next turn you will not be able to see your aim trajectory. Enemy spawns can also be an issue, especially if they have gathered in a particular area that you cannot get to easily.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paramount-cancels-halo-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount has canceled the controversial&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>TV series after just two seasons, but it looks like the show's producers aren't giving up on it just yet.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-2-seasons-1235952581/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Hollywood Reporter</a> (which cites a statement from Paramount), the series' second and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/halo-tv-season-2-review-how-far-should-artistic-license-go">most recent season</a>, which aired in March, will be its last on the Paramount+ platform.</p>
<p>In the statement, Paramount says it's "extremely proud" of the series, which it calls "ambitious", and wishes the show's producers and cast "the best going forward". If the Hollywood Reporter is to be believed, there will be a "going forward" after all, too.</p>

<p>343 Industries says it remains "committed to broadening the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>universe in different ways in the future", so even if this particular show doesn't stick around, another one may well take its place.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>TV series originally premiered in spring 2022 after its debut trailer was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-tv-show-premiering-first-trailer-at-game-awards">shown during the previous year's Game Awards</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its first season met with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/halo-tv-show-lore-universe">a polarized response</a> from fans, with some praising its action sequences and others decrying what they perceived as significant changes to the original games' lore and narrative elements.</p>

<p>The second season of&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>was met with a more positive reception by fans and critics alike, but it looks like the improvements it made weren't enough for Paramount to consider it a going concern.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>series will end up on a different streaming service in the future, but for now, it looks like you're going to have to wait a while to get more live-action Master Chief. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>.</p>

<p>"The Muckingham Files have returned in PowerWash Simulator's latest free content update," developer FuturLab teased as it marks PowerWash Simulator's second "Washer-Versary".</p>
<p>"As part of our Washer-Versary celebration this update brings you two brand new maps to clean, voted for by the community! Take a day trip to a filthy Aquarium, then deep clean a Submarine in Muckingham docks."</p>
<p>PowerWash Simulator's previous premium expansion fell down the rabbit hole for an adventure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulators-alices-adventures-dlc-gets-july-release-date">inspired by Lewis Caroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>.</p>
<p>"PowerWash Simulator may feel like a sleeper hit, but veteran UK developer FuturLab knew early on it had something special on its hands," Tom wrote in his fabulous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-powerwash-simulator-and-developer-futurlab">interview with FuturLab boss, James Marsden</a>.
</p>
<p>"A brilliant blend of compulsive yet cosy gameplay, PowerWash Simulator sounds an unlikely concept - and yet it has found a legion of fans who don't want to stop playing. Now, with the successful launch of its first paid DLC - based on SpongeBob SquarePants - safely tucked under its belt, I'm keen to find out what's next for the game, and for FuturLab itself."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-complaint-against-microsoft-following-game-pass-price-hike/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The US FTC (Federal Trade Commission) has <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453.121.0_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> a new complaint to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit against Microsoft following the recent Game Pass price hike, alleging that this is exactly the type of post-merger behavior they wanted to prevent by blocking the acquisition. Here's an excerpt from the complaint filed by FTC counsel Imad Abyad:</p>
<p><em>Product degradation—removing the most valuable games from Microsoft’s new service—combined with price increases for existing users, is exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged. </em><em>Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation—combined with Microsoft’s reduced </em><em>investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs—are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger.</em></p>
<p><em>Importantly, Microsoft’s actions are inconsistent with Microsoft’s representations below. Microsoft’s price increases coincide with adding “Call of Duty” (CoD) to Game Pass’s most expensive tier, and discontinuing the Console tier will happen shortly before releasing CoD’s newest game. Below, Microsoft promised that “the acquisition would benefit consumers by making [CoD] available on Microsoft’s Game Pass on the day it is released on console (with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition).” Microsoft’s post-merger actions thus vindicate the congressional design of preliminarily halting mergers to fully evaluate their likely competitive effects, and judicial skepticism of promises inconsistent with a firm’s economic incentives.</em></p>
<p>It is true that Microsoft lawyers <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-wont-increase-in-price-even-after-abk-merger-says-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> in their memorandum defense against the FTC's motion for a preliminary injunction to block the Activision Blizzard merger that there would be no Game Pass price increase. However, this promise was non-binding, and most consumers already expected a price increase following the addition of Activision Blizzard's prized portfolio to the subscription service. Diablo IV was added to Game Pass in late March, and rumors suggest <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-is-coming-to-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-activision-blizzard-games-are-reportedly-launching-on-game-pass-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other ABK games</a> might be joining soon. Besides, Microsoft's subscription service is hardly the only one to have raised its pricing plans recently. Ultimately, customers will decide whether the new price is too high.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the FTC is still waiting on its appeal against the Microsoft/Activision Blizzard merger lodged a while ago at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The chances of the Federal Trade Commission being able to unwind the acquisition seem slim at this point, but cannot be altogether discounted.</p>
