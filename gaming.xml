		<p>Kunos Simulazioni has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assetto-corsa-evo">Assetto Corsa EVO</a> patch 0.1.5, finally bringing online functionality to the racing game, almost three weeks after its initial launch into Steam Early Access.</p>
<p>Now with the server backend live, elements like the car dealership, game economy, academy, car ownership and personalisation, as well as special events are now enabled. Also included in the update are a number of control and UI changes, there’s some track-specific improvements, and a smattering of other fixes elsewhere.</p>


<p>Up until this update, the game had been in a limited offline-only mode. At launch, as the servers first went offline, that meant players were restricted to just 5 of the Early Access release’s 20 cars, though as Kunos grappled with the situation, they released hotfixes that made all cars available to drive without earning them in-game. Alas, this was a game bitten by the issues that tying solo player progression to online server saves has, even though it’s a very common sight in all manner of other titles.</p>
<p>With this now restored, Kunos should be able to turn their focus to the first content drop, which will add two new cars, Fuji Speedway and more special events, and then the first major content and feature update.</p>
<p>Here’s the patch notes for Assetto Corsa EVO 0.1.5:</p>

<p>GAMEPLAY:<br>
– enabled server backend for dealership, game economy, academy, car ownership and personalization as well as special events<br>
– updated penalty checks for jump starts</p>
<p>AUDIO:<br>
– Honda S2000 – new sound set<br>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/06/ninja-gaiden-2-black-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Are there a more pert pair of buttocks in all of video gamedom than those belonging to Ryu Hayabusa? Like two smooth boulders covered in latex, Ryu’s glutes have accompanied him on many adventures over the years, mostly involving the deadly ninja hacking, slashing, and dismembering his way through a veritable horde of assassins, ninja-dogs and fiends. First introduced in 1988’s Ninja Gaiden, Ryu has appeared in numerous games since, yet it’s arguably when he went 3D in 2004 that both Ryu and his famous bum cheeks really broke through into the mainstream consciousness.</p>
<p>2008’s Ninja Gaiden II is arguably the best action-adventure in the series history, offering thrills, spills, and gore by the bucketload. So, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/ninja-gaiden-4-has-been-revealed-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-ps5-pc-in-fall-2025/">Ninja Gaiden 4 revealed for release this year</a>, it’s fitting that the original version of Ninja Gaiden II has received the remake treatment. Now dressed up in stunning Unreal Engine 5 visuals, the game certainly looks the part. Character models are top-notch, the level of details added to a 17-year-old game is something to behold. The speed of the gameplay is lightning fast too, Ryu moving with lighting fluidity at a silky smooth 60fps, packs of enemies exploding in viscera around him.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN 2 Black - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BwSjicduASA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s rather quaint to remember that Ninja Gaiden used to be considered a rock-hard, uber-punishing game. Now, in contrast to the Souls genre, it proves itself to be extremely accessible, and all the better for it. Controls are simple and spectacular, basic inputs resulting in phenomenal screen-shaking combo of attacks. Ryu is a bad-ass, and the game lets him be that bad-ass.</p>
<p>Rather than preoccupying itself with limiting the ninja’s abilities, Team Ninja’s finest is all about unleashing that power. With an extremely generous block to protect you, your main task is managing the space and ensuring Ryu doesn’t become overwhelmed by the multitude of murderous foes he faces in each encounter. That means timing Ultimate Attacks just right, and once you’ve done that, the awesome flurry of attacks that follows is all down to Ryu.</p>


<p>Combat is a total cathartic joy, particularly when facing down human foes. Your unwitting opponents will end up with the arms and legs lopped off, though, hilariously, they will fight on, in a manner akin to Monty Python. Though don’t be distracted by all that chuckling, as, due to missing their important extremities, your enemies will unleash devastating suicide attacks – so, you’re best off putting them down quickly. Less enjoyable to face are big minions, such as fiends or werewolves. Whilst it’s undeniably impressive to witness ten hulking werewolves bearing down on you, they lack the variety in their combat style that human foes bring.</p>
<p>What’s most refreshing about playing classic Ninja Gaiden now is how quickly battles are over; this isn’t drawn out Souls-like combat, combat is fast, frantic, and over in seconds. That applies to the bosses as well. I’ve become so atuned to boss battles going on and on through various phases, that I was flabbergasted to crush a typically massive demon in a matter of minutes. It’s a thrilling change from the modern norm of long drawn-out slog-fests. Though, many of the boss battles have not aged well, fighting the weird silver demon train or water dragon are clunky and messy experiences, frankly it’s a good thing they are done with in 120 seconds.</p>

<p>Ironically, Ryu’s greatest foe is no screen-breaking gigantic boss, instead it’s the in-game camera. This remains, as in the 2008 original and is resolutely terrible. Rather than rotating 360 degrees around Ryu, the camera instead acts like a slow-moving drone hovering behind the ninja. As such, it’s all too easy to have absolutely no idea what’s going on, as a lot of the time you can’t even see your player character. Navigating narrow corridors, in particular, is a total chore, the camera failing to keep up entirely. Swimming has also not aged well either, the normally agile and dexterous ninja handling like a soviet-era submarine.</p>
<p>Personally, I would have preferred the camera to have been completely re-worked, but that’s one of the dangers of remaking an older game.&nbsp;But hey, I guess that’s the dangers of remaking an old game, you get everything exactly as it was, just prettier, which means you end up with both the very good and the underwhelmingly bad.</p>

<p>That said, another potential sore spot for series fans might be more about whether this release is deserving of the ‘Black’ moniker. Pitched as a remake of the Xbox 360 original, this is actually closer to Ninja Gaiden 2 Sigma in terms of the volume of enemies that you face, and some of the other revisions and changes made as the game was brought to other platforms. If you can accept that, this is the prettiest version of the game, and a great reintroduction to the series (alongside 2021’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/10/ninja-gaiden-master-collection-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Master Collection</a>) ahead of Ninja Gaiden 4.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach has just <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?e0a6b1252ea06e64c499d35782726646a6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> an official rating from the South Korean GRAC, the Game Rating and Administration Committee. The game has been vetoed for minors, with the following summary of its content:</p>
<p><em>An adventure game about delivering parcels across a post-apocalyptic world and connecting cities to save humanity.</em></p>
<p><em>＊ Excessive violence</em><br>
<em>- There is red blood and bodily harm during combat using weapons during the game.</em><br>
<em>＊ Excessive vulgar language, profanity, and swearing</em><br>
<em>- There is excessive vulgar vulgarity and swearing during the game (f＊＊k, a＊＊h＊＊e, s＊＊t, d＊＊n, h＊＊ys＊＊t, etc.)</em><br>
<em>＊ Direct drug use</em><br>
<em>- Smoking and drinking scenes are depicted during the game.</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore, according to Article 21 of the Act on Promotion of the Game Industry and Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Rating Classification Regulations, it has been rated as 'Not available to minors'.</em></p>
<p>What fans will be interested in, though, is the mere fact that it was rated. Usually, this means the game is close to its launch window. Ubisoft Massive's Star Wars Outlaws was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-rated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> in late March and subsequently launched in late August, but there were cases where the rating only appeared around three months before the game's release date. As such, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach might be coming within the first half of the year. A release date could be announced at the upcoming State of Play, <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-playstation-state-of-play-presentation-is-set-for-february-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored to take place next week</a>.</p>
<p>It's not that surprising, considering that creator Hideo Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-has-entered-adjustment-phase-voice-acting-and-motion-capture-finished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> back in May 2024 that the game had already entered the 'adjustment phase', with voice acting and motion capture already done. Fans got an <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-looks-even-crazier-than-the-first-one-in-the-new-tgs-2024-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended look at the sequel</a> at the Tokyo Game Show 2024, where Kojima showed some of the new characters, such as Rainy (played by Shioli Kutsuna, previously seen in Deadpool &amp; Wolverine and The Invasion), Tomorrow (played by Elle Fanning, known for Super 8, Maleficent, and The Great), Dollman (played by Jonathan Roumie, mainly known for playing Jesus in The Chosen), and Heartman (played by Darren Jacobs, who was featured in Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver). Norman Reedus, Léa Seydoux, and Troy Baker are returning as Sam Porter Bridges, Fragile, and Higgs. Players will also find the likenesses of Mad Max creator George Miller and In The Shade director Fatih Akin.</p>
<p>Just like the first game, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach has been made with Guerrilla's Decima Engine. It will launch on PlayStation 5 first, though there's a solid chance it will make it not only on PC like the first one but even on Xbox, following Kojima Productions' <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-directors-cut-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent acquisition of the IP from Sony</a>.</p>

        <p>They're working on a new IP</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Paradox are buying Bulgarian game developer Haemimont Games, the developers of strategy games including several in the Tropico and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jagged-alliance">Jagged Alliance</a> series. The two companies previously worked together on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/surviving-mars">Surviving Mars</a>, which was originally developed by Haemimont and published by Paradox Interactive.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-acquires-haemimont-games">press release</a>, Paradox attributed the acquisition to their "strategic focus on growing in the management games genre."
</p>
<p>"They bring a tight-knit team with long experience in developing management games with many well received projects in their portfolio. Moreover, they have a strong creative streak, technology developed for their niche, a new IP in development and a strong culture that fits Paradox’s way of working," says Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester in the press release.
</p>
<p>Haemimont have been producing strategy games of various kinds since 2000, often doing work-for-hire development on sequels for series created by others. They developed Tropico 3, 4 and 5, all published by Kalypso, and 2023's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jagged-alliance-3">Jagged Alliance 3</a>, published by THQ Nordic. They don't own the rights to those IP, so don't expect future entries in either series from Haemimont and Paradox.
</p><p>This acquisition does reunite Haemimont with Surviving Mars, the citybuilder they developed for Paradox about building a home on the red planet. Three years after release, ongoing development of DLC was taken over by a different studio, Abstraction Games, while Haemimont moved off to other projects. Paradox Interactive published two further spiritual successors developed by other teams: Iceflake Studios' post-apocalyptic citybuilder Surviving The Aftermath and Rocket Flair Studios' deep-sea citybuilder Surviving The Abyss. Neither successor was as well received as the first, which Alec had enjoyed a lot in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surviving-mars-review">Surviving Mars review</a>. The press release only names an unnamed "new IP", however, so who knows whether anything Surviving-based might come of this down the line.
</p>
<p>Paradox have been having a rough time recently, and last year we spoke to them at length about their future plans. They feel that there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-think-theres-no-point-competing-with-xcom-after-their-lamplighters-flop-its-winner-takes-all-in-the-tactical-gaming-space">no point competing with XCOM</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">that players are less accepting of bugs now</a>, and their intent is to therefore focus on fewer, more polished games within their core market of strategy games. They would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-still-want-to-make-a-sims-competitor-after-life-by-you-but-we-need-to-start-smaller">still like to take another swing at a life simulation game though</a>, even after cancelling Life By You and closing its studio, Paradox Tectonic.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Nightmare Kart is set to receive an expansion, despite a DMCA takedown from Sony against the developer's Bloodborne PSX demake.</p>
<p>Originally known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bloodborne-kart">Bloodborne Kart</a>, the racer is a spin-off from the Bloodborne PSX demake from fan developer Lilith Walther. The name was changed to Nightmare Kart once Sony got involved and requested Walther "scrub the branding" from the game.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-bloodborne-fan-project-gets-the-legal-takedown-treatment-sparking-speculation-an-official-remake-is-coming">legal takedown was issued by MarkScan Enforcement against a YouTube video of Walther's Bloodborne PSX demake</a>. Now the full game itself has been <a href="https://itch.io/takedowns/1370201">removed from itch.io</a> with a notice from the same company.</p>

<p>MarkScan represents Sony Interactive Entertainment, with the notice claiming copyright infringement.</p>
<p>"No person is entitled to upload, stream (live, delayed, repeat etc.), make available for download, broadcast and/or communicate to the public, the copyright content listed above, in any manner whatsoever, through any transmission platform, including the internet, for viewing on devices such as computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablet computers, etc. without express authorization from our client," the notice reads.</p>
<p>As reported earlier this week, another fan project from modder Lance McDonald has also been hit by a claim, which enabled Bloodborne to run at 60fps.</p>
<p>McDonald shared a social media post from Walther confirming both projects had been hit by DMCA takedown requests. Walther's post has since been removed.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Sony for comment, but has not yet received a response.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">MarkScan are a company hired by Sony Interactive Entertainment. They’re the same company that DMCAed my page about the Bloodborne 60fps patch. And now they’ve DMCAed an old video about the Bloodborne PSX demake project. That’s pretty wild. What the hell are they doing?? <a href="https://t.co/yMwdHHc8NY">https://t.co/yMwdHHc8NY</a></p>— Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1886214740755742901?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>It seems, therefore, that Sony is gradually targeting all Bloodborne fan projects. But why? Hope has, of course, turned to a possible official remake, though Sony or FromSoftware are yet to announce anything.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Nightmare Kart is still available for free. It released in June last year, and its suitably named DLC The Old Karts will add in a new mini campaign, as well as new racers, karts, tracks, and power ups.</p>
<p>Bloodborne DLC The Old Hunters introduced Lady Maria, who's already paralleled in Nightmare Kart as Mistress Mary. Perhaps we'll get an Orphan of Kos equivalent?</p>
<p>Former PlayStation exec <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hasnt-playstation-done-anything-new-with-bloodborne-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-theory">Shuhei Yoshida reckons Bloodborne creator Hidetaka Miyazaki is "so busy"</a> a remake hasn't been possible.</p>
<p>"Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created. So I think he is interested but he's so successful and he's so busy, so he cannot do it himself, and he doesn't want anyone else to touch it," said Yoshida.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware">Miyazaki told Eurogamer</a> he's "very happy" to see so many passionate fans calling for a Bloodborne remake.</p>
<p>"Put simply, it makes me very happy to see it's a title with a lot of specific memories, both for me and the staff who worked on it," he said. "And when we see those passionate voices in the community, of course it makes us feel thrilled, it makes us feel very fortunate to have that and to have those memories."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a well-optimized game, so much so that the most powerful GPU now available on the market, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/">NVIDIA RTX 5090</a>, can run the game at 16K resolution and playable framerates with the help of DLSS.</p>
<p>A new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@zWORMzGaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zWORMz Gaming</a> shows the second entry in the series by Warhorse Studios running at 16K resolution, low settings, and NVIDIA DLSS at the Performance setting, meaning it is upscaled from 8K resolution. Despite not running at native resolution, it is still impressive to see the RTX 5090 handle such a high resolution relatively well, as the above 30 FPS the GPU can deliver makes the game more than playable. Unsurprisingly, the RTX 5090 is not capable of handling Kingdom Come: Deliverance II running at native 16K resolution, as it only delivers a proper slideshow experience with a whopping 3 FPS gameplay.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II isn't only among the most well-optimized games of recent times, it is also a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, as Chris highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>
Avowed will include the option to play at 60fps on Xbox Series X, developer Obsidian has now confirmed, after previously saying the game's "core" 30fps option was a benefit.
</p>
<p>
Game director Carrie Patel has now confirmed an option for "up to" 60fps will exist in the game at launch, as part of a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAtStowg2Rk">MinnMax</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Last year, art director Matt Hansen said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-currently-targeting-baseline-of-30fps-on-xbox-consoles-to-make-way-for-juicier-vfx">Obsidian had decided to target 30fps as Avowed was a single-player game</a>, and therefore "you don't necessarily need that 60fps". Indeed, 30fps allowed Obsidian to "get a lot juicier with VFX and lighting", he continued.

<p>
"It's a trade-off we opted to make relatively early, and we're really happy with that," Hansen added. "The game's running pretty smooth for, you know, how visually dense it is, and that was always our goal."
</p>
<p>
That said, Hansen has still left wiggle room that other options might make the game's final release. Performance optimisation was "one of the last things you do", he noted.
</p>
<p>
This week, on being asked what Avowed's frame-rate would be, Patel answered: "You can get up to 60[fps]". Details of the game's resolution at that frame-rate were not mentioned.
</p>
<p>
Set in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> universe, Avowed is the latest game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> studio Obsidian, and is set to launch for PC and Xbox Series X/S in just a couple of weeks, on 18th February. As you'd expect, PC and Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will get access to the game on day one.
</p>
<p>
"Avowed plays like a funny Obsidian role-player where you buddy up with the voice of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>'s Garrus," I wrote after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-plays-like-a-funny-obsidian-role-player-where-you-buddy-up-with-the-voice-of-mass-effects-garrus">hands-on with Avowed</a> last year. "If you're after a fresh Obsidian hit... Avowed is one to keep an eye on."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-series-x-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy XVI is close to making its debut on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, but its release on Nintendo Switch 2 remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Speaking on the ResetERA forums, NateDrake, a.k.a. NatheTheHate, who proved to be a very reliable source in the past, recently revealing precisely when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">Nintendo Switch 2 would get officially unveiled last month</a>, said that, barring any late changes, Final Fantasy XVI will<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot34-reseteora.1090722/post-135340638" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> soon be announced for Xbox consoles</a>, and will be released around the mid-first half of the year, so around Spring. Final Fantasy VII Remake will also be released on Xbox consoles <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot34-reseteora.1090722/post-135340932" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later this year</a>, and Rebirth next year. The Xbox release of all three games will be announced at the same time for maximum impact, according to the insider.</p>
<p>While Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S owners will soon be able to finally experience Final Fantasy XVI, Nintendo Switch 2 owners, on the other hand, may never get the chance. According to NateDrake, the game is<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot34-reseteora.1090722/post-135347844" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> not planned</a> for the next Nintendo console at this time, as Square Enix decided to prioritize Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth for the console. Considering how the game has trouble running with decent performance on PlayStation 5 and even on certain PC configurations, it wouldn't be surprising if not getting the game out on much weaker hardware was due to technical reasons.</p>
<p>Of the three Final Fantasy games mentioned above, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the latest. Launched last year on PlayStation 5 and last month on PC, it is among the best entries in the entire franchise to date, and a massive step forward from Remake, as Kai highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <p>The creators of sci-fi corridor explorer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duskers">Duskers</a> are making a "spiritual successor" to the 2016 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space game</a>. The studio revealed their plans in a video showing three prototypes they're currently working on. The working title for this one is "Humanity 2.0" and it'll see you carving up derelict ships to build your own vessel and sometimes defending that ship from pirates trying to take it over. It sounds like you'll still be the sweaty cybermaster of a bunch of glitchy drones, who now might suffer "fun personality quirks" when you install upgrades, "like not wanting to go down narrow corridors because it's now claustrophobic". </p>
<p>Sad, busted-ass space robots just trying to get by? Yes, I'm interested.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"What can I say? I still love Duskers," says Tim Keenan, co-founder of Misfits Attic, in the video that shows off what the studio has been up to, including two other game prototypes. </p>
<figure>

<p>The footage for Humanity 2.0 shows the player cutting up and rearranging the rooms of a spaceship using the green retro interface familiar to players of the first game. The player types "slice" as a command to chop up parts of the vessel, for example. But that's really all we see that seems significantly different so far. The rest of the video talks of pirates and scrap-hunting in deep space. But it seems too early in development to show any of that yet.</p><p>Keenan wants the game to go beyond mere survival though, to include themes of "sacrificing to save the survivors of this bleak future, and rebooting humanity". But he also reassures viewers that the tone will still be pretty grim. "It's just a ray of hope, not a sunrise," he says. "The game will still be dark."</p>
<p>Like I say, this is not the only thing the studio is working on. Misfits Attic have three projects in the pipeline. The others include a fantasy-themed strategy game currently titled "Scheme", which sees you "starting as a lowborn and rising to power while outwitting and backstabbing some very powerful highborns". It's described as "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a> lite", in which you never have any armies yourself, but need to use Game Of Thrones style manipulation to convince other factions to war with one another. </p>
<p>The third game is a tactical chessy roguelike temporarily known as "Magic Wizard Chess" but in which something weird is going on behind the wibbling CRT scanlines. "While you're playing you may be psychologically evaluated for an unknown reason," says Keenan, "but don't worry about that."</p>
<p>Duskers remains one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-hacking-games">best hacking games</a> you can play today. It gives you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/duskers-review">the feeling of being a lost and lonely engineer</a> hired by a big ugly company from the Alien movies, except all you have are unreliable drone pals and shaky typing hands hovering over your command-line interface. It would be cool to see a follow-up some day, but with three games in the assembly line, it might be a while until those bay doors open. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Harrison Ford has praised Troy Baker's depiction of his iconic whip-toting archaeologist in Xbox's recent release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>
<p>Ford was interviewed by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/harrison-ford-shrinking-1923-captain-america-7b1f9b3f">Wall Street Journal</a>, and discussed the suggestion someone might use AI to replicate his likeness in the future. Notably, his last appearance in the Indiana Jones film series includes a digitalised de-aged likeness of himself, seen through flashbacks.</p>
<p>"You don't need artificial intelligence to steal my soul. You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent," said Ford, before referring to Baker's performance as the iconic Indy.  "He did a brilliant job, and it didn't take AI to do it."</p>

<p>Indeed, Ford isn't concerned with AI. "My plan is to keep working behind that face till I don't care what happens anymore. I'm selling that piece by piece while I'm alive," he said. "I've been compensated. You don't need to worry about me."</p>
<p>AI has been a major talking point for video game actors, and a key hold-up in negotiations between actors' union SAG-AFTRA and the video game industry as a strike continues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Eurogamer spoke to celebrated video game actor Jennifer Hale</a> about the strikes, with Hale describing AI as "an existential issue for all of us".</p>
<p>"We need to be able to control when our voice is used," she said. "I don't want my voice used on a project that I would never support or that I didn't say yes to. We need to be compensated for when our voice is used, because we are paid for our exposure as much as for our time."</p>
<p>If anything, Baker's performance as Indiana Jones proves AI isn't necessary to replicate an iconic character - talent is enough.</p>
<p>Baker has been widely praised for his performance in the game, which begins with a recreation of the prologue from Raiders of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a>.</p>
<p>"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">five star review of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.

			<p>Layoffs have hit another PlayStation studio, though it is not a game development team but a software development team. The news was reported by Oscar Diaz, Senior Design Technologist at PlayStation since October 2020, where he worked on 'Building tools and processes that help the UX group at PlayStation push the boundaries of play.' Diaz, one of the affected employees, <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@whoisryosuke/113953245919633944" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote on Mastodon</a>:</p>
<p><em>Most of my team was just laid off from PlayStation. It was a dream to get to work with Sony on the platform I'd grown up playing since the PS1 and contribute to the PS5, Portal, PSVR2, PS App, and future consoles. If you know anyone who needs an engineer experienced with native console UI, feel free to reach out.</em></p>
<p>Sony's PlayStation division has recently laid off several employees, including some at Sony Bend following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancellation of their live service project</a> (which got canceled alongside a God of War live service game in development at Bluepoint). A few months ago, we reported on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closures</a> of Firewalk, maker of the live service Concord game, and Neon Koi, which was going to port PlayStation franchises to mobile devices. Earlier in 2024, around a year ago, PlayStation <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-lays-off-8-of-playstation-workforce-london-studio-closed-guerrilla-naughty-dog-insomniac-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut 8% of its total workforce</a>, shutting down the London studio and even laying off employees at acclaimed studios like Guerrilla Games, Naughty Dog, and Insomniac Games. In July 2024, PlayStation subsidiary Bungie laid off 220 employees, too.</p>
<p>Of course, this is far from a PlayStation-specific issue. 2024 was terrible across the whole industry, and 2025 isn't shaping up to be any better. Layoffs <a href="https://wccftech.com/unknown-9-awakening-developer-hit-with-layoffs-after-games-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit Reflector Entertainment</a> after the failure of Unknown 9: Awakening, and the same goes for Phoenix Labs, developer of Dauntless and Fae Farm, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/phoenix-labs-fae-farm-developer-lays-off-majority-of-the-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to let go of most of the studio</a>. BioWare was <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shrunk down to less than a hundred employees</a> following the commercial underperformance of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laid off 185 employees</a>, including the shutdown of the Leamington studio.</p>

			<p>This morning, Paradox Interactive <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-acquires-haemimont-games,c4101380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a binding agreement to acquire formerly independent developer Haemimont Games, which will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Paradox. The current leadership and team will remain active with the studio, and the studio’s ongoing projects will remain in development. The acquisition consists of an upfront cash payment and a similar sized performance-based earn-out to be paid over the coming years. Haemimont Games and Paradox have agreed not to disclose the purchase price at this time. The acquisition will be financed with cash on hand and is expected to close within a few days.</p>
<p>Haemimont Games is headquartered in Sofia, Bulgaria. Over the years, they've made games in several different genres, though most of them were in the strategy and simulation niche. Haemimont released Tropico 3, 4, and 5, the city-building game Surviving Mars, the action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/victor-vran-overkill-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victor Vran</a>, the survival simulation game <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranded-alien-dawn-leaves-early-access-on-april-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stranded: Alien Dawn</a>, and most recently, the well-received tactical roleplaying game Jagged Alliance 3, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/jagged-alliance-3-unexpendables/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received an 8.5 score here on Wccftech</a>.</p>
<p>Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox, stated:</p>
<p><em>We are very happy to welcome Haemimont Games to Paradox! They bring a tight-knit team with long experience in developing management games with many well received projects in their portfolio. Moreover, they have a strong creative streak, technology developed for their niche, a new IP in development and a strong culture that fits Paradox’s way of working. We have strong faith in their team and leadership, and our main focus now is to ensure that they can continue to create great games under new ownership.</em></p>
<p>Gabriel Dobrev, Founder of Haemimont Games, added:</p>
<p><em>We're delighted to become a part of the Paradox family! The cultural fit between our companies is remarkable, and we already feel at home. This partnership empowers us to push the boundaries of our games, delivering deeper and more intense experiences to our players. It also opens new horizons for our team, technology, and creative processes, which we're eager to explore. Expect amazing new games from us!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-20-is-on-the-horizon-says-ea-boss-but-it-probably-wont-happen-until-after-battlefield-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sci-fi battle royale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> is due a "meaningful update" , according to the CEO of Electronic Arts, something he's called "Apex 2.0". To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game's name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it's not clear if that's exactly what he means. It could mean a revamp with new features, or some other new direction for the existing game. His later words do make it sound more like this is what EA have in mind. Or at least what they're prepared to tell folks in a financial report.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>CEO Andrew Wilson made the comments in <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf">an earnings call</a> for EA's quarterly financial results, the sad phone call where numbers go to be interrogated. </p>
<p>"[On] a longer-term time horizon, there will be an even bigger, more meaningful update to that broader game experience. An Apex 2.0, if you will. This will not be the final incarnation of Apex," he said. </p>
<p>The Apex update "will probably happen after a Battlefield launch," he added. A reference to the the as-yet untitled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, which the publisher has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-crumbling-warzones-are-teased-in-a-promo-vid-calling-for-playtesters">teasing recently</a>. Elsewhere in the call Wilson said that wartorn shooter is expected to launch before April 2026.  </p><p>Previously, Wilson dismissed the idea of a "2.0" version of the game, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-ceo-pushes-back-against-the-idea-of-an-apex-20-to-solve-its-issues-after-the-titles-disappointing-quarter">Gamesindustry.biz</a>. But it looks like he feels differently now? Ah, the winds of business are ever swooshing. Despite Apex Legends still being one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-battle-royale-games">best battle royales</a>, EA aren't content with how the first-person shooter has been doing in recent times, it seems. </p>
<p>"We've had over 200 million people play the game," said Wilson. "However, the trajectory of the business of that franchise has not been headed in the direction that we have wanted for some time.</p>
<p>"[We] continue to try and test and develop more great content for that community. And I would say we have seen some progress in that, but probably not as much as we would have liked."</p>
<p>Of course, none of that means Apex Legends is going anywhere. The company still sees the series as a valuable bit of corpo-loot. Wilson himself says that "franchises that exist at this level and have this much fan love don't come along all that often."</p><p>Since appearing in 2019, Apex has gone through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/5-years-of-apex-legends-how-surreal-success-became-a-fight-to-stay-fresh">many years</a> of updates, changes, and additions. It recently added a throwback mode which simply reminded our James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-is-revisiting-the-past-but-it-should-be-prouder-of-its-present">how much better it got over time</a>. When I learned that Respawn were developing a battle royale all those years ago, my first thought was: "God, not another one". But it turned out to be my favourite in the entire genre. Whatever happens to Apex next, it's probably worth watching.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Capcom is shutting down its online multiplayer game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-reverse">Resident Evil Re:Verse</a>.</p>
<p>The spin-off game comes packaged with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> on PC via Steam, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, but from 3rd March it will be removed from online stores, as will its purchasable DLC.</p>
<p>Then, on 29th June 2025 23:59 PDT (that's 30th June 8:59 BST), the service will fully shut down.</p>

<p>"Resident Evil Re:Verse was developed in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Resident Evil series, and your overwhelming support for the game has far exceeded our expectations since the time of its release," reads a <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/reverse/us/topic/topic_250206.html">statement from Capcom</a>.</p>
<p>"Now that we've reached a new turning point for the series, we feel that Resident Evil Re:Verse has served its original, celebratory purpose admirably.</p>
<p>"We are incredibly grateful for your warm support for Resident Evil Re:Verse, and we deeply apologise for bringing you this disappointing news."</p>
<p>Any RP Boosters or content unlocked in the game's Premium Pass will be available from now until servers are shut off.</p>
<p>Though originally intended to release alongside Resident Evil Village, Re:Verse was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-reverse-resurfaces">delayed multiple times</a> before eventually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-reverse-has-a-new-october-release-date">releasing in October 2022</a> with Village's Winters Expansion DLC - that was 17 months after Village.</p>
<p>That means Re:Verse has lasted just over two years.</p>
<p>The game was a six-player deathmatch competitive multiplayer mode featuring various characters from across the Resident Evil universe.</p>
<p>Village was followed by the remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>, which is now the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-now-the-fastest-selling-resident-evil-game-in-history">fastest-selling game in the series</a>.</p>
<p>As for the next new game in the series, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> director Koshi Nakanishi stated last July a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">fresh installment is in development</a>. "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said. "But I found it, and to be honest it feels substantial."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>2K Games has removed Michael Condrey, founder and president of developer 31st Union, from his position within the studio. The news comes&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Kotaku</a>, which also says the main reason is the lack of player interest in their debut title, Project ETHOS, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/2k-announces-project-ethos-a-new-f2p-third-person-hero-shooter-with-roguelike-elements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its unveiling in October 2024</a>.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean 2K is shutting down the studio or the game. A spokesperson told Kotaku:</p>
<p><em>We are grateful to Michael Condrey for the dedication, passion, and work ethic it took to build an incredible team and shape the vision of 31st Union. Michael will be transitioning his role in the short term to focus on advising on the future of Project ETHOS. We remain very committed to the forward path for Project ETHOS and the people and culture of the 31st Union studio.</em></p>
<p>Michael Condrey was the Game Director (alongside Bret Robbins, who recently made <a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-of-aveum-director-says-sales-have-improved-lately-story-isnt-written-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortals of Aveum</a>) in Visceral's acclaimed Dead Space. Later, he co-founded Sledgehammer Games with fellow Dead Space creator Glen Schofield, where he worked on multiple Call of Duty games. For example, he directed 2017's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-wwii-a-shot-away-greatness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty WWII</a>. Later, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/31st-union-michael-condrey-2k-ambitious-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined 2K to found 31st Union</a> in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>As for Project ETHOS, the game was described as a free-to-play third-person hero shooter mixed with roguelike elements. These come in the form of Evolutions, powerful semi-randomized upgrades that are unique to each Hero. Evolutions can transform a sniper into a melee skirmisher or a support role into a powerful lone wolf. The roguelike elements mean that players take on the competition with new skills, stakes, and challenges every time they play, according to 31st Union.</p>
<p>The game will also include an extraction mode called Trials, which was described as an ongoing, persistent battle to collect cores, extract and unlock powerful Augments. There's also a built-in risk versus reward mechanic where players can either play it safe with the cores or risk everything to get to the top spot.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Chernobylite 2 Releases in Early Access in Just One Month]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/chernobylite-2-early-access-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chernobylite-2-releases-in-early-access-in-just-one-month.1101663/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/chernobylite-2-early-access-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been revealed by Farm 51 that Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone will be released on PC in early access on March 6, 2025. This surprise announcement came just weeks after a new trailer that perfectly showcases everything this post-apocalyptic-style game has to offer, from a massive open world to branching character development options.</p>



<p>The first Chernobylite game was released in 2019 and flew under the radar for a bit. It was a first-person survival game with exploration options left and right, plus a base-building ecosystem and some intense combat mechanics. While the first game is available on all platforms, Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone is entering early access exclusively on PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-zone">Enter the Zone</h2>



<p>I’m coming into Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone hot off an irradiated spree through games like STALKER 2 and Fallout, and I love it. I’m a huge fan of the first game, which looks phenomenal and offers a top-tier story and some interesting features, and I can’t wait for the second game to enter early access.</p>



<p>Chernobylite 2 has already been a hit with investors. This Kickstarter-backed title has secured 170% of what it was aiming for to bring the game to market, and there’s still a week left in the campaign. If you pledge to support the game, you’ll get access to both a beta and demo version of the game. </p>



<p>Here’s the most recent trailer for Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="KICKSTARTER LAUNCH TRAILER - Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5lRDzR54eo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>On Kickstarter, Chernobylite 2 has secured $168,400 (at the time of publishing) out of a goal of $98,678. The most exciting stretch goal hit so far introduces first-person combat to the game. In a twist, Chernobylite 2 breaks away from the first-person exclusive perspective of the 2019 opening title and opts to use a third-person perspective.</p>



<p>But now, thanks to those backing the game, you’ll be able to switch whenever you want.</p>



<p>Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone also offers fully open-world exploration, while the first game focused on smaller, more confined ‘regions’ that you could jump in and out of.</p>



<p>I’m ready for Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone – it enters early access on Steam on March 6, 2025. Are you going to give it a try? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gaming-qa-developers-not-enough/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/only-23-of-developers-believe-they%E2%80%99ve-conducted-%E2%80%98enough%E2%80%99-qa-for-new-games.1101654/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gaming-qa-developers-not-enough/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent study published by modl.ai, it was revealed that a whopping 77% of developers polled felt like they didn’t conduct enough QA for their studio’s most recent releases. Additionally, 50% of developers surveyed felt that QA budgets aren’t ‘growing fast enough’ to keep up with the ‘increasing complexity of modern games’.</p>



<p>The study was pieced together to take stock of the quality control ecosystem in the world of gaming development. It was focused primarily on gauging the adoption and anticipation of artificial intelligence in QA processes and procedures.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-ready-but-released">Not Ready But Released</h2>



<p>In recent years, we’ve seen some big-budget games released in a woeful state. More than a few titles have hit the open market in a paltry condition, boasting bugs across the board and performance issues left and right.</p>



<p>Last year, STALKER 2 was released to an eager reception but it was hampered by a stack of bugs – particularly on console platforms. In 2020, Cyberpunk 2077 was released in such a bad state that it faced legal concerns from investors.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insights.modl.ai/state-of-games-qa-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report published by modl.ai</a>, it was revealed that 94% of developers (extrapolated) believe that AI will ‘play an important role in the future of game QA’. But with that being said, it comes as a surprise that just 18% of developers feel they’re ‘fully prepared to implement AI in all QA processes’.</p>



<p>They recognise that it’s the future of QA and testing, but they’re not ready to adopt it just yet.</p>



<p>In the numbers, 70.3% of survey respondents said they’d never launched a bug-free game.</p>



<p>In a statement on the data, Dajana Dimovska, the CEO of Indium Play, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’re never going to catch every bug, but AI can get you closer. It can take on early testing responsibilities, reducing the need for large QA teams throughout the production phase.</p>



<p>As the game reaches a more playable and polished state, manual QA testers step in — working alongside AI to identify and address quality issues. This collaboration between experienced testers and AI ensures a better final product.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many are ready to place stock in the implementation of AI-based QA. In one slide in the report from modl.ai, it was revealed that 21% of developers feel that AI testing is much more effective than traditional methods.</p>



<p>Presently, the blockers preventing industry-wide adoption include the complexity of setting up and operating AI-based systems, the costs of doing so, and the resistance to change – and fear of facing redundancy.</p>



<p>Do you think more AI in QA processes would eliminate more bugs ahead of launch? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you think.</p>

<p>Later in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll be tasked with getting a treasury key before a big raid can take place. It’s one of the most important steps in the run-up to one of the game’s most major missions, so it cannot be avoided. It’s simple – <strong>you need that key</strong>.</p>



<p>However, when it comes to trying to find Vavak’s key, you’ll most likely have a hard time given the size of the search area and the lack of direction towards where it might be. In this guide, I’ll tell you where and how to find Vavak’s key in Oratores, the all-important mission in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-vavak-s-key">How to Find Vavak’s Key</h2>



<p>Despite chatting with Christian in the guarded building in Kuttenberg, you’ll likely be searching the place for ages trying to find Vavak’s key. He doesn’t know where it is, either – it’s up to you to track it down.</p>



<p>Now, you could spend the next few minutes probing the building and the search area in a desperate attempt to find the critical key, or you could follow this guide and find it in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>Firstly, you’ll need to get past the guards at the front of the building. If you have a high enough charisma level (and other skills are assigned), you can pass a skill check and you’ll simply be granted access to the site. It’ll surprise Christian, who is already inside, but if you did his earlier missions and aligned amicably with him, it won’t be a concern.</p>



<p>Otherwise, expect trouble – and more speech checks.</p>



<p>Now that you’re in the building, you’ll learn that Vavak has fled, but there’s a chance that the key might have been left behind. However, this building has several floors and rooms, along with plenty of chests and hidden nooks and crannies – it’ll take <strong>forever</strong> to search everything – and not everyone knows <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-lockpick-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/">how to pick locks</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t</strong> do that.</p>



<p>Instead, head to the ground floor and out the back door, making a beeline for the toilet that sits in the rear courtyard of the building. Inside the toilet (yes, <strong>inside</strong>) you’ll find a key sticking out of a pile of waste. That’s where Vavak’s key is in Oratores – simple.</p>



<p>Once you’ve got the key, you’ll need to wash up in a trough, otherwise people will notice your stink. But that’s it – that’s how to find Vavak’s key in Oratores. Have fun!</p>
