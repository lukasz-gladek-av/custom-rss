            <p>PlayStation's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">recently cancelled Twisted Metal game</a> was reportedly a battle royale.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/cancelled-twisted-metal-live-service-a-battle-royale-featuring-out-of-vehicle-combat">MP1st</a>, the abandoned game - known internally as Project Copper - allegedly blended third-person shooting mechanics alongside the vehicular combat the series is known for.</p>

<p>How do we know this? A UI programmer working at Firesprite from April 2022 to October 2023 has <a href="https://www.hugoflsilva.com/project/1">uploaded</a> obscured screenshots from the work-in-progress to their portfolio. Whilst the game isn't explicitly mentioned and the images are blurred, you can nonetheless still see early prototypes of the third-person action both in and out of vehicles.</p>
<p>"I was part of Project Copper leading the UI team," the developer wrote on their online portfolio. "I was tasked with creating a generic UI system to be used in multiple projects in the company, I was also managing a team of 2 UI Programmers while working with other teams."</p>

</figure>
<p>As for the game itself? The dev describes Project Copper a "third person vehicular action combat game based on a classic IP owned by PlayStation developed by Firesprite (PlayStation Studios)".</p>
<p>"It had third person shooter mechanics wrapped with third person vehicle combat with the objective of being the last one standing," they added.</p>
<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live service games</a> over the coming years. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">then-Sony exec Jim Ryan said he believed live service games were a key part of gaming's future</a>, confident in PlayStation's live service push.</p>
<p>However, since then, the company has been pulling back on this vision, with several proposed projects cancelled, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">including two more in January</a>.
</p>
<p>In related news, just last week, Peacock shared its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-twisted-metal-season-two">first trailer for the second season of Twisted Metal</a>. The upcoming second series stars Anthony Mackie, Stephanie Beatriz, Joe Seanoa, Will Arnett and Anthony Carrigan.</p>
<p>"As they try to survive an onslaught of dangerous new foes and familiar faces alike, including the murderous clown Sweet Tooth, things get complicated for John when he reunites with his long-lost sister, the vigilante Dollface," reads the official blurb.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Warhorse has <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-will-get-official-mod-support-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> official mod support&nbsp;<span>for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 soon, but in the meantime, modders continue to find ways to improve the highly successful first-person open world role-playing game that just celebrated selling</span>&nbsp;two million units in the first two weeks.</p>
<p>Nexus user nimbul recently <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/927" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a utility mod that loads configuration (CFG) variables correctly even after level loading. Without it, the game reverts to default variables. Thanks to this mod, Nexus user vktrfly worked on those variables to improve the global illumination quality in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/942" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with great results</a>, as you can see in the screenshots and the footage below.</p>

<p>According to the modder, the following two variables can be used to further enhance indirect lighting:</p>
<ul>
<li>e_svoTI_DiffuseConeWidth = 4 ; Reduces light leak, default is 8</li>
<li>e_svoTI_NumberOfBounces = 2 ; Medium performance impact. Default is 2 at Ultra and above</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter can go up to 3 but will have a greater performance impact and may not be worth it, according to the author. Still, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-polished-impeccable-smoothness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is extremely well optimized</a>, so users with the latest GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards may be tempted to try it - especially if they are subscribed to PureDark's Patreon and can, therefore, access his DLSS Multi Frame Generation mod for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K60] Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 - RTX5090 nearly REALLIFE GRAPHICS - third Person Gaming ASMR" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sb84_c3iKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There is a downside, however: this global illumination mod cannot be used in conjunction with the previously covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-async-compute-mod-performance-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Async Compute mod</a>. The author wrote:</p>
<p><em>If you encounter strobing, flickering, or pulsing lighting effects, they are not caused by this mod. Make sure you are not using AsyncCompute Enabler and e_svoTI_AsyncCompute = 1 is not in your user.cfg. AsyncCompute causes issues with global illumination, and Enhanced GI makes those issues extremely apparent.</em></p>
<p>Warhorse is currently preparing <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's first free content update</a>. Scheduled to launch in Spring, it will add barbers to change Henry's look, horse racing, and a proper Hardcore mode. Later this year, three premium DLCs will also be released.</p>

While news of <em>Legends: Z-A</em> was very welcome, what was not mentioned—nor ever rumored to be mentioned—was Pokémon’s next mainline entry. And yet, based on the pattern of the last decade-and-a-half, this should have been the day we learned of a new core title in the world’s most popular franchise, and got our first few hints about a whole new generation of pocket monsters.

Following Warner’s mishandling of so much talent and so many otherwise reliable franchises, the creatives who made great games like the <em>Middle-earth </em>series have now been caught in the crossfire. One deeply frustrating wrinkle in this is that one of Monolith Productions’ greatest claims to fame has been patented by the same company that just shut down the studio. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-middle-earth-nemesis-system-patent-1851766437&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-middle-earth-nemesis-system-patent-1851766437">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="43ccf1ba9cd6f04288fc24f775371936" data-recommend-id="image://43ccf1ba9cd6f04288fc24f775371936" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="43ccf1ba9cd6f04288fc24f775371936" data-recommend-id="image://43ccf1ba9cd6f04288fc24f775371936" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What is a role-playing game? You probably have your own definition and exceptions. And as you might expect, nearly everyone at <em>Kotaku </em>has thoughts and opinions on what is and isn’t an RPG.

The game is being positioned as the future of <em>Pokémon</em>’s competitive play, as evidenced by the teaser trailer showing players using items like Game Boy link cables to battle, all culminating in a modern-day battle between a Switch user and a mobile player in <em>Champions</em>.

Speaking of which, EA just made the code for the first four <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> games officially open source. - John Walker <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/command-conquer-ea-source-code-red-alert-generals-1851767009&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/command-conquer-ea-source-code-red-alert-generals-1851767009">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e2cf96d2267edc1d82c380a94b25ebd2" data-recommend-id="image://e2cf96d2267edc1d82c380a94b25ebd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1998" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Shovel Knight Live concert band is shown on stage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Shovel Knight Live concert band is shown on stage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e2cf96d2267edc1d82c380a94b25ebd2" data-recommend-id="image://e2cf96d2267edc1d82c380a94b25ebd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1998" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Shovel Knight Live concert band is shown on stage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On Saturday, February 22, I hiked up to the Town Hall music venue in Manhattan for Shovel Knight Live: Steel Thy Concert, in which an orchestral and rock ensemble performed tunes from Yacht Club’s hugely popular platformer.

<p>Raven Forge have announced two brand-new full-scale replica swords from Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Both Yasuke’s Wakizashi &amp; Naoe’s Tantō&nbsp;from Assassin’s Creed Shadows are <a href="https://ravenforge.com/collections/the-raven-forge-legend-collection-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available now for pre-order</a>, with Naoe’s Tantō&nbsp;costing £139.99 and Yasuke’s Wakizashi costing £199.99. </p>



<p>This isn’t the first full-scale replica from Raven Forge on Assassin’s Creed either, as late late year the company announced&nbsp;a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-scale-replica-of-assassins-creeds-altairs-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-scale replica of Assassins Creed’s Altaïr’s Sword</a> from the original game.</p>



<h2 id="h-yasuke-s-wakizashi">Yasuke’s Wakizashi&nbsp;</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The wakizashi, a revered sidearm of the samurai, was traditionally worn alongside a katana—a symbol of status, duty, and skill. This exceptional replica features an intricately wrapped faux rayskin handle and saya (scabbard), custom menuki (handle ornaments), and a tsuba inspired by the crest of the Oda clan. Every detail has been thoughtfully recreated to bring Yasuke’s weapon to life.</p>



<p><strong>Production dimensions:</strong></p>



<div><p>Full Length: 670mm<br>Blade Length: 500mm<br>Grip Length: 170mm<br>Blade Width (base): 30mm<br>Tang: Full<br>Weight: 776g<br>Materials: 3CR13 – Tempered steel<br>Edge: Blunt – Prop replica</p><p><strong>Pre-order ship date: Early August</strong></p></div>



<h2 id="h-naoe-s-tanto">Naoe’s Tantō</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>A weapon of both practicality and prestige, the tantō served as a trusted sidearm of the samurai and was also wielded with remarkable skill by the Onna-musha, the warrior women of feudal Japan. This faithful reproduction features a beautifully wrapped faux rayskin handle, ornate menuki (handle embellishments), and a strikingly detailed saya (scabbard).</p>



<p><strong>Production dimensions:</strong></p>



<div><p>Full Length: 430mm<br>Blade Length: 295mm<br>Grip Length: 128mm<br>Blade Width (base): 26mm<br>Tang: Full<br>Weight: 425g<br>Materials: 3CR13 – Tempered steel&nbsp;<br>Edge: Blunt – Prop replica</p><p><strong><strong>Pre-order ship date: Early August</strong></strong></p></div>

Survivors of many battles, they pose the biggest threat once you've reached the endgame portion of the campaign.

Here's a quick summary:</p><ul><li>Chapter 3-5: Monster Hunter is the conclusion of the story proper.</li><li>When you're done with the story, quests become more free-form. You simply need to take out targets and complete quests so you can continue to increase your Hunter Rank.</li><li>Upon reaching Hunter Rank 20, you're given the Wyvern Sparks and Rose Thorns mission, which takes you back to the Ruins of Wyveria.</li><li>This leads you to a battle against a Lala Barina that you're tracking, as well as a Guardian Fulgur Anjanath, the first Tempered Monster type that you encounter.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452184-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452184" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452184-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452184"></a><figcaption>Tempered Monsters are scarred veterans of countless battles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452184-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="How_to_track_down_Tempered_Monsters">How to track down Tempered Monsters</h3><p>The Monster Hunter Wilds Tempered Monsters offer the most difficult bouts in the game. These creatures are battle-hardened, as you can see by the scars and old wounds on their bodies. They're tougher compared to normal variants, so don't underestimate them.</p><p>If you plan on tracking down a Tempered Monster, you can do so by opening the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/monster-hunter-wilds-world-map-biomes-regions/2900-6290/" data-ref-id="2900-6290"><strong>world map biomes</strong></a> to see which ones are currently active in a particular location. You'll also notice that a blue glow/waypoint leads you to these targets, as opposed to the green-colored trails for other creatures or items.</p><h3 id="Tempered_Monster_materials">Tempered Monster materials</h3><p>The reason why you want to eliminate Tempered Monsters whenever you see them is because they grant the usual loot from their species, as well as endgame materials. These are used to craft Artian Weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds--i.e. rank 6, 7, and 8 (currently the highest tier in the game).</p><p>Once you've collected enough materials, talk to Gemma at your base and select the Forge Artian Weapons option. You'll notice some key differences here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452186-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452186-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452186"></a><figcaption>Combine parts to come up with an Artian Weapon with a certain elemental property or status ailment.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452186-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-2.jpg"></figure><h3 id="How_to_craft_Artian_Weapons">How to craft Artian Weapons</h3><p>The process of crafting Artian Weapons is vastly different compared to Low Rank or High Rank armaments. This time, you need to select three parts to develop a viable combination. Here are a few reminders:</p><ul><li>You may only select parts that have the same rarity--i.e. rank 6, 7, or 8.</li><li>Parts have an elemental property or a status ailment property.</li><li>If you pick two or more materials with the same properties, the weapon gains that effect. If all three materials have different properties, then the result will be a non-elemental gear piece.</li><li>Example: 2x Thunder and 1x Sleep results in a weapon with the Thunder element. However, if you pick 1x Thunder, 1x Sleep, and 1x Dragon, then the combination would yield a non-elemental result.</li></ul><p>It's also worth noting that weapon categories require different part classifications:</p><ul><li>Great Sword - Requires 2x blade and 1x tube.</li><li>Long Sword - Requires 1x blade and 2x tube.</li><li>Sword &amp; Shield - Requires 1x blade, 1x tube, and 1x disc.</li><li>Dual Blades - Requires 2x blade and 1x disc.</li><li>Hammer - Requires 2x disc and 1x tube.</li><li>Hunting Horn - Requires 1x disc and 2x device.</li><li>Lance - Requires 1x blade and 2x disc.</li><li>Gunlance - Requires 2x disc and 1x device.</li><li>Switch Axe - Requires 2x blade and 1x device.</li><li>Charge Blade - Requires 1x blade, 1x disc, and 1x device.</li><li>Insect Glaive - Requires 1x blade, 1x tube, and 1x device.</li><li>Light Bowgun - Requires 1x tube and 2x device.</li><li>Heavy Bowgun - Requires 1x disc, 1x tube, and 1x device.</li><li>Bow - Requires 2x tube and 1x device.</li></ul><p>That does it for our Monster Hunter Tempered Monsters and Artian Weapons guide. Once you've crafted a couple of these high-end armaments, keep eliminating tougher creatures so you can continue to increase your Hunter Rank.</p><p>Soon, rarer and more difficult Tempered Monsters will appear. Of course, this also means that you'll be able to create rank 7 and, eventually, rank 8 gear pieces.</p><p>Need more tips as you continue fighting deadly creatures and venture into lands unknown?

<p>"Once Human's cross-platform test uses the current global server environment that's being used by the PC version of the game," NetEase explains. "This means that all of the content from the PC version, including all the Scenarios and the Visional Wheel/Lunar Oracle, can be experienced by mobile players throughout the test."</p>

<p>I gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-human-review">Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it for Eurogamer</a>, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter hold it back. Since launch, however, NetEase has ramped up its premium in-game offerings, including cosmetic loot crates.</p>
<p>The developer behind NetEase's survival free-to-play horror, Once Human, recently said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">feedback it's received about the game's second season has been "quite demoralising"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Its Steam Next Fest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671570/Out_and_About/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> has all the bright colors and cheerful local people you’d expect of the genre, but the core of the game is surprisingly realistic, asking you to correctly identify various real-life plants.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Out and About - Short Steam Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3lqJUUH76B8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>At the start of the demo, a storm destroys the town where you’re visiting your grandmother. On your way from your campsite you meet the local forager, who tasks you with finding plants to heal an injured resident. Developer Yaldi Games says the game contains over 100 real-world plants; each one you find grows next to one that looks very similar. Some of these similarities are no big deal–the consequences of mixing up chamomile and daisy are fairly minor–but others have toxic lookalikes, like hemlock and yarrow.</p><p>The plant identification mini-game is pretty simple: after taking a photo of your finds (<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alas</a>), you’re given two cards with clues to each plant’s identity. Verifying which plant is which involves clicking around on the plant until you check the various details listed on the card. Then, you can harvest the plant, taking care not to take too much of its flowers and leaves. You’re also tasked with sorting the plants you’ve collected, which presents a slightly harder identification game that only gives you bits of cuttings and less clues. None of it is too taxing, but I really enjoyed studying the game’s renditions of real plants and learning about their uses.</p><p>You use the plants you’ve gathered to craft–in the demo, you make a stinging nettle soup, a green I’ve sometimes seen at the farmer’s market and never understood why people buy, and which I am now really curious to use; thanks, video games! You sell the stuff you craft at the local market, where customers come to you with various needs that can be met by your snacks, balms, and medicines. Again, it’s not too hard, but it’s fun to think about what might be best for the townsfolk from your stock. Yaldi writes that “All 150+ recipes in the game are real, and we'll give you step-by-step instructions on how to make them at home,” which sounds very cool. (The game also opens with a giant-font warning that it is not a guide to real-life foraging, which feels like a very necessary caveat.)</p><p>Aesthetically, <em>Out and About</em> looks like the kind of game I tend to find a little too twee, but your mileage will vary there given your own personal tastes. In a press release, Yaldi described itself as having "a mission to craft hobby games infused with real, actionable knowledge that enriches players' lives." I’m intrigued by that claim to fidelity and really enjoyed what I experienced of it in the demo. The full game is set to release later this year.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-warner-bros-monolith-wonder-woman"><h3>Major Publishers Can’t Keep Making Fewer, Bigger Games</h3></a><p>"Destined to fail.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/new-minecraft-movie-lego-sets-where-to-buy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO announced earlier this year that we'd be getting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-movie-lego-sets-gives-insight-into-which-mobs-will-appear-in-the-jack-black-film">new Minecraft Movie sets</a>, and the time has finally come for them to be released into the world. There are four new Minecraft sets that you can now buy, with two of them featuring scenes from the upcoming film. These new sets are added to an ever-growing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-minecraft-sets">list of LEGO Minecraft sets</a> that have been accumulating over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the new Minecraft Movie sets features minifigure mobs, but only two of the sets offer up a tiny Jack Black as Steve. You can currently purchase all of these sets from Amazon, LEGO direct, or any of the other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-sets">best places to buy LEGO</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New LEGO Minecraft Sets Available Now</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Although there are four new LEGO Minecraft sets coming out, the two that are associated with the movie are The Ghast Balloon Village Attack and Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring. Both sets give us an idea of what to expect from the upcoming film. The Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring depicts some sort of gladiator style battle with Jason Momoa fighting a baby zombie on a chicken. Meanwhile the Ghast Balloon Village Attack set reveals a marshamallow-like villain from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Nether">Nether</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other two Minecraft sets that are releasing are The Parrot Houses and The Trial Chamber. For more like these, you can check out more of our favorite LEGO Minecraft sets.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Does the New Minecraft Movie Come Out?</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO tends to release new sets tied to movie releases about a month before the actual release of the film. The new Minecraft sets are following the same timeline by coming out on March 1 seeing as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/a-minecraft-movie">A Minecraft movie</a> is hitting theaters on April 4, 2025.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Will There Be More Minecraft Movie Sets?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">So far the two sets we've featured above are the only ones set to release alongside the film. It's possible this could change if the live-action Minecraft movie is a success. Either way, there are new LEGO Minecraft sets released fairly consistently and we can likely expect more to release later this year, even if it isn't directly tied to the movie.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/621706/sayonara-wild-hearts-ps5-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Of all of my favorite games, <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> might be the hardest to describe. It’s a rhythm game, but also you ride on a motorcycle and a dragon, wield giant swords while dodging fireballs, and teleport to a retrofuturistic VR world. It’s structured like a pop album, telling a story of love and loss, and is narrated by Queen Latifah. It’s <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> meets <em>R-Type</em> crossed with <em>Rhythm Heaven</em> as directed by Carly Rae Jepsen. It makes sense once you play it, trust me.</p><p>This was all true <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882183/sayonara-wild-hearts-interview-switch-ps4-apple-arcade-simogo">when the game first launched in 2019 on the Switch and PS4</a> (it was also on Apple Arcade, but has since been removed). But now is a good time to check it out if you haven’t. The game just launched on the PS5 — it’s a free upgrade if you have it on PS4 — which adds some performance improvements and a new endless mode called remix arcade that you can read more about <a href="https://simogo.com/work/sayonara-wild-hearts/sayonara-wild-hearts-remix-arcade/">here</a>. Really, though, the new platform is just an excellent excuse to dive back into this world.</p><p><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> follows the story of a young heartbroken woman who is transported to an alternate realm where she must restore harmony by collecting lots of hearts. To do this, you play through a series of 23 short levels, doing everything from racing through city streets to fighting biker gangs to flying amid the ruins of a destroyed city. It’s an arcade-style game, where you’re racing through levels in search of a high score (which you get by collecting hearts and other items), and most of what you’re doing is in time to the beat of the dreamy pop music that plays throughout.</p><p>The game only lasts around two hours, but it packs so much into that space. What you’re doing is <em>constantly</em> changing. Vehicles shift from skateboards to motorcycles to cars to human flight to dragons, and there are about a half dozen different styles of games, from old-school arcade shooters to early 3D platformers to racing games. Almost all of those genres are then filtered through the lens of rhythm action, for a twitchy experience that feels very cohesive. It’s also pretty approachable. If you keep failing a section — like me during any of the first-person driving sequences — you have the option to simply skip it and move on.</p><p>Just as important, <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> is incredibly stylish. The dream world is slick and beautiful, rendered in pinks, blues, and purples, with characters that dance as they fight and, uh, mechs made out of robotic wolves. It’s as weird as it is cool, and it’s carried by an incredible pop soundtrack from composers Daniel Olsén and Jonathan Eng, alongside vocalist Linnea Olsson. It’s all bangers, and I’m listening to it right now as I write this story.</p><p>Just like a great album, <em>Sayonara</em> is something I find myself coming back to again and again. I’ve replayed it several times over the last six years, and each time, I’ve been struck by just how bold it is. Those feelings haven’t been diminished over time. It helps that it’s just the right length so you can easily soak it all in.</p><p>If you haven’t heard of <em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> before, you might be surprised to learn that it comes from Simogo, the same Swedish studio behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24157530/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-switch-steam">last year’s cryptic noir puzzler <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a>. If you <em>have</em> heard of Simogo, well, then nothing will really surprise you. The studio’s games have covered everything from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/21/4013456/year-walk-iphone-ipad-vision-quest-game">folklore horror</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/21/4013456/year-walk-iphone-ipad-vision-quest-game">audio dramas</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/17/4844472/device-6-iphone-ipad-report">interactive spy novels</a>. It’s an eclectic lineup, but also one that’s impressively consistent and inventive, and <em>Sayonara</em> might just be the team at the height of its creativity.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It made me respect integrated graphics, and it convinced me a Windows tablet can be fun. </p><p>The <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/">Asus ROG Flow Z13</a> is a 13-inch tablet with a detachable keyboard, a bright screen, and the guts of a gaming laptop. I knew it was something special when I used a clamp-on controller to turn a preproduction model into some kind of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment">superpowered, supersized Steam Deck</a>. In daily use, it’s more like a husky <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24191243/microsoft-surface-pro-11-oled-review">Surface Pro</a>, with an AMD Strix Halo processor featuring powerful integrated graphics for gaming and a battery that lasts a full workday in non-gaming tasks. It’s a charming and versatile device that could plausibly replace a desktop, laptop, <em>and</em> a tablet or handheld for a certain type of PC gamer — one who doesn’t mind the $2,100 starting price.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->2100</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Impressive game performance for an iGPU on a tablet</li><li>Capable 2.5K performance</li><li>Laptop-quality keyboard and trackpad</li><li>Battery can get through a day of work (with no gaming breaks)</li><li>Play games on your lap without heating up your legs</li><li>Excellent kickstand</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Still a pricey, niche device</li><li>Wish the keyboard cover had Bluetooth like the latest Surface Pro</li><li>Power / sleep button is too flush</li><li>No auto-brightness</li><li>Keyboard case sometimes not detected after waking from sleep</li><li>Single-zone keyboard RGB looks basic</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The ROG Flow Z13 is a tablet that’s also trying to be a hardcore gaming machine. It has a 13.4-inch, 180Hz IPS touchscreen with pen support, 32GB of unified memory (up to 128GB), a 1TB m.2 SSD, and ample port selection, starting at $2,099.99. The Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 APU in our $2,299.99 review unit offers surprisingly good gaming performance, especially for a <em>tablet</em>. And the detachable keyboard with larger keycaps and trackpad feels like it’s pulled directly from the excellent ROG Zephyrus laptops. It makes for a potent portable gaming device — one you can even use on your lap without your legs burning up. </p><p>I used it keyboardless on the couch for a Discord movie and game night with some buds, and it left enough space on my lap for my cat to curl up. I stuck it on my desk, between my giant 4K monitor and my mechanical keyboard, and it doubled as my desktop computer and a handy secondary screen. I even plugged it into my TV like a game console — one with much better graphics than any docked handheld. The ability to do all these things makes it a lot of fun.</p><div id=":R32rarr6:"><div><div><p><figcaption><em>It’s a great second screen to a large monitor.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Or a console for a giant TV.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><div><p><figcaption><em>But it’s coziest when chilling on your lap around the house.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>The Flow Z13’s Strix Halo processor is very capable in graphics-heavy games at its native 2560 x 1600-inch resolution. Don’t expect extras like path tracing, but <em>do </em>expect solid framerates in the 50 to 60-plus fps range on low-to-medium settings. In games that support FSR 3 and frame generation, you can push things further: with those scaling options enabled, <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>hit over 60fps and even pushed into the 70s at high settings on a 4K external monitor.</p><p>I’ve also played a bunch of <em>Elden Ring </em>on the Z13. (I blame the recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts"><em>Nightreign</em> network test</a> for giving me the itch again.) At native resolution, it was consistently in the 50fps range on high settings, and at 1200p, it hit the game’s 60fps ceiling. By comparison, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22989540/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-windows-specs-review">first Z13, back in 2022</a>, could barely muster 30fps at 1200p on medium settings in the Lands Between. That wasn’t far off from the much cheaper and less powerful Steam Deck, which tops out around 40fps at 800p and medium settings, with plenty of framerate dips. </p><p><em>Elden Ring</em> remains <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcharts%2Fsteamdecktopplayed" rel="sponsored">one of the most-played titles</a> on Valve’s $400 handheld. But it’s <em>so much </em>better on the new ROG Flow, and the delta between the Z13 and the Steam Deck is now much wider. You can even play for around 90 minutes on battery on the Z13, as opposed to 70 minutes on the Steam Deck. The Steam Deck is cheaper and comfier to use, but it’s also another device to keep track of. The Z13’s detachable keyboard gives it some of the play-anywhere benefit of the Steam Deck while still being good for other things. If the Z13 just had dedicated controllers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment">like I tried to adapt</a>, it’d be like a Super Steam Deck.</p><div id=":R52rarr6:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The screen isn’t OLED, but it’s a great looking 180Hz IPS panel.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The design is fun and gamer-y without feeling edgelord.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>This is the first device of any kind we’ve tested that uses AMD’s new Ryzen AI Max <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337025/amd-ryzen-ai-max-strix-halo-fire-range-9955hx3d">Strix Halo</a> processors, which combine speedy CPU cores like the ones on AMD’s Strix Point processors with AMD’s most powerful integrated graphics cores. It also gives this Z13 much better battery life than previous models. It lasted a very respectable 10 hours in our battery rundown test, and I could get through an eight to nine-hour workday if I wasn’t reckless (no games, around 200 to 300 nits brightness, power efficiency mode, and battery saver at 30 percent).

Asus’s upcoming 2025 <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g14-2025/wtb/">ROG Zephyrus G14</a> will be 0.63 inches thick and 3.46 pounds, which is slightly lighter and thinner than the chonky-for-a-tablet Z13. Hefty as the Z13 is, its compact size and rigid build make it feel more portable and knockaround-friendly than you’d expect. The sturdy kickstand really helps when toting it around the house or repositioning it, since you can stick your hands under it and lift with support from your forearms, as opposed to just your fingers. It’s still best thought of as a gaming laptop with a detachable keyboard, but it’s surprising how much more flexible that makes it. </p><p>The Z13 also has a 5-megapixel webcam and 13-megapixel rear-facing camera. You’d have to be deranged to take actual pictures with the rear camera on a Windows tablet; it’s mostly useful for showing people things on video calls. The dual speakers are workable but don’t offer a particularly full sound, especially at the low end, and you may accidentally block one when holding it in landscape orientation. And the chunky 200W power adapter uses Asus’ reversible proprietary connector (it supports 100W Power Delivery via its USB-C 4 ports, as well).</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->8</strong><span><figcaption><em>Just for fun, here’s the Z13 and an older 13-inch iPad Pro. The Asus is certainly a chonk by comparison.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>As a tablet that makes a plausible gaming laptop and even desktop, the ROG Flow Z13 is as close to an all-in-one device as there is right now. And like any all-in-one, it’s expensive and it makes some compromises compared to more traditional devices — price being the most obvious. You can spend less money on a more powerful (and even more compact) gaming laptop like the Zephyrus G14, or you can go the other way and get a desktop and a Steam Deck. But there’s something about the Flow that’s charming and joyful<strong>.</strong> If it weren’t quite so expensive, I’d be tempted to buy it instead of a traditional gaming laptop and handheld.</p><p>The Strix Halo chip inside the Z13 may end up being a bigger deal than the tablet itself. That’s already evidenced by its implementation in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/619605/framework-desktop-preview-hands-on">Framework’s endearing little Desktop</a> and more <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339771/i-lifted-128gb-of-memory-and-the-most-powerful-integrated-graphics-with-one-hand">traditional laptops</a> on their way. But, for now, this intriguing chip takes one of the quirkiest and coolest tablet-laptop hybrids and makes it more powerful, more efficient, and a lot more compelling.</p><div><div><p id="asus-rog-flow-z13-specs-as-reviewed"><h2>Asus ROG Flow Z13 specs (as reviewed)</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Display: </strong>13.4-inch (2560 x 1600) 180Hz IPS touchscreen, 500 nits</span></li><li><span><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 (16 cores, up to 5.1 GHz)</span></li><li><span><strong>GPU:</strong> AMD Radeon 8060S (40 cores)</span></li><li><span><strong>Unified memory:</strong> 32GB LPDDR5X</span></li><li><span><strong>Storage:</strong> 1TB NVMe M.2 PCIe 4.0 (2230)</span></li><li><span><strong>Webcam:</strong> 5MP front, 13MP rear, Windows Hello</span></li><li><span><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4</span></li><li><span><strong>Ports:</strong> 2x USB 4 (Type-C) with Power Delivery / DisplayPort, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 (Type-A), HDMI 2.1, 3.5mm combo audio jack, microSD card slot (UHS-II)</span></li><li><span><strong>Weight:</strong> 2.65 pounds (3.5 pounds with keyboard)</span></li><li><span><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11.81 x 8.03 x 0.51 inches (0.59 inches with keyboard)</span></li><li><span><strong>Battery:</strong> 70Wh</span></li><li><span><strong>Power adapter:</strong> 200W, proprietary connector</span></li><li><span><strong>Price:</strong> $2,299.99</span></li></ul></div></div><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

It’s Pokémon Day, which commemorates the anniversary of the launch of the original <em>Pokemon Red</em> and <em>Green </em>in Japan in 1996. Each year, The Pokémon Company puts on a livestream to talk about upcoming games, updates on current ones, and other projects within the franchise. Last year’s was a little lowkey because it was the first year in a while that Game Freak didn’t release a new RPG or DLC, but this year, the studio is releasing <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, the second installment in the <em>Legends </em>subseries set in Kalos.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Star Wars: Republic Commando is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, March 1, 2025. Below, we look at how its focus on military fiction was a sign of things to come to the Star Wars galaxy .</em></p><p dir="ltr">When you boot up Star Wars: Republic Commando, the first thing you see is the LucasArts logo, fuzzy like a jammed radio signal. It flickers with the audio of muttered orders, of droid speak. This is an idea taken from the original Clone Wars cartoons (starting in 2003), which also opens with a distorted broadcast, in that case of blaster fire and blaring lightsabers. In tandem, these aesthetic flourishes represent a turn away from the science fantasy mythicism of Star Wars proper and a turn toward a grittier, though still exaggerated, military fiction.</p><p dir="ltr">To be fair, it is not as if these impulses were not in Star Wars to begin with. Though A New Hope draws on the science fiction golden age idealism of Flash Gordan serials, it is a worn down future. Our heroes are would-be guerrilla militants, piloting buckets of bolts. Their fascist enemies reserve any futurist slickness. The fight of rebels is scrappy, hidden in trees and sequestered in backwater planets.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker are not ordinary soldiers, but heroes (nomenclature used by a Star Wars video game contemporary to Republic Commando: Battlefront 2). The original trilogy, and to a large extent the prequels, take a similar position to war as The Lord of the Rings. Epic battles often take the forefront, and both franchises are undoubtedly concerned with war. But the heroes are not boots-on-the-ground infantry or even military commanders exactly, but kings and prodigal children. They save the world, while rebels and fascists alike die in the dirt.</p><p dir="ltr">Republic Commando represents something more mundane: the everyday life of a soldier at war. The game's obvious principle inspiration, outside of Star Wars itself, is Halo. Like that FPS, Republic Commando goes to great pains to make its titular characters special boys, a cut above the ordinary clones who make up the rest of the Galactic Republic's army. But also, the commandos can't get up to anything too earth-shattering or else interfere with the films their game ties in with. In practical terms, the plot of Star Wars itself would not change if every one of the commandos died in a ditch. The effect is like a bit of propaganda: You are the heroes that preserve the republic, although in actuality, you are just more bodies to line the future Emperor's checkbook.</p><div tabindex="0"

Even though it was released before Episode III revealed the looming threat of Order 66, the clone troopers were still destined to become the Empire's stormtroopers. (Yes, I'm aware the Empire swaps to a more standard military recruitment strategy in its early days. To this criticism I have just one response: Shut up, nerd.) At game's end, the commandos suffer a senseless loss of their sniper, Sev, only for their Jedi commanders to order them to a new position, forcing the squad to leave their teammate behind. This is not the loss of some pawn with the same visage and personality as every one of his brothers. This is an individual loss of someone with a soul of his own, however cliched or simplistic.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this neatly anticipates Dave Filoni's The Clone Wars show, which grants whole platoons and battalions the same attention this game provided an elite squad. The game's commandos even appear in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz3wpkCt2Ms">one episode</a>, but they also are predecessors to many of The Clone Wars' original characters, especially The Bad Batch, who were first conceptualized before the series' cancelation on Cartoon Network but re-appeared as part of the series' revitalization on Disney+ and then on their own spin-off show. Like the commandos, the Bad Batch are a squad of specialized personalities defined by their skill in battle. The Bad Batch are not the first of such characters to appear in The Clone Wars, but are a small unit, defined by their relationships to each other, in a way that echoes Republic Commando.</p><p dir="ltr">But The Clone Wars' sense of wartime tragedy is even more heightened. The Battle of Umbara arc follows Anakin Skywalker's 501st clone battalion after he is called away on a special mission. The general who replaces him pushes the clones toward senseless losses for a secret agenda. The whole thing is the plight of the clones in miniature. They are all dying for a cause they are incapable of actually choosing, that demands they turn against their friends and comrades with the flick of a switch.</p><p dir="ltr">The show's final run on Disney+ pushes this to its logical conclusion, dramatizing Order 66 itself. Anakin's apprentice, Ahsoka, watches her friends turn on her and she saves her mentor, Captain Rex, but the rest of the clones accompanying her die in the encounter. This could be the substance of a Metal Gear Solid backstory, as it explores the same issues: duty to your loyalties vs. the substance of your conscience, love on the battlefield or a bullet in the gut. The plight of the clone is the plight of the idealized, fictional, unreal soldier.</p><p dir="ltr">Republic Commando is hardly a serious engagement with these themes, but it's all there in uniformed shadows. Its influence is felt across the next 20 years of Star Wars, from the sometimes strict military fiction of Clone Wars to the guerrilla warfare drama of Andor to Dave Filoni's partial stewardship of the franchise (though I'll believe that Mandalorian movie is happening when I am in the theater watching it). All these examples share the same sorts of dead ends. No matter how Republic Commandos dressed itself up in blaster fire and Halo-style heroics, all that awaits its heroes is death. That's as true for them as it is for Captain Rex as it is for Andor or Anakin Skywalker.</p>
