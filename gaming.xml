            <p>
There's a strong chance a good few of you out there saw that initial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingmakers">Kingmakers</a> trailer from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingmakers-mashes-the-medieval-era-with-modern-weapons-and-its-trailer-is-a-viral-sensation">last year</a> and thought "I'll take a piece of that pie." You came pretty close to getting your slice too, as it was due out next week on October 8th… except the devs have announced that it's been delayed. Indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/543369627969783348?l=english">Steam news post</a>, Redemption Road apologised for not meeting the release date before explaining why the delay is taking place. "In short: it's an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don't want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door earlier." The post notes how the team is 80% engineers, and that they set out to make the game with a goal of making sure the game runs at a true 60 frames per second even on midrange PCs, "without the need for fake frames."
</p>
<p>
Redemption Road further explained all the things that supposedly makes the game so complicated, with battles featuring "tens of thousands of soldiers," and there being "giant 6 story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed… Every mission takes place in a massive map that each player on the server is free to explore - with or without their own personal army of thousands. We set out to do all of this, with full drop-in/drop-out 4 player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it."
</p>
<p>
As mentioned, this is an indefinite delay, there was no suggestion from Redemption Road as to when it could possibly come out. Still, a delay less than a week from release is pretty surprising just because of how close it actually is. Looking at the game itself, I do feel less surprised.
</p><p>
There really are just a metric tonne of NPCs on screen at any one time, there's anachronistic guns, tanks, and cars, you can build stuff, a lot of moving parts are clearly at play here! Good look to the devs.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> has been out for - hang on, let me just check my calendar… crikey, that long? - four years now, and despite being a behemoth of a game that I could never imagine seeing absolutely all of, I imagine there are some of you out there that have and crave new ways to go about that. So how about a mod! One which doesn't exactly turn you into Geralt of Rivia, but does at least let you fight like everybody's favourite witcher.
</p>
<p>
This particular mod comes from therealsqueam (as opposed to the fake squeam you've been hearing about), and is quite simply titled "<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/8707">Witcher - Moveset Mod</a>" (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fight-like-a-witcher-in-elden-ring-thanks-to-this-ingenious-moveset-mod/">PCGamer</a>). There's even a little video showcasing the mod from therealsqueam that you can check out below, but I'll tell you the important bits here too. The mod has three main bits, essentially. You get two swords, one steel for dealing with a majority of enemies, the other silver for handling the undead, and for the third part there's signs, those witchery spells Geralt uses.
</p>

<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Witcher Moveset Showcase - Elden Ring" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vUTwY8X3u_M?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTwY8X3u_M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
Both swords play the same, though they do come with different Ashes of War. The sword combat does admittedly move quite similarly to how Geralt does, there's a nice flow to it and almost a dancer-like quality as well.
</p>
<p>
Now, the signs. For Aard, using a little FP sends out a small shockwave, and charging it up results in a greater area of effect for more damage. Then there's Axii. When you're in range of an enemy, casting it on them will bring them to your side, though it does have a wind-up meaning you should exercise caution.
</p><p>
While you can typically be quite defensive in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>, that's not the case in The Witcher 3, so for that there's Quen. Using this one briefly raises poise and reduces damage, and light attacks won't affect you. After you've been hit five times, it explodes for some added damage too. 
</p>
<p>
Igni is the steel sword's Ash of War and is pretty simple, you just shoot out fire! But you can also add a flame buff to your sword. Switching to the silver sword lets you use the final sign, Yrden, which does a couple different things too. One is placing a sign on the ground that heals you, which also lures in enemies, dealing lethal damage to revenants and wraiths. You can also cast a holy buff on your sword to prevent undead reviving.
</p>
<p>
It's a very neat mod overall! Clearly well thought out and put together, and seems worth a punt if you like the idea of a more witchery take on Elden Ring.

              <p>We’re sure you’re already aware of this, but the next three months are basically one huge shopageddon. Halloween candy, costumes, and decorations lead straight into the biggest food shopping week of the year before Thanksgiving, following immediately by Black Friday and Cyber Week. Normally that would mean either a long, grueling trek of in-person shopping, or online shopping with so many tabs open your laptop cries uncle.</p>
<p>Or, you could do it all in one location, either online or in any of over 600 location nationwide, when you get a Sam’s Club membership. Getting access to the all-in-one warehouse giant should come at a premium cost just for the convenience and amazing prices, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/">right now at StackSocial you can get a one-year Club membership for just $15.</a> That even less than the usual discounted price offered by StackSocial, and you’ll easily recoup that $15 just in the gas you’d burn through hitting all those shopping stops if you weren’t a Sam’s Club member.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

Everything you need for a Thanksgiving feast, from the turkey to the fresh vegetables, desserts, and beverages? Check — Sam’s Club has it. Everything on your Black Friday and Cyber Week lists — the latest tech gear, home goods, clothes, toys, even the tree and decorations? Again, check. All you need is a membership to have in-person or online access to it all, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/">that’s just $15 right now at StackSocial</a>.</p>
<p>You would think that was a comprehensive enough list to get anyone to sign up, but it’s just scratching the surface of what a Sam’s Club membership gives you access to. Sam’s Club has amazing services like auto tire replacement, pharmacy, vision and hearing services, travel, custom cakes and cupcakes, even home installations and warranties, and all at amazing members-only prices.</p>



<h2>Rewards Await</h2>
<p>Sam’s Club pricing and utterly incredible inventory and range of goods and services create the ultimate one-stop shopping destination, and the more you use your membership, the more you get back in the form of Sam’s Cash. Each Sam’s Club purchase earns you 2% back in Sam’s Cash, which adds up quickly to cut down on your next shopping excursion or membership renewal in a big way.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/">This $15 offer for a year of Club membership at Sam’s Club</a> is good for new members and anyone who has joined within the past 6 months, and there is a 1 membership purchase limit per person. You also sign up to auto-renew your membership at regular price. But once you see for yourself the incredible range of groceries, goods, tools, clothes, services, and more that this $15 StackSocial deal gets you, you’ll be happy to keep your Sam’s Club membership for years to come.</p>

            <p>
Remember last month when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nine-sols">Nine Sols</a> developer Red Candle Games started teasing… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-devs-behind-nine-sols-tease-a-possible-follow-up-with-a-mysterious-fictitious-creepypasta-video-essay">something</a>… related to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">Metroidvania</a>? That something leaned much more into the studio's horror origins, and as it turns out has developed into a whole entire ARG. I won't dive into every last detail of said ARG, you can go down that rabbit hole yourself. However it has led to something interesting: Red Candle Games have hidden an entirely new game within Nine Sols.
</p>
<p>
To unlock this game within a game isn't particularly complicated. After making sure you have the game installed, head to the Betas tab in the game's properties. Here, just type in "shanhaiarchive" and a download will start letting you play what is essentially a completely different, relatively short, first-person horror game. According to the devs themselves, this strange little game tasks you to save someone called Yuuki - the beta branch itself is titled "yuukimindscape." It's also worth noting that this appears to be a limited-time event, so if you might want to carve out some time for it.
</p>
<p>
Also worth noting is that this game-within-a-game may spoil some story elements of Nine Sols, so if this has you so curious that you want to play it even if you haven't played the original, keep that in mind if you're particularly spoiler averse. I'll avoid going into any of that here so that you can experience it all as fresh as possible.
</p>
<p>
It's still not particularly clear if this is leading to something else, like a sequel or a spin-off of some kind, but I'm deeply into it. Nine Sols felt like quite the change in tone for Red Candles Games, their first two works <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detention">Detention</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a> both sitting in the horror genre, so I'm finding this quite a clever use of their own skills.
</p>
<p>
In any case, Nine Sols is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/">half off on Steam</a> from now until October 6th as part of the autumn sales, so it's a good time to get on board the mystery train.

            <p>Redemption Road's time-travelling bring-an-assault-rifle-to-a-medieval-sword-fight shooter and strategy game, Kingmakers, has been indefinitely delayed.</p>
<p>Redemption stated it pushed the release to ensure it does not "cut any planned features for the sake of getting it out of the door earlier" and apologised for "letting [players] down".</p>

<p>"After much contemplation, we realise that the scheduled Kingmakers launch on October 8 will no longer be possible. We want to apologise to all of the fans who are eagerly anticipating this game. We are sorry for letting you down," the studio said in a statement posted to social media.</p><p>"Why is Kingmakers being delayed? In short, it's an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don't want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door earlier. Our goal, from the start, has been to create something that's nothing like anything else on the market, in terms of gameplay, scale, scope, and interactivity."</p> <div>

<p>The statement goes on to say that Redemption Road "pushed the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits", while still providing "true 60fps to mid-range PCs, without the need for fake frames".</p>
<p>"We are an 80% engineering team, who got into this business to push technological barriers," the team added, before describing how the game has "tens of thousands of soldiers" each with AI and pathfinding that "rivals what you'd expect from a AAA person shooter" and how players can enter every room in its six-story castles.</p>
<p>"Every mission takes place in a giant, massive map that each player on the server is free to explore – with or without their own personal army of thousands," Redemption added. "We set out to do all of this, with full drop-in/drop-out four-player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a little bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it."</p>
<p>The statement closed on promising that the studio would shortly present a half-hour-long deep dive on Kingmaker's gameplay, "with a comprehensive overview of everything we've been working on".</p>
<p>Donlan was certainly impressed when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingmakers-is-the-glorious-embodiment-of-one-of-gamings-most-powerful-rules-and-i-am-here-for-it">Kingsmakers memorable teaser dropped</a>, writing: "Over the last decade or so, alongside the bigger, fewer bets publishers have made - which has also often led to formula, to conservatism - an onward march in graphical fidelity means that a certain kind of game has become obsessed with the details. I love details, and I love that games do this."</p><p>Kingmakers may not be out yet, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/time-travelling-bring-a-gun-to-a-sword-fight-kingmakers-isnt-even-out-yet-and-its-getting-movie-adaptation">it's already secured a movie adaptation</a>. The studio said it was "absolutely thrilled" that the unreleased game was "making its way to the big screen" in partnership with publisher tinyBuild and Story Kitchen.</p>

<figure data-uuid="436cf77138e7c"><a title="Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/436cf77138e7c/z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ever since The Pokémon Company uttered the name <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, one idea has obsessively swirled around my mind: I <em>needed</em> to declare my favourite Pokémon for each letter in the alphabet, in reverse alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Anyone else? Just me? <em>And why?</em> I don’t know, because what I thought would be a fun, breezy exercise ended up being an endless toil of picking between my favourite children. It taught me what a Pokémon must feel when inflicted with paralysis.</p>
<p>In the end, there could only be 26 winners, though. These were the victors.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fihxzjt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<div><div><h2>Z: Zorua</h2>
<figure data-uuid="ffab312bf9898"><a title="Z" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ffab312bf9898/z.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Zorua is the rare Pokémon that’s never felt like a commodity. True to its nature as an elusive master of illusions, this sly fox has remained difficult to obtain in most games it's appeared in, making it still feel special a decade and a half since its debut.</p>
<p>If I could have one Pokémon as a pet, Zorua would be the one, if only for the mischief that would ensue.</p>
</div><div><h2>Y: Yamask</h2>
<figure data-uuid="c2938a1fa899c"><a title="Y" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c2938a1fa899c/y.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Pokémon has plenty of monsters that become quite disturbing once you learn their nature, but Yamask just about takes the cake.</p>
<p>It’s quite literally a human soul that carries around a mask of its former face. This begs some questions, such as why every human that turned into a Yamask looked the same, but my spine is tingling enough without going there.</p>
</div><div><h2>X: Xerneas</h2>
<figure data-uuid="892fa3ad3e75d"><a title="X" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/892fa3ad3e75d/x.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>I never had a chance to catch Xerneas as Generation VI is the only mainline entry that I didn’t play through to completion (I’ll carry that great shame). However, that doesn’t stop me from adoring its handsome majesty.</p>
<p>Many people have drawn the comparison between it and the Forest Spirit in <strong>Princess Mononoke</strong>, and as I see it, Game Freak was doing something right if it’s getting comparisons to Studio Ghibli.</p>
</div><div><h2>W: Wiglett</h2>
<figure data-uuid="30ea5145bcbcf"><a title="W" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30ea5145bcbcf/w.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Do I like Wiglett because it’s an absolutely ridiculous pseudo-variant-but-not-actually of Diglett? You bet.</p>
<p>Do I take Wiglett seriously? Absolutely not, but that’s also why I love this notoriously long white eel and its clown nose (mouth?). They knew what they were doing here.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/pokemon/related-articles:153789 @ 1759605130 -->
</div><div><h2>V: Vikavolt</h2>
<figure data-uuid="0b157de233a2e"><a title="V" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b157de233a2e/v.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>When you catch an unassuming Grubbin at the start of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_sun_and_moon">Sun &amp; Moon</a>, you don’t expect to wait through a majority of the game for it to evolve to its final form.</p>
<p>However, Vikavolt is all the more special for the love and time investment. It became a powerful force in my first playthrough’s Elite 4 team, the only time I can recall a bug-type Pokémon making that cut.</p>
</div><div><h2>U: Umbreon</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e24f6757d26df"><a title="U" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e24f6757d26df/u.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/pokemon_gold_and_silver">Gold &amp; Silver</a> released, I was at a point in my boyhood where the rule of cool reigned supreme. This meant I loved dark types, and chief among these was Umbreon.</p>
<p>Turns out I never grew out of that phase, as this Eeveelution still has that same impact on me to this day. It exudes a cool, collected mystique and slight threat of brutality that pairs perfectly with just how adorable it is. Maybe I’d take an Umbreon as a pet over a Zorua, actually.</p>
</div><div><h2>T: Typhlosion</h2>
<figure data-uuid="48f0cc155efd5"><a title="T" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/48f0cc155efd5/t.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>I feel like Typhlosion’s goofy 3D model with its flame collar retracted makes you either love it more or feel like it lost its edge. That unintentional duality makes me fall squarely in the former camp.</p>
<p>This lanky bipedal badger keeps it chill when it’s not turning up the heat, making it the perfect companion to start your Johto journey with. (Though, as a self-proclaimed water trainer back in the day, it was regrettably not my pick. Speaking of which…)</p>
</div><div><h2>S: Squirtle</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e8772f3e601cf"><a title="S" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e8772f3e601cf/s.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>The 'S' category is unbelievably stacked for me, yet Squirtle still clears with ease. The turtle was my #1 from the moment <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon</a> came to North America. I’ll never forget lugging a gargantuan Squirtle pillow with me everywhere for a good year in the late 1990s. There’s no beating a core memory like that.</p>
<p>This is why some of us will never entirely grow past Generation 1.</p>
</div><div><h2>R: Rattata</h2>
<figure data-uuid="31d0dfc450d88"><a title="R" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/31d0dfc450d88/r.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t think Rattata is the 'R' Pokémon most people would even consider singling out, and definitely not the one I expected to pick coming into this list. But, core memories once again kicked in, this time regarding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/evolving-with-pokemon-how-the-games-helped-me-navigate-a-confused-childhood">my cul-de-sac adventures</a> where neighbourhood kids would call me “Rattatray.”</p>
<p>I hated it then, but it’s only made me grow more affectionate to the little guy over the years. We know the same mockery.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/pokemon/related-articles:163492 @ 1759605130 -->
</div><div><h2>Q: Quagsire</h2>
<figure data-uuid="642a2cdb43162"><a title="Q" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/642a2cdb43162/q.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>The selection of 'Q' Pokémon is admittedly lacking, but don’t let that fool you into thinking Quagsire hasn’t earned its spot on this list. This unassuming, friendly doofus loafs about without a care in the world. At this moment in history, I have to admit I’m envious.</p>
</div><div><h2>P: Pikachu</h2>
<figure data-uuid="4d2c701117765"><a title="P" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4d2c701117765/p.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t think you’ll find many people who dislike Pikachu, but I wonder how many dedicated fans would actually consider it a favourite. I guess you can count me as one.</p>
<p>Its mascot status has afforded it an amount of personality and depictional variety that is unmatched among its over 1,000 peers. I’ll never get sick of its overpowered anime antics, or its many costumes (<a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10086-101/pikachu-celebrations-intern-pikachu-poke-plush-7-in?srsltid=AfmBOopt-75AOXGFt3kGOijLDGzvPGhFxSA5AzHyH6cT07Kn4RQcyclt">Business Pikachu</a> forever), or actors in bouncy Pikachu costumes swarming the streets of Japanese cities in unison. It’s iconic for a reason.</p>
</div><div><h2>O: Ogerpon</h2>
<figure data-uuid="bf6bbd262125b"><a title="O" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bf6bbd262125b/o.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>I wish detractors of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> would experience its first DLC expansion, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet_-_the_teal_mask">The Teal Mask</a>, as a stand-alone story since Ogerpon’s plight is genuinely heart-wrenching. It hit me hard enough that I couldn’t bring myself to box this humanoid creature after unshackling it from ire. A Pokémon that can do that surely has similarly earned its place on this list.</p>
<p>It helps that its mask-swapping mechanic is one of my favourites in the series, as it allows Ogerpon to fit into whatever typing niche I need to fill.</p>
</div><div><h2>N: Ninetales</h2>
<figure data-uuid="c23fdb04df6c8"><a title="N" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c23fdb04df6c8/n.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>Most people are aware of the importance of kitsune in Japanese folklore, but did you know the most powerful among them have nine tails? That makes Ninetales’ existence pretty on-the-nose, but also standard fare when it comes to depictions of the folkloric creature.</p>
<p>Yet it has a simple majesty to it that still hits hard all these years later. Plus, its wispy Alolan variant may just be the best regional variant to date, and one of the more unique kitsune on the market.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Harry Potter is one of LEGO’s most beloved franchises, and the <em>Hogwarts Castle and Grounds</em> set has earned a stellar 4.8 out of 5-star rating on Amazon with over 1,800 reviews backing it up. <strong>LEGO’s official website shows zero discounts</strong> on this flagship model and maintains the strict pricing the company is known for. But Amazon isn’t playing by those rules.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">this 2,660-piece castle has dropped from $169 to just $135, marking an all-time low for the best-selling Harry Potter LEGO set</a>. This deal is accessible to everyone, including non-Prime members, which makes it even more appealing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Complete Miniature Replica of the Wizarding School</h2>
<p>It is the first L<strong>EGO brick model that includes the entire Hogwarts Castle and its grounds in a single build</strong>. Earlier sets focused on a solitary tower, classroom, or section, but this 2,660-piece model presents the entire campus to you in one continuous display. The construction includes the Main Tower with its signature pointed roof, the Astronomy Tower where the students study the stars, the Great Hall where banquets and ceremonies take place, as well as several courtyards and cross-bridges that lead to various sections of the castle.</p>



<p>The scale allows the LEGO designers to include recognisable details without overwhelming builders with tens of thousands of pieces. You will construct <strong>the Chamber of Secrets hidden beneath the school, the Winged Key room of Harry’s first-year nightmare, the Potions Classroom where Snape taught in the dungeons, and the large Chessboard Chamber from the Philosopher’s Stone challenges</strong>. The grounds surrounding consist of the Boathouse where students arrive by boat, the Black Lake in front, the greenhouses for Herbology class lessons and the Whomping Willow that attacks anything getting too close.</p>
<p>Other features recreate scenes from around the film series: The Durmstrang Ship comes out of the lake just as it did when Durmstrang participants arrived during the Triwizard Tournament in Goblet of Fire. The powder-blue Beauxbatons Carriage is present on the grounds, representing the arrival of the French school of magic. The crashed Ford Anglia is a part of the Forbidden Forest trees after the failed flight by Ron and Harry in Chamber of Secrets.</p>
<p>The finished model measures <strong>13.5 inches wide, 10 inches in depth, and 8.5 inches in height</strong>, large enough to be seen on a shelf or desk but not big enough to require special furniture. The build is supported on a highly detailed baseplate that is sculpted as the grounds of the castle with textured areas representing grass, pathways, and water. There is a gold mini-figure statue representing the Hogwarts architect which you can put near the nameplate “Hogwarts Castle” or in the corner of the baseplate to give it an extra visual touch.</p>
<p>For $135 for 2,660 pieces, you are <strong>paying around 5 cents per brick which is excellent value in the price system of LEGO</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a lot of math in diet culture. It’s all numbers — calories in, calories burned — and a constant tally running in one’s head. In some ways, disordered eating can be considered a disturbed sort of strategy game, which is precisely why Jenny Jiao Hsia and AP Thomson’s <em>Consume Me</em> works so well. The autobiographical game detailing Hsia’s teenage years is a darkly funny, honest peek into the desire to shape one’s life and body through food.</p><p>Food in <em>Consume Me </em>— tomatoes, kale, and pasta rendered as <em>Tetris</em> blocks — are assigned “bites,” a stand-in for calories. Jenny’s (the character, not the developer, who we’ll refer to using her last name, Hsia) lunch ritual is organizing these blocks on a plate, carefully selecting the pieces, and arranging them to both keep her full but stay under her self-imposed bite limit. It’s the sort of math that’s familiar in video games, but flipped upside down by the influence of controlled, disordered eating. This is <a href="https://www.eater.com/pop-culture/2019/10/25/20917488/food-in-video-games-pac-man-history-women-on-food-soleil-ho-book-excerpt">no glossy-egged, open-faced croque madame from <em>Final Fantasy XV</em></a>, a dish that is as beautiful as it is powerful.</p><p>In most video games, food means strength: <em>Final Fantasy XV</em>’s croque madame awards a bonus that increases attack damage. A cabbage in <em>Skyrim</em> restores a single health point. When Link eats a mushroom skewer in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, his hearts are restored. <em>Consume Me</em> uses the familiar language of video game stats to cleverly flip the expectations. Reduced back down simply to numbers, food is no longer a source of power. It’s something to control, to fear. Hsia introduces Jenny’s diet — her teenage diet, because this is a memoir, after all — as the first of many all-consuming goals that will, supposedly, add up to the perfect life.</p><p>It begins simply, with Jenny’s mother criticizing her weight. The solution there, of course, is to diet, which is represented in <em>Consume Me</em> as a <em>Tetris</em>-esque minigame. The diet, which eventually is made clear as disordered eating, acts as an anchor throughout several years of Jenny’s life, spanning dating, friendships, and getting into college. <em>Consume Me</em> works so brilliantly because dieting and the other minigames aren’t just simple interactive elements, but are designed in service of the story. Dieting forces the player into the mindset of eating disorder math. And it’s not only the calculations of bites, but how those bites influence the rest of Jenny’s life — if Jenny has too many bites at lunch, she’ll need to exercise during her free time, which means she’ll have to choose between neglecting her schoolwork or her boyfriend. (Eat too little, though, and Jenny will end up bingeing on hot chips before bed, often undoing any bite deficit.)</p><p>It’s the impossible reality of being a teenage girl. Expectations are a <em>Tetris</em> board in which the bricks never stop coming. When you’ve cleared a row — being pretty and smart — another shape is inevitably right behind. <em>Consume Me</em> takes place over the days that make up weeks of Jenny’s life, in which the player must min-max her decisions by playing through different minigames, each of which ups Jenny’s skills or knocks something off a checklist but takes away precious, limited time. And every decision, even simply staying up late, feels dire, because in this reality, it is.</p><p>Reading, for example, is a minigame in which the player has to keep Jenny’s eyes on the book as her head spins, dodging rogue thoughts of her pup, boyfriend, or body. Exercising is the practice of corralling Jenny’s flailing arms into the correct positions. They’re all chaotic in the same ways <em>WarioWare</em> microgames are, matching the air of anxiety that lingers around Jenny’s life. Failing any of Jenny’s main goals means having to start over, either redoing a day or an entire week. It’s not necessarily hard to complete Jenny’s goals, but it does require anxious strategy, which is the point. <em>Consume Me</em> nails the mindset of its teenage protagonist.</p><p>Years pass in <em>Consume Me</em>, and Jenny’s goals shift and change slightly; those goals are dictated to her through a dysmorphic version of herself she talks to in the mirror. But diet remains non-negotiable throughout the entirety of the playable parts of the game. And that makes sense: disordered eating is so rarely just about food and image. It can also be about the illusion of control of one’s life through one’s body. Even as Jenny’s priorities change, bites always remain. Until, suddenly, they don’t.</p><p><em>Consume Me</em> ends with a jump forward 10 years, skipping over any sort of resolution to her eating disorder. But it’s clear that something’s happened in that decade — maybe partially related to the jarring religious awakening that hits toward the end of the game — because food is no longer a running tally in Jenny’s life. A sausage is no longer three blocks long, a visualization of its 200 or so bites. It’s just a sausage. She thinks about food, image, and diet still, but it’s no longer the undercurrent of her life.</p><p>There’s a risk in having <em>Consume Me</em> end without some distinct resolution, but it’s just another example of why the game works: it’s a confident memoir that doesn’t shy away from the messy bits.</p><p><sub>Consume Me <em>is available now <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2359120%2FConsume_Me%2F" rel="sponsored">on Steam</a></em>.</sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTgxNzU2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Nicole Carpenter</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/791220/consume-me-review-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year’s <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> was the first entry in the hit multiplayer military shooter to launch day-one on Game Pass in what reportedly turned out to be an expensive experiment for Microsoft. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, making the game available for free to paid subscribers on console and PC cost the tech giant $300 million in lost sales of the 2024 best-seller. That data point adds some interesting context to Microsoft’s controversial decision to hike the price of Game Pass Ultimate by 50 percent this week.</p> <p>A defining feature of Game Pass was the decision early on to release first-party games like <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> and <em>Halo Infinite</em> on the service day-and-date. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-03/xbox-s-game-pass-hike-shows-cost-of-lost-call-of-duty-sales?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1OTUyNzI0MywiZXhwIjoxNzYwMTMyMDQzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUM0lWRFNHUFFROVIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJGRUIzODlCNUI2ODI0RTY0QjY5MENEODE1RTBDREZGRCJ9.D1EObQzg2KlvqBoXPyEm5Yn-DznTYaVWC3okI5aX3AU"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that this move was “controversial internally” due to the likelihood of cannibalizing sales of big games that take a lot of time and money to develop. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango"><em>The Verge</em> reported</a> last year that a similar debate arose around the decision of whether to put <em>Call of Duty</em> on Game Pass or not.</p>

 <p>The former longtime head of Activision, Bobby Kotick, went on record during the 2023 FTC trial over Microsoft’s acquisition of the company saying that he didn’t think adding games like <em>Call of Duty</em> to subscription services made “commercial sense.” “I have a general aversion to the idea of multi-game subscription services,” he <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/activision-ceo-wouldnt-put-call-of-duty-other-titles-on-xbox-game-pass">said at the time</a>. “Maybe part of it is being in Los Angeles and having large, big media companies move their content to these subscription streaming services and the business results have suffered.”</p>

 <p>But following the acquisition, Microsoft did exactly that. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/october-2024-sales-charts-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sparks-xbox-game-pass-subscription-surge">According to Circana’s U.S. market data</a>, sales of 2024’s <em>Black Ops 6 w</em>ere 23 percent higher than <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> sales over the same period, but 82 percent of those sales were on PlayStation compared to Xbox and PC. Subscription gaming services also saw a 16-percent jump year-over-year following the release of<em> Black Ops 6</em>.</p>

 <p>If the move cost the company $300 million in lost sales, Microsoft would have needed around 15 million players to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate for one month to make that up, or just 1.25 million over the course of an entire year. The numbers would be more dramatic for the even cheaper Game Pass PC tier where <em>Call of Duty</em> is also now available day-and-date. The price hikes this week change that math. Now, even if <em>Black Ops 7</em> saw a similar drop in sales, Microsoft would need only 10 million new sign-ups for Ultimate in November to fill the gap, or just 834,000 over the length of a year.</p>

 <p>This week’s Game Pass overhaul shows Microsoft is essentially continuing to back off its original day-one commitment. Game Pass Premium is the same price Game Pass Ultimate was a few years ago, but will only get first-party Xbox games a year after they’re out, and it’s not guaranteed to get<em> Call of Duty</em> games at all. This might not be the last major change we see to the service in the near future, either. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-streaming-free-ad-supported-report-price-increase-2000631520">is reportedly testing a “free” ad-supported tier</a> that will be exclusively cloud gaming, and it could keep raising prices on the higher tiers if it thinks a core audience will stick around.</p> <p><em>Bloomberg</em> reports that Microsoft CFO Amy Hood has “asked Xbox to find other ways to increase profit.” Instead of growing its share of the gaming market, the company now seems content to extract more from those already paying it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages during storms, camping trips without reliable electricity, tailgating events that need a blender for frozen drinks, remote work setups in RVs, or simply keeping your essential devices running during emergency situations… These scenarios share one common frustration: <strong>being disconnected from power when you need it most</strong>.</p>
<p>A portable power station solves this problem by providing reliable electricity anywhere and gives you the freedom to charge laptops, run small appliances, or keep medical devices operational during blackouts. If you’ve found yourself in any of these situations wishing you had backup power,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/"> the Jackery Explorer 1000 is currently at a record low of $429, down from $799</a>. This <strong>46% discount</strong> makes one of the most capable portable power stations accessible for people who need reliable energy independence.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Explorer 1000 holds 1,070 watt-hours of capacity in <strong>an incredibly light 23.8-pound package</strong>. This held energy translates to usable use like powering a mini-fridge for roughly 10 hours, charging a laptop over multiple work sessions, or keeping your phone charged dozens of times through. The unit can <strong>output 1,500 continuous watts via its three pure sine wave AC receptacles</strong> and can surge a maximum of 3,000 watts momentarily as appliances come online.</p>



<h2>Charges Faster Than You’d Ever Imagine</h2>
<p>Jackery designed this power station <strong>using ChargeShield 2.0 technology</strong> which enables full recharge in one hour when you activate emergency mode via the accompanying app. That’s due to intelligent charging algorithms that push maximum current safely into the lithium iron phosphate battery cells. The standard charge time stands at 1.7 hours which strikes a balance between fast charging and maintaining long-term battery health by minimizing heat gain during charging. For perspective, most other power stations you’ll find take four to six hours for a full charge.</p>



<p>LiFePO4 battery chemistry delivers outstanding longevity over conventional lithium-ion cells. This<strong> battery retains over 70% of its capacity after 4,000 full charge cycles</strong>, or over a decade of moderate use if you’re cycling the battery every week. Lithium iron phosphate cells also handle extreme temperatures more robustly and represent less fire hazard than traditional lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>The port choice caters to modern charging needs with t<strong>wo USB-C ports offering 100 watts of power delivery, a USB-A port, a 12-volt automotive port, and the usual three AC ports</strong>. A 100-watt USB-C port can charge new MacBook Pros, iPads and high-end Android phones at maximum speed without requiring separate power bricks.</p>
<p>At $429, this power station is practically half its regular price but provides the capacity and functionality that makes portable power stations really useful and not novelty items.</p>

<figure><a title="KUUKIYOMI 4: Consider It Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159355/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>We reported on the Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kuukiyomi-4-consider-it-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Kuukiyomi 4: Consider It</a> having arrived with new features, including a bunch of exclusive mouse-mode content, and as a result of that, well, I agreed in writing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/random-kuukiyomi-4-consider-its-switch-2-edition-uses-mouse-mode-in-neat-ways-while-poking-fun-at-nintendo">in the comments</a> that I'd review it. Thanks, past me. Thanks a bunch.</p>
<p>I jest, of course. This is an off-kilter Japanese series that had completely passed me by, and after seeing the Switch 2 port trailer, I simply had to give it a go. It's right up my street.</p>
<p>So, what have we actually got here? Well, Kuukiyomi 4: Consider It is the latest in a series that has already seen a few releases on Switch 1, and the entire concept revolves around you being placed in situations where you must <em>consider</em> a suitable action or solution to often awkward — or just plain weird — social situations. Will you consider being considerate? Or will you take every opportunity you can to mess people around?</p>
<figure><a title="KUUKIYOMI 4: Consider It Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159357/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a coming together of a very funny art style here; it's the sort of game that does a very good line in incredibly stupid facial expressions that amuse whilst also nailing precisely an awkward feeling, with situations that manage to raise, at the very least, a wry smile. You can see the pain in the eyes of these NPCs at points. The terror of human interaction writ large. I can't stop laughing.</p>
<p>Starting with the original game's contents, which you play with the Switch 2's normal, non-exclusive inputs, you push through some 100 scenarios that, well, I'm not going to spoil many of them here, because the entire fun is in seeing what comes next. But I have howled at my screen a few times due to the underlying social tension being nagged at.</p>
<p>This is a game that asks us, "Why do humans read the air?" And those facial expressions I was just on about, combined with the oddness of the scenarios, and then multiplied by the very real awkward silence (we all know the one) that transpires as you consider what to do...man, this game nails the squeaky bum tension so hard.</p>

<p>Will you shift seats on a train to let a couple sit together? Will you put your dirty mouth around the water font and drink from it when nobody is looking? Will you sit at the table beside the girl in the cafe or go sit alone at the bar? I'm sweating already.</p>
<p>Alongside these social aspects, you also have lots of curveballs, one or two of which I'll admit to not really even understanding, and honestly, there's something about sweating over sitting next to a stranger one moment, and then moving your Joy-Con around to simulate trying to find a Wi-Fi phone signal the next, that really brings things right down to the level of crushing reality. In the best way possible, you understand.</p>
<p>Playing through the game's scenarios in the main solo campaign mode, you'll be graded after every handful of levels to ascertain just how considerate you are being, or as the game puts it, your "ability to read the atmosphere will be diagnosed."</p>
<figure><a title="KUUKIYOMI 4: Consider It Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159359/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is where the main sticking point with this game will be. You see, it's not taking itself particularly seriously, and so even when you're presented with the ludicrously in-depth results of your attempts to be nice, it's mostly all played for laughs. So don't expect to find seriousness for even a second. It's really all just for japes, and so there may not be enough of a hook for those who don't gel with the humour. Luckily, I'm covered in gel right now.</p>
<p>Aside from the vanilla game's 100 main mode scenarios, you also get a 'Consider It Together' multiplayer mode that asks you and your associates a bunch of questions before diagnosing your 'compatibility', plus a handful of quick games that you'll unlock as you play (again, no spoilers) and a few extra minigames to boot. So there's plenty to do, even before you add in the Switch 2's new sections, where the mouse mode fun happens.</p>
<p>In the main new mode, you use either one of your Joy-Con in mouse mode to navigate 20 new levels, and I'm happy to report that they are some of the best in the entire thing. Mostly aimed at the console itself, I got a lot of laughs out of cheeky takes on 120fps gaming, how the console's mic works, and what HDR stands for.</p>
<figure><a title="KUUKIYOMI 4: Consider It Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159354/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's all very silly and delightfully tongue-in-cheek. The Switch 2 port also lands with five two-player mouse-made games to play against a pal for added value. Again, I'm not going to ruin them here, as seeing what pops onto the screen next is what it's all about.</p>
<p>Being that the art style is so stark and spartan, there are zero issues in terms of performance, and really the only negative that I'd level at Kuukiyomi 4 is that, as much as it's great that it doesn't take anything too seriously, it does have an inherent lack of focus or drive. If you want something with some challenge, this is not that, even if it does let you re-run and improve your results. However, even this has been remedied to a degree in the NS2 Edition by the addition of achievements, which give you something to work towards, whilst also providing a few more laughs by challenging you to consider it in some not-so-obvious ways. Did I just unlock a 'cheevo' for letting my head fall all the way to one side during a haircut? You're goddamn right I did.</p>

<p>Given its cheerful pricing, honestly, it's a hard thing to knock if you're looking for some cheap laughs that can also hit home harder than you'll expect at points.</p>
<p>Now, prepare to relive the unbearable tension of...moving out of the way to let someone off the train!</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Kuukiyomi 4: Consider It! is a delightfully silly little game that also provides plenty of dark laughs, clever digs, and unbearable social tension thanks to a brilliantly executed collection of scenarios.</p>
<p>Not every level is gonna have you howling, and some of them don't even really make any sense, but I'll be damned if I haven't been well-entertained for my money and made to laugh plenty whilst also being reminded that, at best, I am deeply inconsiderate.</p></section>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ditch-your-ipad-amazons-new-gaming-tablet-at-40-off-is-flying-off-the-shelves-2000631749</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ditch-your-ipad-amazon%E2%80%99s-new-gaming-tablet-at-40-off-is-flying-off-the-shelves.1316476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming on tablets has exploded in popularity, with more players discovering that pairing a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi controller with a portable screen creates an incredibly flexible gaming setup. The problem? A decent iPad Pro will set you back $800, and even the base iPad hovers around $400. If you’re looking for a capable tablet experience without the Apple tax, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4479/">Amazon’s Fire Max 11 represents the company’s most powerful tablet to date, and it’s currently hitting an all-time low at $139, down from $229</a> (64GB model, with lockscreen ads). This is the <strong>newest model in Amazon’s lineup</strong>, and seeing it <strong>drop 39% during Prime Big Deal Days</strong> makes it an accessible entry point for streaming and casual gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4479/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Fire Max 11 is all <strong>about its huge 11-inch screen</strong>, packing 2.4 million pixels into a 2000 x 1200 screen. That means text is readable enough to read ebooks or browse web pages, with videos and games benefitting from clear detail that does not force you to squint at blurry images. The screen is blue light low emission certified, which is something that stops eye strain when viewing for extended periods.</p>
<h2>Performance That Keeps Up With Your Entertainment</h2>
<p>Underneath the aluminum shell is an <strong>octa-core processor and 4 GB of RAM</strong> to offer a seamless experience for multitasking scenarios like keeping multiple browser tabs open while streaming background music. The eight cores divide the load evenly and never permits stuttering and lag that plagues lower-end tablets when jumping between applications. Wi-Fi 6 connectivity offers quicker data transfer rates and improved performance in busy network conditions so you can stream 1080p content on the couch even while family members are bandwidth-thirsty on their own devices.</p>



<p>The build quality of the tablet is a balance of portability and ruggedness <strong>through the aluminum frame and reinforced glass display</strong>. Amazon states it’s <strong>three times more durable than the iPad 10.9-inch in tumble tests</strong> which involve dropping the tablet repeatedly from specific heights onto hard surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life is 14 hours of continuous use,</strong> or a couple days’ worth of normal usage patterns if you’re not watching a whole season in one sitting. You get 64 GB of storage built-in at this price point, and you can expand capacity to 1 TB with a microSD card.</p>
<p>The stylus pen and keyboard case option turn the Fire Max 11 into a productivity tablet able to do email, note taking and document editing. The tablet includes a three-month trial of Microsoft 365 Personal so you can use Word, Excel, and PowerPoint with full cloud syncing across all your devices. The 8 MP front camera provides excellent video quality when using Zoom calls, so it’s perfect for remote work or keeping in touch with distant family members.</p>
<p>This is a great value for budget-minded customers who want current features without premium prices, make sure you don’t miss that Prime Day deal on Amazon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-silently-offloads-v11-inventory-on-amazon-now-40-off-at-a-record-low-price-2000631741</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-silently-offloads-v11-inventory-on-amazon-now-40-off-at-a-record-low-price.1316467/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson is the ultimate luxury in vacuum cleaners and it sets standards that competitors try to copy but never quite match. The brand’s combination of <strong>advanced performance and sleek design</strong> remains unrivaled in the industry. If you’ve been looking for a new-generation cordless stick vacuum without dropping $1,500 on the latest Dyson flagship model, the V11 <em>Origin</em> is a great breakthrough moment in Dyson’s evolution.</p>
<p>This was the first model to truly enter the <em>“new gen”</em> era of cordless cleaning power <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">and seeing it drop to $399 from $629 on Amazon is unprecedented</a> (nearly 40% off right now). The British company seems to be clearing inventory on earlier models, possibly to push consumers toward their premium $1,000+ options later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The <strong>Dyson V11 Origin delivers 185AW of suction, 60% more cleaning power than previous Dyson models</strong>. We’re talking about the difference between surface-level dust removal and deep extraction of embedded dirt from carpet fibers and hard floor crevices. The <strong>motor spins at up to 125,000 revolutions per minute</strong>, and it generates the kind of cyclonic force that pulls allergens, pet dander, and fine particles from every surface in your home.</p>
<h2>Three Intelligent Modes That Actually Make Sense</h2>
<p>The V11 has <strong>three different power modes</strong> that respond to real-world cleaning conditions. <em>Auto mode</em> takes advantage of sensors integrated into the vacuum to detect floor type and change suction automatically, balancing cleaning performance with battery life. <em>Eco mode</em> gets the most out of battery life for quick maintenance cleaning sessions, allowing you up to 60 minutes of steady use when you’re just doing a few quick touch-ups around the house. <em>Boost mode</em> lets out all the suction power for tough messes like ground-in cereal crumbs or tracked-in mud, but it does drain the battery faster.</p>



<p>The LCD display informs you of the mode you’re in, total amount of runtime remaining to the last second, and maintenance alerts when the filters must be cleaned or clogs form.</p>
<p>The Motorbar cleaner bar head itself is worth an accolade because it solves one of the greatest annoyances of vacuum ownership: Normal brush rolls become tangles of hairballs of mess within minutes of operation and you have to stop and snip away the mess with scissors. <strong>Dyson created this head on a spiral brush bar that actively untangles snarled hair</strong> and petting fur while you clean. The cleaner head automatically adjusts between carpets and hard floors, which makes a tight seal that doesn’t let dirt seep underneath.</p>
<p><strong>Converting the V11 into handheld mode</strong> is a matter of seconds by letting go of the wand which turns it into an all-around cleaning device for cleaning above floors. The whole-machine <strong>filtration system captures 99.99% of particles with a diameter of 0.3 microns</strong> or smaller such as most common allergens, bacteria, and mold spores.</p>
<p>This deal is unprecedented and it’s one of our favorite Prime Day deals right now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-dell-16-laptop-2tb-ssd-64gb-ram-core-7-is-3400-off-amazon-is-selling-out-all-laptops-2000631607</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-dell-16%E2%80%B3-laptop-2tb-ssd-64gb-ram-core-7-is-3-400-off-amazon-is-selling-out-all-laptops.1316458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The laptop market has become impossibly crowded with dozens of brands and hundreds of models, which makes it very difficult to know where to start. If you want a safe bet backed by decades of reliability and support infrastructure, <strong>Dell remains one of the smartest choices you can make</strong>.</p>
<p>Within Dell’s lineup, there’s something for every budget and every use case. Right now, if you want maximum performance at the absolute lowest price, Amazon has dropped a deal that borders on absurd: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4475/">Dell Inspiron 16 with upgraded specs (Intel Core 7, 64GB DDR5 RAM, 2TB SSD) has plummeted to $1,195 from its typical $4,599 price</a>, which is a <strong>74 percent discount</strong> that requires a double-take to believe.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4475/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Intel Core 7 150U processor boasts <strong>10 cores and 12 threads with a turbo frequency of up to 5.4GHz</strong> and provides processing capability that tackles high-end workloads without pause. The 150U is part of Intel’s newest family of mobile processors using their power-efficient architecture, optimizing performance and battery life through smart power management.</p>
<h2>Huge Upgrades That Transform Daily Computing</h2>
<p>The memory and storage configuration makes it stand apart from bread-and-butter retail models. <strong>With 64GB of DDR5 RAM</strong>, you can have a bunch of browser tabs open, virtual machines and background processes simultaneously without any system slowdown. DDR5 is a generation improvement over DDR4 with exponentially greater data transfer rates, improved power efficiency and greater performance under heavy multitasking loads.</p>


<p>The 2TB SSD has enough space for your whole digital life without constant file management anxiety. You can have your whole software suite installed, store years of photos and video, download enormous game collections and store local backups without even approaching capacity limits. SSD technology means all loading nearly at the same instant, from system booting to application launching to file copying.</p>



<p>The<strong> 16-inch FHD+ touchscreen uses a 1920×1200 resolution with a 16:10 aspect ratio</strong> that gives you more vertical space than typical 16:9 screens. It comes in handy while working with documents, spreadsheets, or code when you’d rather see more content without scrolling. The 300-nit brightness delivers clarity in light rooms and the touchscreen feature (no need to use it if you don’t want to) delivers convenience for faster interactions when the keyboard gets too formal.</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/windows-11-pro">Windows 11 Pro includes</a> enterprise-grade features like BitLocker encryption, remote desktop, and domain join functionality that are not included in Home versions. The Copilot key provides direct access to Microsoft’s AI assistant.</p>
<p>Connectivity includes Wi-Fi 6E for extremely fast wireless speeds on supporting networks, <strong>Bluetooth for peripherals, USB-C and USB-A ports for legacy and newer devices, HDMI output for external monitors, and an SD card reader</strong> for photographers transferring files from cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life is 80 percent after just 60 minutes of charging</strong>, minimizing downtime when you simply need to have power ready at an instant between classes or meetings.</p>
<p>For $1,195, you’re getting technology that would otherwise cost three or four times that much.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/after-selling-out-amazon-brings-back-50-pack-pokemon-cards-at-a-new-record-low-2000631600</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-selling-out-amazon-brings-back-50-pack-pokemon-cards-at-a-new-record-low.1316446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Building a Pokemon card collection from the ground up involves that you focus on quantity before hunting down specialty holographic Charizards or first edition old cards. The smart thing to do is to get a few inexpensive bulk packs like this and accumulate a solid base of cards that can be traded, sorted and used to build decks. You will have some duplicates in a bunch of packs but that is exactly what you want when you are just starting out: Duplicates become currency amongst friends and fellow collectors, and having the ability to have multiple copies of useful cards allows you to build functional decks without decreasing your collection.</p>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/">50-card miscellaneous lot that has dropped to an all-time low of $5 on Amazon from its usual $10 price point</a>, and it just came back in stock after selling out last week. You’re going to want to move quick because these bulk lots are short-lived.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The appeal here is simple value. <strong>For $5 for 50 cards, you’re paying 10 cents per card</strong>&nbsp;which is effectively floor price on Pokemon cards no matter what format. The <strong>individual booster packs cost $4 to $5 and contain only 10 to 11 cards</strong>, so you’d be paying $20 to $25 to get the same quantity through the traditional retailing method. This bulk approach bypasses the thrill of opening the sealed pack and the very low chance of obtaining ultra-rare cards but it provides you with maximum number of cards for minimum amount of money.</p>
<h2>Random Draw Gives Diverse Sets</h2>
<p>The pack includes <strong>random cards of all Pokemon series</strong> that represent the entire history of the trading card game from the very beginning Base Set to the most recent issues. You’ll receive a mix of core Pokemon cards with basic, Stage 1, and Stage 2 Pokemon from various generations and energy cards to power up attacks while playing. Randomization guarantees each lot acts as a surprise grab bag. You might receive popular Pokemon like Pikachu, evolutions of Eevee or starting Pokemon, or you might receive under-the-radar creatures from later generations.</p>



<p>Energy cards within such lots serve important gameplay functions. Energy cards on your Pokemon need to be played in order for the Pokemon Trading Card Game to use their attacks, with different Pokemon types requiring such energy types as Fire, Water, Grass, Lightning, Psychic, Fighting, Darkness, Metal, or Fairy. Possessing a solid base of energy cards enables you to actually build playable decks rather than simply gathering cards for their visual reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Duplicates are to be expected even in one 50-card lot</strong>. This is part of bulk card collections where the packaging process is more about speed than making each card unique. In reality, duplicates are less important than you’d imagine. Basic Pokemon cards and energy cards are intended to show up in multiples throughout your deck because competitive decks would have multiple copies of the same card.</p>
<p>The set is Amazon’s top-selling collectible card game set and deck, with over 20,000 sales in the past month alone.&nbsp;For $5, you’re getting the best value way to start a Pokemon collection or build upon one. The record-low price and recent stock shortages mean this won’t last long. If you’re even remotely interested in Pokemon cards, buying four or five of these lots puts you at 200 to 250 cards for $20 to $25, an immediate collection with high trading value.</p>

And this is the first edition since Switch 2 launched!</p>
<p>While we've done our utmost to keep up with every new Switch 2 game after 25 of them dropped on 5th June, there have already been a handful we weren't able to cover - although we <em>did</em> manage to catch up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bokura-planet">Bokura: Planet</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kuukiyomi-4-consider-it-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Kuukiyomi 4</a>, both of which we enjoyed immensely (spoilers for the Kuukiyomi review that'll be going live later today!). And Switch 1 has kept up its relentless release rate, with publishers pumping out all sorts of jewels glinting in the ever-churning eShop slop. Missing some good 'uns is unavoidable, unfortunately.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067orhwsu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Back in April, in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/community-38-switch-games-we-missed-as-recommended-by-you">Part 10</a> (blimey!) of this community series, you highlighted a chunky 38 titles, including such gems as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bzzzt">BZZZT</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/haiku_the_robot">Haiku the Robot</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/howl">Howl</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/a_tiny_sticker_tale">A Tiny Sticker Tale</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/promise_mascot_agency">Promise Mascot Agency</a>.</p>
<p>So, ahead of the next instalment, it's callout time! If you'd like to highlight a Switch 1 or Switch 2 game that we haven't reviewed, send us your recommendations and we'll showcase the best in Part 11.</p>
<p>Remember — and this is a point that is frequently forgotten when people send their recommendations! — <strong>we won't be reviewing these games</strong>. We want to shine a light on games that we weren't able to when they launched. Make sure to carefully read the submission guidelines below if you want to see your entries included in the feature:</p>
<h2>Submission guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>100-word limit</strong> - Keep it brief! A history of the genre and deep-dive into every mechanic is unnecessary. Concentrate on what the game is about, what sets it apart from other games, and why you enjoyed it.</li>
<li><strong>One entry per game</strong> - Feel free to send your thoughts on multiple games, but there's no need to duplicate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose only games that we haven't reviewed on the site</strong> - To check if a Nintendo Life review exists, simply type the name of the game into the search box at the very top of the page (look for the magnifying glass icon in the top left corner) and click on the game page that appears. If there's no review, and it doesn't appear in a previous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/reader-recommendations">Reader Recommendations</a> feature (which will also appear on the game page if it exists), you're good to go!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a recommendation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=gems"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Switch eShop Hidden Gems"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted message into the appropriate box, hit send, and Bob's your uncle!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>Let’s see what you’ve been playing?</p>
<ul>
<li>TSBonyman checked in with an update of his gaming antics, having run through plenty more No Man’s Sky with the custom ship designing, a cheap copy of Atomic Heart which impressed with its style, but less so its gameplay, and the System Shock remake for some classic immersive sim action. He’s also enjoyed&nbsp;Steamworld Dig 2 and Steamworld Heist, which are still lovely indie games.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, enjoy the weekend, and we’ll catch you for more gaming shenanigans next week!</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>This weekend I'll hopefully get back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> - it's had an update since I last played, so I'm interested to see what effect that's had. I'm also keen to crack into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> is sitting on my home screen, giving me a cheeky little wink every time I fire up my Switch. It'd be rude not to.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I've had a copy of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/last_guardian">The Last Guardian</a> sitting under the TV for about a year, and with GOTY approaching <em>of course</em> the urge to play games totally unrelated to 2025 is gripping me. Hey, I just finished 2017's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, so why not try a winner from 2016 next? <em>*head in hands*</em></p>
<p>Actually, my instinct is to ignore games completely this weekend and deep-dive into videos, specifically YouTube videos featuring our recently departed (from the company - he's okay, everyone!) Zion<del>-from-Nintendo-Life</del>. The video chaps do such brilliant work, yet I often don't have the time to properly check it out. Having watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qQv6IDHAvM">his last chat video</a>, I'm itching to go back into the archives and (re)watch some of the many brilliant videos Zion's created over the years. Top man, that Mr. Z. He will be missed.</p>
<p>(Just to reiterate, he ain't dead - we'll absolutely be keeping in touch!)</p>
<p>Have a good one, folks.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> this weekend, because of course I am. What a game, man. I'm also keen to play a bit more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, but I feel like I might need to put that one off a bit until I'm in the right mood.</p>
<p>I also got Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles, so that's on my radar. Again, I've got a lot on right now, so chances are I'll probably just chill out with some Galaxy 2 before I get properly invested in a new game.</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m away in Paris this weekend, so Switchin’ might have to take a backseat for a little while, but it feels fitting that the hours spent on the Eurostar are filled with a game all about <em>love</em>. Okay, it’s Hades II and okay, I don’t actually know whether it’s all that much about love, but it does feature Aphrodite, the goddess of love, so that has to carry my imagery some way, right?</p>
<p>Either way, I’ve only got a couple of roguelike runs under my belt at this point, but <em>boy</em> does it feel good to be back in a Hades mood! Getting to grips with attacks, building up my weapons arsenal, wooing gods with Nectar, this is all the good stuff that I’ll be looking fondly back on in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Death to Chronos, and all that, dear readers. Have a good one!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>An excellent mech game that I skipped last week has will be my go-to game this weekend. I have about half the missions cleared on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gearbits">Gearbits</a> and I hope to tackle the remaining ones before Monday hits. Hades II progress continues, with every run brining another titbit to the story of Melinoë. Hope to find some time to revisit both Mario Galaxies, really fond memories of a simpler time in my life.</p>
<p>UFO 50 report: 26 of 50 games played. Made it past the halfway mark! Caramel Caramel is excellent but Porgy is the biggest challenge of the week. Pesky, pesky giant shark...</p>
<p>Game of the week is (yet again!) Star Wars Outlaws. Tatooine is far bigger than I was expecting with vast open desert areas, secret caves, Jawas and if I squint really, really hard I can pretend I’m on Arrakis. Looking forward to reaching the main end game story arch.</p>
