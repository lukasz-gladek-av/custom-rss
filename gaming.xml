  <p id="8rKijb">Choosing the <strong>best class</strong> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides"><em>Diablo 4</em></a> isn’t as simple as choosing a class you think sounds cool. </p>
<p id="3rLELX">Blizzard’s isometric dungeon-crawler features five classes: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23654868/barbarian-best-build-skills">Barbarian</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23656235/necromancer-best-build-skills">Necromancer</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23653283/sorcerer-best-build-skills">Sorcerer</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23650988/rogue-best-build-skills">Rogue</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23656236/druid-best-build-skills">Druid</a>. Each class has a unique class mechanic along with a skill tree equipped with a variety of spells. All of their playstyles are different — and compounded by <em>Diablo 4</em>’s complex game of numbers — but which one is the best class for you? </p>
<p id="d5W1z0">In this <em>Diablo 4</em> guide, we’ll explain each of the classes to help you decide <strong>how to pick the best class</strong>. We’ll also tell you the best <em>Diablo 4</em> class for solo players, and the best class for beginners.</p>

<hr id="cAMkQs">

<p id="2sqNqh">There are five <em>Diablo 4</em> classes, and all of them have their own unique playstyle. But before you dive into the game and pick your class, you may be wondering: Which class is the <em>best</em> class in <em>Diablo 4</em>?</p>
<p id="X3AF3F">You may be surprised to learn that this is an impossible question to answer — at least in such simple terms. </p>

<p id="ddThKK">The best class changes season to season. And while Blizzard typically doesn’t make big balance changes during the season itself, it will rebalance classes that are overperforming too much. <strong>So it’s best to avoid picking a class for a specific build and instead try and pick based on the class that interests you most</strong>. Plus, the power levels between the classes really only start to matter at the highest levels of play, which is something most players will never even get close to.</p>
<p id="po1hHj">All that being said, if you do want to know what the current “best class” is and which you should choose, we’ve got some advice for you below.</p>
<hr id="xEK8a0">
<h2 id="e44dYx"><strong>What is the best class to pick for Diablo 4 season 4?</strong></h2>
<p id="YmO3yD">Based on Blizzard’s very first public test realm for <em>Diablo 4</em> season 4, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24147550/diablo-4-d4-season-loot-reborn-patch-notes">Loot Reborn</a>, is debatably the game’s most-balanced season to date. All five classes are looking very good in season 4, so you shouldn’t worry too much about <strong>what the “best” class is</strong> unless you want to compete with your friends. </p>
<p id="OE1Y41">However, it’s worth keeping in mind that all of this is based off of the public test realm, which is only representative of the start of the season. These rankings could change over the coming days, weeks, and months.</p>
<p id="jErwfK">At a glance, here’s our ranking of the classes, from worst to best, for <em>Diablo 4</em> season 4. </p>
<p id="b6noYi">5. Druid<br>4. Rogue<br>3. Barbarian<br>2. Sorcerer<br>1. Necromancer </p>
<div id="9KyyP7"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9yKl9LI9Qo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="KnY5XJ">If you’re looking for additional resources and breakdowns on the best builds, <em>Diablo 4</em> content creator <a href="https://youtu.be/Y9yKl9LI9Qo">Raxxanterax</a> has a great video ranking the <em>Diablo 4</em> classes going into season 4. And while his order varies slightly from ours, he’s got some interesting perspectives from his time on the public test realm that are worth checking out.</p>
<p id="3pZoa0"><strong>Druids </strong></p>
<p id="gYfWQv">Druids have one of the strongest builds in season 4, with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23656236/druid-best-build-skills">Werewolf Tornado</a>. That’s how even the balance is looking for Loot Reborn, that our “worst” class of the season could be one of the strongest if you get a specific build going. However, Druids are still very slow, which can make them hard to stick with, as they’re pretty rough to play before you get your build going.</p>
<p id="uwZkoP"><strong>Rogues</strong></p>
<p id="k2dcIC">Rogues are still extremely good in<em> Diablo 4</em> season 4. However, as always, they take the most effort to play. This is especially true in season 4 when you consider that Necromancers and their partially passive minion build are number one this season. That’s a lot of power for not much effort, which inherently makes something more “high-skilled” like the Rogue fall in value.</p>
<p id="sOB18y"><strong>Barbarians </strong></p>
<p id="QAdkn4">Barbarians are always going to be the best or worse class in the game, just by nature of having four weapons equipped at a time. For season 4, Blizzard nerfed not only some of the Barbarian’s best builds from previous seasons, but also the best build from the test realm version of season 4, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23654868/barbarian-best-build-skills">Double Swing Dust Devils</a>. However, the Dust Devils build still looks very powerful — just not “delete everything on screen and crash your computer” powerful — so Barbs should still be in a great spot.</p>
<div id="VYn0g7"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RnHPr7aCBqk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="f0WY8x"><strong>Sorcerers </strong></p>
<p id="7VD3YS">Sorcerers are always low health, high damage characters in <em>Diablo 4</em>, but the new item systems and simpler affixes coming to the game in season 4 should help push them into an even cleaner spot when it comes to mixing defense and offense. Plus they’re getting a new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23653283/sorcerer-best-build-skills">Frozen Orb</a> build in Loot Reborn that looks very fun, and extremely powerful. </p>
<p id="jUtkA2"><strong>Necromancers </strong></p>
<p id="epQZST">Necromancer players have been waiting since <em>Diablo 4</em> launched to have a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23656235/necromancer-best-build-skills">good minion build</a>, and season 4 finally has one. Blizzard gave massive buffs to Necromancer minions in season 4, allowing you to run around the battlefield and summon a horde of undead monsters to kill stuff rather than having to do it yourself. This season, Necromancers get the double whammy of a relatively simple build to play paired with a ton of strength, making them the best class in the game.</p>
<hr id="f6CRaQ">
<h2 id="RSZH6B"><strong>What is the best class in Diablo 4 for solo players?</strong></h2>
<p id="yb44GT">The <strong>Rogue is likely the best solo class for skilled players </strong>looking to bring themselves through the game — even if you’ll eventually have to work harder in the endgame to compete with Barbarians.</p>
<div id="L8acr5"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nqGKjAfMNYE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="58R9AU">As a Rogue, you’re highly mobile, stealthy, and are able to fight from both range and melee. You’re also the most versatile class with a huge variety of builds. You are easy to kill, which can make your class difficult to master, but once you’re practiced, you can take on an army of monsters by yourself without slowing down. </p>
<p id="UZpLet">Of course, like the “which class is best for you” section, there is no right answer. You can play all five classes solo, and there is no support class in <em>Diablo 4</em>, only support builds. </p>
<hr id="loaqjN">
<h2 id="lq6JCl"><strong>What is the best class in Diablo 4 for beginners?</strong></h2>
<p id="8dOhAE">The easiest class for beginners is<strong> either the Necromancer or the Barbarian</strong>, and there are pros and cons to each.</p>
<p id="nAturi">The obvious boon for <strong>Necromancer </strong>players is the army of skeletons you have at your disposal. These minions will attack things alongside you and, depending on your build, they can deal very high damage. As a new player, being able to lean on some AI allies all the time is a huge stress reliever. If you mess up your abilities or aren’t sure how to attack and stay alive, you can just focus on keeping yourself safe while your buddies clean out the dungeon. </p>
<div id="a8qHV0"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/olFtCvxi3gk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="9Udk8x">The con here is that Necromancers technically have two resources to manage, as they cast spells using Essence as well as their unique Corpse mechanic. This can make things a bit overwhelming for new players, as Corpses complicate certain skills and can also visually obscure the ground in dungeons.</p>
<p id="kllx4D"><strong>Barbarians</strong>, on the other hand, are just big, smashy folk trying to do their best to rid Sanctuary of demons. The fantasy and (some of) the playstyles for Barbarians are similarly simple. You’re going to spend a lot of time just running up to monsters and punching them in the face until they die. There are no tricks here. You’re not turning yourself invisible or transforming into a bear. You’re taking a big hammer and you’re smashing stuff. </p>
<div id="KIMcT3"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tDUHT2TxcWA?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="1WjtIl">However, there are two big cons to the Barbarian: one on each end of the play experience. Barbarians are one of the weaker early game classes, and you can die fairly easily when you don’t know what you’re doing. For your suffering, you’ll get to be very powerful in the endgame. But even that comes with a complexity cost, as the reason Barbarians are so strong later in the game is because they are the only class that can wield four weapons at once. This means that you have to find more gear than other classes and you have more powerful Legendary powers to combine together. That’s exciting, but also overwhelming.</p>
<p id="5O4jd6">The great news about<em> Diablo 4 </em>is all the classes — including Druid, Sorcerer, and Rogue — all have simple builds and complex builds. While Barbarian and Necromancer are probably the easiest for most players, they might not be the best first choice for you.</p>

<p id="iIkhB7"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23654868/barbarian-best-build-skills">Barbarians</a> in <em>Diablo 4</em> are fierce warriors who leap into the fray. As a Barb, your main mechanic is the <strong>Weapon Arsenal</strong>, which allows you to hold four weapons at once. Some of your abilities will require you to have a specific weapon type such as slicing, two-handed, dual-wield, or bludgeoning to use. But for some skills, you can manually <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23508568">switch weapons</a> for different effects. You’ll gain expertise the more you use a certain weapon, which will provide you with buffs like increased critical hit chance or more damage against vulnerable enemies.</p>
<p id="1T49Rl">Not only are you capable of mastering offensive weapons, Barbarians are meant to be bulky bruisers who can take a hit from any foe. With a plethora of shouts and damage reducing abilities, you’ll be spending a lot of time up close and personal due to your survivability.</p>

<p id="hPr2Fn">The Necromancer is a staple for the Diablo series. As a summoner, you’re able to conjure hordes of undead enemies to do your bidding or sacrifice your minions to empower yourself.</p>
<p id="8JesUB">Your unique mechanic is called the <strong>Book of the Dead</strong>, which<strong> </strong>allows you to customize your undead army by selecting what type of skeletons you’ll summon (along with a specialization). You can give your pawns more health, increased damage output, or the ability to deal AoE damage. If you don’t want to manage your minions, you can choose to sacrifice either some or all of your minions to gain a permanent buff. </p>
<p id="xB2PWU">Necromancers have a unique resource that other classes do not have: <strong>corpses </strong>— which, you guessed it, are left behind when enemies die. You also have Essence, which functions similarly to mana, allowing you to cast your regular abilities, but in order to raise minions, you’ll need a corpse. If you’re going the solo show route, you can also detonate the deceased instead.</p>

<p id="6CdsLU"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23650988/rogue-best-build-skills">Rogues</a> are versatile duelists who can specialize in either ranged or close quarters combat. (If you played the Demon Hunter in <em>Diablo 3</em>, this is the most similar class for <em>Diablo 4</em>). </p>
<p id="i77wCW">Your unique class mechanic is <strong>Specialization</strong>,<strong> </strong>which changes your fundamental abilities and your playstyle. There are three different specializations: <strong>Combo Points</strong>, <strong>Inner Sight</strong>, and <strong>Preparation</strong>.</p>
<p id="hTPhSx">Combo points will increase the damage output of some of your abilities and change how they function by increasing the number of arrows fired or adding a chance to knock down your opponents. Inner Sight will provide you with unlimited energy for a short amount of time when attacking a marked enemy. Preparation allows you to use your ultimate abilities more frequently after spending a lot of your main resource.</p>
<p id="hNNgKd">The Rogue is a mobile class that gives you access to stealth, traps, and imbuements, allowing you to take on any kind of content. You’re able to dart in an out of combat with combination of ranged, melee, and stealth attacks.</p>

<p id="ay6VFZ">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23653283/sorcerer-best-build-skills">Sorcerer</a> is your typical ranged caster or fantasy mage. By using the powers of <strong>fire</strong>, <strong>lightning</strong>, and <strong>ice</strong> magic, you can obliterate your opponents. Whether you want to spawn fire hydras or spam chain lightning, you’ll easily take down anyone in your path.</p>
<p id="HNOgYD">Your unique class mechanic is <strong>Enchantment</strong>,<strong> </strong>which will provide your abilities with powerful passive effects that — when slotted into your Enchantment slots — will trigger without you needing to put them on your bar or spend mana. For example, you can cast Fireball using mana to shoot a giant flaming blasts at enemies. But you can also place Fireball into one of your Enchantment slots, which will cause all enemies to explode when you kill them.</p>
<p id="KyD62Z">As a Sorcerer, you’re slightly more frail than the other classes, but you do have a bundle of defensive abilities that can make you (temporarily) unkillable. Encase yourself in ice, surround your body with fire, or simply zip away from danger.</p>

<p id="lRGBgY">Druids missed out on <em>Diablo 3</em>, but have been in the <em>Diablo </em>universe since <em>Diablo 2</em>. As a Druid, you’re are shapeshifters who can transform into a savage werebear or a vicious werewolf while also unleashing nature’s wrath to defeat your foes. Your unique class mechanic is<strong> </strong>the <strong>Spirit Animal system</strong>, which grants your character a boon such as new passives and stat increases.</p>
<p id="n9ckQp">Necromancers are not the only summoners in <em>Diablo 4</em>, as you can also call companions to your aid as a Druid. Summon wolves, ravens, and vines to assist you in defeating the demons scattered around Sanctuary. You’ll also be able to bring forth some of nature’s deadliest calamities such as a hurricane to sweep away your enemies.</p>

<p id="tbYrO7">Once you unlock your first Specialization at level 15 — <strong>Combo Points</strong> — you’ll stick with it through the leveling process.

<li id="SCnoL6">Ambush</li>
<li id="Rh3CGQ">Closer</li>

<li id="SoMhuV">Exploit</li>
<li id="5Hrt2S">Turf</li>
<li id="7ZnpCj">Versatility</li>
</ol>
<p id="nsYJP8">You can path your own way through the Paragon Boards following these basic guidelines. However, for the best results, follow <a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/shadow-step-rogue-guide">M1PY’s path</a> exactly.</p>

<p id="91X17S">Rogues are the classic bow-wielders in <em>Diablo 4</em>. But they’re also much more than that. Instead of just slinging arrows, they also utilize stealth, traps, and knives. This makes them one of <em>Diablo 4</em>’s most versatile classes, and also gives them several different build paths to take:</p>
<ul>
<li id="TQuMBT">Momentum</li>
<li id="fNsMb4">Melee</li>
<li id="uf2HQH">Precision</li>
<li id="p030jH">Vulnerable</li>
<li id="NBQ9U1">Trap</li>
</ul>
<p id="c6pXrK"><strong>Melee</strong>-specific builds have a few options. They can use the <strong>Momentum Key Passive</strong> to deal additional damage and gain bonus effects when backstabbing enemies or attacking those impacted by certain crowd control effects, like Stunned Dazed, or Frozen. Similarly, the <strong>Close Quarters Combat Key Passive</strong> gives you bonuses for using certain skills on enemies that are nearby.</p>
<p id="wi20SW">For <strong>ranged </strong>builds, <strong>Precision </strong>is your best bet. Hitting a critical hit on an enemy with Marksman skills increases your crit chance drastically over time. </p>
<p id="pPCMRA">Then there are Rogue’s <strong>status </strong>builds. The <strong>Victimize Key Passive</strong> causes hits on Vulnerable enemies to create an explosion. The <strong>Exposure Key Passive</strong> gives a small chance for some massive buffs when the Rogue deals damage with a trap.</p>
<p id="H5oR7p">The important thing to remember when building your own Rogue build is that mobility and versatility are your friends. The Key Passives here aren’t entire identities on their own the way some other classes are. Instead, they’re huge bonuses that can fit into multiple playstyles. While making your Rogue, figure out which skills you want to use and which Specializations you want to use first, then pick out your Key Passive once you reach the end.</p>

  <p id="DQaXKo"><strong>Necromancers</strong> are the summoners of<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides"><em>Diablo 4</em></a>, but that’s not their entire identity. Like much of <em>Diablo 4</em>, Necromancers are far more complex than you’d initially imagine. So when you can summon minions to do your bidding or sacrifice them for major stat bonuses, how do you know what to do? That’s where we come in, with our suggestions of the best Necromancer builds for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24147550/diablo-4-d4-season-loot-reborn-patch-notes"><em>Diablo 4</em> season 4</a>.</p>
<p id="kAtIMU">Necromancers are able to summon Skeletons and Golems. But they’re also able to cast Sorcerer-like spells dealing in the creepier sides of magic. They can sling bones and drain blood from foes. They can even project poison blight on the ground. And, yes, they can sacrifice minions for incredible bonuses with the Book of the Dead.</p>
<p id="wDeXqI">In this<em> Diablo 4</em> guide, we’ve gathered and simplified <strong>the best </strong><em><strong>Diablo 4</strong></em><strong> Necromancer builds for season 4</strong>. If you need even more information on item affixes or other more complex ideas, we’ve been sure to link out to the more detailed versions of these builds, as well as where to find their original creators.</p>

<h3 id="3uBOW7"><strong>Best skills for leveling</strong></h3>
<p id="Bm17wV">Necromancer leveling guides use the absolute powerhouse of a skill: <strong>Bone Spear</strong>. Bone Spear is both extremely versatile and deals massive damage, hence why we rank it up so quickly. In this build, you’ll also use <strong>Bone Splinters</strong>, <strong>Corpse Explosion</strong>, <strong>Blood Mist</strong>, and <strong>Decrepify — </strong>as well as both Golem and Skeleton skills.</p>
<p id="hSqHKY">Here are the best skills for a Necromancer leveling build, organized by the exact order you should purchase them in — bearing in mind that some skills require you to allocate a number of skill points in the tree in order to unlock them. As such, you’ll need to unlock new skills before enhancing existing ones. </p>
<p id="P4a6Fn"><strong>Note</strong>: GhazzyTV’s guide recommends starting with <strong>Blood Surge</strong> and transitioning to <strong>Bone Spear</strong> after level 15.</p>
<ol>
<li id="WiZ6Zb">Bone Splinters / Enhanced Bone Splinters </li>
<li id="xZ8fs9">Blood Surge (rank 1-5) — <strong>Replace with Bone Spear (rank 1-5) after level 15</strong>
</li>
<li id="vS4ku7">Corpse Explosion / Enhanced Corpse Explosion</li>
<li id="6N0fb4">Hewed Flesh (rank 1-3)</li>

</ol>
<h3 id="WzlfSe"><strong>Best Book of the Dead setup for leveling</strong></h3>
<p id="tbYrO7">While sacrificing your minions is the common play for endgame builds, most builds actually use minions while leveling, and this build is not different. Here are the minions you should use for this build:</p>
<ul>
<li id="HLcS2Z">Melee Skeletons – <strong>Reapers</strong>
</li>
<li id="Wb6ujL">Mage Skeletons – <strong>Cold</strong>
</li>
<li id="5e4Ig1">Golem – <strong>Bone </strong>(change to <strong>Iron </strong>as you get closer to 50)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vgooTx"><strong>Best Legendary Aspect for Necromancer leveling build</strong></h3>
<p id="wzErla">GhazzyTV’s build only recommends a single Legendary Aspect while leveling.</p>

<p id="wzYlJX">Necromancer’s are <em>Diablo 4</em>’s main summoning class — although Druids, ironically, had better summons during the game’s launch window. But aside from their army of minions, Necromancers also act as a darker caster, sharing a lot of playstyle DNA with the Sorcerer.</p>
<p id="JZGvYm">Like all classes, most Necromancer builds boil down to a few Key Passives:</p>
<ul>
<li id="MySBk1">Bone</li>
<li id="ryE2Z8">Blood/Health</li>
<li id="xbByST">Shadow</li>
<li id="OfYHi6">Minion</li>
</ul>
<p id="ZoxX03"><strong>Bone</strong> skills — like Bone Spear — hit extremely hard for Necromancers, and are great for chunking down enemies. The <strong>Ossified Essence Key Passive</strong> modifies that damage even further for players that successfully pool their Essence. <strong>Blood </strong>builds utilize Blood skills to both keep the Necromancer healthy while dealing big damage. These builds typically end with the <strong>Rathma’s Vigor Key Passive</strong>.</p>
<p id="WjxVLZ"><strong>Shadow </strong>builds use Shadow skills to poison enemies with dark essence. Interestingly, the <strong>Shadowblight Key Passive</strong> not only benefits the Necromancer, but also their minions, making it a more diverse build path. <strong>Minion </strong>builds are Necromancer’s main bread and butter, but are entirely dependent on how good minions are in the current meta. When they’re useful, these builds end with the <strong>Kalan’s Edict Key Passive</strong>.</p>
<p id="VYSleq">Like all classes, Necromancer builds have other identities to them — like <strong>Thorns </strong>— but most will converge on one of the four identities highlighted above. What really determines build viability on Necromancer is how you use your minions and the <strong>Book of the Dead</strong>. If you want to make your own build, decide early on if you want to sacrifice your minions or use them in battle. This will not only determine which skills you’ll want to use, but which of the four Key Passives you want to angle toward.</p>

<h3 id="kMSNCX"><strong>Paragon Boards for Sorcerer Frozen Orb build</strong></h3>
<p id="hM6DRX">The Paragon Board system is very complex, and you’ll want to carefully pair your Glyphs with specific boards for your class:</p>

<li id="4y2ekE">Enhancement Master / Reinforced Glyph</li>
<li id="NsCfXP">Icefall / Control Glyph</li>

<li id="IwIOPQ">Frigid Fate / Tactician Glyph</li>
<li id="ifLBhO">Searing Heat / Exploit Glyph</li>

<p id="91X17S">Sorcerers are <em>Diablo 4</em>’s pure caster class, and use elemental magic to differentiate from the  spells of the Druid and Necromancer. The Sorcerer has six Key Passives, but only three elements, which is what you’ll base your build around:</p>
<ul>
<li id="7TI4Ky">Lightning</li>
<li id="nQ5vv2">Fire</li>
<li id="Wlq3y2">Ice</li>
</ul>
<p id="lvQbFf"><strong>Lightning</strong> builds utilize Lightning skills to deal with large groups of enemies at once. When making a Lightning build, you’ll end up using the <strong>Overflowing Energy Key Passive</strong> or the <strong>Vyr’s Master Key Passive</strong>, depending on if you’re in melee range or not.</p>
<p id="y2SMwp"><strong>Ice</strong> builds specialize in slowing enemies down, making it easier to survive their attacks. Ice builds will take advantage of either the<strong> Avalanche Key Passive</strong> or the<strong> Shatter Key Passive</strong>, depending on how much your build relies on crowd control</p>
<p id="Q9honF"><strong>Fire</strong> builds are all about big explosions and burning your enemies. For these builds, you’ll typically use either the <strong>Combustion Key Passive</strong> for burning enemies or the <strong>Esu’s Ferocity Key Passive</strong> for chunky critical strikes.</p>
<p id="eGofyn">When making your own build for a Sorcerer, you’ll likely end up sticking to one element for your main damage sources. But that’s not the most important thing you need to remember. Sorcerers die very, very easily in<em> Diablo 4</em>, and they have the weakest defensive stats by far — however, they can deal a massive amount of damage when built correctly. If you don’t want to end up dead more often than not, make sure to invest heavily in defensive skills while making your way toward one of the six Key Passives we listed above.</p>

  <p id="DQaXKo"><strong>Barbarians</strong> are a relatively simple class in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides"><em>Diablo 4</em></a>: They smash stuff. However, <em>Diablo 4</em> is underscored by math that’s so complex that even the simple act of smashing stuff becomes a dizzying equation. That’s where we come in, with our suggestions of the best Barbarian builds for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24147550/diablo-4-d4-season-loot-reborn-patch-notes"><em>Diablo 4</em> season 4</a>. </p>
<p id="eFKRQo">Barbarians are big, muscular, and powerful. They excel at using Bleed to kill their enemies over time. And their unique weapon-swapping system means they get to have more Legendary powers at their disposal than any other class.</p>
<p id="KIZEyS">In this <em>Diablo 4</em> guide, we’ve gathered and simplified <strong>the best </strong><em><strong>Diablo 4 </strong></em><strong>Barbarian builds for season 4</strong>. If you need even more information on item affixes or other more complex ideas, we’ve been sure to link out to the more detailed versions of these builds, as well as where to find their original creators. </p>

<p id="cfQSwL">This build is based off <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lexyu/">Lexyu</a>’s Barbarian leveling guide at <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/guides/barbarian-leveling-guide/">IcyVeins</a>, and is purely for leveling: i.e., allocating your 58 skill points between levels 1 and 50. If you want more detailed information about the item affixes you want to look for on your gear, or which other Legendary powers are great for your build, check out the original <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/guides/barbarian-leveling-guide/">IcyVeins guide</a>.</p>
<h3 id="3uBOW7"><strong>Best skills for leveling</strong></h3>
<p id="Bm17wV">Most Barbarian leveling guides you’ll find make use of <strong>Hammer of the Ancients</strong> as your primary skill, as it deals massive damage while remaining very cheap to cast. In this build, you’ll also use <strong>Frenzy</strong>, <strong>Death Blow</strong>, <strong>Rallying Cry</strong>, <strong>Leap</strong>, and <strong>Wrath of the Berserker</strong>.</p>
<p id="hSqHKY">Here are the best skills for a Barbarian leveling build, organized by the exact order you should purchase them in — bearing in mind that some skills require you to allocate a number of skill points in the tree in order to unlock them. As such, you’ll need to unlock new skills before enhancing existing ones:</p>
<ol>
<li id="xZ8fs9">Frenzy / Enhanced Frenzy</li>
<li id="SMZh9d">Hammer of the Ancients / Enhanced Hammer of the Ancients / Furious Hammer of the Ancients</li>
<li id="jmtKHZ">Combat Frenzy</li>
<li id="4KdOmW">Rallying Cry / Enhanced Rallying Cry / Tactical Rallying Cry</li>
<li id="6D3eAp">Hammer of the Ancients (ranks 2-3)</li>
<li id="9QeWh7">Leap / Enhanced Leap / Power Leap</li>
<li id="U56dKQ">Hammer of the Ancients (ranks 4-5)</li>
<li id="qNrubq">Death Blow /<strong> </strong>Enhanced Death Blow / Warrior’s Death Blow / Death Blow (rank 2-5)</li>
<li id="zxXIif">Wrath of the Berserker /<strong> </strong>Prime Wrath of the Berserker / Supreme Wrath of the Berserker</li>
<li id="KrN50z">Pit Fighter (ranks 1-3)</li>
<li id="mzMBmt">Tempered Fury</li>
<li id="Q4o2QJ">Furious Impulse (ranks 1-3)</li>
<li id="bx2OeZ">Walking Arsenal</li>
<li id="bSP7sS">Hamstring</li>
<li id="ABkerJ">No Mercy</li>
<li id="bDTTou">Expose Vulnerability (ranks 1-3)</li>
<li id="OzAs38">No Mercy (ranks 2-3)</li>
<li id="X8ztTv">Swiftness (ranks 1-3)</li>
<li id="BBvrUS">Thick Skin (ranks 1-3)</li>
<li id="BtEVHc">Counteroffensive (ranks 1-3)</li>

<li id="dtLuJJ">Slaying Strike (ranks 1-3)</li>
<li id="Q2xJl0">Aggressive Resistance</li>
<li id="hZYHjN">Prolific Fury </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="WzlfSe"><strong>Best Weapon Expertise setup for leveling</strong></h3>
<p id="tbYrO7">Once you unlock the <strong>Weapon Expertise</strong> system for your Barbarian, you’ll want to place the  <strong>two-handed sword</strong> in your <strong>Technique </strong>slot. This will cause all of your Hammer of the Ancients damage to make enemies <strong>Bleed</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="vgooTx"><strong>Best Legendary Aspects for Barbarian leveling build</strong></h3>
<p id="wzErla">When you first start your new character, complete these three dungeons first in order to collect their <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23768833/aspects-dungeons-locations-list-codex">Aspects</a>. Then place them on a piece of gear (ideally jewelry, when possible). Just keep in mind that you should replace these Legendaries with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo-4-guides/23654101/aspects-codex-power-occultist-extract-imprint">new versions using the imprint system</a> every few levels.</p>
<ul>
<li id="kBLhHJ">
<strong>Aspect of Ancestral Force</strong> (Sunken Ruins dungeon in Scosglen) — Hammer of the Ancients quakes outwards, dealing X% of its damage to enemies</li>
<li id="8bONxs">
<strong>Aspect of the Expectant</strong> (Underroot dungeon in Scosglen) — Attacking enemies with a Basic Skill increases the damage of your next Core Skill cast by X% up to X%</li>
<li id="SKeC2z">
<strong>Edgemaster’s Aspect</strong> (Oldstones dungeon in Scosglen) — Skills deal X% increased damage based on Primary Resource when cast, receiving the maximum benefit while you have full Primary Resource</li>
</ul>

<p id="hM6DRX">The Paragon Board system is very complex, and you’ll want to carefully pair your Glyphs with specific boards for your class:</p>
<ol>
<li id="MGhKwJ">Starter Board / Twister Glyph</li>
<li id="4y2ekE">Blood Rage / Exploit Glyph</li>
<li id="M3MYWu">Warbringer / Territorial Glyph</li>
<li id="9EkKYD">Carnage / Ambidextrous Glyph</li>
<li id="LVMoL4">Decimator / Ire Glyph</li>
<li id="VFG1ZD">Flawless Technique / Undaunted Glyph</li>
</ol>
<p id="bsj6oK">You should level your Glyphs to 15 in this specific order:</p>
<ol>
<li id="SCnoL6">Twister</li>
<li id="GflMI7">Exploit</li>

<p id="91X17S">Barbarians are <em>Diablo 4</em>’s only <em>pure </em>melee class, with the other classes having hybrid builds for multiple ranges. There are four main ideas that all Barbarian builds stem from:</p>
<ul>
<li id="wzYlJX">Fury dumping</li>
<li id="ISvBBB">Weapon swapping</li>
<li id="8HMtjz">Bleed</li>
<li id="R1fy6W">Berserk</li>
</ul>
<p id="ZoxX03"><strong>Fury dump </strong>builds make use of the <strong>Unbridled Rage</strong> Key Passive, which causes your Fury spenders to cost double the Fury but deal more than double the damage. These kinds of builds obviously require very steady Fury generation, as it’s easy to starve yourself. <strong>Berserk </strong>builds that use the <strong>Unconstrained Key Passive</strong> are all about keeping your Barbarian in the Berserk stage at all times, which nets you a hefty bonus. All Barbarian builds will likely use some skills that make them go Berserk, the Unconstrained Key Passive just enhances the effect.</p>
<p id="3w74VS"><strong>Bleed builds</strong> use the <strong>Gushing Wounds</strong> Key Passive to create a critical strike heavy build that’s great for whittling down groups of enemies with damage over time and explosions. <strong>Weapon swapping builds</strong> offer what is almost certainly the most unique playstyle for Barbarians and takes advantage of the<strong> Walking Arsenal</strong> Key Passive. The idea here is that you’re constantly swapping between your skills and weapons to give yourself massive damage buffs.</p>
<p id="YgQaS9">When making a build, you want to have one of these Key Passives in mind and choose your skills accordingly. Thankfully skills that share certain aspects (like Bleed) are color-coded on the skill tree, and you can even use the in-game search function to find them all. Other Barbarian builds let you take advantage of mechanics like <strong>Thorns </strong>or <strong>Shouts</strong>. But they still typically end with one of these Key Passives.</p>

<p>It looks like NFL fans are going to get a double-dose of big news this week. In addition to the league’s schedule release, Madden 25 appears to be set for a reveal.</p>



<p>According to reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-connait-la-date-de-sortie-du-prochain-madden-nfl-25-50251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data minter billbil-kun</a>, EA Sports is set to reveal Madden 25 on Thursday, May 16. The game is scheduled to be released on August 16 with four days early access starting August 12.</p>



<p>As far as the game is concerned, billbil-kun says that it will have a reworked physics engine among other updates. The updates to this year’s game — such as improvements to Franchise and Superstar Mode — are expected to be a part of the reveal on May 16 along with pricing and the various editions of the game. </p>



<p>The report says that the game’s cover athlete isn’t expected to be revealed during the initial announcement. </p>



<p>“We believe the identity of the player on the cover of the game will be revealed at a later stage, unlike the first announcement of&nbsp;Madden NFL 24&nbsp;last year,” the report says.</p>



<p>One feature that is expected this year is the inclusion of new broadcasters. Current commentator Charles Davis revealed back in December 2023 that Madden 25 will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-25-to-have-new-announcers/">multiple announce teams</a> for the first time.</p>



<p>Madden 25 will be the second game of the same name. Back in 2013, EA Sports celebrated the 25th anniversary of the franchise by renaming Madden 14 to Madden 25. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-by-daylight-8th-anniversary-stream-shares-new-details-on-2v8-mode-d-d-chapter-and-more.870570/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-8th-anniversary-stream-everything-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Dead by Daylight turns eight today, and to celebrate the milestone, Behaviour Interactive held its anniversary stream to share new details on updates headed to the asymmetrical horror game. This includes an official reveal of a new game mode, details on the previously teased D&amp;D chapter, and updates on its upcoming spinoff projects. </p><p>But if you missed it, don't worry. We break down every announcement from the Dead by Daylight 8th Anniversary Stream below: </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Dead by Daylight's 2V8 mode officially announced</strong></h2><p>Dead by Daylight fans, your wish has been granted: a 2V8 mode is coming. As the name implies, this game mode will have two killers facing off against eight survivors, and will include a larger map to accommodate the increase in players. However, this won't be a rehash of the previous game mode, as the developer confirmed that Perks will not be available in 2V8; instead, it will be replaced with a Class system. </p><p>Because the community has highly requested the 2V8 mode, Behaviour revealed that its initial launch would be a building block for tweaks and adjustments based on community feedback. Behaviour plans to share more details on 2V8 mode in July, with a late summer release window. 
</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons chapter coming to Dead by Daylight next month</strong></h2><p>After <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-teases-dungeons-and-dragons-themed-chapter">teasing a D&amp;D-themed crossover in Dead by Daylight last week</a>, Behaviour Interactive has finally made a proper reveal for the next licensed chapter. </p><p>This new chapter, which launches on June 3, will introduce Vecna as a new killer, who will have four spells available to his playstyle: Fly, Flight of the Damned, Mage Hand, and Dispelling Sphere. At the same time, the two survivors are male and female Bard characters: Baermar Uraz, a human male, and Aestri Yazar, a female elf. Regardless of which gender you choose, this new survivor has three unique perks: Mirror Illusion, Bardic Inspiration, and Still Sight. Alongside new playable characters, the next chapter will introduce a new map inspired by the D&amp;D franchise. The Forgotten Ruins is a new dungeon-themed map that serves as a home to Vecna after he finds himself mysteriously transported into The Fog. Alongside an expansive main floor is an extensive underground component filled with horrific experiments and secrets to discover. </p><p>For those interested in trying the new chapter early, it is available on the Dead by Daylight Public Test server today. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Dead by Daylight spinoff The Casting of Frank Stone gets new trailer, but no release date</strong></h2><p>Last year, Behaviour announced it was expanding the Dead by Daylight franchise by announcing two new games set in the same universe. One of them was The Casting of Frank Stone, a new narrative-driven game from Until Dawn developer Supermassive Games. </p><p>An <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-supermassive-games-spinoff-revealed">official reveal</a> came last December during The Game Awards, and today's anniversary stream provided another look at the game. The new trailer reveals that the game is set in 1980 and focuses on a group of friends who are on a quest to make their own horror film. </p><p>Though we still do not have a firm release date, today's trailer doubles down the fact that The Casting of Frank Stone is still targeting to release sometime this year. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Dead by Daylight's upcoming PvE shooter, codenamed Project T, is launching an Insider Program</strong></h2><p>The second of two previously announced spinoffs, Behaviour shared new details about its unannounced PvE game, codenamed Project T. Developed by Midwinter Entertainment, Project T is an action-horror co-op shooter, set in a set in a region called The Backwater, up to four players can join together and fend off the monsters inhabiting the area. </p><p>Project T still doesn't have a release window. Still, Behaviour revealed that it is launching an Insider Program, allowing players interested in the spinoff to become active in its development cycle. The insider program will include incentives, such as access to closed playtests.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>What the Fog is a new rougouelite Dead by Daylight spinoff for PC</strong></h2><p>While fans previously knew about the other two spinoff games, Behaviour added a third one to the mix: a 2-person co-op roguelite game called What the Fog. Developed in-house by Behaviour, What the Fog has  players control Dead by Daylight survivors Claudette Morel, Dwight Fairfield, or Feng Min as they run, jump, and shoot their way through a swarm of monsters.</p><p>What the Fog is exlclusive to PC, with the first 2 million copies available, free of charge, if you sign into or create a Behaviour account. After the promotion, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139020/What_the_Fog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What the Fog, will cost $4.99</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2><strong>Behaviour teases Castlevania</strong> <strong>as the next chapter for Dead by Daylight</strong></h2><p>As a final "and one more thing"-type announcement, Behaviour announced that the next chapter coming to Dead by Daylight is Konami's popular action-adventure series Castlevania. Not a ton of information was shared during the stream, but Behaviour promised that fans will get more details on August 6. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

<p data-characters="359" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s no secret that <em>Stardew Valley</em> is the responsibility of a small developer. Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone was busy trying to get the hotly anticipated <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/stardew-valley-patch-1-6-adds-new-crops-mastery-system-new-neighbors/">1.6 update out for PC</a>, which finally went live in March. Since then, they’ve been promising patches for the console and mobile ports of the game, though they haven’t emerged yet.</p> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Patience is very much appreciated from Barone, and a recent post on Twitter/X is keeping us in the loop on <em>Stardew Valley</em> 1.6 for console and mobile. The latest is that the developer is “doing everything within my power to have the ports ready as soon as possible.”</p> <figure data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I know that the console and mobile players are eager to play 1.6, and I am doing everything within my power to have the ports ready as soon as possible. The ports require extra work beyond the PC version. There is also another patch for PC underway which is mainly some bug fixes</p>— ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1790396655054848363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">There’s still no release date yet, but the fact of the matter is: “the ports require extra work beyond the PC version.” The important thing is that it’s being worked on, but being a small outfit, it’s understandable that it takes time to deliver huge updates.</p> <h2 id="h-also" data-injectable="false">Also…</h2> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="528" data-injectable="true">In the meantime, PC users will have another patch coming their way soon. The post above goes on to say that more bug fixes are in the pipeline. The game is already on version 1.6.6, so it sounds like 1.6.7 is hopefully being sent out soon.</p>
 <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false"><em>Stardew Valley</em> is one of the most successful games on the indie scene. Released in 2016, and with a current <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> review score of “Overwhelmingly Positive,” Barone’s life simulator has been a breath of fresh air, offering a chill gameplay environment in an idyllic and colorful setting.</p> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="false">The 1.6 update does add a huge amount of new content and some changes to the game, which is why console and mobile players are so keen to get their hands on it. Rest assured, Barone is on the case, and it’ll be ready when it’s ready.</p>

<p data-characters="399" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There have been efforts in some parts of Europe to impose <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/european-countries-back-report-against-loot-box-gacha-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stricter regulations on games with microtransactions</a>, with loot boxes in particular singled out as being a form of gambling. The Netherlands, for example, has pushed for loot boxes to be outright banned, and now it’s slapped <em>Fortnite</em> company Epic Games with a hefty fine for “unfair commercial practices” aimed at children.</p> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (or ACM for short) imposed the fine on May 14, having conducted an investigation into <em>Fortnite</em>‘s monetisation and advertising practices. You can read the full report for yourself on <a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/acm-imposes-fine-epic-unfair-commercial-practices-aimed-children-fortnite-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the ACM’s website</a>, but the long and short of it is that it believes the game exploits children with aggressive advertising, such as using phrases like “Get it now” or “Buy now.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="699" data-current-count="999" data-injectable="true">“Ads that directly exhort children to make purchases are an illegal aggressive commercial practice,” argues the ACM, which is why it’s fined Epic Games €562,500. However, the ACM has also deemed countdown timers for certain items to be “misleading.” Such timers obviously aim to convince customers to purchase an item before it expires by invoking scarcity and FOMO. The ACM claims to have found that some of these time-limited items never actually left the item store even after their timer expired. Deeming such timers misleading, the ACM has imposed a second fine of €562,500, meaning Epic has to fork over a total of €1,125,000, which is roughly $1.2 million.</p>
 <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">The ACM has given Epic a deadline of June 10, 2024 to end such violations, though its report states Epic has already removed all countdown timers from the <em>Fortnite</em> shop. The company has also informed the ACM of its plans for other such changes, and will “present to players up to the age of 18 years in the Netherlands only items in the Item Shop that will be available for 48 hours or more” starting from May 24.</p>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">Despite sounding like it was willing to play ball in the report, Epic has said it intends to appeal the decision, in a statement to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/epic-11m-fined-for-breaking-eu-consumer-law-in-netherlands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. What’s more, it’s said the ACM’s findings contain “significant factual errors about how <em>Fortnite</em> and the Item Shop operate,” arguing that it’s mandating for changes that would hamper the player experience.</p> <p data-characters="584" data-current-count="976" data-injectable="false">According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/disneys-epic-deal-shows-sharp-cut-fortnite-makers-valuation-the-information-2024-02-08/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, Epic Games is valued at $22.5 billion, following a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-persistent-universe-connected-to-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1.5 billion investment by Disney</a>, so a $1.2 million fine feels like chump change for the company. Then again, it’s not too surprising Epic’s so quick to push back against the ACM. This is the same company who, after violating Apple’s terms and services and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/update-epic-just-goaded-apple-into-removing-fortnite-from-the-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting <em>Fortnite</em> booted from the Apple store</a>, immediately kicked off a years-long lawsuit. It even turned the whole affair into a business opportunity, with an in-game #FreeFortnite event and advertising made to rally fans to its side.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/supergiant-hades-2-dash-chronos-difficulty<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While <em>Hades 2</em> is a game where weapons, boons, arcana cards, and a multitude of other elements can tug runs in different directions for every player, it’s likely that many <em>Hades 1</em> players had roughly the same first experience with the game: They tried to dash, and then they tried to dash again. They discovered, to their chagrin, that they could not immediately dash a second time, but would instead begin sprinting if they kept the button held down. Something, they began to suspect, had gone horribly wrong.</p><p>This has led to calls for the return of the original game’s dash, as well as broader observations that <em>Hades 2 </em>doesn’t feel as good to play. Other pervasive complaints are similar: New main character Melinoë starts out too weak compared to original main character Zagreus. The new final boss is too hard compared to Hades himself from the first game. The new boons aren’t as good. Selene, the moon incarnate, is a poor replacement for the ability to call for aid from specific gods.&nbsp;</p><p>In response to all of this, I’d like to echo a sentiment shared by players who – like myself – are probably freaks with close to 50 hours in <em>Hades 2</em>: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1cqtj0q/two_things_are_true_on_the_comparisons_between/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Give it time</a>. Just like the original <em>Hades</em>, <em>Hades 2</em> is an onion you peel back over the course of countless runs. It’s not really fair to compare early or mid-game Melinoë to late- (and non-early access) game Zagreus. And again, as in the original, the secret best part of the process is learning to love mechanics and items that you disliked or even hated at first blush.</p><figure><blockquote><p>It’s not really fair to compare early or mid-game Melinoë to late- (and non-early access) game Zagreus.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Let’s use the dash as an example. Though double-dash was not unlocked from the <em>very </em>beginning of the original <em>Hades</em>, being able to dash a whole, whole, whole lot was a cornerstone of the game. Zagreus was a fleet-footed blur. He was so prone to darting every which way that they ought to have called him Zig-Zagreus. There was comfort in this blazing hyperactivity. As long as you remained on the move, you felt almost untouchable. Dash spam was more than just an option; it was Zagreus’ mid-battle identity. He was a berserker, dashing and slashing to relieve years of pent-up rage at his dear old dad, Hades.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s understandable that players have felt distraught upon discovering that <em>Hades 2 </em>is more judicious with its dashes. I remember when I first realized the game had snatched away my comfort zone like a thief in the night. I thought “Oh no, am I gonna be bad at this game? Will I even be able to beat a single boss?” But as I embarked on run after run and dug deeper into Melinoë’s kit, I came to appreciate just how much she has at her disposal to compensate for her inability to fight like several competing car accidents.&nbsp;</p><p>Casts and specials can take on so many interesting forms. Omega abilities – especially once powered up – feel like unleashing a tidal wave on your enemies. All of this emphasizes distance and positioning, as well as a more aware playstyle. In the game’s early goings, you can’t afford to take your eye off the ball or go on autopilot. You have to stay focused. Enemy types are designed to both get you up to speed with Melinoë’s unique capabilities and punish you for plunging in like you’re Zagreus 2.0. Instead of charging in and hammering away until anything you perceive as even vaguely nail-shaped is firmly in the ground, you have to stick and move. If enemies keep swarming you, you’ve got to remember to throw down a circle to glue their feet to the floor for a few seconds. When in doubt, hop on your (figurative) bicycle, reposition, and try again. Don’t get me wrong: This is still very much <em>Hades</em>. You’re still solving a series of ever-shifting puzzles one piece at a time. It’s just a different type of puzzle.&nbsp;</p><p>This, in turn, fits with Melinoë’s character: She was raised almost from birth to complete her task. Poise and focus are pillars of her personality, to the point that she and others in her life worry that maybe she’s a little <em>too </em>locked in to enjoy life’s bounties. In that regard, <em>Hades 2</em> is about peeling back both mechanical layers and those of Melinoë herself. Slowly but surely, she emerges from her shell and learns how to stop and smell the roses – or weird Chaos alien flowers – every once in a while.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Supergiant</figcaption></figure><p>Melinoë’s playstyle similarly expands over time. At first I struggled to employ her arsenal holistically. I’d focus on attacks one run, specials another, or circles during a third, depending on which weapon I was wielding. Then, dozens of runs down the line, everything clicked. Using specific abilities and placing circles depending on which enemies were in front of me became second nature. Different weapons and boons, meanwhile, allowed for – and, depending on what I encountered during a run, sometimes <em>forced </em>– different playstyles. When I first started playing, I was laser-focused on achieving roughly the same build every run. I got mad when boons didn’t align just so. I felt like the game was wasting my time. Now, dozens of hours in, I love that there are instances where my favorite builds prove impossible, forcing me to improvise. Runs have a lot more actual variety than they did in the first game. You’ve just got to be willing to roll with the punches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, I initially thought the sprint felt a bit clunky, especially once I reached more hectic boss fights, like Scylla and the Sirens. But over time I’ve come to appreciate the ways sprinting opens up the game’s map design – allowing for larger, more multifaceted areas like the Fields of Mourning and the City of Ephyra – and, once sufficiently powered up, lets me literally run circles around bosses like Cerberus (and even Chronos, on a good day). I feel like Sonic The Hedgehog, zipping behind bosses’ big attacks before they even finish firing them off. But even with a wimpy vanilla sprint, there’s a thrill to the moments where you just barely outpace, say, Cerberus’ giant gout of flame. It might be a predictable attack pattern, but <em>the way</em> you evade it – sprinting at top speed as it practically singes the hairs on the back of your neck – feels like something out of an action movie. There’s something to be said for those tiny thrills. They keep runs interesting, even when everything seems to be going according to plan.</p><p>Supergiant’s greatest masterstroke in all of this, if you ask me, is having Chronos sporadically teleport you into Asphodel, a location from<em> Hades 1</em>, and forcing you to survive against enemies designed around the first game’s move set. It really drives home just how different Melinoë is from Zagreus, how much she struggles when surrounded on all sides by hazards that her older brother would have just crashed over, under, or through. But it’s also a very clear and clever wake up call. <em>Hades 2</em> forces you to stay on top of a small, circular space for a sustained period of time – rather than just kill a bunch of enemies – to prevail in this encounter, and maintaining space is what Melinoë does best. So Supergiant is spelling out for you, very explicitly, how Melinoë would navigate a situation that you previously overcame hundreds of times in Zagreus’ shoes. Supergiant is demonstrating her unique strengths in addition to her weaknesses.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I <em>enjoy </em>the process of warming up to some of those things, of believing something might just not be for me, only to be proven wrong a dozen hours later.</p></blockquote></figure><p>After nearly 50 hours, the sprint is far from the only divisive element of <em>Hades 2</em> I’ve come to appreciate. I actually love that Chronos is a titanic pain in the ass to beat. It makes his snarling snark that much more menacing, and when you finally do take him down, it’s a giant exhale. You feel shaky but triumphant. You, like Melinoë, can barely believe you did it. Comparatively speaking, beating Hades in <em>Hades </em>began to feel trivial after a while. I enjoy Chronos as a more mechanically credible threat. That said, to those with doubts, I would again say: Give Chronos, the Titan of time, time. <em>Hades 2</em> will eventually provide you with the tools you need to beat him, even if it might feel like it’s taking a little longer than in the original game. Also, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-god-mode-autofire-timer-1851461987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there’s always God Mode</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, <em>Hades 2</em> is in early access, and I have no doubt that Supergiant will tweak some of these things: damage, balance, boon effects, and even <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072251730219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sprint responsiveness</a>. But the core of the game – its many overlapping loops – feels very intentionally designed, down to the detail. I <em>enjoy </em>the process of warming up to some of those things, of believing something might just not be for me, only to be proven wrong a dozen hours later. That’s key to the experience, as far as I’m concerned.&nbsp;</p><p>Put another way, when I first unlocked the Moonstone Axe, I thought it was hot garbage. Too slow to wind up and cool down. Too many openings. Just a big, clumsy liability. A couple nights ago, I pulled off a run in which I used it to down the first boss in a single-digit number of hits. I never should have doubted it. I was a fool. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>is eight years old this year, and developer Behaviour Interactive is celebrating with a slew of new announcements surrounding the game.</p>
<p>During an anniversary celebration stream today, Behaviour revealed a number of new things coming to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>, including more details about the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>, a new game announcement, and another tantalizing crossover.</p>
<p>First up, the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>crossover content has been revealed, and if you guessed that everyone's favorite lich Vecna would be the killer joining the roster from the popular tabletop RPG, you'd be absolutely correct.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-eighth-anniversary-vecna-screenshot.jpg?itok=ZCtaTYib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-eighth-anniversary-vecna-screenshot.jpg?itok=pk28Awuw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Say hello to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s newest killer Vecna. Then run away from him screaming.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with Vecna, the crossover is also bringing a new survivor (well, technically two) in the form of the Bard. You can choose between elven female Aestri Yazar and human male Baermar Uraz for your Bard.</p>
<p>A new map, the Forgotten Ruins, is being introduced. It's Vecna's domain, but it's scattered with chests in which you can find gear to help you fight his spells. In a cute&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-themed twist, you'll have to roll to see what item you get.</p>
<p>All of this&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-themed stuff is coming to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>on June 3rd, but if you're of a mind, you can check it out right now on the PTB (public test build) via Steam. You can do that by selecting the "public-test" branch in the game's Properties window within your Steam library.</p>

<p>As well as learning about the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>crossover, we also got a glimpse of some of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s upcoming spinoffs.</p>
<p>None of them are perhaps quite as out there as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hooked-on-you-dead-by-daylight-dating-sim-is-out-today"><em>Hooked On You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim</em></a>, but they should whet your appetite for more&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>content.</p>
<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Project T&nbsp;</em>is a third-person co-op shooter in which you will explore the Backwater, a hitherto-unexplored region controlled by the Entity. The game is in its early development stages right now, so you'll have to wait for a bit more info in the coming months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-eighth-anniversary-project-t-spinoff.jpg?itok=rzU6dWI1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-eighth-anniversary-project-t-spinoff.jpg?itok=FzNqotuy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>Project T&nbsp;</em>is currently in its early development stages.</figcaption></figure><p>We also got to hear more about&nbsp;<em>The Casting of Frank Stone</em>, the single-player narrative horror game currently in development over at&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/quarry">The Quarry</a>&nbsp;</em>and <em>The&nbsp;</em><em>Dark Pictures&nbsp;</em>dev Supermassive Games.</p>
<p>The game will revolve around a group of teens who head to a small town in order to make a movie. It sounds like a pretty typical Supermassive setup, but with the extra spice added by the&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>connection.</p>
<p>Finally, a brand new game,&nbsp;<em>What the Fog</em>, was announced. It's a "chaotic roguelite" in which you'll need to work with a friend to complete objectives across a series of procedurally-generated levels. The game's available right now on Steam, and it's free for a limited time as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-eighth-anniversary-what-the-fog-spinoff.jpg?itok=V8wYxhDl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-eighth-anniversary-what-the-fog-spinoff.jpg?itok=9zUj08e_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>sure is getting some spinoffs.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>itself isn't getting neglected, of course. The game is getting a new 2v8 mode (and it will be a mode, rather than a modifier) that will see teams of two killers and eight survivors working together.</p>
<p>Abilities in this mode will be rebalanced around co-operative play, and a class system will be introduced to replace&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s usual Perks. Behaviour says it'll reveal more about this mode later this year.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Behaviour also revealed a brand new crossover:&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>is coming to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</p>
<p>We don't know too much else about this crossover yet, but it'll be interesting to see how it pans out. If Dracula is the killer, surely none of the Belmonts can be survivors? After all, Belmonts don't flee from Dracula.</p>
<p>That's all for today's jam-packed&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>anniversary show, anyway. Stay tuned for more on everything you've heard about here!</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight</a> is turning eight years old, and Montreal-based series creators Behaviour Interactive had certainly a lot to announce <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIwtIGmevQE&amp;ab_channel=DeadbyDaylight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during their big anniversary broadcast</a>. Plenty of new detail was provided about the new Dungeons &amp; Dragons update, although we also learned that a Castlevania chapter is on the way later this year. Players can also look forward to the introduction of a mode with two killers instead of the usual one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are plenty of spinoffs on the way. We got a new trailer for the Supermassive-Games-developed narrative adventure The Casting of Frank Stone, and some information on “Project T,” a new PvE shooter spinoff set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Perhaps most exciting and unexpected, Behaviour shadow dropped What the Fog, a new cartoony Dead by Daylight action platformer.</p>
<p>Before we jump into anything else, let’s check out the cinematic trailer for Dead by Daylight: Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | Dungeons &amp; Dragons | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dcizzog5WBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dead by Daylight: Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ new killer is the lich king Vecna, who brings the following unique abilities to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Fly</strong> grants him flying speed for a short time, letting him pass over obstacles in his path.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Flight of the Damned</strong> conjures flying spectral entities that can pass through obstacles and cause harm to all they hit.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Mage </strong>Hand creates a ghastly, phantasmic hand that can complete tasks such as holding and blocking the use of Pallets.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Dispelling Sphere</strong> creates a moving AOE sphere that reveals Survivors and disables their Magical Items.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the new survivors are a pair of bards, Aestri Yazar and Baermar Uraz (you’ll have the same perks and abilities regardless of who you pick).</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Mirrored Illusion</strong> spawns a static copy of the Survivor in front of a Totem, Chest, Generator or Exit Gate for a limited time</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Bardic Inspiration</strong> inspires others through a stirring performance. Roll a d20 and fellow Survivors get a Skill Check buff depending on the result of the roll.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Still Sight</strong> lets you briefly see the auras of all close by Generators, Totems, and Chests.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>A new dungeon-esque map, the Forgotten Ruins, featuring treasure chests you’ll need to roll a 20-sided die to open, will also be part of the D&amp;D chapter.</p>
<p>Moving on to the 2v8 mode, Behaviour is promising it will take place on larger maps, the replacement of perks with a new class system, and a new cage mechanic instead of hooks. Behaviour is promising to reveal more about the mode in July.</p>
<p>Next up, here’s a first gameplay trailer for The Casting of Frank Stone.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Casting of Frank Stone | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O1xixINNd6I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And here’s an early look at Project T, which is clearly very much a work in progress at this point.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project T | A First Look" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b1_DhOrH4Ds?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And here’s What the Fog, which is available to download… right now! Those with a Behaviour account can get the game for free, although Behaviour is only giving away 2 million copies. If you miss out, the game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139020/What_the_Fog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on Steam for 5 bucks</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="What the Fog - Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZGSG0CihE8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, here’s your first peek at the Dead by Daylight Castlevania chapter. Apparently, more will be revealed on August 6.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dead by Daylight | Castlevania | Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YEfRYKRr8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Phew! That was a lot of stuff! Dead by Daylight can be played on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Switch, and mobile devices. The Dungeons &amp; Dragons will be available on June 3, although it’s available on PC test servers now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24155657/lonely-island-jorma-taccone-knuckles-musical<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="P79yI1">The nonsense was all there on the page — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24140560/knuckles-cast-adam-pally-kid-cudi-interview">Adam Pally</a> in an echidna costume, Julian Barratt rocking out in an owl headdress, an enormous puppet hell demon, a black-box-theater-worthy interpretation of a Sonic stage — but when director Jorma Taccone began orchestrating the hallucinatory musical tucked inside <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24140560/knuckles-cast-adam-pally-kid-cudi-interview"><em>Knuckles</em>’</a> fourth episode, his impulse was to pile on even more. </p>
<p id="ZjmMHX">“Toby [Ascher, the showrunner], right from the jump was like, <em>Look, I was raised on Adult Swim, I want to make this weird and push boundaries and make this as interesting and different and unexpected as possible</em>,” Taccone tells Polygon. “And obviously, that’s up my alley.”</p>
<p id="1nyBY0">The episode, “The Flames of Disaster,” is not just up Taccone’s alley — he built the dang alley. After breaking out with Digital Shorts on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, the Lonely Island member applied his go-hard-or-go-home comedy stylings to feature work like <em>MacGruber</em> and <em>Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping</em>. While, on paper, a spinoff of the Sonic the Hedgehog movies may not have immediately called for his established skill set, his longtime collaborator Brandon Trost, the director of photography on <em>Popstar</em> and <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> who pivoted to directing on <em>Knuckles</em>, convinced Taccone to step in for a one-off. </p>
<p id="tH8jct">Thanks to a lo-fi approach to executing on the musical concept, Taccone could basically do whatever he wanted, and with the resources of a major motion picture crew; <em>Knuckles</em> employed most of the same crew from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23021865/sonic-2-knuckles-director-interview"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em></a>, that would eventually go straight from the series into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131363/keanu-reeves-shadow-the-hedgehod-sonic-3"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em></a>. </p>
<p id="Q4yZr2">“My goal for the episode was honestly to have this be something that you watch and are like, <em>Whoa, what was that?</em> — it’s so packed for 21, 22 minutes,” Taccone says, still sounding as giddy as he was on set. “When I showed it to my wife, her response was, ‘I don’t even know what to say about that.’” </p>

<p id="EODsil">“The Flames of Disaster” picks up the morning after a raucous Shabbat dinner, as bounty hunter Jack Sinclair (Barratt) kidnaps deputy sheriff Wade Whipple (Pally) off the porch of his mom’s house. Knuckles declines to save him — Wade needs to become a true warrior, and this is his shot. Even if he’s being carted across Idaho in an electrified steel cage. As Wade reels from shocks to the brain, the action shifts to his subconsciousness, where Pachacamac (voiced by Christopher Lloyd), the elder of Knuckles’ tribe, appears to him at a bowling alley of the mind to send him on a spiritual journey — of interpretive dance and puppetry.</p>

<p id="SKdOvd">The first thing Taccone did when he received the script for “The Flames of Disaster” was call his brother Asa Taccone, who has played an instrumental role in writing the songs for Lonely Island over the years. Working with another of their go-to collaborators, composer Matthew Compton, the trio wrote a power ballad for Barratt to wail as Pally swayed, kicked, ran, and twirled his way around the bowling alley set. At this point, Taccone can’t even tell if he’s parodying anything with “The Flames of Disaster” — “honestly it feels very Lonely Island to me?” he says, realizing he had created his own musical subgenre — but when the song was wrapped up, it made sense to call in a favor with one of his leading creative inspirations: Michael Bolton. </p>
<p id="n8MVKd">The Lonely Island gave Bolton a late-career resurgence with their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI6CfKcMhjY"><em>SNL</em> video “Jack Sparrow.” </a>Now Taccone can text him when he needs a little of that Bolton magic on a new project.</p>
<p id="aZk7DZ">“It’s been bizarre in my life to say that I can consider Val Kilmer a friend [after <em>MacGruber</em>], and it’s been bizarre to say that Michael Bolton is definitely a dear friend,” Taccone says. “We call him Lord Boltron, which I would really like to spread as much as possible. We really want people at concerts to be yelling out ‘LORD BOLTRON!!’”</p>

<p id="SY8ilh">“The Flames of Disaster” checked two boxes for the <em>Knuckles</em> production: An episode with very little of its main star, a pricey CG creation, and an episode that could lean even further into the lo-fi to contrast with anything the audience would expect from the series. Taccone approached it as a “community theater production,” despite working with many of the most sought after production heads working in Hollywood.</p>
<p id="TwsJXk">When Taccone met the episode’s choreographer — Ellen Kane, whose credits include West End productions and the recent <em>Matilda</em> movie — he remembers her being super game for any wacky idea. He could only be self-deprecating. “I was like, ‘Just know... this <em>is</em> beneath you.’”</p>
<p id="37rHdt">But Taccone sells himself short: The ultimate production is astounding. The director says his personal comedy mantra is “comedy is contrast” and there are examples everywhere. Pally spends most of the episode in a dingy Knuckles costume dancing through Kane’s precision choreography like he’s in <em>Fame</em>. A giant demon erupts from the back halls of the bowling alley only to go on and on about browsing Facebook Marketplace (“My whole thing was: I just want him looking for mountain bikes,” Taccone says.) There are throwaway gags — watch for the puppets phasing in and out of the dream — that the director says he carved out time for just because if anyone caught them for a split second they’d get a laugh. Not every dream came true, like the floating head of Michael Bolton, but he came close. With a seasoned team, he could say “Can I get a flare gun? I want the mailman to shoot a flare gun,” and then he’d have a flare gun. </p>

<p id="DWZeVU">“I am so used to working within the margins of not a lot of time or money, and being able to shoot a lot in that amount of time,” Taccone says. “And while this is way more episode days than I had had on things like <em>MacGruber</em>, we packed it back. I was trying to get a lot of shots per day. So certain parts we almost treated it like a music video. The first thing I did was have them buy me a little Bluetooth speaker so I could even run playback [of the song] just so I could get more takes quickly and read cue things very quickly. So I could do all these lines from Julian really fast, so fast I couldn’t wait for us to even connect to the timecode.” </p>
<p id="Fr4mzu">The absurdity is technical, and for Taccone, the results are transcendent. He is the most surprised that an episode of the <em>Knuckles</em> TV show made him get… a little teary. </p>
<p id="lr28AN">“The moments I’m always proudest of are when it’s both funny and somehow musically moving. A moment where [Wade] rises up and the echidna angels are around him, bringing him up and then the music starts to soar and Bolton’s voice is soaring — you kind of feel something! It’s always my favorite to have it be both funny and insane and, like, <em>I’m kind of inspired!</em>” </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-by-daylight%E2%80%99s-next-killer-is-dungeons-dragons-baddie-vecna.870525/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24155430/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover-vecna<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="PeaPI9"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/dead-by-daylight/39050"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a> is a game absolutely packed with murderous monsters, both original and licensed from other franchises. The next crossover is a little bit outside of the usual horror wheelhouse — <em>Dead by Daylight </em>is producing a chapter themed around the wildly popular tabletop game <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Vecna, known in-game as The Lich, will be the game’s next Killer. Vecna is joined by a pair of Elven bards, one male and one female, who will serve as the new Survivors. </p>
<p id="RBE67h">Behaviour Interactive announced the crossover during the game’s anniversary stream Tuesday, which included sneak peeks of other titles in the same universe and a new 2v8 gameplay mode.</p>
<p id="g6WUOI">Vecna is a powerful mage, with access to an array of spells. He can fly, summon spectral entities, create a mage hand to manipulate items, and dispel magic. While most Killers in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> focus on throwing hatchets or swinging a blade, Vecna uses magical abilities to hunt down Survivors. Luckily, there’s an upside to facing him as an enemy. When Vecna is the Killer, he spawns chests around the map. Opening them starts a dice roll, and if the player is lucky enough, they can obtain some of Vecna’s legendary loot. </p>
<p id="clUNU0">The Eye and Hand of Vecna can be obtained from these chests. The Eye of Vecna grants invisibility to Survivors after they leave a locker, while the Hand of Vecna allows you to teleport between lockers. If you roll a critical failure, Behaviour promises something terrible happens — but we don’t know what quite yet.</p>
<p id="C8XbNo">With the runaway success of<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/10/19/21519763/baldurs-gate-3-review-larian-rpg-dungeons-and-dragons"> <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>, as well as the recent <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23635507/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-sxsw-review-spoiler-free">Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie</a>, it’s interesting to see Dungeons &amp; Dragons expand even further by entering the illustrious cast of the asymmetrical horror game. <em>Stranger Things</em>, a show no stranger to D&amp;D tie-ins, based its season four antagonist on Vecna, and they even share the same name — so maybe he’ll form a special bond with <em>Stranger Things’ </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/19/20812070/stranger-things-dead-by-daylight-nancy-wheeler-steve-harrington-demogorgon-chapter"><em>Dead by Daylight</em> Kille</a>r, the Demogorgon, who was similarly named after a D&amp;D monster.</p>
<p id="xNGmdh">Behaviour also teased the next licensed chapter, which will be a cross-over with the Castlevania franchise. We don’t know who the Killer or Survivor will be for that, but we can expect details later this summer. The stream also shared that a third licensed chapter will arrive before the end of <em>Dead by Daylight</em>’s next anniversary.</p>
<p id="KaP1B8">For fans who prefer the original aspects of <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, Behaviour shared a look at some other games in the same universe. <em>The Casting of Frank Stone</em> is a branching narrative game from <em>Until Dawn </em>developer Supermassive, similar to <em>The Quarry</em> or the Dark Pictures Anthology. A two-player co-op title called <em>What the Fog</em> is also briefly available for free with the registration of a Behaviour account, and it looks like a much cuter and absurd take on the Entity’s Realm.</p>
<p id="5lsb9C">The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> DLC is coming to the test realm today, and the chapter will release on live servers on June 3.</p>

Walk a few steps forward and she’ll blink out of existence. </p><h2 id="h13319"><a id="bug"></a>Hey, I didn’t see her ghost.

Unfortunately, the flashback scene takes place very early in the game, so you’d likely need to go back and play it all over again if you accidentally disabled the ghost scene.Which, hey, replaying <em>FF7</em> is hardly a bad thing anyway.</p><h2 id="h13320"><a id="truth"></a>Is that <em>really</em> Aerith’s ghost?</h2><p>There’s a spooky subtlety in the Aerith’s ghost “scene.” One of the kids you’ll find upon re-entering the church and seeing Aerith’s ghost will say “Hey, where’s the flower lady” if you chat with them.

Firstly, you can see an option titled “After Aerith’s death” in the game’s dubugging program for activating this ghost scene. Secondly, there’s a bit of scrapped dialogue from an NPC that was removed from the game who, upon talking too after re-entering Midgar, says that they saw a woman disappear and that the church is haunted. To me, that’s an indication that Square Enix was at least thinking about the idea of the church being haunted and people seeing apparitions there.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions-review-worth-playing-1851469341&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions-review-worth-playing-1851469341"><em>Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Retro Review</a></span></p><p>That said, as some have found out, there is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/0vViHqNrd6E&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/0vViHqNrd6E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unused Aerith dialogue</a></span> found in the game’s files that would play <em>after</em> her death, indicating that previous versions of the story might’ve involved Aerith living in some way after the events in the City of the Ancients.</p><p>But whether it’s an intentional spooky and sad moment, or the result of some leftover code running amok, I happen to enjoy the idea of briefly seeing Aerith’s spirit for a brief moment.

<p>A new gameplay trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1xixINNd6I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been released</a> for The Casting of Frank Stone, the new game from by Supermassive Games. The trailer gives a look into what players should expect in the new game set in the Dead by Daylight universe.</p>



<p>“In the summer of 1980, four friends set out to make their mark on horror cinema,” the trailer’s description reads. “What they capture will trigger the unthinkable. Decide their fate, develop their relationships, and guide their shoot of Murder Mill, a soon-to-be cult classic with an insidious influence… ”</p>



<p>It continues: “In The Casting of Frank Stone, a dark branching narrative lies before you. Your decisions pen the script – the only thing standing between life and death for a group of young filmmakers. Change reality with your choices, unlock new paths with your actions, and discover what horrors your final cut may hold. ”</p>

Players were treated to a small glimpse of what they can expect when the long-running gaming franchise swoops in to sink its teeth into <em>Dead by Daylight</em> later this year.</p></blockquote><p>And here are more details on the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Chapter:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Welcome weary travelers. A new Chapter in our tale is about to begin. One filled with pain and power. Fantasy and fear. One driven by the darkest magic and told in song around flickering campfires. <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> has come to <em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</p><p>Fifty years ago, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> first inspired mere mortals to enter its world and campaign to become legends. In celebration of this milestone, the franchise is expanding its horizons with a rare plunge into horror, infusing dark fantasy into the <em>Dead by Daylight</em> universe with a new Killer, Survivor, Map, and <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-inspired gameplay elements.</p><p>Our story unfolds in the crumbling Forgotten Ruins, where the power-hungry villain, The Lich—Vecna, will stop at nothing to achieve his gruesome ambitions. Aestri Yazar, a Bard, has found herself cast into this forsaken land. She must survive at all costs—for who else will be able to tell the tale should she perish?</p><p>Will you seek to impose your deadly will, or face the darkness and survive with your party of 4? Ambitious adventurers can get their start early with a limited-time public test build on Steam. Just remember—the difference between life and death is sometimes just a roll of a die.</p><p><strong>An Eternal Tyrant</strong></p><p>The Whispered One. Lord of the Rotted Tower. The Master of Secrets. Few dare speak his true name. Vecna’s thirst for dark knowledge led him to many strange realms, but a clue found by a servant ignited a new obsession. It spoke of an unknown land. A realm of fog, home to an incredible dark energy.</p><p>Driven to harness this power, Vecna spent endless nights fixated on how he might wield it. When he finally found a way in – when The Fog came – excitement washed over him. He’d conquered and ruled countless Realms before, why would this be any different?</p><p>Vecna knows no fear, for he carries the Book of Vile Darkness. With it and within the Entity’s Realm, he can cast four spells:</p><ul><li>Fly grants him flying speed for a short time, letting him pass over obstacles in his path.</li><li>Flight of the Damned conjures flying spectral entities that pass-through obstacles and cause harm to all they hit.</li><li>Mage Hand creates a ghastly, phantasmic hand that completes tasks such as holding and blocking the use of Pallets.</li><li>Dispelling Sphere creates a moving AOE sphere that reveals Survivors and disables their Magical Items.</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_882435"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Bardic Inspirations</strong></p><p>What would the world be without darkness to contrast the light? What would one sing about if not for the delicate balance between good and evil? Players will be able to choose between Aestri Yazar, an Elf, and Baermar Uraz, a Human, to form The Troupe and lead them on their final adventure.</p><p>As the forces of evil began to mysteriously vanish from the land, the Bards needed to find out why. Their arduous journey led them to the Rotted Tower. Mustering up the bravery for a chance encounter with the Arch-Lich, Vecna, they were instead met with a Black Fog.</p><p>Whether you choose the role of Aestri or Baermar, they enter the fray with three unique Perks:</p><ul><li>Mirrored Illusion spawns a static copy of the Survivor in front of a Totem, Chest, Generator or Exit Gate for a limited time</li><li>Bardic Inspiration inspires others through a stirring performance. Roll a d20 and fellow Survivors get a Skill Check buff depending on the result of the roll.</li><li>When not in motion, Still Sight lets you briefly see the auras of all close by Generators, Totems, and Chests.</li></ul><p><strong>Enter the Dungeon</strong></p><p>The setting for this journey lies in the Forgotten Ruins, a thrilling new Map. It is here that Vecna has made his domain while he researches the mysteries of the Realm. Be brave, traveler, beneath the ruins of a ruined tower lies an underground lair of terrible experiments and horrifying secrets.</p><p><strong>A Roll of the Dice</strong></p><p>New tools are available to fight this evil. When facing off against Vecna, seven Chests are scattered across the Map. Seek out their loot and gain untold powers.</p><p>To open a Chest, the adventurer must roll a d20. Should you roll a 2 or a 3, you’ll find a regular <em>Dead by Daylight</em> item. Rolling a 4 to 19, however, unlocks a Magical Item—either Gauntlets or Boots, that are equipped automatically. Each Magical Item gives the wearer an ability designed to counter one of Vecna’s spells.</p><p>Rolling a 20, a critical success, grants a powerful Magical Item that can be used like a Perk.</p><ul><li>The Eye of Vecna allows the user to vanish for a brief period after exiting a Locker.</li><li>The Hand of Vecna allows the user to teleport from one Locker to another.</li></ul><p>They may be powerful, but power comes at a cost. Each time they are called upon, the user loses a Health State, so choose your moment wisely.</p><p>As for the unlucky adventurers who roll a 1, a critical fail, they have a nasty surprise waiting for them.</p></blockquote><p><em>Dead by Daylight</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [6,995 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,295 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [26,676 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,145 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,315 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,062 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/dead-by-daylight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/dead-by-daylight-windows/9nms4sfnbgbh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Store</a>.</p><p>View a new set of screenshots <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/dead-by-daylight/may-14-2024/">at the gallery</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut is officially slashing its way onto PC this month, and for anyone looking to experience the open-world samurai game on Steam Deck, there's <em>mostly </em>good news. Sony's PC porting studio Nixxes has confirmed that Ghost of Tsushima will be playable on Steam Deck--and "similar" handheld gaming PCs--but only for the single-player campaign and its Iki Island expansion.</p><p>The Ghost of Tsushima: Legends co-op multiplayer mode won't be playable on that system due to it requiring Windows to access PlayStation Network integrated features. This has led to a strange situation where the game has been listed as "Unsupported" for Steam Deck.</p>

<p>Nixxes didn't clarify if the multiplayer mode would function on Steam Deck competitors like the ROG Ally or MSI Claw, which run on a Windows 11 operating system. Nixxes added that it has "worked extensively to optimize performance and deliver the best possible experience" on these devices and it explained how Legends will include cross-play between players on PS5, PS4, and PC.</p><p>"Legends will be functional on PC at launch, but you won't be automatically matched with players on different platforms," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215430/view/4188987871078331985" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nixxes wrote in a Steam blog</a>. "Cross-play will launch in beta, meaning you can try it out by inviting your PlayStation Network friends."</p><p>Launch times have also been finalized for Ghost of Tsushima's May 16 release, and depending on where you are in the world, you can expect the game to unlock at the following times this week:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302888-got-launch-times.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302888" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302888-got-launch-times.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302888"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut PC launch times</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302888-got-launch-times.jpg"></figure><ul><li>8 AM PT</li><li>11 AM ET</li><li>4 PM BST</li><li>5 PM CET</li><li>1 AM AEST (May 17)</li></ul><p>Ghost of Tsushima will be the first PlayStation Studios title on PC <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-overlay-lets-you-earn-trophies-in-pc-games/1100-6522723/" data-ref-id="1100-6522723">to make use of the new PlayStation overlay function</a>, an interface designed to add more PlayStation elements to that platform.

                <p dir="ltr">After teasing the announcement on social media late last week, Behavior Interactive released full details on the next crossover event coming to Dead By Daylight--Dungeons And Dragons, which will introduce a new Killer, two new Survivors, a new map, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">The Dead By Daylight: Dungeons And Dragons event will introduce Vecna, the Lord Of The Rotted Tower, to the game as a Killer character. He wields the Book of Vile Darkness, which allows him to cast four spells in pursuit of survivors:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Fly</strong>, which lets him fly over obstacles for a short time</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Flight Of The Damned</strong>, which summons ghost-like creatures that can pass through obstacles and damage anyone they make contact with</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mage Hand</strong>, which creates a magic floating hand that completes tasks for Vecna</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Dispelling Sphere</strong>, which sends a moving energy sphere across the map that can reveal Survivors and disable certain items</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4302741-dbddnd.png" data-ref-id="1300-4302741" data-ratio="0.56410256410256" data-width="936" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4302741-dbddnd.png" data-ref-id="1300-4302741"></a><figcaption>Vecna in Dead By Daylight: Dungeons And Dragons</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4302741-dbddnd.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The event will also add a pair of Survivors to the mix, both of whom are bards--the elf Aestri Yazar and the human Baermar Uraz. Each bard possesses the same perks when selected:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mirrored Illusion</strong>, which creates a decoy version of the character in front of specific points on the map</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Bardic Inspiration</strong>, which gives each Survivor certain perks based on a d20 roll</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Still Sight</strong>, which reveals the locations of Totems, Generators, and Chests by standing still for a short time</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Finally, a new map based on Dungeons and Dragons' Forgotten Ruins will be added via the update. The map features multiple chests with contents depending on the roll of a d20; those contents are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>1 (Critical Fail)</strong>: A "nasty surprise"</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>2-3:</strong> Normal item</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>4-19:</strong> Magical items which automatically equips and can be used to repel Vecna's attacks</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>20 (Critical Success)</strong>: One of two magical items that acts like perks  <ul><li dir="ltr">The Eye Of Vecna: User can disappear for a short time after exiting a locker</li><li dir="ltr">The Hand Of Vecna: User can teleport from one locker to another</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">The D&amp;D event wasn't the only collaboration mentioned during the livestream, however, as the event ended with a brief teaser for a Castlevania-themed event. The event is scheduled for "later this year," with more information coming August 6.</p><p dir="ltr">Dead By Daylight is available now for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Other features coming to the game for its eighth anniversary include a 2v8 mode and a new standalone co-op roguelite game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/lofi-girl-in-fortnite-new-exploration-map/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=lofi-girl-in-fortnite-new-exploration-map<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Anytime I log into&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rarest-fortnite-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a></em>, I always end up in a jaw-clenching, competitive mood, especially when the triumphant of Victory Royale is in my grasp. But, in a surprising turn of events, my recent session offered a moment of peace and relaxation, thanks to the new <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/@lofigirl/6437-7858-4061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lofi Girl <em>Fortnite</em></a> exploration map.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Embarking on this map, you’ll be immediately enveloped in the comforting embrace of Lofi beats. It’ll take you on an object-finding mission to search for musical and secret notes. For those who’ve long been captivated by Lofi Girl, the setting will feel familiar, as it’s the very spot of her iconic room.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">But here’s the twist — you won’t be seeing it from&nbsp;a regular perspective. Instead, you’ll be shrunk down to a miniature size, offering a whimsical and fun twist to the gameplay. It’s a concept reminiscent of beloved&nbsp;films like&nbsp;<em>Toy Story&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Small Soldiers.</em><br></p>

Getting from one end of the room to the other almost felt like a journey to Mordor. But still, there’s no rushing around on this&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>&nbsp;map, so I can’t complain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">Equipped with a Grapple, Wardrobe Selector, and Radio Selector, you’ll navigate through a variety of sounds, mirroring the diverse music on Lofi Girl’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LofiGirl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel</a>. From synthwaves to dark ambient moods, the map offers an immersive audio experience, complete with ambient sounds that mimic rain, white noise, and forest vibes.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">There are a bunch of tiny details scattered around the room to pay more homage to Lofi Girl. One of the most prominent ones is the display on the computer, depicting Lofi Girl in her element on her YouTube page. Her headphones, including Lofi Boy’s, are also available for character customization.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-use-the-creative-mode-code-to-access-the-lofi-girl-fortnite-map" data-injectable="false">Use the Creative Mode code to access the Lofi Girl <em>Fortnite</em> map</h2> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">While <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-2024-collab-wishlist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the collaboration</a> between Lofi Girl and&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>&nbsp;may seem like an unexpected pairing, it’s not entirely surprising. Epic Games has a history of unique collaborations, such as the Rocket League&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rocket-league-teams-up-with-the-lofi-girl-for-this-years-frosty-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frosty Fest event</a>. Now,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>&nbsp;players can further indulge in their love for Lofi Girl by using the ‘6437-7858-4061’ to access her<em>&nbsp;</em>map.</p> <figure data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false">Now, all that’s left is for Lofi Girl to get a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>skin (could also throw Lofi Boy in there). Maybe then Battle Royale can be much more chill, rather than the bustling competition it is today.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="198" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">For fans of Brandon Sanderson’s <em>The Stormlight Archive</em>, the fifth book in the series—<em>Wind and Truth</em>—marks an important place in the saga, serving as the conclusion to its first story arc. </p> <p data-characters="216" data-current-count="216" data-injectable="false">So, be you a long-time reader or have only recently been getting into the series, here’s a run down of <em>Wind and Truth</em>‘s release date, how you can pre-order it, and how you can read an early glimpse of it.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-the-release-date-for-wind-and-truth" data-injectable="false">What is the release date for <em>Wind and Truth</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true"><em>Wind and Truth</em> is scheduled to <strong>release on Friday, December 6</strong>, just in time for Christmas in case you know any Brandon Sanderson fans. You’ll want to make sure they haven’t bought it already, and have at least read the previous books. As the fifth and final entry in a story arc that began in 2010, <em>Wind and Truth</em> probably isn’t the best jumping on point for Sanderson’s epic fantasy series.</p>
 <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true">This also isn’t the end of <em>The Stormlight Archives</em> as a whole. Sanderson has said in the past he envisions the series as consisting of 10 books. So, while <em>Wind and Truth</em> is an ending per se, it only marks the halfway point of the wider saga. After <em>Wind and Truth</em>, there will be a sequel series comprised of another five books; one set after a big time skip according to<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5t9nyy/comment/dgvwl8j/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> a 2017 Reddit AMA</a> Sanderson hosted.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-tsushima-is-unsupported-on-steam-deck-due-to-psn.870489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-steam-deck-unsupported<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s multiplayer mode won't be playable on Steam Deck, Sony and porting studio Nixxes have announced, and the reason once again involves PSN.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/04/17/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-cross-play-and-system-requirements-revealed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">p</a><a href="https://twitter.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1790396884873355624" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ost on X</a> outlining the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-system-requirements">impending PC release</a>, Nixxes says that&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s single-player mode, including its&nbsp;<em>Iki Island&nbsp;</em>expansion, will be fully playable on Steam Deck thanks to extensive optimization efforts.</p>
<p>However, the game will technically sport an "Unsupported" rating on Steam Deck. That's the rating Valve assigns to games for which "some or all" of their functionality doesn't work on Steam Deck, and in&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s case, it's the multiplayer component.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-steam-deck-psn-jin-snow.jpg?itok=02rP6qA2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-steam-deck-psn-jin-snow.jpg?itok=eXoBAy5L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s single-player is fully playable on Steam Deck, but its multiplayer is not.</figcaption></figure><p>Nixxes says that because&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s multiplayer requires Windows "to access PlayStation Network integrated features", you won't be able to play the game on Steam Deck, which runs a custom Linux shell.</p>
<p>This represents another stumbling block for&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>on PC when it comes to PSN integration. Last week, owing to its requirement for a PSN ID in order to access multiplayer, the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-no-longer-available-on-steam-in-almost-180-countries-due-to-psn-requirement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removed from Steam in many countries in which PSN is not available</a>.</p>
<p>A PSN account isn't required to play the single-player game, though, which is why you'll be able to enjoy it on your Steam Deck without any restrictions.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Sony has slipped up with regards to PSN account requirements.</p>
<p>Although Sony recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">walked back</a> a decision to require&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>players to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">link a PSN ID with their Steam account</a> to keep playing on PC, that game was also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-delisted-for-over-100-countries-on-steam">delisted in many non-PSN countries</a>, and at time of writing, it hasn't been restored.</p>
<h2><em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>global PC launch timings revealed</h2>
<p>It's not all doom and gloom for&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>PC players, though. Along with the warning about Steam Deck compatibility, Nixxes also revealed the&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>global launch timings on PC.</p>
<p>Most areas of the world will get to play the game on May 16th, but if you're in Sydney, Auckland, or Tokyo, you'll have to wait until the following day due to time zone shenanigans.</p>

</ul><p>As ever, if you don't live in one of these cities, pick the time zone closest to you and you'll be able to get a good idea of when the game will launch in your region.</p>

The series will be produced in collaboration between Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios, with Phoebe Waller-Bridge serving as the show’s writer and executive producer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/27/23574923/amazon-tomb-raider-tv-series-phoebe-waller-bridge">confirming rumors reported earlier last year</a>.</p><p>The <em>Tomb Raider</em> series is no stranger to live-action adaptations. In the 2000s, Angelina Jolie starred as the badass grave robber in<em> Lara Croft: Tomb Raider </em>and its sequel, <em>The Cradle of Life</em>. At the time, both movies were financial if not critical successes but are viewed more favorably today, especially when compared to contemporaries like <em>Doom</em>, <em>Silent Hill</em>, and <em>Max Payne</em>. In 2018, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/7/12122532/tomb-raider-movie-reboot-alicia-vikander-lara-croft-march-2018">a reboot of the <em>Tomb Raider</em> movie franchise</a> was produced to follow up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9695274/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review">the reboot of the game series</a>, this time with <em>Ex Machina</em> star Alicia Vikander in the lead.</p><p>With the <em>Fallout</em> show hitting over 65 million viewers, Amazon has proven it can make a pretty good video game adaptation. Plus, the streamer is no stranger to successful adaptations of other mediums with <em>The Boys</em>, <em>Gen V</em>, and <em>Invincible</em>,<em> </em>so a <em>Tomb Raider</em> series seems like it could be a good fit. Phoebe Waller-Bridge, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/27/21031773/phoebe-waller-bridge-2019-fleabag-killing-eve-james-bond-amazon-prime-video-emmys">notable for her work on <em>Fleabag</em> and <em>Killing Eve</em></a>, also seems to be a fan of the series, sharing in Amazon’s press release, “Lara Croft means a lot to me, as she does to many, and I can’t wait to go on this adventure. Bats ‘n all.” I’m not sure if bats were a pain in the ass in the reboots as they were in the original trilogy, but at least, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24072931/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered-game-review">as an original trilogy fan myself</a>, I feel like the series is in capable hands. She also has hands-on tomb-raiding experience, so to speak, starring alongside Harrison Ford in the latest <em>Indiana Jones </em>movie.</p><div><p>The streamer is producing this new show in tandem with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/15/23510923/amazon-tomb-raider-game-crystal-dynamics">Amazon Games publishing the next entry in the <em>Tomb Raider</em> game series</a>. This also means that if the <em>Tomb Raider</em> series turns out to be good, fans likely won’t have to wait too long for a new game like all the poor players <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-steam-pc-new-vegas-1851410034">jonesing for a new <em>Fallout</em> entry</a>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-megalopolis-trailer-might-be-the-coolest-thing-i%E2%80%99ve-ever-seen.870483/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24156434/megalopolis-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="N72y4i"><em>Megalopoli</em>s<em>, </em>legendary director Francis Ford Coppola’s first film in 14 years, is one of 2024’s most notable movies for two reasons. First, it is the decades-in-development self-funded passion project of a cinematic titan, and second, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/megalopolis-francis-ford-coppola-challenges-distribution-1235867556/">no one wants to distribute it</a>. On paper, that’s plenty baffling, but it only becomes more so when you see what the film looks like. </p>
<p id="38TxhT">An urban fantasy about an idealist who seeks to rebuild a New York City-like metropolis into a utopia following a disaster, the trailer is mostly a montage of dreams and decadence. Statues walk, chariots race in Madison Square Garden, and Adam Driver ruminates on the nature of utopias. </p>
<p id="HLLByi">At just a minute and a half, the trailer is awe-inspiring (even on a phone screen), with little context for the narrative. It’s the platonic ideal of movie marketing: Win, lose or draw, the trailer sells <em>Megalopolis</em> as something that <em>must</em> be seen, preferably in a theater. Let’s hope that after the film premieres at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, we get the chance to see it, and very soon at that. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24156462/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Fwd752">After making fans wage war by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24107923/house-dragon-game-thrones-trailer-red-black-team">picking which of two trailers to watch on YouTube</a><em>, </em>HBO is back with a new trailer for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419614/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-release-date-cast-news"><em>House of the Dragon </em>season 2</a> that promises things will go quite badly no matter who your fave is. That’s the Westeros Promise, baby!</p>
<p id="LSmqLU">While the first season skipped through time, season 2 looks like it’s settling in for the long haul. The new episodes seem to depict the immediate fallout from last season, when <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23368925/house-dragon-kids-who-rhaenyra-alicent-daemon-jace-joffrey-aegon">Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney)</a> was installed as king in a coup over Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D’Arcy), kicking off the Targaryen Civil War, aka <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23415231/house-dragon-green-blacks-dance-dragons-explained">the Dance of the Dragons</a>.</p>
<p id="6uVt9n">The new trailer shows off both sides of the Worst Family Ever amassing supporters and dragons, promising tons of sexy intrigue and backstabbing in addition to big, brutal battles atop horse and dragon. Frankly, it looks pretty spectacular, and even if the we know where this story ends, getting there seems like it’s gonna be a hell of a ride. </p>
<p id="og0jsW"><em>House of the Dragon </em>season 2 premieres on HBO and Max on June 16.</p>

The sale is likely one of a few leading up to the closure of the Xbox 360 store in a few months. Until then, folks can pick up a number of 360 titles that will otherwise be disappearing at the end of July for dirt cheap.</p><p>For example, <em>Cloudberry Kingdom</em>, a Ubisoft-published title I haven’t heard about in <em>so</em> goddamn long, was delisted from Steam back in 2020 but is still available on the 360 digital store and on sale right now. The game was once available on Steam, Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii U, but over the years, it’s either been delisted or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-wii-u-3ds-classic-games-mario-zelda-eshop-shop-1848544931&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-wii-u-3ds-classic-games-mario-zelda-eshop-shop-1848544931">those stores have completely shut down</a></span>. The Xbox 360 store is one of the last places you can buy it before it becomes lost media. Come July, that and a few other titles, like <em>Puzzle Arcade</em>, will be gone, so if you’re a preservationist, or just someone a little bit nostalgic for the early days of digital-only console games, you may want to give it a look.</p><p>Other games, like the Xbox 360 versions of 2014’s <em>Thief, Trials Fusion, </em>and <em>Far Cry 4</em>, will also be unavailable digitally once the store closes, but these are also titles you can find in print, on other systems like PC, or on modern console storefronts thanks to backward compatibility between the last few generations.</p><p>Some of the games listed vary between regions, but for the most part, there are over 60 games that you rarely see on sale that are heavily discounted right now. If you’ve got an Xbox 360, or think you might want to hold onto some of these titles, I’d urge you to get on it right now.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-players-filed-27-million-reports-in-six-months-%E2%80%93-but-only-10-were-legit.870471/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-players-reports/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In the latest <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/45/df/45dff59c-7b36-44df-9e64-e673dae355c1.pdf?n=293843.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Transparency Report</a>, Microsoft revealed a whole host of information related to the moderation, user protection, and enforcement ecosystems it promotes across its gaming platforms. In a staggering figure, it was shown that more than 27.4 <strong>million </strong>reports were filed by Xbox players in the space of six months in H2 2023.</p>



<p>It was revealed that a whopping 12.7 million reports were filed regarding in-game or on-platform communications and that in the six months, more than 10.3 million enforcements were issued – but only 2.1 million of those came from player reports, which is fewer than 10% overall. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-issue">What’s The Issue?</h2>



<p>Either 25 million reports were filed in error (or maliciously) or Microsoft’s moderation system is a little more lenient than we’ve been led to believe.</p>



<p>If 27.4 million reports were filed but only 2.1 million reports ended up leading to enforcement, there’s a stark imbalance somewhere in the system. However, Microsoft was quick to confirm that proactive enforcement is much more prevalent, with the tech titan using automated systems to detect cheaters and malicious operators on its platforms. That’s primarily why H2 of 2023 saw a whopping 79% of all enforcement action come off the back of proactive measures.</p>



<p>Amazingly, it was revealed that Microsoft secured a proactive enforcement rate of 100% (or close enough to that figure) for account tampering, piracy, cheating, fraud, and phishing, slamming down on these topics long before they were reported by players. </p>



<p>Out of the millions of enforcements across the board, it was confirmed that around 693,000 were issued due to harassment or bullying, and another 551,000 were due to adult sexual content. At the other end of the spectrum, 7.32 million enforcements were issued due to cheating or inauthentic accounts. </p>



<p>In the closing slides, Microsoft claimed that it’s increasing more toxicity on its platforms over time, and that includes text-based, image-based, and video-based communications. That’s not always a good thing, though – an Xbox user recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-user-baldurs-gate-ban/">got a one-year ban</a> for sharing a captured game clip featuring a sex scene in Baldur’s Gate 3.</p>
