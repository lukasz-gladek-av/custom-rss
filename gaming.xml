<p>"If I had a sister, I'd sell her in a second"</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section><section>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim">Skyrim</a>. Listen, mate. We need to talk.</p>
<p>Back when I reviewed Skyrim's 2022 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_anniversary_edition">Anniversary Edition</a> update on Switch, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">I gave it a 7/10</a> and summarised that, whilst it was amusing that Todd Howard was still signing off on versions of this game, there were enhancements enough, through some new quests and the addition of Creation Club mods (and fishing), that fans would get their money's worth, whilst newcomers were treated to a solid, stutter-free version of an epic RPG. Nice.</p>
<p>With a game this long in the tooth, albeit one folk seem to be unable to stop buying and playing (myself included, although I like to think I'm doing it ironically), I reckon a 'Good' score and a slap on the back for the effort would have been a healthy place to leave the relationship. But no. Oh no. Todd. He back.</p>
<p>You may have already clocked the score at the bottom, so let's get to why I've come down so harsh this time. It's chiefly because Bethesda's taken a game that on Switch, whilst relatively restrained in comparison to some of its fancier ports, got the job done smoothly and competently. Yes, it was 30fps, but it felt nice.</p>
<p>With this Switch 2 upgrade, they've decided to smash a bunch of volumetric effects and graphical enhancements into the situation, as well as upping the resolution. Admittedly, I'm no Digital Foundry boffin, but DLSS is being employed and the resolution has improved. But then why no 40fps, at the very least? Honestly, my friends, Bethesda's crapped out a terrible version of a game they've released hundreds of times already, and I do believe they've done it for Christmas.</p>

<p>I can't think of any other reason to release their precious in this state other than a big rush to make the holiday shelves. The moment you boot into this Switch 2 port, once you've ridden the wave of excitement that is two-second-faster loading times and a slightly better draw distance, you're immediately presented with a game that's not as good at all to play. Quickly, how do I delete and go back to my old version? Well, you'll need to delete this one entirely and redownload the older one, because they haven't even done that bit well.</p>
<p>It still runs at 30fps *gulp*, but now there's also genuinely awful input lag to boot. I'm talking about online-fighting-on-a-Switch-Lite bad at times. Why have they released it like this? Oh, and it's a massive 53GB download as well. That's 40+GBs to make something slightly prettier but ultimately worse, folks.</p>
<p>I've no doubt it'll get fixed up eventually. They may even make it 60fps down the road, and it'll be a lovely version then, especially given that mouse controls are in there now and working just fine. But we're talking about Skyrim here, a game from 2011, not <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition]]></content:encoded>

<figcaption><em>Call of Duty </em>won't be releasing back-to-back <em>Black Ops </em>or <em>Modern Warfare </em>games again.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To clarify, this doesn't seem to mean you won't get a <em>Modern Warfare </em>game one year and then a <em>Black Ops </em>game the next; rather, it looks like it means successive years won't see the same sub-franchise launching, so there won't be two <em>Black Ops </em>or <em>Modern Warfare </em>games in a row.</p><p>Activision also says that in the future, it intends to "drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental" when it comes to <em>Call of Duty</em>, and that while it has no more information to share about what that might mean right now, it will share more "when the time is right".</p><p>If you've yet to try <em>Black Ops 7</em> (and <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1990519018537812406" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">sales data suggests</a> you're far from alone if you haven't played it yet), Activision is holding a free weekend for the shooter next week, so you can jump in and try its multiplayer and Zombies game modes for free.</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>launched back in mid-November, and despite its predecessor apparently enjoying the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0e8aa163-0fd6-4fc9-a2e0-23799b12215b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">franchise's biggest ever launch</a>, it looks like the game <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/november-2025s-top-new-steam-games" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">hasn't exactly been a smash hit</a> for Activision.</p><p>Indeed, it looks as though EA's <em>Battlefield 6 </em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-sales-7m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f54e66c-a1d7-49c6-a458-a64a557a9323" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">significantly outperformed</a> its rival, at least in terms of initial sales, which is probably why Activision is scrambling to figure out what's gone wrong.</p><p>Whether or not this results in any real change in terms of what's next for <em>Call of Duty </em>remains to be seen, but there's clearly still enough faith in the franchise at Activision HQ to move ahead with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-movie" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5bcbe900-0a2b-4995-b155-09cc3df0eb7f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Paramount-led movie adaptation</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-12-in-1-docking-station-returns-at-black-friday-pricing-after-selling-out-doubles-as-a-monitor-stand-2000651854</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re well into December now. If you still haven’t secured all your gifts for the holidays, the clock’s a-tickin’. Though, you’re not out of luck just yet. We’re well past the big deals days of the season like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but some deals are still holding strong so you can save big.</p>
<p>Take a moment to check out this Anker USB-C docking station, a device that does far more than simply expand the number of ports available on your computer. Anker designed it to function as both a powerful connectivity hub and a practical monitor stand, giving you two essential workspace upgrades in a single piece of equipment.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4158/"> At the moment, Amazon is still offering a notable 32% discount, dropping the usual $250 price tag down to about $170</a> — a savings of roughly $80 for anyone looking to upgrade their desk setup without overspending.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4158/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="543" data-end="1179">This model is a 12-in-1 docking station intended to transform a cluttered, cable-ridden desk into a space that feels polished, intentional, and comfortable to work at for long stretches. Its shelf-style construction is sturdy enough to support your external monitor, raising it just high enough to improve your viewing angle while simultaneously freeing up valuable desk real estate. Beneath the stand, there’s plenty of room to slide your keyboard out of the way when it’s not needed—ideal for keeping things tidy when stepping away from your desk or when you want extra space for meals or note-taking.</p>
<p data-start="1181" data-end="1512">Even a slight elevation of your monitor can have real benefits for your posture. By bringing the screen closer to eye level, the stand reduces the temptation to lean forward or slouch, encouraging a more ergonomic sitting position. This can help lessen neck and shoulder tension, especially for those who spend hours at a computer.</p>


<h2>Charge Everything at Once</h2>
<p data-start="1514" data-end="2163">Along the right side of the unit, Anker incorporated an array of ports and connectors that should satisfy anyone who regularly juggles multiple accessories. The Anker 675 includes a 100W-max USB-C upstream port for powering and linking your laptop, three USB-A ports, two additional USB-C ports, a full-size SD card slot, a MicroSD slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, an ethernet port for wired internet, and an HDMI output capable of supporting 4K resolution at 60Hz. Whether you need to transfer files, plug in peripherals, or connect an external display, the station provides instinctive access to almost every type of connection you might need.</p>
<p data-start="2165" data-end="2522">On the top surface, you’ll find a built-in wireless charging pad. This allows you to place your smartphone on the dock and have it recharge while you work, eliminating the need to keep an extra charging cable on your desk. The USB-A and USB-C ports each support data transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps, which is especially handy for moving large files quickly.</p>
<p data-start="2524" data-end="3047" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Underneath the stand is a spacious cable-management compartment designed to hide excess cords and keep your workspace looking clean and intentional. The entire structure is built from durable aircraft-grade aluminum, giving it a premium feel and solid longevity. Anti-slip silicone pads on the feet prevent shifting or wobbling. With dimensions of 21.26 inches by 8.66 inches by 3.54 inches, the station is broad enough to accommodate most monitors currently on the market while still fitting comfortably on standard desks.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-q7-m5-hits-new-record-low-amazon-goes-zero-profit-play-for-christmas-clearance-2000652112</link>

              <p>Roborock earned its reputation as the premium standard in robot vacuums, essentially <strong>becoming the “Dyson” of automated floor cleaning</strong> with advanced engineering. The company’s newest flagship models command prices between $1,000 and $2,000 and target buyers who want the absolute best regardless of cost.</p>
<p>However, Roborock still produces more affordable models that deliver excellent cleaning performance without the premium price tag, and the Q7 M5+ represents this value-focused approach perfectly: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/">Amazon has dropped this model to a record low of $219, down from its usual $359</a>, which makes premium automated cleaning accessible at a price that competes with basic robot vacuums offering far fewer features.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Suction</h2>
<p>The <strong>10,000Pa HyperForce suction</strong> is strong enough to pull dirt out of carpet fibers and pick up pet hair that other vacuums leave behind: This vacuum has a lot of suction power, similar to what you would get from many upright vacuums which means that the robot doesn’t just move dirt around but it actually lifts it up and takes it away. The robot makes several passes over high-traffic areas and pulls dirt from deep within the pile where it builds up over time. This strong suction is especially good for carpets.</p>



<p>The dual anti-tangle system solves the most annoying problem with robot vacuums: hair getting stuck in the brushes and needing to be removed by hand. The main brush on the <em>JawScraper</em> actively cuts and channels hair into the dustbin instead of letting it wind around the roller. The <strong>side brush has a zero-tangle structure</strong> that works even in homes with long-haired pets or family members. This design lets you use the vacuum every day without having to flip it over and cut away matted hair every few days.</p>
<p>The<strong> RockDock Plus station lets the robot empty itself, so it can run for 7 to 9 weeks</strong> without needing any help: The 2.7-liter dust bag collects dirt from dozens of cleaning cycles and after each cleaning session, the robot automatically goes back to the dock to empty its dustbin. Then it goes back out to finish its scheduled tasks. You can almost forget about the vacuum for almost two months because of this longer maintenance period.</p>



<p><em>PreciSense</em> LiDAR navigation makes <strong>detailed maps of your home by bouncing laser beams off of walls</strong> and furniture to measure distances with millimeter accuracy. The robot uses these maps to figure out the best ways to clean that cover every area that can be reached without going over the same spot more than once which lets it finish jobs faster than robots that just bump around. With multi-floor mapping, the vacuum can learn the layout of each level in your home and automatically load the right map for the floor it’s on. You can set up no-go zones around pet bowls, fragile furniture, or places where cables might get caught in the brushes. This will keep the robot from getting into trouble without having to use physical barrier tape.</p>
<p>The <strong>hybrid vacuum and mop feature</strong> lets you remove dry debris and mop up wet areas in one pass: You can change the water flow from light dampening for hardwood to more aggressive mopping for tile and laminate. The <em>VibraRise 2.0</em> technology adds sound vibrations to the mop pad to help it remove stains better and it also automatically lifts the mop when the robot sees carpet, so the pads don’t soak your rugs.</p>
<p>In a market where basic models without docking stations often cost more, paying $219 for a robot vacuum that can empty itself and has 10,000Pa suction is a great deal. Roborock’s usual price of $359 already made this model a good deal, but the 39% discount makes it an impulse buy for families who are tired of vacuuming every day.</p>

<p>Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem drop is live now, introducing new weapons, mounts, enemies, and more. </p>



<p>The developers of Minecraft have been churning out a lot of content for the game this year. We already received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-vibrant-visuals-happy-ghast-chase-the-skies-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vibrant Visuals and Happy Ghast</a> in June, and now, we are all set to receive Mounts of Mayhem, the next big content update for the title, which you can learn more about below.</p>







<h2 id="h-minecraft-s-mounts-of-mayhem-update-will-introduce-new-weapons-foes-mounts-and-underwater-exploration">Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem Update Will Introduce New Weapons, Foes, Mounts, and Underwater Exploration </h2>

<h4 id="h-mounts-of-mayhem-weapons">Mounts of Mayhem Weapons</h4>



<p>Starting with the weapons, Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem update will add a spear, which is excellent for both hand-to-hand and mounted combat. The weapon’s damage can scale based on the speed of the player. Lunge Enchantment is a new enchantment unique to the spear, which gives players a burst of speed with the jab attack. Moreover, the higher the enchantment level, the farther the player will be able to travel with their attack. </p>



<h4 id="h-zombie-mounts-and-enemies">Zombie Mounts and Enemies</h4>



<p>Then we come to Zombie Mounts, which are not only enemy mobs, but can be tamed to be your own mounts. Zombie Horses are the first; they are passive mobs, but are ridden by spear-wielding zombies. Get rid of them, and the mount is yours. Then we have the Zombie Nautilus, an underwater mob ridden by a trident-wielding drowned. Players will have to tame it by unseating the ride and tempting it with a pufferfish. </p>



<p>The next enemy mob in Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem update is Camel Husks. These are passive mobs, but are spawned with two riders, one with a spear and the other with a bow. What’s more, these mobs are immune to sunlight and will provide a daytime challenge to the player. </p>



<p>Lastly, Mounts of Mayhem will allow players to explore the underwater world of Minecraft in the best way possible. There are three types of mounts: the nautilus, zombie nautilus, and coral zombie nautilus. Each of them can be ridden and provides a speed boost while preserving the player’s existing air supply. </p>

                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 fans can now own a piece of tech that feels and looks like something you'd find at Kiroshi Opticals in Night City. To celebrate the game's fifth anniversary, CD Projekt Red partnered with Viture on limited-edition XR glasses themed around Cyberpunk 2077. The Viture x Cyberpunk 2077 5th Anniversary Collector's Edition XR Glasses are numbered to 10,000 and available to <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Viture+Reveals+High-Tech+Cyberpunk+2077+Limited-Edition+XR+Glasses&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-12-10+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-10+01%3A55%3A42&amp;fnarticle_id=6536823&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fredirect.viglink.com%3Fkey%3Dfbff19622bfc4d759c94ca50d964e98d%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.viture.com%2F%26cuid%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fviture-luma-cyber-xr-glasses-cyberpunk-2077-anniversary-limited-edition%2F1100-6536823%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">purchase now for $549 on Viture's online storefront</a> and at select major retailers.</p><p>Viture Luma Cyber XR Glasses combine the form factor of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Luma-Pro-Glasses-First-Ever/dp/B0FD8NP2DC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Luma Pro ($499)</a> with the technical enhancements found in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Luma-Ultra-Gestures-Real-time/dp/B0FFT72CBX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Luma Ultra ($599)</a>. Officially licensed collectible editions of tech and gaming products usually cost more than standard models, so it's pretty cool that the Luma Cyber XR Glasses cost $50 less than the Luma Ultra.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620215-viturecyberxr.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620215" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620215-viturecyberxr.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620215"></a><figcaption>Viture x Cyberpunk 2077 5th Anniversary Collector's Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620215-viturecyberxr.png"></figure><p>Designed by CD Projekt Red artists, the Luma Cyber XR Glasses feature the Kiroshi Opticals logo on the temples/arms as well as Night City-inspired symbols. The edges and temple tips glow neon yellow when the glasses are active. The black frames are translucent, which allows you to see some of the internal mechanisms and circuitry that powers Viture's high-tech extended reality glasses.</p><p>Viture launched its flagship Luma series in late August, so the Cyberpunk 2077-themed model utilizes the manufacturer's newest tech. The glasses create a private 152-inch virtual display for gaming, watching videos, and productivity. The Luma series uses Sony's latest Micro-OLED display panels and offer 1200p resolution with 120Hz refresh rate. The lenses are coated in electrochromic film to block out light and to prevent people around you from seeing your screen. The virtual display is crisp and bright whether you're outside in natural light or in a dark room.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620219-viturecyber3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620219" data-ratio="0.486" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620219-viturecyber3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620219"></a><figcaption>Cyberpunk 2077's signature shade of neon yellow is prominently featured.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620219-viturecyber3.png"></figure><p>As mentioned, the Cyber XR edition has the lightweight form factor of the Luma Pro with the more advanced tech of the Luma Ultra. The enhanced features include an increase in peak brightness from 1,000 to 1,500 nits, hand gesture support, and 6DoF (Degrees of Freedom). The tracking sensors register head and body movements, which makes the Ultra and Cyber editions better equipped for augmented reality. The Luma Pro, for reference, is limited to head movements (3DoF).</p><p>The glasses can connect to just about any device with USB-C video out, but handheld gaming is the biggest draw for many users. Viture glasses work wonderfully with Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and other Windows handhelds. When connected to iOS, Android, macOS, or Windows devices, you can use Viture's free Spacewalker app to create three virtual displays. This is especially helpful if you plan on using the glasses for work as well as entertainment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620262-vituremobiledock.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620262" data-ratio="0.41666666666667" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620262-vituremobiledock.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620262"></a><figcaption>Viture Pro Mobile Dock is required for Switch 1/2 (sold separately).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620262-vituremobiledock.png"></figure><hr><p>Viture XR Glasses are compatible with Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, but you'll need an extra accessory to act as the Switch 1/2 Dock Set.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-goes-full-clearance-on-its-gaming-laptop-as-the-tuf-f16-with-rtx-4050-hits-a-new-record-low-2000651800</link>
            <guid>1378267</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Not all laptops qualify as gaming laptops. Gaming machines should have a powerful processor, sufficient memory, better graphics, and spacious storage – for starters. Models offering this and more, however, sit well over $1,000. If a not-so-friendly price tag has been holding you back from picking one, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/">Amazon just slashed 27% off the 16-inch ASUS TUF F16, bringing its price down to $800.</a> You’re saving a whopping $300 on a machine that makes working on resource-intensive tasks during the day and gaming at night a lot more efficient and, honestly, fun. Just note that orders placed now are likely going to arrive after Christmas, so you’ll want to plan accordingly if you’re planning to pick it up as a gift.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Performance With Immersive Visuals</h2>
<p>It’s a tough laptop with a lot of muscle, and that shows. Looks-wise, it maintains a classic design, featuring a subtle embossed TUF logo on its sleek cover. Open the thing up, and you’re greeted with a massive 16-inch Full HD display with 90% screen-to-body ratio, pushing vibrant, detailed visuals that bring all your favorite content and titles to life. The 100% sRGB color coverage delivers every color in a more realistic manner, which can especially help creatives ensure excellent accuracy consistently. Its 144Hz refresh rate, alongside Adaptive-Sync technology, actively reduces lag and eliminates visual tearing for a smoother experience; great for those fast-paced, action-filled games where everything moves quickly. Basically, your screen won’t struggle to keep up.</p>
<p>Immersive, studio-quality sound comes from Dolby Atmos and Hi-Res audio support, while the two-way AI noise cancellation allows for sharp, clear communication. As for the keyboard, a 1.7mm key travel distance makes for responsive controls. There’s a white backlight on the board that makes it easy to hit both deadlines and the bad guys in all lighting situations.</p>



<p>Power-wise, you’re covered with an Intel Core 5 210H processor, paired with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 laptop GPU with a Max TGP of 115W and NVIDIA Advanced Optimus. Translation? Ultra-smooth, fast gameplay, even during those intense sessions. The 512 GB SSD isn’t massive, but enough to house your favorite titles, plus some heavy programs, without throwing a fit. Despite the power, F16 keeps cool and calm as it works. That’s thanks to its 84-blade arc flow fans that draw in more air to maximize airflow, as well as up to 4 dedicated exhaust vents that let warm air out efficiently. The machine has also been rigorously tested to meet the Military Grade testing standard, MIL-STD-810H, letting you enjoy peak performance even in harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Battery life is another strong selling point. This laptop comes with a 56Wh battery that can help you get through an entire day without worrying about plugging it in. Recharging doesn’t take forever either, as the machine can hit 50% in just 30 minutes.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about it, but to wrap it up, if you’ve been after a reliable, strong work and play machine, we highly recommend grabbing the ASUS TUF F16 laptop, which is made keeping both creatives and gamers in mind. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/">On a regular day, it would run you around $1,100, but you can pick it up for just $800 if you act fast.</a> There are no delivery charges to worry about either. If the post-Christmas shipping time is not a problem, get your orders in quick, though, as discounts this good tend to expire sooner.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been one of the biggest years for Nintendo in a while with the release of the Switch 2. With two different Nintendo consoles to play games on, and another stellar line of new releases added to the catalog, your Nintendo Wrapped Year in Review for 2025 should make for interesting reading.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-nintendo-switch-games-to-gift-christmas-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a> will be back with the 2025 Year in Review. This gives you a comprehensive rundown of all the games you’ve played this year, how many hours you sank into each, the types of games you played, and how many Blue Shells you’ve fired (the last one might be a slight exaggeration).</p>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-year-in-review-2025-expected-release-date">Nintendo Year in Review 2025 Expected Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So, how did you spend your year? Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Sometime in the third week of December—starting December 15—is when everyone should expect the 2025 Nintendo Year in Review.</strong></p>



<p>Sony seems to be the only company deadset on retaining a consistent Wrapped schedule! Xbox is all over the place, but we can get a rough idea, and Nintendo’s is also a haphazard do-whatever launch.</p>







<p>Nintendo’s 2022 Wrapped was on Tuesday, December 13. This seems quite normal, right? The 2023 stat wrap-up dropped on Friday, December 15. Lastly, the 2024 Nintendo Year in Review arrived before Christmas on Wednesday, December 18.</p>



<p>From this, we can see that Nintendo isn’t attached to a certain day of the week, nor a date. However, the most consistent aspects are that the Nintendo Wrapped always arrives a few days after PlayStation and Xbox, and it’s commonly in the third week of the month.</p>



<p>As of writing, you can presumably look forward to your Year in Review becoming available between December 15 and December 19. Insider Gaming will update this if something drastically changes, and Nintendo shocks everyone.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-nintendo-wrapped-2025-stats">How To Check Nintendo Wrapped 2025 Stats</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s A Go! Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>If the method is the same, all you need to do to check your Nintendo 2025 Year in Review stats is to click the 2025 link once it’s live, log into your Nintendo account, and check out your stats.</strong></p>



<p>Once you’ve done all of this, a plethora of numbers and facts await, and you can question your life choices and whether you need to get out more.</p>



<p>Stat comparisons are always fun. Don’t be afraid to share your end-of-year Nintendo stats with the rest of the IG community, which you can do via the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reliable source has leaked that Fortnite’s next big anime collaboration is with Bleach, and it’s set to arrive this season. </p>



<p>Fortnite has had several notable anime collaborations in the past, with big names like Naruto, Dragon Ball Z, Jujutsu Kaisen, and more coming to the island. What’s more, we already have one member of the Big 3 anime in the game; a second is set to be added shortly. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-bleach-collaboration-is-expected-to-arrive-this-season">Fortnite Bleach Collaboration is Expected to Arrive This Season </h2>



<p>The collab between Fortnite and Bleach was spotted by <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SamLeakss</a> and corroborated by HYPEX on <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1998589004590301445" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). HYPEX’s new post also revealed that the collaboration will include the song “Number One – Bankai”, the iconic soundtrack that has played several times during crucial moments in the series. </p>



<p>We still don’t know the details about what other content the Bleach x Fortnite collab will bring. If we go by the previous collaborations, then players can expect some new cosmetics for sure, and Bleach has a solid roster of characters, with some popular ones being Ichigo, Kenpachi, Byakuya, Kisuke Urahara, Aizen, Uryū, Yhwach, and more. </p>



<p>On top of that, most anime collaborations have introduced special abilities to the game. Dragon Ball Z introduced the Kamehameha, My Hero Academia brought Deku’s Smash and Todoroki’s Ice Wall, and Jujutsu Kaisen introduced Hollow Purple and the Straw Doll technique. With Bleach’s iconic Bankai song being added, we could get the Bankai ability, with players having to find their own Zanpakutōs on the island. However, this is just speculation. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Top 10 Best Licensed Games Based on Movies]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-10-best-licensed-games-based-on-movies</link>
            <guid>1378258</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ah, the licensed video game. Once a collection of underwhelming retellings of big-screen blockbusters, littered with haunting polygonal nightmares (Hagrid, that’s you) and aimless Atari attempts (yes, E.T., that’s you), we’ve seen an uptick in actually good adaptations in recent years, with the upcoming Terminator 2D: No Fate looking like a promising attempt at turning James Cameron’s classic into some enjoyable retro action. So, we thought we’d pick out the best of the bunch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do have a few little rules, though, that stop just any old film-adjacent game from making the list. They need to either be:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A direct translation or adaptation of a feature film</li><li>An official movie sequel or prequel.</li><li>Or a game that attempts to continue the story or provide backstory and additional canonical lore.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Terminator 2D: No Fate Steam Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, for example, Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man is not eligible as it takes place in a Marvel universe separate from the movies and is much more rooted in the original comic books, but the PS2’s Spider-Man 2 would be allowed due to it being directly based on the Sam Raimi film of the same name. Make sense? I hope so. Let’s rank the top 10 best licensed games based on movies.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>10. Peter Jackson’s King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/kong-1764777464721.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Console launch games come with the power to stun thanks to the leap in technology they inherently are unlocked by. The Xbox 360’s Peter Jackson’s King Kong definitely benefited from this, as the Lord of the Rings’ director’s epic retelling of the classic monster movie made a huge splash at the dawn of gaming’s HD era. With Rayman and Beyond Good and Evil creator Michel Ancel helming it at Ubisoft Montpellier, King Kong felt more than a standard movie tie-in thanks to its many interesting and novel ideas. You had the freedom to explore its vast jungle spaces, which offered an unprecedented sense of cinematic immersion and was a breathtaking contrast against the previous generation’s more limiting, corridor-like spaces. King Kong not only ushered in a whole new generation of hardware but also a new way of thinking about how licensed games could be approached.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>9. Scarface: The World is Yours</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/scarface-1764777509202.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarface: The World is Yours has balls. Not only does a “Balls Meter” fill up as Tony Montana causes mayhem across an open-world ‘80s Miami, allowing for him to slow down time, enter first-person mode, and gain infinite ammo as he guns down as many gang rivals as possible, but it also has an audacity to position itself as a sequel to a film in which its protagonist dies at the end. In this alternative universe, Al Pacino’s antihero coke fiend survives the ambush at his mansion thanks to a certain little friend and escapes out of the back door, free to continue building his drug-running empire. Yes, it's largely a GTA-clone, as was commonplace in the era — see the also actually quite good The Godfather adaptation for further evidence — but its wild concept alone is enough for it to deserve a place on this list.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>8. Rockstar’s The Warriors</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/warriors-1764777573589.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of creating immersive worlds and capturing a tone, not many do it quite like Rockstar. The Warriors comes from an era when we’d get more than one game a decade from the developer, and sometimes multiple in one year. A much smaller-scale project than the likes of GTA: San Andreas or Vice City, The Warriors acts as both a prequel and a retelling of the cult ‘70s thriller of the same name, focusing on the titular New York gang. Taking the form of a beat 'em up, it successfully drenches you in the seedy underworld alleyways that its characters inhabit, as Rockstar once again displayed their world-class world-building credentials. And that grimy tone is what The Warriors achieves most successfully, making it an adaptation that shouldn’t be overlooked, even when compared to the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption studio’s other headline-stealing projects.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>7. Mad Max</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/mad-max-1764777696030.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Avalanche Studios’ Mad Max is the perfect example of taking the essence of a film series and turning that into the driving force behind a video game adaptation. In this case, it's the exhilarating car combat witnessed all the way back in the original 1979 movie, through Road Warrior, and into Fury Road’s landmark action. When Max is on foot in the 2015 game, it's perfectly good as it apes the successful melee formula concocted by Warner Bros. stablemate Rocksteady for its Batman Arkham series, but it's when the Australian drifter gets those hands out of raiders’ jawbones and behind the wheel of his iconic Interceptor that it really comes to life. Now a cult favourite, much like the original film that inspires it, Mad Max is one of a kind and a fantastic translation of George Miller’s vision in video game form.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>6. Spider-Man 2 (2004)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/spidey-1764777730481.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Years before the Rocksteady Batman: Arkham and Insomniac Marvel’s Spider-Man games, the prospect of a successful comic book game was bleak. Even rarer was the thought of a genuinely fun movie tie-in. Treyarch’s Spider-Man 2, based on the Sam Raimi film of the same name, flew in the face of both those ideas. An incredibly detailed New York City (for the time, at least) felt like a revelation to swing around in, and Peter Parker’s web-slinging provided a whole new way to explore the sort of 3D open world that the PS2’s Grand Theft Auto games had pioneered. In a legitimately impressive technical revelation, Treyarch’s Spidey actually attached his webs to buildings rather than empty skyboxes. Flying between skyscrapers and thumping petty criminals was a thrilling sensation back in 2004, and, while it has since been far eclipsed by more modern Peter Parker and Miles Morales adventures, it certainly paved the way for those to exist.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>5. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/jedi-1764777782836.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s difficult to think of a movie series that’s had more games to its name than Star Wars. Classics such as TIE Fighter and Rogue Leader were contenders for this pick, but we just think there’s nothing like the fulfillment of the Force fantasy that is delivered by Respawn’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Bridging the gap between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, this 2023 action-adventure is part of the official canon, with references to Order 66 and clashes with Darth Vader fuelling Cal Kestis’ story, but with an originality that doesn’t just lean on Star Wars cliches. An improvement in pretty much every way over its predecessor, Fallen Order, it's an easy pick for our representative of the most famous of film universes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4. GoldenEye 007</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/goldeneye-1764777823570.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It may not be the best to play now, but there’s just no denying the impact that GoldenEye 007 had when it arrived in 1997 on the Nintendo 64. Perfect Dark, shortly after, would go on to expand on the ideas established in its campaign, and games like TimeSplitters would borrow from its revolutionary approach to FPS multiplayer, making it so much more than just a movie adaptation. Yes, it featured a whole host of famous James Bond heroes and villains — including a truly broken Oddjob, who takes the term “sharply dressed” to its extreme —- and successfully captured the globetrotting exploits of 007 as much as a console with the limited power of the N64 could at the time, but it also shaped the next three decades of online shooters. This makes it so much more than just a movie tie-in, and something developer Rare should never be forgotten for achieving.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3. The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/riddick-1764777899466.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"> A video game prequel to the 2000 Vin Diesel vehicle, Pitch Black, has no right to be as good as The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay, yet here we are. Taking a heap of Half-Life campaign design and a healthy dose of Thief-like stealth, the Swedish Starbreeze Studios and Vin Diesel’s own Tigon Studios transformed a perfectly decent film series into a genuinely great video game, and one that many believe surpasses its source material. Its smart level design is enhanced by intelligent translations of Riddick’s abilities from the film, such as his trademark “eyeshine”, which lets you see in the dark, and a healthy amount of improvised blunt and sharp weaponry that fits perfectly with the movie’s grimy aesthetic. The plot’s premise — a prison escape — is fundamentally cinematic, but it's the ways in which Butcher Bay asks you to play intelligently in its world that pushes it beyond the big screen and into a truly great game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2. Alien Isolation</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/alien-1764777933080.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Alien film from 1979 is a haunted house movie in space, with lone survivor of the Nostromo, Ripley, aiming to survive its dark corridors and the roaming Xenomorph threat until the credits hit. As such, it would become a natural inspiration for many survival horror greats, from Dead Space’s infested spaceship, to SOMA’s unnerving futurism, and, of course, Resident Evil 2’s stalking Mr X threat. So, naturally, when the time came for yet another Alien game to be made, survival horror seemed a logical choice for developer Creative Assembly, who would be the next in a long line to take up the challenge of translating the unique atmosphere of Ridley Scott’s original film. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What the studio made was beyond what could have been expected, as it evolved the idea of RE 2’s Tyrant into an ever-present danger that scuttled along the map’s sprawling web of vents. The Xenomorph, and the tech powering it, are the jewel at the centre of Isolation’s crown, and are what make it such a faithful recreation of Alien. By stepping into her daughter’s shoes and sneaking around the Sevastopol, you get as close a feeling as to what it would’ve been like to be Ripley and walk those Nostromo hallways yourself. It may not quite make the number one spot on our list, but it is the entry that most successfully captures the overall tone of its source material, embracing its terror to astonishing effect.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/indy-1764777968098.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We wouldn’t have the likes of Tomb Raider or Uncharted without Indiana Jones, and in 2024, the king came back to claim his throne. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle took everything that made the original trilogy of Steven Spielberg films so special and managed to translate it into a lovingly designed video game from Wolfenstein developer MachineGames — perhaps not so coincidentally, a studio formed by former Escape from Butcher Bay developers. Not only is The Great Circle a fantastic, stealthy, puzzle-filled action-adventure that really places an emphasis on the adventure part, but it borrows all of the archaeological intrigue and, crucially, humour that makes the likes of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade so special. So much, in fact, that the story told here would slot in nicely between them and act as a superior third of that trilogy than Temple of Doom ever did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throw in a fantastic pitch-perfect Harrison Ford impression from Troy Baker, a suitably swarmy performance from Marios Gavrilis for the villainous Emmerich Voss, and a healthy amount of Nazi punching, whipping, and shovel-smacking, and you’ve got all of the ingredients you need. But it’s so much more than just a playable film, instead grounding itself in flexible immersive-sim-esque gameplay systems that emphasise using brain over brawn. Violence is rarely considered a first option, and gained knowledge is always a much sharper weapon. It makes for a truly fantastic game in its own right, but one that is as referential as it is transformative, and a true-to-life version of what the Indiana Jones character is —  a doctor, not a soldier. The Great Circle is as thought-out a licensed game based on a movie as you could wish for, and a perfect fit for the top of our list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And those are our picks for the best games based on movies.

            <guid>1378255</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Netflix has admitted it did not attribute any value to Warner Bros.’ video game business in its $82.7 billion acquisition deal, sparking concern for the future of everything from Mortal Kombat to Hogwarts Legacy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Warner Bros. is best known for its movie and TV business, Warner Bros. Games includes a number of well-known video game developers and brands. Batman Arkham developer Rocksteady, LEGO games developer Traveller's Tales, Hogwarts Legacy developer Avalanche Software, and Mortal Kombat maker NetherRealm are all on Warner Bros. Games’ books.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And despite the fact some of Warner Bros. games, in particular smash hit Hogwarts Legacy, have sold tens of millions of copies and generated billions of dollars in revenue, as far as Netflix is concerned, they’re pretty much an afterthought in this mega deal.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking during a conference presentation about the deal reported on by <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-warner-bros-games-business-in-83bn-mega-deal/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pocket Gamer</a>, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters responded to a question about whether buying Warner Bros. would accelerate its own gaming plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He said that while Warner Bros. had done “great work in the game space, we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now we are super excited because some of those properties that they’ve built, Hogwarts is a great example of that, have been done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we’re offering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They’ve got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there’s definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven’t built that into our deal model.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mortal Kombat Flawless Victory: A Visual History of the Iconic Series Excerpt</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Warner Bros. Games does have some big hitters under its belt, it has struggled since the release of Hogwarts Legacy. In January, previous games boss David Haddad exited the company following the costly failures of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and MultiVersus. Soon after, Warner Bros. Games announced plans to shutter Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. San Diego alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-cancels-wonder-woman-game-closes-three-studios"><u>the cancelation of its Wonder Woman game</u></a>. And in June, Warner Bros. Games announced a restructure to focus on four key franchises: Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC, and Game of Thrones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, 2024 was a brutal year for Warner Bros. Games, with Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League sparking a $200 million hit to revenue, and then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business"><u>Smash Bros.-style brawler MultiVersus flopping to the tune of $100 million</u></a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions"><u>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</u></a>, meanwhile, failed to make an impression. Speaking in a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav said: "We recognise [the games business] is substantially underperforming its potential right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what’s next for Warner Bros. Games while it awaits its fate? The promising <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> is set to launch at some point in 2026, and given Netflix's deal may not close until summer 2027, this one feels safe.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there's a Hogwarts Legacy sequel in the works and a single-player Batman game from Rocksteady reportedly in development, but neither is announced nor do we have release windows.  NetherRealm has yet to announce its next project, having ceased work on Mortal Kombat 1 updates. Will it make another Mortal Kombat game or another game in the DC fighting game series, Injustice? Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal, meanwhile, reportedly pitched a John Constantine game but it was never approved. A Flash game was scrapped after the DCU Flash film bombed. It’s now allegedly helping out with other games and is reportedly working on a pitch for a new Game of Thrones game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Netflix be interested in any of this? So far, Netflix has seen mixed results from its video game efforts, with a number of high-profile hires and subsequent studio closures. It’s currently focused on narrative games based on Netflix shows, games for children, social party games, and Grand Theft Auto ports.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

			<p>Half-Life 3 is a game that no fan of the series thought would ever see the light of day. Although the game hasn't been revealed yet, there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/"><strong>numerous indications over the past few months that Valve may be working on a new entry in the series</strong></a>. However, if the wait for an announcement is becoming unbearable, you can get a glimpse of the potential future of the series in a new look at the impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/"><strong>Half-Life 2 RTX Remix mod</strong></a>.</p>



<p>A new look at one of the most impressive modding projects, powered by NVIDIA's modding tool, was provided a few days ago by a new comparison video from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">MxBench</strong><strong>m</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">arkPC</strong></a>. The video compares the vanilla release with the latest version of the project, which incorporates significant improvements over its initial launch.</p>



<p>Although the performance hit on an RTX 5080 GPU is considerable, the new PBR assets, GPU and CPU performance improvements, lighting enhancements, improved volumetric fog and water, and the new tonemapper which prevents image from being too bright make this mod worth a try for fans of the series who want to experience the game like never before.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Half-Life 3 is no longer a fever dream of fans of the series, but a concrete possibility. Although the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/">rumored 2025 announcement</a></strong> of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/">project known as HLX</a></strong> may not materialize, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/">Valve is undoubtedly actively working on it</a></strong>, adding new features to the Source 2 engine over the past few months that will likely be incorporated into the game. Some of these will reportedly make <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-reportedly-getting-announced-soon-but-how-will-it-play/">Half-Life 3 a very immersive experience</a></strong> that should make the wait since the launch of Half-Life:Alyx well worth it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-8tb-external-hard-drive-at-under-0-02-per-gb-is-practically-the-cheapest-data-storage-available-2000651777</link>
            <guid>1378231</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage problems aren’t just annoying; they also keep you from delivering your best. Constantly deleting old files to make room for new ones, or spreading essential files across multiple devices, is not fun. Thankfully, there’s a way to resolve the issue, and right now, it doesn’t cost a lot either.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6319/">We just spotted the 8TB Seagate external hard drive sitting at $150 at Amazon, after the retailer took 12% off its $170 tag.</a> Shipping is free for both Prime and non-Prime members, so you’re saving a bit on that front too, which brings the total down even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6319/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Incredibly Spacious</h2>
<p>The drive itself is not massive. At just 2.5 inches, it fits nicely into any desktop setup without demanding too much space or attention. It’s also quite lightweight, which makes it easy to take your entire library with you on the go; just plug the drive into another laptop or PC, and access all your important files just like you would on your everyday computer.</p>
<p>As for the storage – it’s truly massive. The drive’s 8GB capacity is spacious enough for you to house all important data, whether it’s media content or work documents. You will be able to throw in thousands of images, hundreds of high-quality videos, a ton of movies (both the latest releases and some classics), long research papers, never-ending spreadsheets, your favorite gaming titles, and still have space for more. Basically, it can hold all that you currently own, plus all your future downloads. This capacity makes it great for creatives looking to keep all their heavy projects in one place, work professionals with years’ worth of data, and even students. You really won’t need to invest in another storage solution anytime soon.</p>



<p>Setting things up and getting started couldn’t be simpler. All you need to do is connect the USB hard drive to Windows or a Mac. There are no software or driver installations to worry about, but Apple users might need to reformat the drive to proceed. Once it’s connected to your device, moving files around takes minutes. That’s thanks to USB 3.0, plus the drag-and-drop functionality. Simply pick what you need to transfer and drop it in the drive; no need to click endless buttons.</p>
<p>The box includes the drive itself, an 18-inch USB 3.0 cable, an 18W power adapter, and Rescue Data Recovery Services. The rescue service helps you get back your lost data from the hard drive if it fails or gets damaged; great for some extra peace of mind. This can be done by shipping your device to recovery specialists, who are pros at handling both mechanical and logical (file system) data issues. There’s also a limited warranty thrown in with your purchase.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking for a spacious drive that is capable of housing all your data, from media files to programs, work documents, creative projects, games, and more, look no further, as this 8TB is an excellent option to consider. If you’re looking for even more space, there are several other configurations available to consider, but not all are discounted. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6319/">The current 12% discount on this one brings the price down to $150, making the upgrade affordable.</a> Grab it quick, though, as deals around this time of the year tend to move fast, and deals don’t stick around for long. You’re saving on delivery fees, which is another nice bonus.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy: The Kotaku Review]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-the-kotaku-review-2000651792</link>
            <guid>1378228</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Over the past year,&nbsp; I have spent at least three individual nights yelling over the din of a loud New York City bar to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games-to-play-with-friends-multiplayer-how-to-sell-1851576183"><span>try and sell someone</span></a><span> on </span><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</span></i><span>. Too Kyo Games’ passion project visual novel/tactics RPG hybrid is the kind of thing that you can easily convince someone is impressive, but getting anyone to get over the hump of its magnitude and actually play it is something that still eludes me as we approach the end of the year. I think at a certain point, I accepted that as long as I could get someone to respect </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>, that was enough for me. If anything, I consider the fact that it’s such a hard sell to some people a testament to its accomplishments.</span></p> <p><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</span></i><span> might sound like too large an undertaking for the average person, even someone who might be interested in its bold premise. But even if you don’t get around to it, know that even the most celebrated games will never be as daring as Too Kyo Games’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-too-kyo-bankrupt-1851786150"><span>incredible Hail Mary</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Like most works by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-danganronpa-game-is-getting-an-enhanced-remake-with-a-twist-2000625415"><i><span>Danganronpa</span></i></a> <span>lead Kazutaka Kodaka, </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>follows a group of high school students trapped within the walls of an academy. Though they’re not in a killing game like the unfortunate stars of Kodaka’s signature series (at least, not initially), the group of oddballs, freaks, and like, one or two normal teenagers are caught up in a violent scheme against their will. These kids are told that they’re here to defend the titular school from waves of alien invaders because </span><i><span>something</span></i><span> within its walls is a key to saving humanity, but before they can inquire further, their captor, Sirei, a ghost-like mascot character who’s obviously taking notes from </span><i><span>Danganronpa</span></i><span>’s Monokuma, is found sliced up in a trash can just off campus.</span></p>

 <p><span>Now these kids are stuck defending this school for 100 days and without any clarity. The three months and change pass with them all having to find the strength to fight for something they don’t know if they truly believe in, as they instead find belief in one another to get them through.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>The Hundred Line’s </span></i><span>100 days are filled with silly antics, tragic breakdowns, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/shuten-order-review-kodaka-danganronpa-hundred-line-2000621052"><span>compelling mysteries</span></a><span>. This is every signature pillar Kodaka has skillfully mastered over the years of creating high school whodunnits, all wrapped into a three-month timespan. Each day as the clock ticks down, a new clue to what actually brought these kids to the Last Defense Academy is unearthed, and with every passing night, a sense of dread lingers over even the smallest interactions. Is everyone here trustworthy? Is everything as simple as it seems? If you know Kodaka’s work, you know the answer is “no,” but even a knowledge of murder mysteries like </span><i><span>Danganronpa </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code </span></i><span>as well as the cyberpunk dystopian anime </span><i><span>Akaduma Drive </span></i><span>couldn’t prepare me for what I’d find on the other side of </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s tactical battles.</span></p>

 <p><span>As the “Last Defense Squad” grows in combatants over the course of 100 days, each member takes on different, highly specialized roles in combat. All of their big personalities manifest in different fighting styles and weapons only they can use, all spawning from a force called hemoanima within them. This is why these particular kids are fighting on behalf of humanity; they’re the only ones who can.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000651797" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651797"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651797">© Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>That specialization is why </span><i><span>Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s combat</span> <span>doesn’t quite match the strategic play of something like </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>, as it makes each battle feel like a puzzle to solve. Most characters have only one or two attack patterns; Kako, for instance, a meek younger sister in the group, uses a sniper rifle to avoid the scrap, and thus excels at long range. Then there are bolder heroes like the main protagonist, Takumi, who wields a sword that puts him on the front lines as he seeks to lead the group.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some might find these rigid roles limiting. </span><i><span>Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s battles don’t feel like free-for-all scenarios in which you’re meant to move pieces around a board to your whim. Battles often spawn your heroes on different sides of the school, and those characters might not have great synergies with each other, so it’s up to you to figure out how best to defend the Last Defense Academy from incoming alien forces with the mini team comps you’re given on each side. The greatest strategy in </span><i><span>Hundred Line </span></i><span>is improvising, and sometimes that means making a big play that will take some of your own team members off the board in favor of giving the survivors an opening.</span></p> <p><span>Each battle is divided into waves, and your characters are all revived at the beginning of a round, so it’s perfectly viable to sacrifice a character knowing they will come back shortly. Some of my favorite plays involved using a character’s ultimate ability, a high-impact attack your unit can perform when low on health in exchange for their life. Killing certain enemies grants your team more actions before the opposition’s turn, so using a self-sacrificing ultimate to take out some of my foes and let one of my other combatants whale on a boss a few more times is a sacrifice I’m willing to make. Those decisions aren’t something you typically strategize around; they’re just making the most of what you have in the moment.</span></p> <p><span>After all, those spur-of-the-moment plays and intricate synergies are in service of taking down a mindless horde of aliens that mean to harm humanity, right? We should feel nothing tearing through them to save all our friends and family waiting to return to Earth after they’ve been given the all clear…right?</span></p>

  <p><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s 100 days come to a close pretty quickly, all things considered. The average player will hit that deadline in about 30 hours. But there’s a reason, even after having seen the end of those 100 days, that I never reviewed </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031"><span>when it launched in April</span></a><span>, and still wasn’t ready to when I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031"><span>declared it an easy contender for 2025’s Game of the Year</span></a><span> the following month. It’s what happens after you reach that final day that makes it one of the most ambitious and important games of the year.</span></p> <p><span>By the time Takumi and the rest of the Last Defense Squad reach the 100th day, pretty much everything has gone wrong. You’ve lost members of your team in the war, one of your own has betrayed the mission, and the thing you sought to protect has been destroyed, but what you’ve lost may be your only hope to make things right.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Deep in the depths of the Last Defense Academy, the team has found what they were recruited to protect: a baby swaddled in flame who has spent these three months gathering power to cover the planet in undying fire, killing the rest of the invaders and allowing humanity to finally return and rebuild. This baby, like the rest of the crew, is able to use hemoanima, and since he’s been storing up his power for all this time, he is far more powerful than any of the others who are capable of using it.</span></p> <p><span>However, when one of your crew betrays the mission and kills this fire-covered baby, they’re able to absorb his charged-up power and wield it in what seems like a final boss fight. In this fight, the ex-party member’s “Specialist Skill,” or an ability that only they have, is upgraded. When Takumi defeats them, he absorbs all this energy. Typically, his power is to rewind turns in battle, but now that gift is more far-reaching than it has been in the last 100 days. Now, Takumi can rewind much farther. In fact, he’s now able to go back all 100 days, and that’s what he does, hoping that maybe this time, he’ll be able to save humanity.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000002145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002145"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002145">© Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At this point, </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>puts a </span><i><span>2 </span></i><span>on its title screen, and Takumi must relive the 100 days and try to salvage the mission. Using the knowledge you have from the first time you saw this whole thing go south, you can get it right this time…maybe. This is where Kotaro Uchikoshi, </span><i><span>Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s co-director, known for his work on the </span><i><span>Zero Escape </span></i><span>series, grabs the wheel. You don’t just watch the 100 days play out again as Takumi makes all the right decisions this time; you have to make calls that will drastically change the course of events. </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>has over 20 routes, with each branching into one of several endings, all culminating in 100 possible conclusions. You can jump around the timeline as many times as you need to until you’ve either seen them all or you’re satisfied with the conclusion you received, but it’s up to you to use all you learned from the first route to try and find a better conclusion than the dire one you found the first time.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s many routes range in quality. Some of them are gags, like one that abandons all the stakes to make the story a slice-of-life comedy or a harem anime arc; others are genuine tactical challenges, like one that requires you to engage in long battles almost every other day in the three-month run. Broadly, </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s many routes are chances for its writing team to morph and mold its core premise into different genre stories. There’s a route that turns into a slasher story, another that riffs on zombie fiction, and there’s even one that turns into a </span><i><span>Danganronpa</span></i><span>-like killing game.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yes, there is arguably a “true” route that solves the broader mysteries, but the degree to which </span><i><span>Hundred Line </span></i><span>is willing to remix everything you think you know about this story to deliver something entirely unrecognizable is such an incredible swing that I can’t believe Too Kyo Games pulled it off. Giving you the reins to steer the story in one of its many directions is a bold move that can easily lead to moments of incredible discovery but also to frustration as you reach what feel like dead ends or time-wasting conclusions.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651798" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651798"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651798">© Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Some of these storylines will tell you things you won’t find out elsewhere, and so playing through all 100 routes isn’t just something for the sickest of completionists; it does genuinely help fill out everything you do and don’t understand about the world you spent 100 days defending with blinders on.

But</span><i><span> The Hundred Line</span></i><span> is still an achievement that most developers wouldn’t even entertain in a pitch, and Too Kyo Games made it when the studio had everything to lose.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651799" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651799"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651799">© Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Too Kyo Games easily could have set its niche obsessions of killing games, branching narratives, and mind-bending twists aside and created something that aimed for the widest personal audience in hopes that it would save the studio. Instead, it committed to what it knows, leaning into what has always made its leads’ work so memorable. Where others might have pumped the brakes on their ambitions, Too Kyo slammed its foot on the gas and hoped there would still be another route to follow when it reached the end. </span><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy </span></i><span>may not be for everyone, but anyone can see what it’s done and know that it’s earned their respect.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-the-kotaku-review-2000651792]]></content:encoded>

<p>Use these Geometry Dash monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Diamonds, Mana Orbs and other cosmetics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Does a combination of the PC classic, Dave and Guitar Hero sound like a fun experience to you? If so, you need to check out the exhilarating experience that is Geometry Dash immediately. Geometry Dash is a popular platformer where syncing your movements to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-music-codes-best-song-ids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">music</a> is of utmost importance. Players are required to guide an icon from one end of the map to the other, all while maintaining the rhythm and avoiding obstacles and other distractions. The game auto-scrolls to the side, meaning that the amount of time players have to make decisions is also quite limited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are 26 distinct levels that come standard in Geometry Dash, with each level having its own unique soundtrack. Another feature that makes Geometry Dash so popular among its players is the level editor. This allows users to create their own custom maps for the game, with the added bonus of being able to select the soundtrack for each level. For players looking to customise their gameplay experience by changing the player icon, there are vaults where this can be done – The Vault, The Wraith Vault, The Vault Of Secrets and The Chamber Of Time. This article provides players with all of the active Geometry Dash codes for each of these vaults.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were quite taken with Assassin's Creed Mirage on its release in 2023, calling it a "rich and characterful adventure".</p>
<p>"I have frequently looked at Assassin's games as historical adventures with a bit of wonky sci-fi glamour, and Mirage's late-game certainly conforms to the formula in this regard. But what Mirage, and Mirage's Baghdad in particular, have reminded me is that the historical stuff is where the real care is found," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-review">Eurogamer's four star Assassin's Creed Mirage review</a>.</p><p>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty also came out in 2023, and again we quite liked it. "Team Ninja evolves Nioh's formula in a Three Kingdoms-era action RPG where allies, flags, and stealth make its brutal challenges more manageable than ever," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-masocore-action-with-an-approachable-twist">Eurogamer's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty review</a>.</p>
<p>Sony is expected to announce its PS Plus December line up soon, so stay tuned for the official announcement.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Assassin's Creed news, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">PEGI rating for Black Flag Resynced was recently spotted</a>, further cementing that those remake rumours are indeed true. Perhaps we will officially hear more on Black Flag's remake at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">The Game Awards later this week</a>?</p>

<figure data-uuid="7fc8ef16a4588"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7fc8ef16a4588/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the massive Switch 2 sales out of the gate, Nintendo's shares have been slipping throughout December, dropping as much as 4.7% yesterday. Why? It seems fears surrounding chip shortages may be to blame.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/nintendo-sheds-14-billion-value-after-chip-squeeze-fears-grow">Bloomberg</a> (paywall) estimates that Nintendo's market value may have already decreased by as much as $14 billion this month, as Switch 2 RAM module costs have leapt up 41% in the quarter.</p>
<p>It's not just RAM either. The console's NAND storage has also seen an estimated 8% price rise, as both SanDisk and Samsung have delayed shipments of flash chips due to "increased demand from large data centres and hyperscalers", according to a <a href="https://x.com/jukan05/status/1996105253545279875">recent statement</a> from SSD manufacturer Transcend.</p>
<p>This shortage explains the pricy state of microSD Express cards — the <em>only</em> expandable storage method for Switch 2 — which regularly sit at the best part of $200 for the beefy 1TB option and around $60-$80 for the smaller 256GB. "This is effectively a cost that Nintendo has passed onto the gamer," Pelham Smithers of Pelham Smithers Associates told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Of course, the holiday season is near-enough guaranteed to be a big one for Nintendo and the Switch 2. Last month, the company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">upped its sales forecast</a> from 15 million to 19 million Switch 2 sales by the end of the financial year, and its impressive start is nothing to be scoffed at.</p>
<p>But consoles cost money to make, and if memory costs stay on the up-and-up, who knows what the company will need to do to keep its profits moving in the right direction.</p>

<p data-start="0" data-end="503">If you’re a runner or really anyone who’s serious about fitness, a reliable watch is a must. The best way to improve yourself at any activity is by setting incremental goals, and you can’t effectively track your progress without the right tools. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is a tough, durable smartwatch that’s designed to be your perfect partner, whether you’re in the gym or building your cardio the great outdoors. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6318/">Right now, you can grab it at Amazon for $250 off, bringing the price down to $549 from its regular price of $799.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6318/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/i-have-never-played-a-game-like-this-before-doom-creator-john-romero-compares-next-game-to-elden-ring/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, a massive wave of layoffs at Xbox affected several gaming projects, including announced titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/"><strong>Perfect Dark</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/"><strong>a new MMORPG by ZeniMax Online</strong></a>, and many others. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/">The next unannounced project by Romero Games</a></strong>, the studio created by DOOM series creator John Romero, was also cancelled, but today, it has been confirmed that it has been saved, and though its scope has been changed, it will be an innovative experience in the vein of FromSoftware's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/"><strong>Elden Ring</strong></a>.</p>



<p>As shown in the video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@htdreams"><strong>Andrés De Pedro Álvarez</strong></a>, speaking at the Salón del Videojuego de Madrid 2025 last week, the creator of the DOOM series confirmed that the unannounced project has been saved. However, the game has been redesigned and has become something different despite incorporating many elements from the title canceled earlier this year.</p>



<p>Though the DOOM series creator couldn't get into specifics other than the fact that the game is much smaller than before, he did say that he has never played a game like this shooter before. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"But, the things that you do in it, will be new to people, the way that going through Elden Ring was a really new experience,"</em> Romero said. </p>



<p>Comparing the game to a masterpiece like FromSoftware's is definitely bold, but also very exciting, especially coming from the developer that contributed to the creation of the genre with Wolfenstein 3D and its establishment with the DOOM and Quake series.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The confirmation that the next project from Romero Games has been saved is rather welcome, but not entirely surprising. Following the cancellation of the game that Xbox would have published, it was revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/romero-games-is-not-closed-studio-clarifies/"><strong>the studio had not closed and was evaluating opportunities from other publishers</strong></a>. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see the first glimpses of a game that already sounds very interesting.</p>

            <p>Well, there you go. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' winter update's now got got a proper release date. Snow will be coming to the shooter on December 16th, and judging by the way Embark have revealed that, it looks like there could be a temperature-based twist coming to the usual murder-deathing and trying to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-update-140-takes-aim-at-locked-room-exploits-and-item-swap-induced-rapid-fire">sneak into places you shouldn't</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-first-roadmap-promises-lots-of-goodies-like-a-new-map-quests-and-more-before-the-end-of-the-year">roadmap</a> Embark put out last month offers a good glimpse into what'll be coming with this update, dubbed Cold Snap. The snowfall map condition, which does what it says on the tin, will bring with it a "Flickering Flames" event, a new raider deck, and new quests.</p>
<p>Plus, a day after Cold Snap drops, the chance to reset your character via a prestige-esque extraction project will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embark-dishes-on-all-the-goodies-youll-get-in-arc-raiders-if-you-choose-to-prestige-later-this-month">start being offered</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Cool. While the addition of snow alone's not much to write home about, the fact Embark have revealed Cold Snap's arrival date via a shot of a dead bloke lying in the now does seem like it might suggest some survival-style temperature mechanics you'll have to stay on the right side of in order not to catch your death. Maybe flickering flames is all about chucking yourself into a fire before your fingers and toes start to freeze up and fall off.</p><p>Cold Snap marks the end of the additions Embark have pulled back the curtain on thus far, with a fresh roadmap for 2026 likely to arrive not long after the calendar flips over, if not before then.

              <p>The shock of&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-helldivers-2-lava-skyblivion-delay-2000650525"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> having stumbled out of the gate</a> has clearly hit publisher Activision hard. Reports that the latest entry in the annual franchise has seen a slump in player numbers are seemingly <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team">confirmed by a statement</a> the publisher put out late last night, in which it was stated that “the Franchise has not met your expectations fully,” and that as a result there will no longer be “back-to-back releases of <em>Modern Warfare</em> or&nbsp;<em>Black Ops&nbsp;</em>games.”</p> <p>For over 20 years, the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> franchise has been the backbone of Microsoft-owned Activision’s sales, more often than not the best-selling game of a given year, and routinely bringing in in excess of $2 billion. But in 2025, that run seems to have once more faltered. Observable player numbers are way down, user reviews are extremely bad, and old rivals like <em>Battlefield</em> have reappeared and eaten its lunch.</p>

 <p>To be completely clear, <em>Black Ops 7</em> isn’t a disaster! It will likely make a solid profit, perhaps be one of the best-selling games of 2025, but the issue likes in Activision’s colossal expectations for the series. Anything short of record-breaking popularity is perceived as failure, given how much of the company’s financial claims will have been predicated on such success. This has clearly spooked the now Microsoft-owned Activision Blizzard so much that it’s made a public statement, ostensibly directed to players but clearly aimed at shareholders, to <em>mea culpa</em> and promise to do better next year.</p>

 <p>The whole statement is a masterclass in euphemism, each negative phrased as a positive, its opening paragraph thanking us for “the feedback” from a “passionate community” (“please stop yelling!”) and stating “we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver,” (“we fucked up, we know we fucked up!”).</p>

 <p>After announcing a free week next week for multiplayer and Zombies, and explaining how impossibly brilliant the seasonal updates are going to be, the statement eventually states that “our strategy going forward is changing.”</p> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <p>This seems very much designed to respond to widespread complaints that this year’s outing feels too familiar with a terrible always-online campaign, thus losing the public’s wider interests when there’s a big, bold and fresh-feeling <em>Battlefield 6</em> to be playing instead.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">A&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em> interview</a> with&nbsp;<em>The Game Business</em>‘s Chris Dring last week reported that not only had&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> not performed well since its November 14 release, but that&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> has a whole has seen far lower numbers of players throughout 2025. While no official sales or player numbers have been reported by Activision, and things are futher obfuscated by the game being released on Game Pass, public facing stats like <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/">those of&nbsp;<em>SteamDB</em></a> show just how few people are playing&nbsp;<em>CoD</em> on Steam compared to both previous years&nbsp;<em>and</em> this years strong competition in the form of <em>Battlefield 6</em>,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em> and free-to-play&nbsp;<em>Delta Force</em>.</p>

 <h2>Innovation vs. escalation</h2> <p>Of course, what this statement is&nbsp;<em>not</em> saying is that there won’t be a new&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> in 2026, but rather that it won’t be&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Black Ops</em>. The last time the franchise featured any other branch was 2021’s <em>Call of Duty:</em> <em>Vanguard</em>, and before that, 2017’s <em>Call of Duty: WWII.</em> Both were the best-selling games in the U.S. in their years, but it’s noteworthy that Activision was still disappointed by&nbsp;<em>Vanguard</em>‘s sales, <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-call-duty-vanguard-modern-warfare-2-release-1848873636">blaming this on the World War II setting and a lack of “innovation.”</a></p>

 <p>It seems we’re back there once again, although this time the franchise is in a tougher spot. <em>Vanguard</em>‘s perceived failures were cited as being because of what it <em>wasn’t</em>, and the company was able to declare that no one need worry (it was in the midst of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-that-has-happened-since-the-activision-blizz-1847401161">sexual abuse scandals</a>, some <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-activisions-bobby-kotick-didnt-just-know-he-al-1848066600">specific to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/report-activisions-bobby-kotick-didnt-just-know-he-al-1848066600"> management</a>, as well as trying to ensure its $69 billion sale to Microsoft), and that next year there would instead be a game-changing new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare</em> series. But this time, the statement promises nothing at all beyond hopes and dreams, given falling back on what’s worked before clearly isn’t the answer.</p> <p>It remains to be seen if there even is an answer. 22 years of annual releases (plus spin-offs) is enough to exhaust even the most ardent, die-hard fan, and after a while just the words “<em>Call of Duty</em>” can feel leaden, even outdated. It would be more sensible for Activision and Microsoft to pull back on expectations, perhaps spend less on a game that innovates rather than escalates, fascinating a gaming audience into not wanting to be left out. But given the need to appease shareholders, the forced move is always to go bigger, spend more, risk more, and make more. If the issue really is general fatigue among players, that could be a hefty disaster.</p> <p>“To be clear,” ends the “Call of Duty team’s” statement, “the future of <em>Call of Duty</em> is very strong and we believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams.” It continues,</p> <blockquote><p>“We have been building the next era of <em>Call of Duty</em>, and it will deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the Franchise and the genre forward. We look forward to welcoming you in, listening to you, and moving forward together.”</p></blockquote> <p>It’s going to be an interesting year.</p>
