			<p>The PC port of The Last of Us Part II was reportedly completed a few months ago, and it is not yet known why the game has not been released.</p>
<p>Earlier today, well-known reliable insider billbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mais-quand-sortira-la-version-pc-de-the-last-of-us-part-ii-52283">commented</a> on the PC version of the second entry in the series by Naughty Dog released earlier this year on PlayStation 5, saying that the PC port of the game has been in development since 2021, and it was completed by November 2023. As for why the game still hasn't been released, the insider could not say but speculates the release could have been held back to coincide with the launch of the second season of the HBO show, which is scheduled for next year.</p>
<p>The PC version of The Last of Us Part II will be based on the Remastered release launched earlier this year on PlayStation 5. With the additions of the No Return Mode, the Lost Levels, and the developer's commentary, it is the best way to enjoy the game, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is, without a doubt, the best way to enjoy Naughty Dog's excellent survival horror game, thanks to addition of the surprisingly fun No Return roguelike mode, the cut Lost Levels, developer commentary and two display modes for a proper 4K resolution experience. The main campaign's bleak story remains as controversial as it was when the original game launched on PlayStation 4, but underneath it is one of the finest survival horror games ever made.</em></p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II is now available on PlayStation 4, while the Remastered release is only available on PlayStation 5. The game will be released at some point on PC.</p>

The Final Shape wraps up Destiny’s long-running narrative by taking players inside the Traveler for a showdown with the enigmatic Witness. This marks the climax of a decade of intricate Destiny storytelling, leaving fans curious about the future.  <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-cryptic-tweets-spark-destiny-3-speculation-as-expansion-the-final-shape-launches">Some are even speculating Bungie has Destiny 3 up its sleeve</a>.</p><p>For now, if you're looking to jump into the expansion and see what it has to offer, we have found the best deal available for those on PC. Destiny 2: The Final Shape is down to <a href="https://zdcs.link/rdwgX" target="_blank">$42.99 at Fanatical</a> (<a href="https://zdcs.link/V08K3" target="_blank">£35,69 in the UK</a>) a trusted steam code seller, and a 15% saving compared to the $49.99 list price.

The developer, now owned by Sony, is also working on the multiplayer game Marathon. In a series of tweets celebrating the release of The Final Shape, Bungie executive creative director Luke Smith discussed the journey to its release and the tremendous effort the developers invested. However, it was his repeated use of the capitalized word "Hope" that sparked a buzz within the Destiny community.</p><p>For now, the focus is on The Final Shape and its three planned episodes. Echoes kicks off next week on June 11, Revenant is set for October 2024, and Heresy rounds The Final Shape off in February 2025, although of course, the plan may change.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Final Shape launched on June 4, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-developer-bungie-truly-sorry-for-the-final-shape-launch-issues">Destiny 2 quickly encountered major server issues</a> that hindered players from progressing through the highly anticipated campaign. Many players reported being kicked out of campaign levels, missing crucial cutscenes, and losing progress. Bungie provided progress updates via Twitter as they worked to resolve the issues, but for many players, the night was a loss.</p><p>Bungie has rolled out a number of restarts in a bid to tackle errors causing players to get kicked out of activities, which it said “remains our highest priority issue to resolve.” Those who missed a cutscene can replay the mission by accessing the Replayable Missions node in the middle of the Pale Heart map, Bungie advised. There are cutscenes at the end of Mission 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p><p>“We built The Final Shape to be an exciting, cathartic, story-driven adventure for everyone to enjoy,” Bungie continued. “We’re truly sorry if connection issues and instability is getting in the way of that experience, and we promise to keep working until these issues are resolved.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Destiny 2: The Final Shape Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>We've also been raving around a similar DLC discount for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deal-elden-ring-dlc-before-release-day-pc-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, which is down to $35.19</a>, also from Fanatical.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-players-discover-special-homelander-brutality-with-a-cool-the-boys-easter-egg<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> now has Homelander as a DLC character, and players are already finding cool Easter eggs with the supervillain.</p><p>Homelander, from the phenomenally popular Prime Video show <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-boys">The Boys</a>, launches in NetherRealm's gory fighting game with a number of references, but one Brutality in particular was found to include unique dialogue that hat tips an infamous scene.</p><p><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for The Boys Season 2 follow:</em></p><p>In The Boys Season 2 premiere The Big Ride, Homelander is introduced to Blindspot, a candidate for replacing the now-deceased Translucent's spot in The Seven. Blindspot is blind but possesses superhuman hearing and agility. Homelander, clearly unimpressed, bashes Blindspot’s ears in, declaring him “just another useless f***ing blind guy.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mortal-kombat-1/How_to_Do_Brutalities">All Mortal Kombat 1 characters have Brutalities</a> — unique moves that end a match in a particularly brutal fashion. They’re triggered by doing an extra input command on top of a specific combo ender or move that wins the final round. Most of the characters in the game have six brutalities, but ever since Mortal Kombat 1 launched in September last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-players-are-starting-to-discover-hidden-brutalities-including-one-for-omni-man"><u>players have discovered secret Brutalities, too</u></a>.</p><p>Homelander’s Brutality is similar to the ear bash he performs on Blindspot in the show, leaving his opponent screaming in agony on the floor. But, if Homelander performs this Brutality on Kenshi, he says the line from the show: “just another useless f***ing blind guy.” Kenshi, Mortal Kombat fans will know, is a blind swordsman who uses telekinetic abilities to defeat his opponents — and perfect fodder for Homelander’s quip.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Homelander has a unique line when performing a brutality on Kenshi. <a href="https://t.co/OQOgXxk32m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/OQOgXxk32m</a></p>— Noah Hajnasr (@DIZZ_NH) <a href="https://twitter.com/DIZZ_NH/status/1798077214266974692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>It's a cool nod to The Boys, but not everything about Mortal Kombat 1's Homelander is a perfect recreation of the on-screen character. For example, Warner Bros. has remained coy about the voice actor behind Mortal Kombat 1’s Homelander. Antony Starr, who plays Homelander in The Boys, does not voice the character, much to the disappointment of fans. Omni-Man voice actor J. K. Simmons reprised his role for Mortal Kombat 1, as did Peacemaker actor John Cena. It is unclear why Starr did not do the same here.</p><p>The Mortal Kombat 1 Kombat Pack includes the Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin for Johnny Cage (available now), and one-week early access to six playable DLC characters: Omni-Man (available now), Quan Chi (available now), Peacemaker (available now), Ermac (available now), Homelander (available now), and the upcoming Takeda Takahashi, as well as five DLC Kameo fighters. The Boys Season 4, meanwhile, kicks off June 13.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

</div><div>



            
<p>Silkbulb Test is a game in which, going by its demo, you are strapped to a chair and made to answer questions projected onto a screen. You answer the questions by looking ponderously down and pressing the big red and yellow buttons on the desk in front of you. The questions begin with relatively innocuous, CAPTCHA-style inquiries, such as "is this a door?" accompanied by a picture of a face. A few minutes later, there's stuff like "Are you alone?" and "Is it safe to be alone?" and "You are alone" and yep, time to smash Pause or better, throw the Steam Deck behind the sofa and go stare out the window for a while.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In the velvety darkness that surrounds the projection screen, you hear tinkly nursery music and other noises that are less tinkly and more squelchy or breathy and hey, it sounds like they're coming from behind you, and getting louder. "Hold shift to run" anytime now, Silkbulb Test. Hopefully, this is enough to catch your interest, because I couldn't bear to play much more of the demo (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2468250/silkbulb_test/">Steam link here</a>). What a relief to discover that it "should be considered an introduction and early tutorial to the world and is not representative of the gameplay for the full game."</p>
<p>Hang on, the full game sounds worse. It's an asymmetrical co-op and single player horror "experience". Players are called upon to explore "a mysterious, uncanny, and sunken place" in which "the creatures, the environment, and your own body want you dead". Just like shopping at Budgens, then. To make progress you must "harvest the minds of the Sunken Ones" and perhaps work with other unseen test participants, for "Silkbulb Test is about being alone, together". </p>
<p>Your principle tool in navigating these perils appears to be a customisable "Safe-T-Face". It works like Alien's proximity detector, alerting you to threats in the dark. Except that unlike Alien's proximity detector, it's a bruised and hairless disembodied head that sometimes appears concussed and sometimes gurns at you like a Barbie doll from hell. That's the Safe-T-Face in the header image, I think. No, not Wishlisty, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wishlisted">our purple mascot</a>, the other one. Those teeth! Too white, too white. Time to disconnect from the wi-fi with a vengeance and go look out the window again.</p>
<p>Silkbulb Test is one of the most striking shortform horror games I've stumbled on lately and I can't wait to absolutely never play the full thing. Developer Tim Oxton is a DreadXP alumnus: his past credits include the very affordable, well-received and equally disturbing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2840480/FLATHEAD/?curator_clanid=44760799">Flathead</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1952590/Future_Racer_2000/">Future Racer 2000</a>, the latter of which is possibly the worst of the lot for looking like a harmless exhibition of retro aesthetics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-story-mode-hands-on/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While in Warsaw with 11 bit studios, I got <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on with The Alters</a> and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-qa-creating-a-game-about-the-roads-not-taken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q&amp;A session</a>. I also had a <a href="https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-qa-back-to-the-wasteland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q&amp;A session</a> on Frostpunk 2 and hands-on with the new story mode. Having only recently had a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hands-on-with-frostpunk-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on with the utopia builder mode</a> of Frostpunk 2, I was keen to see where the story here would jump off from the original.</p>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>As I said in my earlier preview, you can look at the original as a launchpad for the sequel, as should be the case. As indicated in the Q&amp;A, the one thing 11 bit studios didn't want was to make a sequel that was essentially a retread of the original. When the room was advised to jump into the easy mode for this quick hands-on, I did what I always do and ignored them, going for normal, and I got the Frostpunk experience I expected - I fell. The first time, I didn't even get to the city for it to fall.</p>
<p>At the start of the campaign's tutorial, you find yourself trying to keep people alive after your dreadnought has crashed. I'm going to spoil something here, but survival is impossible. You want to try your best to survive, and your decisions will impact the core campaign and story, but as with anything in the Frostpunk world, the cold will kill you. I finished the tutorial on my third attempt without killing the elderly or the seals, a very proud victory after one failure and one minor seal-killing victory.</p>
<p>This brings us to the start of the campaign. Thirty years after the first game's events, New London is struggling. The city is essentially in ruins; the generator is down, and there isn't enough housing, resource gathering, or anything. You're the new steward and about as well-liked as Liz Truss. The initial vote of confidence can be won; fortunately, you do have something, and the promises you make to win that vote will have to be met, as well as any actions needed to survive the frozen wasteland.</p>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>The core difference here is that your actions are naturally on a bigger scale. While I'm not completely sold on the city being in a near ruinous state after thirty years - though not beyond the realms of belief - it makes it difficult to jump right into the new idea of expanding beyond the original city limits. I would have preferred a scenario where your resources are depleting, and now it's time to expand, not one where the resources have depleted and it's gone to shit before expanding.</p>
<p>Not a big issue, not even an issue, just a niggle. So, in Frostpunk 2, you're going beyond your city limits and making districts in the nearby area. Think of them as specialist suburbs. You'll place a residential suburb to increase housing, a resource suburb to exploit resources, a food one to start farming, and so on. This is on a hex-based grid; before you can even place them, you have to use icebreakers to let you get to the terrain. It makes for a natural expansion despite my earlier niggle.</p>
<p>Each of these districts - we'll go by the correct name - can also hold a few unique buildings. The first you need to build in the original city limits is your council hall, where the politics of Frostpunk 2 comes into its own. As with before, you're passing laws and balancing the needs of factions. The difference now is that these factions pass your laws through a voting system, meaning you must sometimes haggle, barter, and promise to get something through. Even if it's objectively for the best, politics gets in the way, and sometimes, the promise is to let a faction decide what the next vote is on. Not always the best if they want something to pass you don't support.</p>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>It creates a constant battle where you're trying to keep factions happy and retain their trust in you while combating the terrible effects of the frozen world outside. Which is when you come to the outside world. Beyond the area where you will be expanding your city is the frostlands. Much like the first game, you can go out into the frostlands with expeditionary teams, but now there's more detail. You can see your units moving to where you've sent them, and as you uncover more, you may even have the option of building new outposts, which can act as settlements in their own right.</p>
<p>Everything I've tried in Frostpunk 2, from the earlier utopia builder to this hands-on with the early stages of the story, gives that feel of a natural expansion that should be found in a successful sequel. What was micro is now macro, but it still feels like Frostpunk. This is probably the best praise I can give to the game and 11-bit studios so far, and all I know is that I'm looking forward to playing the full game when it releases on the 25th of July for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>Roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wild-bastards">Wild Bastards</a> is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space</a> western follow up to 2019’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-bastards">Void Bastards</a>. It takes some of that game’s ideas, mainly those related to shooty and looty, and reforms them into a largely different can o’ campfire beans. This time, it’s less focused on exploration, more on individual, tense shoot-outs. You collect a cast of weirdos, each with different guns and abilities, and form the deadliest dang posse this side of the last tactical overworld map you descision'd your way through. I like what I've played so far, although I think a lot is going to hinge on how much evolution the mid-game offers. As always, here’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660840/Wild_Bastards/">Steam demo</a>, if you want to be all contrary and 'form your own opinions'. Pah.</p>

<p>The first thing you’ll want to do is whack mouse sensitivity as high as it’ll go. Seems as if Ol’ Jimmy Molasses has been gunking up the pistols again, varmint that he is. Once this is sorted though, Wild Bastards appears to have  pushed far more of its chips into the FPS pile this time around. You get two outlaws quite quickly, a spidery Pistolier and a robot with a large laser shotgun. I’m not too hot on the shotgun, but the spinny dual pistols feel pretty solid. There’s still a sense that, whether through engine limitations or design, Wild Bastards is a game that <em>includes</em> shooting, rather than being a dedicated shooter. Still, solid pistols.</p>

<p>I spend some of my first showdown hiding on top of a water tower, which elicits barks from my confused enemies. Feeling sorry for them, I eventually decide to return to the ground. I switch Bastards from pistol to shotgun, which is instant, so it basically just feels like switching loadouts. Except! Individual Bastards can get wounded, so it’s a bit like each of your guns having their own health pool. When the short showdowns end, you’ll enter the overworld map. Health carries over between showdowns, but you can find heals on the map  in between bags of money, upgrades, and other encounters. This incentivises you to either finesse each showdown as smoothly as possible, or switch out Bastards often so you get an even spread of wounds. The overworld map itself is styled somewhat like a board game, giving you a certain amount of movement points each turn instead of just a flat node hop.</p>
<p>Why does this movement limit matter? Because you’ll also be pursued by enemies as you move around. I finish the first map, do some upgrade stuff in space, then start the second.  Eventually, a no-good rotten treacle-bellied prairie dog-kissing varmint called McNeil arrives. He pursues me across the map, and the game tells me to avoid him. So, of course, I decide to run straight toward him to see what all the fuss is about. He manages to kill Spider Rosa. But! The duff-feeling shotgun turns out to be quite effective. I change tac from hiding out in a big pipe, and bunny hop over to McNeil and his horse, giving them old shell-to-face as I go. McNeil? More like McNeil, but dead! Did the game make McNeil deliberately weak to make me feel special, or I am just that good at Wild Bastards? I suppose I’ll learn more when the full game releases this year, September 12th 2024.</p>

			<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is almost guaranteed to be released before the end of the year, judging from a legal document that's been circulated online.</p>
<p>As reported by Enomis on <a href="https://x.com/venixys/status/1798061147956076907?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X/Twitter</a>, Bandai Namco has six months to demonstrate the commercial use of the trademark or to request an extension, which apparently never happened with the latest games based on the series created by Akira Toriyama. As such, there's an extremely good chance Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO will be released before the end of the year, as suggested in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-2024-release/">a new rating a few days back.</a></p>
<p>On a related note, it seems like one of the core features of the Budokai Tenkaichi series will be coming back in Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO. The game's<a href="https://store.playstation.com/it-it/concept/10007902/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PlayStation Store listing</a> was updated today to include a 2-player local multiplayer tag, suggesting splitscreen multiplayer will be in alongside online multiplayer. This is great news, as the original listing on both the PlayStation Store and Steam did not list local multiplayer.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. It is being said the release date will be officially revealed soon, so it won't take too long to learn if the new entry in the series will indeed launch in the next six months or so.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, mobile games installs and sessions decreased globally by 2% and 7% respectively. But during Q4 2023, installs saw a slight increase by 7% year-over-year. LATAM saw the largest increase of 19%, followed by EMEA (12%), North America (6%), and APAC (3%).</p>
<p>In terms of worldwide downloads last year, Subway Surfers topped the charts followed by Free Fire, Roblox, Ludo King, and Candy Crush Saga.</p>
<p>As for which genres saw the highest amount of installs during this period, action had the largest share at 18% with hyper casual and puzzle tied close behind at 14%.</p>
<p>Action also saw the highest session rate at 27%, followed by puzzle and sports (12%), board (7%), and casual (6%).</p>

            <p>
Flock - the sky-based shepherding game from Richard Hogg and Hollow Ponds described as an "ode to the joy of flight and discovery" - has landed itself a release date. 
</p>
<p>
Flock will be arriving across PC via Steam, PlayStation and Xbox next month, on 16th July. It will also be available day one on Game Pass. 
</p>
<p>
You can check out Flock's release date trailer, which has been styled as a David Attenborough documentary-like short, below.

<p>
On its release, Flock's players will be able to take to the skies as they charm a number of curious flying creatures such as Bewls and Cosmets to join their herd. There are also sheep to shear, and hats to knit.
</p>
<p>
"Starting with a small herd of hover-sheep, you nurture and fly them toward fresh, untouched pastures. Along the way, you will discover the secrets of the beautiful uplands and its wild creatures," the official blurb reads. 
</p>
<p>
I was rather taken with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flock-feels-like-the-video-game-equivalent-of-throwing-open-the-window-for-a-breath-of-fresh-air">Flock's demo</a> when I gave it play earlier this year, describing it as "the video game equivalent of throwing open the window for a breath of fresh air".
</p>
<p>
For more, I also chatted with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hohokums-spiritual-successor-takes-flight-in-flock">Flock's creators Richard Hogg and Ricky Hagget</a> about their upcoming game, including what it is like to actually shear a sheep in the real world. Spoiler, it's harder than it looks.

            <p>
Octopath Traveler has been rated in Taiwan for both PlayStation 4 and PS5.
</p>
<p>
While the sequel is already available on Sony's consoles (as well as Switch and PC), the first game was released on Switch, PC (Steam), and Xbox One, but not PlayStation.
</p>
<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/octopath-traveler-rated-for-ps5-ps4-in-taiwan-alongside-octopath-traveler-ii-for-xbox-series">Gematsu</a>, Octopath Traveler was rated in Taiwan alongside an Xbox Series X/S version of the sequel, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-traveler-2-headed-to-xbox-next-year">previously announced by Microsoft at the Tokyo Game Show 2023</a> but without a firm release date.

<p>
Essentially, this is Square Enix plugging the gaps, so that both Octopath games will be available across all platforms.
</p>
<p>
Further, <a href="https://exputer.com/news/xbox/octopath-traveler-2-xbox-release-june/">Exputer</a> has reported Octopath Traveler 2 will be added to Game Pass too.

</p>
<p>
This would tie in with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's new plan of "aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a> to diversify its earnings and allow more players to "enjoy our titles in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalogue titles".

</p>
<p>
What's more, at the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest event in Las Vegas last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer took to the stage to announce the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-heading-to-xbox">MMORPG was heading to Xbox</a>. Square Enix CEO Takashi Kiryu also noted other games would be arriving on Microsoft's consoles.

</p>
<p>
The release of the Octopath games on more platforms is the next step in this multiplatform strategy, then, but whether the likes of Final Fantasy 16 or the Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy follow remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
The Octopath Traveler games each follow eight characters, as the name implies, in a traditional turn-based RPG that popularised the HD-2D graphic style. The games are perfect for any Final Fantasy fans who dislike the action combat of the latest games.
</p>
<p>
The HD-2D style is also being used for other Square Enix games, with the company teasing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-teased">remake of Dragon Quest 3</a> with this aesthetic.

</p>
<p>
A string of issues plagued last night's The Final Shape launch, which Bungie has now apologised for. These began with the game's usual traffic issues whenever a big update lands, but continued with further problems that saw players kicked out of the game mid-activity and mid-cutscenes. 
</p>
<p>
"I was wondering why the pacing felt so weird until I realised I had missed two entire cutscenes and had to look them up," one fan wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1d8be3e/this_is_the_biggest_narrative_moment_in_destiny/">reddit</a>. "I understand and sympathise with server instability, but it feels so bad for the story experience to be harmed this much. I don't remember this being that much of an issue with previous expansions."

<p>
As a "temporary workaround", Bungie has said anyone affected can replay missions to then watch the cutscenes again at their end (there are five major cutscenes, at the end of missions one, four, five, six and seven). Alternatively, fans have already begun uploading the expansion's full story moments onto YouTube.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, this isn't how Destiny's decade of narrative was supposed to climax, and for that Bungie has apologised. 
</p>
<p>
"We built The Final Shape to be an exciting, cathartic, story-driven adventure for everyone to enjoy," the developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1d8gfie/the_final_shape_stability_update/">wrote</a> in a statement released overnight. "We're truly sorry for connection issues and instability getting in the way of that experience, and we promise to keep working until these issues are resolved."
</p>
<p>
While Destiny 2's narrative reaches a climax in the expansion, Bungie has already said there's plenty more Destiny to come. The coming year will see the launch of three DLC episodes to wrap up remaining plot threads - and after that, well, this was always just the end of the franchise's Light and Dark saga. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-3-discussion-swirls-following-accurate-expansion-leak">Leaks suggest work on Destiny 3 is already underway</a>.

            <p>A month after its early access launch, Supergiant Games has released a second patch for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2</a>.</p>
<p>As with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-hades-2-patch-aims-to-underline-melinoes-distinct-swift-style">first patch</a>, this update does not add any new content to the game, with its focus remaining on things such as bug fixes, general gameplay fixes (many of which were inspired by community feedback) and numerous tweaks to Daedalus Hammer upgrades. </p>
<p>
For example, Marauder Wallop has been removed from the game to be replaced with a staff upgrade known as Rapid Thrasher, which will allow for faster attacks.</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition, the developer has made some adjustments to the game's difficulty levels at certain points. Both the Trial of Heartache and Trail of Haste should now be a bit easier, the team said, following player feedback.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some boss fights have been tweaked slightly. One particular foe (won't say their name to avoid spoilers) has had several adjustments made to their fight, meaning there should now be "fewer instances" where they are "patently unfair".</p>
<p>Hades 2 players will now also be able to meet an additional Olympian each night. There is also a selection of new UI icons for things such as Keepsakes, Weapons, Well of Charon offerings and "more" included with this patch.</p>
<p>You can read the full patch notes over on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4191241567727414432">Hades 2 Steam page</a>, but please be aware of potential spoilers.</p>

Its launch also saw the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-hits-new-record-following-sequels-release">original Hades getting a boost in player numbers</a>.</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-in-early-access-at-least-through-the-end-of-this-year-says-creative-director">how long Hades 2 will remain in early access</a>, creative director Greg Kasavin said it will be until "at least through the end of this year".</p>

            <p>Witchy roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Hades 2</a> got a fresh update yesterday that sees a bunch of weapons getting stompier, thumpier, and, yes, whompier. It's like the hammer of Hephaestus himself was put to work on the entire armory. The Moonstone Axe's heavier attacks now channel faster, for one thing, which could make the most sluggish of the weapons a little more viable. I haven't had a go at the re-jigged bashing yet myself but I trust from these patch notes it will be subtly noticeable.  </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Apart from the sharpened edge of that axe, the twirling pain orbs of the Umbral Flames are also now "stronger and faster". Plus, fans of the stagger daggers will be happy to know slices from the Sister Blades now stagger foes for longer. Meanwhile, the Argent Skull, your morbid bowling ball of hurt, has got a wider field of damage when you do its dash-like Omega attack. The default pokey stick, the Witch's Staff, gets a simpler tweak: "Special knocks foes away, but is slightly slower." </p>
<p>The upgradey effects of the Daedalus Hammer have also seen a big change (the Daedalus Hammer is a heavy-hitting dinger that can alter your attacks when you find it during a run). A large number of its upgrades have been cut and replaced with new effects. I count eight new upgrades with six being removed. The Witch's Staff and the whirligig wound-making of the Umbral Flames seem to be the most affected here. So if you're a fan of those weapons, you might feel a significant difference as you get deeper into a run. One of the new upgrades for the Staff is called Mirrored Thrasher, and reads: "All your Attacks hit twice, but you take more damage". Ouch. But also: pow!</p>
<p>There are a lot of other changes, including alterations to some enemy behaviours (self-destructing Hippos are now more accurate) and some fixes to the menus. As is often the case with Supergiant patches, there are a lot of small but significant changes. Individually they seem minor but altogether they constitute a big ol' update. Very importantly, there is some extra dialogue for when you speak to your pet frog. "More voice lines should play when confiding in Frinos in certain contexts," the notes say. </p>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4191241567727414432">full list of changes here</a>. Or if you have no idea what's going on and, for some reason, don't even know what this game is all about, you can read my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2 review</a>.

            <p>I've set aside some time this evening for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s latest expansion The Final Shape, which launched last night. My pal Liam suggested we play <em>this</em> evening because Bungie's servers would inevitably go up in flames the moment it launched. And what do you know? The right decision was made. Are we smug about it? Yes. Anyway, the good news is that Bungie have put out a few of those fires, though there are still a few bugs to fix.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a diary entry-style <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1798195541291188323">series of Xweets</a>, Bungie have jotted down things they've tackled so far and things they're working on. Those include sign-on issues and a range of errors with codenames that make them sound like very dubious makes of scented candle. Namely, "Honeydew" errors have been squashed, alongside "Weasel" and "Plum".</p>
<p>Bungie also began a <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1798220138917016001">rolling restart of their servers</a> at 8:45am PDT (4:45am BST) this morning. This has led to the extinguishing of a few more scented candles/connection problems, including "Currant" errors that kicked players from activities. However, pesky "Cabbage" and "Weasel" errors are back on the rise, and Bungie are continuing to monitor things until all is resolved.</p>
<p>Bungie say that if you've missed a cutscene thanks to these crashes and errors, you can always go back and replay the mission via the "Replayable Missions" node in the middle of the Pale Heart map (the new expansion area).</p>
<p>Reviews over on Steam are "Mostly Negative", unsurprisingly, as folks express their dismay at the server fire. Besides the obvious frustration, there's some positivity surrounding The Final Shape's campaign, with folks saying it's "a blast" and "leagues better than Lightfall", the previous piece of Destiny 2 DLC. </p>
<p>I'll report back on my Final Shape findings at some stage, as Liam and I shoot some triangles, plunge some orbs into sockets, and try out the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-2-the-final-shapes-game-breaking-subclass-detailed-in-new-bungie-video">Prismatic subclass</a>. I'm looking to mix Arc with Strand, for no real reason other than I like the idea of mixing electricity with Matrix goop.</p>

            <p>
Call me a Paranoid Android or a Suspicious Stanley, but when I ask a videogame developer a question and the videogame developer pauses for exactly 31 seconds and then says “no”, I tend to assume the answer is, in fact, “yes”. Or at least “it’s complicated”, to channel a bit of antique Facebook coyness. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a> is a complicated game. It is a moody sci-fi extravaganza in which your character, beleaguered offworld miner Jan Dolski, has to create new versions of himself by branching off his own past timeline using a "quantum computer", splitting the chain of events at trigger points by, say, having his younger self stand up to his domineering father rather than leaving home. 
</p>
<p>
The result is a rolling space base full of alternate, vat-grown Jans, from bitter repairman Jans to aloof scientist Jans and all the many glittering gradations of Jan that lurk betwixt. The Jans have a hard time getting along, initially. The shared existential horror of everybody being a version of everybody else aside, they all represent each other’s roads-not-taken, a premise that leaves ample room for resentment, envy and contempt. But jolly along they must, in order to operate the aforesaid rolling space station and escape the apocalyptic planet they’re stranded on. Assuming you make the right dialogue decisions as Jan Prime, and ensure each Jan’s material needs are met while upgrading and expanding the station, this practical objective will produce a growing closeness, punctuated by swirly notifications about changes of emotional state, which feels like one big, baroque metaphor for a guy making peace with his own past and warring urges. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/5_DLKABC0.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>11 bit</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It’s both a fun narrative setup and the makings of a production nightmare, to say nothing of the presumably enormous strain placed upon the vocal chords and mental coherence of Jan’s sole voice actor, Alex Jordan. There’s the intricacy of each Jan’s personality in itself, and then there’s the problem of writing up all their interactions, and how they might develop in response to each other - depending on which Jans the player decides to spawn in whatever order. 11 bit have managed this potential for overwhelming complexity by, firstly, only giving you charge of one Jan, the primary Jan who gets to sleep in the captain’s bedroom at the base’s heart, and secondly, by firmly resisting the temptation to do a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eD-dHzGmS4">Flanders family reunion</a> and conjure up a Jan for every genre or season. There are, as far as I can tell, no Janpunks, Cowboy Jans, Jan 3000 BC’s or other Expanded Janiverse misadventures in The Alters. 11 bit has limited the population carefully to keep the quality up and suit the particular narrative dilemmas they want to explore.
</p>
<p>
“We had the idea of what are the most important problems or maybe decisions that players can relate to, and built upon that was the decision of how many Alters do we want to have,” lead designer Rafal Wlosek told me. “We want to have enough Alters to talk about all those things, but not too many, so we wouldn't drown in in writing the shallow stories. So there are more Alters hidden [in the game] then you can find in one playthrough, but just enough for us to get deep into each type of decision and where they came from - what type of person will he become? What will he decide to believe in? How does it work for him in his life, for the people around him?”
</p>
<p>
Looking beyond the tension between multiversal storytelling and project management, the idea of duplicating somebody by reaching into their backstory and yanking levers has a certain amount of overlap with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">current discussions about generative AI</a> and its questionably legal and often intrusive reuse of data shared online. Jan is not the architect of the quantum computer – he is shocked to discover that it is loaded with his entire life history, with one character noting that he probably should have read the small print on his mining contract. 11 bit had a booth at their Alters hands-on event where journos could chat to AI-generated characters. When I asked Wlosek about this, however, he insisted that The Alters isn’t designed to offer “food for thought” on AI.
</p>
<p>
“There was a time when we were discussing the idea of an AI being part of the quantum computer - maybe creating a character out of this machine,” he said. “But we wanted to focus on one topic at a time. And we didn't want to, you know, put the spotlight on too many different aspects of sci-fi.” To be clear, the quantum computer AI would have been a written character, not a piece of text-generating software. “I think it was [conceived] before GPT showed up to the general public,” Wlosek added. “Personally, of course, I'm very interested in how things are going in this area. This is something that probably everyone who knows what's going on is interested in, and will be watching closely, but it’s not in this game.”
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/4_QLN03F1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>11 bit</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Among the broader strokes that differentiate one Jan from another is romantic history. Jan Prime has signed up for offworld mining duty partly because he’s broken up with his wife, who plays an active role nonetheless in the plot. One of the other Jans is from a Janiverse where his wife has died, and is naturally frantic to discover that she’s still alive in Jan Prime’s continuity. The topic of lovelives, together with the conspicuously cramped confines of the rolling space base and the emphasis on building a rapport with other Jans, got me wondering just how far Jan’s evident enormous self-absorption might go. Is it possible for Jans to romance other Jans? And with a view to getting ahead of the Rule34 crowd - can they bone?
</p>
<p>
“No they don’t,” Wlosek said, exactly 31 seconds later. “But it’s not like this topic is totally removed. The whole game or is about thinking about your decisions, about your life, going back to those decisions, if they were good or wrong, and dwelling on them, and maybe we want to show this from very different angles, to give the player the space to think about it. And in order to do that, we had to take a look at every aspect of life, so I guess that would be my general answer! It's not like having sex with the other Alters or anything like that, but the romantic relations of a couple of the Alters are very important, and not all of them are with women.”

			<p>Dragon Age Dreadwolf, the highly-anticipated next entry in the Dragon Age series, is said to be fully revealed later this week.</p>
<p>That's what Insider-Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-we-see-dragon-age-dreadwolf-at-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> based on insider reports. Although the outlet isn't entirely sure during which planned showcase Bioware's title will be revealed, it's likely that it will happen during Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest event later this week. "According to insider reports, which we’re working to corroborate, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will receive a full reveal this week, likely during Summer Game Fest", the outlet writes. "Whether it happens during the Summer Game Fest Showcase, Xbox Games Showcase, or elsewhere, however, remains to be seen."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-devs-pretty-confident-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> back in March of this year, the team behind Dreadwolf as well as publisher EA seemingly have been expressing to be pretty confident that the game will launch later this year, and that a reveal during the summer is likely. "<em>I suspect [Dragon Age] will probably pop up this summer", </em>Journalist Jeff Grubb wrote back in March<em>. "I don't know exactly when it will be shown is the real answer. I assume it will be shown sometime this summer, could happen at any time though. It will be released this year, last I heard. They're pretty confident about that. Doesn't mean it's a guarantee, could slip, but right now, internally, they expect to release it later this year.”</em></p>
<p>Earlier this month, Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-has-everyone-at-bioware-really-happy-with-how-it-turned-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also said</a> that the development team behind Dreadwolf is really happy with how the game has turned out. "<em>And they should have all of the details for that thing because everyone seems really happy with that game; they're pretty pleased with how it turned out", </em>Grubb said earlier this month<em>. "The plan is to launch that this calendar year, so not EA's fiscal year, not before March 2025 or anything like that, this year. And I don't think you're going to have to wait too long after this thing gets announced to play it."</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age Dreadwolf is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. We'll update you as soon as more information about the title comes in.</p>

<p>XDefiant’s first season update will reportedly introduce a Capture the Flag mode to the game.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/xdefiant-leaker-claims-capture-the-flag-mode-will-arrive-in-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, datamined information has revealed some interesting details for XDefiant’s Season 1 update. Through a now-deleted post by X user <a href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1796702849792967131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rogue TX</a>, the dataminer revealed that Ubisoft will introduce a new game mode in its Season 1 update.</p><p>The game mode in question is Capture the Flag, which we have seen primarily in games like Call of Duty, Team Fortress 2, Halo Infinite, Overwatch, and more as a staple gamemode. Of course, players should take this information with a grain of salt as it does not come from an official source, but as the account has seemingly been copyright stricken by Ubisoft, it does have some credibility. </p></div>

<div><p>Capture the Flag is a game mode that most multiplayer shooter veterans are well-versed with. The mode is simple, where players aim to capture the enemy team’s flag and bring it back to their base to score a point. The team with the most points at the end of the match or round wins the game – Simple!</p><p>At the moment, XDefiant has five game modes to explore: Occupy, Domination, Zone Control, Escort, and Hotshot. Adding Capture the Flag as a six-game mode will surely be a worthy addition to the game and could be a great addition to its future competitive scene.</p></div>



<p>Xdefiant is a free-to-play, first-person, multiplayer shooter by Ubisoft that has taken the world by storm. The game has been out for a little over two weeks now and has managed to gather more than 8 million unique players in that time. The game recently released its Y1S0.2 patch, which included fixes for Social features and other miscellaneous issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to a Capture the Flag mode in Xdefiant? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="183" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">New weapons always dominate the <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> meta at launch, but players have already had enough of Season 4’s Kar98k sniper rifle, and are begging Sledgehammer to nerf it. </p> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">Season 4 has already seen <em>CoD</em> fans complain about <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-players-are-sick-of-old-guns-getting-nerfed-into-the-ground-every-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sledgehammer making old guns useless</a>, but the other side of that coin is that when they drop a new weapon, it’s often so powerful that it becomes the game’s most picked gun and is far too powerful. </p> <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true">That’s the opinion that many have of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kar98k-loadout-in-mw3-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kar98k</a> right now, with riversub calling the weapon “a menace” and “the definition of overpowered” on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareIII/comments/1d8eow2/kar98_needs_a_nerf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>A welcome return. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">“Yep, one-tap weapons should be high risk, high reward, but nearly all of them in this game aren’t,” agreed Grand-Article4214. “There are barely any risks for snipers, especially since they aren’t balanced to 150 health compared to every other gun in the game.”</p>
 <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="524" data-injectable="true">Icy-Computer7556 explained that they feel the gun has “ridiculous aim assist,” stating: “Anything with one-shot potential close or far should instantly be aim assist free. They did that in previous <em>CoD</em>s and it worked well. Skilled players kept sniping and sh*tters gave up because they realized they didn’t have the skill to just bloop everyone every second. I’m not saying I’m a good sniper, but the fact that it can slow down or pull on a gun like that? It’s f**king crazy.”</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">For some though, the idea of nerfing the Kar98k is pointless because something else will take its place, with conanwongmkii writing: “It’s either the Kar98k, the Wardens, or the MORS sniper. Pick your poison, you can’t escape it.”</p> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="false">Personally, I find the Kar98k to be unbelievable in other people’s hands, but in mine it feels like I get nothing but hitmarkers. I’ve never been a great sniper though, so it may be my fault. Still, getting one-shot killed over and over again by people running the Kar98k is infuriating, and I’d love to see some balancing changes too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dark-and-darker-adds-free-to-play-option-with-some-limitations/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During yesterday's OTK Games Expo, South Korean developer IRONMACE <a href="https://www.darkanddarker.com/news/54" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the availability of a free-to-play option for Dark and Darker.</p>
<p>Free-to-play accounts have certain limitations, as you would expected. Players taking advantage of the free access will only get to create one character and only be able to enter Normal modes, although there are no limitations regarding maps. The goal is obviously to get more players into Dark and Darker while also providing the option to upgrade later to 'Legendary' status. All players who purchased the Standard and Founders Edition will be automatically upgraded to Legendary Status, by the way, and premium players will also have exclusive access to the Shared Stash between their characters.</p>
<p>That's not all the news IRONMACE shared yesterday. The studio also discussed some of the changes coming with the upcoming season, which starts in a few days.</p>
<p><em>One of the big changes is the reduction in the power gap for items. We have now removed all ‘Junk’ and unnamed ‘Unique’ items. Named ‘Unique’ grade weapons still appear but they now share the same stats and rolls as their ‘Legendary’ counterpart with only difference being the addition of their unique passive. We have also reduced the damage and armor rating values for all weapons and equipment at the upper end to make them less overbearing. We have removed random modifiers that were too valuable such as the +all attribute rolls and have lowered and tightened the gap for the remaining rolls. We have also diminished the movement speed penalty gap on armors to reduce the heavy reliance on move speed. Finally, we have added a flat HP boost to all classes to slightly improve survivability in battles. Please note that many of the perks, skills spells, and class balance remain to be tuned with this new philosophy in mind and will be adjusted in the future.</em></p>

<p>Dark and Darker, you'll remember, is the fantasy extraction game that first debuted on Steam in early 2023. It enjoyed great success for a while, but NEXON quickly filed a DMCA and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-and-darker-removed-from-steam-due-to-dmca-takedown-issued-by-nexon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had it removed from the store,</a> alleging that IRONMACE employees developed the game using 'trade secrets' from NEXON's unreleased P3 project. The lawsuit in American court was eventually dismissed last year, and Dark and Darker will soon launch <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dark-and-darker-qa-c1e629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Epic Games Store</a>, but there's no confirmation regarding a return to Steam.</p>

Many reported being booted from campaign levels, missing out on crucial cutscenes and losing progress. Bungie tweeted progress updates as it worked to ease the problems, but for many players the night was a write-off.</p><p>On Steam, the user review rating for The Final Shape is, predictably, 'mostly negative'. "Best 40 bucks I ever spent and best two hours of my life... My favorite part was when Cayde said 'Destiny 2 servers are not available. Dismiss this message to try again,' " reads one review. "Today is a good day to collect all the error codes if you still haven't got them all," reads another.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Destiny 2: The Final Shape Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Now, Bungie has <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1798195541291188323" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to address the various problems. “Hey everyone, if connection issues have blocked you from playing or enjoying The Final Shape today, we want to apologize,” the Sony-owned studio said. “We’re hard at work trying to resolve each of these issues as quickly as possible, and many of the connection issues from this morning have already been fixed.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"If connection issues have blocked you from playing or enjoying The Final Shape today, we want to apologize.</p></div><p>Bungie has rolled out a number of restarts in a bid to tackle errors causing players to get kicked out of activities, which it said “remains our highest priority issue to resolve.” Those who missed a cutscene can replay the mission by accessing the Replayable Missions node in the middle of the Pale Heart map, Bungie advised. There are cutscenes at the end of Mission 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p><p>“We built The Final Shape to be an exciting, cathartic, story-driven adventure for everyone to enjoy,” Bungie continued. “We’re truly sorry if connection issues and instability is getting in the way of that experience, and we promise to keep working until these issues are resolved.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We built The Final Shape to be an exciting, cathartic, story-driven adventure for everyone to enjoy.

Destiny 2 Steam concurrent players peaked at an impressive 315,285, a figure high enough to make the top five most-played games on Valve’s platform. Microsoft and Sony do not provide player numbers for Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p>The Final Shape concludes Destiny’s overarching story by placing the player inside the Traveler in a face-off against the mysterious The Witness. It’s the culmination of 10 years of often bewildering Destiny storytelling, and has left fans wondering what’s next. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-cryptic-tweets-spark-destiny-3-speculation-as-expansion-the-final-shape-launches">Some are speculating Bungie has Destiny 3 up its sleeve</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

        <p>Bespoke Pixel has raised $25 million in funding</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>A new development studio has launched in Barcelona, led by games veteran David Polfeldt.</p>
<p>Called Bespoke Pixel, the studio is currently in the process of assembling its core team, and has raised $25 million in funding as reported by <a href="https://venturebeat.com/gaming-business/david-polfeldt-opens-bespoke-pixel-game-studio-in-barcelona/">GamesBeat</a>.</p>
<p>Polfeldt previously worked at Ubisoft's Massive Entertainment for 17 years in various leadership roles, the longest serving as managing director from 2008 to 2021.</p>
<p>He was involved with franchises including The Division, Avatar, Far Cry 3, and Assassin's Creed Revelations.</p>
<p>Polfeldt left Massive in 2022 to work as a strategic advisor for PlayerUnknown and Disney before co-founding Bespoke Pixel.</p>
<p>"The opening of Bespoke Pixel in Barcelona reflects our confidence in the local gaming industry, as well as the city's supportive infrastructure" said Polfeldt. "As a newcomer, we hope to add a new dimension to Barcelona's incredibly rich cultural heritage."</p>
<p>He added: "We aim to create original intellectual property focused on refined and well-crafted gameplay. We are forming a small and agile team, initially dedicated to prototype development. We will harness the extensive experience of the core team to deliver top-tier gaming experiences."</p>

			<p>Two and a half years after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/notorious-studios-founded-by-ex-wow-devs-wants-to-build-the-next-chapter-of-core-fantasy-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project's announcement</a>, Notorious Studios unveiled its debut game, Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery, during yesterday's OTK Games Expo.</p>
<p>The studio was founded by several former members of the World of Warcraft team. However, this is no MMO. Instead, it sounds more like an extraction action RPG set in a fantasy world. In the official FAQ listed on the game's website, Notorious Studios explained:</p>
<p><em>The vision of Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery is to be the ultimate world PvPvE game. Players can embark on adventures either solo or with up to two other friends in open-world maps for up to 24 players. The objective is to kill players and monsters, loot, and get back safely to town.</em></p>
<p><em>Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery features full loot PvP, PvE encounters, RPG fantasy classes, and modern third-person action-based combat. The game is session-based with persistent progression. Although it has some elements commonly found in MMORPGs, like crafting, character customization, classes, and open world maps, we do not classify our game as an MMO. </em></p>

<p>Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery will debut in late 2024 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344320/Legacy_Steel__Sorcery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam Early Access</a>, where it is expected to stay for at least twelve months. The Steam page also delves a bit more into the gameplay features.</p>
<p>Each class will have its own way of interacting with the environment. For example, Warriors can hurl boulders and charge through walls, whereas Priests are able to levitate.</p>
<p>In the safety of the town, players will need to improve their standing with vendors to unlock the best crafting options or just to get the NPCs to lower their prices. The players' homes can also be improved with better furnishings, which will have some kind of positive impact (likely a buff) on the characters. However, the developers also said major updates would sometimes reset progression, providing the community with a 'fresh start'.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/05/canyon-doublebee-gtws-2-gaming-earbuds-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Let’s start with the positives shall we? It’s not often that I have to launch straight into finding the best possible things to say due to the less than positive ones I’m going to be saying later, but in the case of the Doublebee GTWS-2, a gaming-focussed pair of wireless earbuds, it’s sadly unavoidable.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gaming Headset DoubleBee GTWS-2 by Canyon" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mlJrqYTTNes?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Doublebee gets its name thanks to its Bumblebee-styled visuals. Now, we’re talking Transformers Camaro more than fuzzy honey-making insectoids, so the case for the GTWS-2 looks like the bonnet of Michael Bay’s favourite yellow and black car. It’s certainly eye-catching, and for a certain type of gamer, it might prove irresistible.</p>


<p>Things become even more interesting when you open the case up via two gull-wing door-styled sections, revealing the earbuds, two glowing RGB strips and the case’s charge level via a numeric LCD display. I especially liked the charge indicator, as it lets you know exactly how much juice is left in the case before you have to charge it up, rather than the vague, non-existent indicators you’ll find elsewhere. You get around 4 hours of playback per full charge, which is solid, if a little on the short side, while the case bumps that up to 37 hours before you have to reach for the USB-C charging cable.</p>
<p>The earbuds carry on the yellow and black theme, with an RGB indicator built into each side to indicate battery levels and connection. They’re smooth and wholly formed out of plastic, much like early Airpods, but without silicon or foam earbud tips you can’t get a perfect, or gentle, seal. However, they’re also rock solid, and won’t discolour or break as they age.</p>


<p>There are onboard touch controls, allowing you to pause and play, move back and forth through audio tracks, and make incremental volume changes via a triple press on either earbud. It’s a simple enough system, and the responsiveness is good, though the triple press for volume changes can become exhausting if you’re making big alterations.</p>
<p>The Canyon Doublebee GTWS-2 is budget-focussed, and at its sub-£30 price point there are very few gaming earbuds at this price, especially ones that can match the build quality and aesthetics. Unfortunately, that’s where the positives stop.</p>
<p>The audio from the Doublebee GTWS-2 is fatally flawed, with the worst bass response I’ve heard from any headset or earbud I’ve reviewed in the past five years. There’s no control, and anything remotely close to being a bottom-end tone clips and squelches in a frankly unlistenable manner. I was so surprised to experience this that I requested a second review unit, thinking that the original was broken, but as it turns out, this is how the earbuds are being shipped.</p>

<p>There is a very specific use case for the Doublebee, and that’s in an FPS or battle royale where you’re focussing on the top-end details of footsteps and gunfire to help locate your foes. It works well enough here – I played a few rounds of Overwatch 2 and the location of enemies was clear enough, but then the music between rounds sounded truly awful, bringing the experience crashing back down.</p>
<p>In this day and age, where audio performance from budget headsets is getting closer and closer to that offered by the bigger manufacturers, I simply don’t understand what’s gone wrong during the Doublebee GTWS-2’s audio design and testing. It’s a real shame when clear effort has been put into various other aspects of its construction.</p>

<p>This summer, a major update is being released on all platforms for Hogwarts Legacy, one of the best-selling games of 2023. The shining gem at the heart of the update is the new photo mode, which will allow players to capture their Wizarding World-based adventures like never before. It’s an advanced offering, boasting a range of filters, character poses, and the ability to change the time of day and even the season, impacting the weather and scenery in the shot.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-for-hogwarts">More for Hogwarts</h2>



<p>Hogwarts Legacy proved to be a stellar title when it was released in February 2023. It took over social and streaming platforms with ease and topped charts worldwide, before doing it all over again when it landed on further platforms as the year unravelled. In Hogwarts Legacy, players undertake a vast adventure that takes them in and around Hogwarts, Hogsmeade, and the surrounding map – the Forbidden Forest, for instance, is widely explorable.</p>



<p>Here’s the video-based breakdown of this update:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hogwarts Legacy - Summer Update Explainer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i1n0iSq1byw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>On June 6, this super-sized update will be released on all platforms, with WB Games promoting a social media campaign encouraging users to share their screenshots taken in photomode with the hashtag #CaptureTheUnwritten.</p>



<p>Fans are still asking for plenty of features to be added to Hogwarts Legacy, and more still are begging WB Games to produce some kind of DLC for the game, but at present, there’s no indication that’s on the cards. </p>

<p>Behaviour Interactive has revealed that up to 95 employees will be laid off amid ‘strategic changes’ to the company’s operating model. This news comes mere months after a wave of redundancies saw 40 workers lose their jobs at the firm. In a press release, Behaviour’s representatives confirmed that a driving reason for these layoffs is the ‘unprecedented competition’ running through the gaming industry at present.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-beginning-the-next-phase">Beginning the Next Phase</h2>



<p>A statement published to recognise the layoffs was written by Behaviour Interactive:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Within this challenging context, Behaviour has renewed its focus on its historical strengths. These include the company’s leading position in horror gaming, its production expertise, and its thirty-year history of providing exceptional service to its development partners.</p>



<p>To pursue this clarified vision, Behaviour will implement multiple strategic changes to its corporate structure, improving the distinction between its product, production, business development, and marketing resources. As a result of these changes, the company will reduce its team by up to 95 employees, 70 of whom are based in Montreal.</p>



<p>While changes to our structure and strategic vision have led to challenging decisions, we are confident that these decisions will position us for continued success. As we begin the next phase of Behaviour’s growth, our commitment to excellence in our products and workplace culture remains steadfast.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is the second time in as many days that a Montreal-based studio has been hit with this kind of action. On June 3, Avalanche Studios (Just Cause) confirmed that it would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avalanche-layoffs-and-studio-closures/">closing a studio in Montreal</a>, leading to the laying off of employees at the office. </p>



<p>It was further confirmed that Dead by Daylight’s live-service development won’t be impacted by these layoffs, and that ongoing projects remain ‘business as usual’. That means that the spin-off title, The Casting of Frank Stone, won’t be affected by this round of redundancies.</p>

<p>Warhorse Studios has released a new deep-dive into Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, showcasing how the grand and regal reveal was pieced together at the start of 2024. In April, Warhorse lifted the lid on KCD2, unveiling an ambitious follow-on from the 2018 title that turned heads after surfacing as a Kickstarter-backed product built by a small but passionate team.</p>



<p>This year’s reveal of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 showed just how far things have progressed. With a cinematic and stunning video, Warhorse Studios filled the hearts of fans of the franchise with a fresh sense of anticipation for this upcoming open-world RPG title.</p>

<h2 id="h-kcd-bts">KCD BTS</h2>



<p>In the new making-of video, Warhorse’s marketing team explores the unique reveal of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, covering everything from the seeds of the project to the ultimate delivery. It’s a telling walkthrough of the magic that went into this stellar reveal, which transcended being ‘just a new trailer’ and lodged itself firmly in the memory of fans worldwide.</p>



<p>Here’s the new making-of video:</p>

<p>Recently, I had the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">opportunity to catch up with Tom McKay</a>, the actor behind Henry of Skalitz, the main character in 2018’s Kingdom Come: Deliverance <strong>and </strong>the frontman for the follow-up title, which is due to be released later this year.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 follows directly from the end of the first title, plunging players into an expansive and detailed map and leaving them to their own devices. With a multi-angled story, survival mechanics, thousands of dialogue options, and some of the most intense combat in gaming history, Kingdom Come presents the ultimate medieval adventure for any player. </p>

<p>In a new trailer, Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded was revealed as being a Meta Quest 3-exclusive title, dropping this summer and being dubbed an ‘unparalleled, untethered, and unrivalled VR experience.’ It has been pieced together by XR Games, a UK-based studio that has worked on the likes of Zombie Army VR and Jurassic World Aftermath.</p>



<p>However, fans of the franchise were quick to criticise the announcement, as shown in the comments section under the freshly posted trailer. There are widespread issues with the PC version of Hitman 3 VR that gamers have been reporting for some time, and the consensus is that Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded should have also been ported to PSVR2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-becoming-47">Becoming 47</h2>



<p>Following the release of the new trailer for Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded, pre-orders for the game went live with a limited-time discount of 10% on the listed price. According to XR Games, several key improvements have been made to Hitman 3 VR to warrant this ‘Reloaded’ tag:</p>



<ul>
<li>Introduction of dual-wielding</li>



<li>Fresh cel-shaded art style</li>



<li>Overhauled UI</li>



<li>Improved movement mechanics</li>



<li>Visual enhancements</li>



<li>Refined gameplay mechanics</li>
</ul>



<p>Since being released a few years back, the original VR version of Hitman 3 has been plagued with a series of issues. Despite that, the game was nominated for awards – and won VR Game of the Year at the Steam Awards in 2022. Online, there’s a whole different sentiment surrounding the game, and the review rating on Steam currently sits at ‘Mostly Negative’.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for the new Reloaded version of the game:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="HITMAN 3 VR: Reloaded - Announcement trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCpv3XuxTL8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The hope would have been that the Reloaded edition could have placated the masses, but now that it has been locked to Meta Quest 3, more consumers than ever are feeling pushed out of the circle. </p>

<p>To access any of the PlayStation Plus games for June 2024, you simply need to head over to the PlayStation Store (or PS Plus) section of your console home menu to find them. Here, you can either download them directly, or add them to your library for later. We always recommend adding any games to your library, even if you don’t fancy playing them at the moment – if you don’t, you’ll lose access when the next rotation of “free” games arrives next month!</p>
<h2>What are the PS Plus June 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three&nbsp;games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, 4th June.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</strong></li>
<li><strong>AEW Fight Forever</strong></li>
<li><strong>Streets of Rage 4</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Streets of Rage 4 is a modern classic, for side-scrolling beat ’em up fans. Published by DotEmu, whose reputation for retro revivals was already well established, it was another big success story. In our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">9/10 Streets of Rage 4 review</a>, Aran said, “The fighting is great, the visuals are great, and the soundtrack is great. Lizardcube and Guard Crush have managed to capture the essence of those classic games and upgrade it for the modern age.</p>
<p>The same can’t really be said of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/07/aew-fight-forever-review/">AEW Fight Forever</a>, which thoroughly disappointed our resident wrestling head, Ade. So let’s move right along.</p>
<p>Rounding things out, SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake was a solid if unremarkable new platformer based on the incredibly popular cartoon series. “SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is a decent 3D platformer filled with all the SpongeBob humour you’d expect, but it feels like a step back when compared to the far more imaginative Battle for Bikini Bottom: Reheydrated,” Steve said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/30/spongebob-squarepants-the-cosmic-shake-review/">in our review</a>.</p>

<p><em>What do you think of this month’s games, and what are your predictions for July’s game selection?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-maintenance-when-will-the-servers-come-back/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ea-fc-24-maintenance-when-will-the-servers-come-back<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="81" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">EA Sports has announced an <em>EA FC 24</em> maintenance, which will take place on June 5.</p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">This maintenance comes at a time when the Ultimate TOTS promo is still active in the Ultimate Team mode. However, EA Sports has some big plans for the upcoming weeks, and this server update might be in preparation for that. Among other possible content going live in the future, a separate Euro 2024 tournament is also expected by the fans. But before that, the community will have to bear with the upcoming update.</p>
 <h2 id="h-when-will-the-ea-fc-24-maintenance-june-5-begin" data-injectable="false">When will the EA FC 24 maintenance (June 5) begin?</h2> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">EA Sports has officially announced details of the upcoming maintenance on the game’s official X account. According to that post, the servers will be taken down at <strong>8 a.m. UTC/1 a.m. PDT/4 a.m. ET</strong>, and matchmaking across all game modes will be stopped 30 minutes prior to that.</p> <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">This maintenance will apply to the game across all platforms. However, only <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/should-you-turn-off-crossplay-in-ea-fc-24/">EA FC 24</a></em> will be impacted by this update, so those of you still playing older releases like <em>FIFA 23</em> can continue to play without any worry.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We have a maintenance coming up on June 5, 08:00 to 14:00 UTC. During this time, you may be disconnected or unable to access online services.</p><p>Match creation will be disabled 30 min before the maintenance.</p><p>Title impacted: EA SPORTS FC 24 on all platforms.</p></div>— EA SPORTS FC Direct Communication (@EASFCDirect) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASFCDirect/status/1798220581671940266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <h2 id="h-when-will-the-ea-fc-24-maintenance-june-5-end" data-injectable="false">When will the EA FC 24 maintenance (June 5) end?</h2> <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true">The servers will be restored once the maintenance is concluded. As per the available schedule, June 5’s maintenance will end at <strong>2 p.m. UTC/7 a.m.PDT/10 a.m. ET</strong>. If there are no more delays, the servers will be down for approximately six hours. This is certainly one of the longer server maintenance periods in recent times.</p>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">While the maintenance is live, players won’t be able to access game modes like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-91-tots-player-pick-sbc-solutions/">Ultimate Team</a>, which rely on online matchmaking. Career Mode will remain a playable option, as there’s no need for the internet to conduct matches.</p>

<p data-characters="204" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Clorinde is a 5-star Electro DPS character in <em>Genshin Impact</em> with unique Bond of Life mechanics. Once you’ve learned <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/?p=528421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to play Clorinde</a>, here are the best weapons and artifacts to maximize her damage.</p> <h2 id="h-clorinde-s-best-weapons-in-genshin-impact" data-injectable="false">Clorinde’s best weapons in Genshin Impact</h2> <h3 id="h-absolution" data-injectable="false">Absolution</h3> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">Absolution is Clorinde’s best weapon. As her signature 5-star Sword, its passive is tailor-made for her Bond of Life mechanics, and Clorinde should have no trouble keeping uptime on its buff. Still, the difference in damage between Absolution and the other 5-stars below is not wide enough to justify gambling on the weapon banner.</p> <figure data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HoYoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-light-of-foliar-incision-haran-geppaku-futsu" data-injectable="false">Light of Foliar Incision / Haran Geppaku Futsu</h3> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">Light of Foliar Incision and Haran Heppaku Futsu are good 5-star options if you don’t have Absolution. Their damage comes fairly close to her signature, since their passives are generally useful for Clorinde.</p> <h3 id="h-primordial-jade-cutter-uraku-misugiri" data-injectable="false">Primordial Jade Cutter / Uraku Misugiri</h3> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">PJC and Uraku Misugiri don’t perform quite as well as the options above, but they’re still quite strong on Clorinde. Other 5-star Swords like Splendor of Tranquil Waters or Mistsplitter Reforged will also work fine if you happen to have them.</p>
 <h3 id="h-the-black-sword-finale-of-the-deep" data-injectable="false">The Black Sword / Finale of the Deep</h3> <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">Black Sword and Finale of the Deep are the 4-star options for Clorinde. With Refinements, Black Sword can be competitive with the 5-stars above. Finale of the Deep is the Fontaine craftable weapon, and I recommend Refining it if possible.</p> <h2 id="h-artifact-sets-for-clorinde-in-genshin-impact" data-injectable="false">Artifact sets for Clorinde in Genshin Impact</h2> <h3 id="h-4pc-fragment-of-harmonic-whimsy" data-injectable="false">4pc Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy</h3> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">Since Clorinde has Bond of Life built into her kit, she synergizes well with 4pc Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy. If you’re farming from scratch, though, you may want to consider the sets below. They’re almost as good in the right circumstances, and they may be more efficient to farm.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Genshin Impact on Twitter</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-4pc-thundering-fury" data-injectable="false">4pc Thundering Fury</h3> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">4pc Thundering Fury can reduce Clorinde’s Skill cooldown, possibly allowing for shorter or more flexible rotations. Whether this is worth it really depends on your team. At best, Thundering Fury performs similarly to Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy. At worst, if you don’t use the reduced Skill cooldown, it’s roughly on par with Gladiator’s Finale.</p>
 <h3 id="h-4pc-gladiator-s-finale" data-injectable="false">4pc Gladiator’s Finale</h3> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">If neither of the above sets appeal to you, 4pc Gladiator’s Finale is a good alternative. While its damage potential is not as high, it’s very consistent, and you don’t need to worry about optimizing Clorinde’s team to make good use of her build.</p> <h2 id="h-artifact-stats-to-prioritize-for-clorinde" data-injectable="false">Artifact stats to prioritize for Clorinde</h2> <figure data-found-rows="2" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sands</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Goblet</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Circlet</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">ATK<br>Elemental Mastery</td><td data-align="center">Electro DMG</td><td data-align="center">CRIT Rate/DMG</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="183" data-injectable="false">Clorinde does not rely on her Burst every rotation, so don’t worry about her Energy Recharge. Focus on offensive stats instead, like CRIT DMG, CRIT Rate, ATK, and Elemental Mastery.</p> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">Pick a CRIT circlet that brings your CRIT Rate:CRIT DMG ratio closer to 1:2. This will primarily be determined by your weapon; if using a CRIT Rate weapon, try to use a CRIT DMG circlet and vice versa.</p>

<p data-characters="311" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It should come as no big surprise that <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is shifting the game’s whole Power Level system around by a fair margin. Broadly, <em>The Final Shape</em> represents a streamlining of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/before-the-final-shape-gets-here-lets-rank-every-destiny-2-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Destiny</em>‘s core Power system</a> to make things easier to understand, and it’s extremely promising stuff.</p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">Bungie’s goal for <em>The Final Shape</em> has been to simplify <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s Power system and make it way more flexible than it’s ever been before. Players should therefore find it much easier to keep up with the game without excessive farming, all the while still enjoying the classic <em>Destiny</em> Power grind if they choose to do so. Here’s how it all works!</p>  <figure data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-destiny-2-the-final-shape-s-power-level-explained" data-injectable="false">Destiny 2: The Final Shape’s Power Level explained</h2> <p data-characters="554" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">“In The Final Shape, playing with friends will be easier than ever, no matter if you play every day, haven’t played in years, or are trying Destiny 2 for the first time,” Bungie promised in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/this_week_in_destiny_04_25_24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent blog post</a>. The whole Guardian fireteam will be assigned a Power delta relative to the squad’s Power Leader (i.e. the Guardian with the highest Power level), which will then affect activity difficulty. The given activity’s rewards, on the other hand, will be handed out based on your Guardian’s actual, personal Power level.</p>
 <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="208" data-injectable="false">Right off the bat, this ensures a level playing field across the board that still allows for personal Power progression for each player. There are many other fascinating tidbits to take into account, however!</p> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="true">On top of using the new Fireteam Power level to dictate a given activity’s difficulty, the new system also means that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-can-you-get-your-old-sunset-guns-back-after-the-final-shape-comes-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our old, previously sunset gear and weapons are relevant once again</a>. This is, in all likelihood, the biggest boon for veteran Guardians, though it’s also obviously a point of contention for those of us who might’ve deleted sunset items in the past.</p>
 <h3 id="h-power-enabled-power-disabled-activities" data-injectable="false">Power Enabled/Power Disabled activities</h3> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">All the <em>Destiny 2</em> activities present in <em>The Final Shape</em> will be either Power Enabled or Power Disabled, too. This means that Disabled activities will be freely accessible without any need for targeted Power grinding: “Increasing your Power won’t change the difficulty you experience, and you can’t over-level the enemies in these activities,” Bungie explained.</p> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="706" data-injectable="true">On the other hand, Enabled activities will come with the usual suite of Power caps allowing Guardians to improve their effectiveness in them through long-term Power grinding: “Enemies will have a set feel for how tough they are even at the cap, but you will notice yourself getting stronger as your Power level grows.”</p>
 <p data-characters="94" data-current-count="94" data-injectable="false">Here’s the list of new Power-enabled difficulties as of <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s release:</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false"> <li>Standard – 1945 (Vanguard Ops, seasonal activities, Exotic missions, Raids, Dungeons)</li> <li>Advanced (Hero) – 1995 (Nightfalls)</li> <li>Expert (Legend) – 2005 (Nightfalls, Lost Sectors, seasonal activities, Exotic missions)</li> <li>Master – 2010 (Nightfalls, Lost Sectors, Raids, Dungeons)</li> <li>Grandmaster – 2020 (Nightfalls)</li> <li>Contest Mode – 1965 (Raids)</li> </ul> <h3 id="h-auxiliary-power-levels-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape" data-injectable="false">Auxiliary Power levels in Destiny 2: The Final Shape</h3> <p data-characters="658" data-current-count="992" data-injectable="true">As always, Guardians will also have the opportunity to further increase their Power level through auxiliary features, such as the Artifact level. This will remain the same as it’s ever been, from the looks of it, but as <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s seasonal model is changing to accomodate longer seasons and progression systems, so too will the whole thing be slightly slowed down, judging by what Bungie’s said on the matter: “Our goals for the rebalance were that actively engaged players could attain similar Artifact levels achieved by the end of an Episode and that Artifact Power remains a rewarding pursuit throughout,” Bungie explained.</p>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">Note, too, that Bungie is introducing the account-wide Power level with <em>The Final Shape</em>, which is essentially a baseline Power level that is applied across all of your different Guardian characters. This makes switching between Guardians way more easy and user-friendly, making cross-character progression that much more valuable for experienced players.</p> <h3 id="h-new-power-bands-for-destiny-2-the-final-shape" data-injectable="false">New Power bands for Destiny 2: The Final Shape</h3> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true">On top of all of the exciting changes outlined above, we are still getting a fairly significant Power band boost to bring everyone up to the same competitive level across the board. Here’s the full array of all of <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s Power bands, as <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/this_week_in_destiny_04_25_24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced by Bungie</a> itself:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Baseline Power floor – 1900</li> <li>Soft Power cap – 1940</li> <li>Powerful cap – 1990</li> <li>Pinnacle cap – 2000</li> </ul> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">Nice and round numbers there. Provided, of course, you can reach the Pinnacle cap in the first place. The good news in that regard is that the Legendary Mode campaign of <em>The Final Shape</em> should set us up with a full 1960-tier set of gear, thus shortening the grind by a fair margin. Again, though, you gotta be able to wrap up the Legendary Mode campaign in the first place!</p>
