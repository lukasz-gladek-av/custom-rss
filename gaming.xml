			<p>This morning, Sony <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202507/25-0724E/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announ</a>ced in a press release that it has entered a strategic partnership with fellow Japanese entertainment conglomerate Bandai Namco. Sony agreed to acquire 16 million Bandai Namco shares for roughly 68 billion yen (around $465 million), gaining control of 2.5% of the company's total shares.</p>



<p>Nobuhiko Momoi, Executive Vice President at Bandai Namco Holdings Inc., said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>The Bandai Namco Group promotes an "IP axis strategy" that aims to maximize IP value by leveraging the appeal and worldview of IP, providing the optimal products and services at the optimal timing in the optimal regions. We are filled with excitement about the potential to create new entertainment by combining Sony Group's strengths and technological capabilities across various entertainment fields with Bandai Namco's IP axis strategy. Through this collaboration, we aim to connect with IP fans worldwide, co-create the future together, and realize our Purpose, "Fun for All into the Future," and Mid- to Long-term Vision, "Connect with Fans."</em></p>



<p>Toshimoto Mitomo, Chief Strategy Officer and Representative Corporate Executive Officer at Sony Group Corporation, added:</p>



<p><em>Through this partnership, we aim to co-create an array of content and experiences that exceed expectations and deliver Kando （emotion） to even more fans, alongside Bandai Namco Group, with its outstanding capacity for multidirectional expansion of diverse IP and deep connections with fans at real touchpoints, both domestically and internationally. By combining the strengths of both companies in the field of entertainment and unlocking the potential of compelling IP, we will further accelerate our efforts to maximize IP value and realize Sony's long-term vision, "Creative Entertainment Vision".</em></p>



<p>The press release mainly emphasizes that Sony will produce and distribute anime and 'other video content' based on Bandai Namco's intellectual properties. That said, the collaboration could extend to other areas like games and music. Even so, it is highly unlikely that Bandai Namco's games will become exclusive to PlayStation consoles, especially given the minuscule share percentage.</p>



<p>In late 2024, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-becomes-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became</a> the largest shareholder of Kadokawa Corporation (the parent company of FromSoftware) with 10% shares. However, a few months ago Tencent also <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-has-increased-its-stake-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-edging-closer-to-sonys-share/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased its own shares</a> up to nearly 8%, almost as much as Sony.</p>

                <p>Retro gaming fans might have to make a difficult choice soon, as ModRetro has revealed that its modern-day tribute to the Nintendo 64 console will cost $200. First teased last year, this could make it a viable alternative to the Analogue 3D, which costs $250.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/palmerluckey/status/1948186521737302455" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>ModRetro's newest product is M64.

Inflation isn't nostalgic. <a href="https://t.co/LYDyiBBx2O" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/LYDyiBBx2O</a></p></div>  — Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) <a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1948186521737302455?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analogue-3d-delayed-to-late-august-due-to-tariffs/1100-6533190/" data-ref-id="1100-6533190">Like the Analogue 3D</a>, the M64 is also an FPGA console that aims to replicate the experience of using an N64 at a hardware level. This is the same direction that ModRetro took for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-review-a-remarkable-recreation-of-the-game-boy-color/1100-6528473/" data-ref-id="1100-6528473">ModRetro Chromatic</a>, a well-designed Game Boy successor that combines several modern conveniences with an authentic handheld gaming experience that can easily run all of your original Game Boy cartridges. The handheld also feels great to use, thanks to all of the premium materials incorporated into its design.</p><p>Beyond that, ModRetro hasn't revealed any other details regarding the M64. The teaser trailer posted by company founder Palmer Luckey does have a very blurry tease of the device--and a "do not open until Christmas" message--and it looks like it'll sport a grey color scheme. The video also suggests that you'll be able to use your original N64 cartridges, and it'll be interesting to see if it has any of the other modern features built into the Chromatic, like native video streaming and multiplayer support.</p><p>FPGA consoles like this are generally seen as the best option for enthusiasts, due to them being able to play these games in HD via HDMI on a modern television. The Analogue 3D can do this in 4K, and it offers a variety of filters to make the experience look like you're playing on a CRT TV, so it'll be interesting to see if the M64 can offer a similar experience.</p><p>If you're a bigger fan of Nintendo's handheld gaming age, you can order the ModRetro Chromatic right now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-is-back-in-stock-and-available-in-new-colors/1100-6533058/" data-ref-id="1100-6533058">as new stock has arrived</a> and it's also available in several new colors.</p>

<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9013bbde981f0/hyrule-warriors.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Koei Tecmo unveiled its new Musou game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> earlier this year for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>If you're wondering how development is tracking, the latest update is the Switch 2 title has just been rated by the classification board in Brazil.</p>
<p>This information comes from <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/23/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-has-now-been-rated-in-brazil/">Universo Nintendo (via My Nintendo News)</a>, with the outlet suggesting an update about this game could be coming very soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The game here was rated "over 12 years old", despite Nintendo's request that it be classified as "over 10"."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The previous title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> was rated 'T' for 'Teen' and contained fantasy violence along with in-game purchases.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo, this follow-up is scheduled to arrive "this winter" although some official online pages currently list 'TBD'.</p>
<p>As previously revealed, this game will take place <em>before</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> and is set to feature the classic 'Warriors' gameplay. Here's a bit extra about it from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em></strong> is the newest title in the Hyrule Warriors series and is developed by Koei-Tecmo Games with support from Nintendo. The game features epic battles against hordes of enemies as it tells the untold story from Hyrule's distant past of the Imprisoning War that ultimately led to the events of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em><em>. Fans of the Legend of Zelda series and players of both</em> <em>The Legend of Zelda:</em> <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> can experience the thrill of battle and this canonical tale featuring Princess Zelda, King Rauru, and other familiar characters. Fight for Hyrule’s future when <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> comes to Nintendo Switch 2 this winter."</p>

If you're still not sure whether or not to upgrade your existing copy, or if it's worth finally taking a look at the latest entry, this might help you decide. So, first up, our review – we gave this upgraded package an "excellent" <strong>9/10</strong> stars:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hozmri&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV gives an already fantastic party game a huge shot in the arm, with a bunch of brilliant Mouse Mode and mic-based games that also allow you to see your big silly face as you play. It's all very knockabout, very easy to use, and very easy to enjoy."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184958 @ 1753342557 -->
<p>What did other outlets have to say then? Starting the party with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review">IGN</a>, this outlet awarded the Switch 2 package <strong>7/10</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Super Mario Party Jamboree itself is still fantastic, but the mixed new content of the Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV re-release adds frustrating limitations and strange design decisions to what was otherwise a polished, customizable experience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/mario-party-jamboree-switch-2/">VGC</a> gave it <strong>4/5</strong> stars, noting how this upgrade elevates what's already one of the best series entries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By itself, then, Jamboree TV is a bit of an uneven expansion. However, Switch 2 does power some genuinely great new mini-games and, when it works (and if you own one), camera support does elevate the general experience, making this almost by default the definitive version of one of the best Mario Party games. Whether that’s worth the $20 / £17 upgrade, however, is very much dependent on your personal affection for the series."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/615084/super-mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-edition">Polygon</a> labelled it the Switch 2's best tech demo yet, even though it labelled the upgrade as "falling on the inessential side":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The upgrade winds up falling on the inessential side – especially since it misses a chance to add some new maps or characters – but the full package is one of the Switch 2’s smartest value propositions at present. <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> now stands as a robust party game that makes up for its shortcomings in sheer variety."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vooks.net/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review/">Vooks</a> scored it <strong>3/5</strong> stars, describing it as one for "superfans":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mario Party superfans will enjoy the new modes for the main board games, but the Jamboree TV additions—aside from the mouse games—are a bit average. <em>Jamboree</em> was a solid and complete package, and this just splits it all up and breaks the flow."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/review-super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-is-perfectly-fine/">Siliconera</a> said this update was "perfectly fine", awarding it <strong>8/10</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Super</em> <em>Mario Party Jamboree</em> remains a solid game... <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</em> is a natural pick-up for families. If someone is in a home with multiple players who own both Switch or Switch 2 systems, it could be great for game nights. However, if you’re going to go with one Switch or Switch 2 system for a group session or plan to play only online... you might be fine sticking with the original game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV launches this week on <strong>24th July 2025</strong>.</p>

After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339971/nintendo-game-boy-lego-release-date-october-2025">revealing this January</a> that it would take up the challenge, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=13923&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fgame-boy-72046" rel="sponsored">it has revealed</a> a most impressive take on the 1989 classic that’ll cost a relatively reasonable $60 in the US. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Game-Boy/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">It’s already up for pre-order today</a> for an October 1st ship date. At 3.5 inches (14cm) wide and 5.5 inches (9cm) tall, it looks like it’ll have almost as same dimensions as the original.</p></div><p>As you’ll see in the many images below, this Game Boy doesn’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters">rely on miniature hats</a> for its iconic fuchsia A and B buttons — Lego has seemingly created pitch-perfect buttons that appear to recess into the frame. The console’s curves are also captured remarkably well!</p><p>And unless I’m very much mistaken, it comes with <em>printed</em> tiles rather than sticker labels to help replicate the Game Boy’s many, many iconic labels for its buttons, volume dial, on-off switch, “Dot Matrix With Stereo Sound” highlight, as well as larger features like the Game Boy’s mono speaker grille, battery compartment latch, and serial number around back that have proven difficult to emulate in bricks. (That serial number has an easter egg, by the way.)</p><div><p><cite>GIF by The Verge / video by Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>But perhaps best of all, this Lego Game Boy can show off actual scenes from the classic games using swappable lenticular lenses that’ll show you different images when viewed from different angles. You can pop in a brick-built cartridge of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening </em>or <em>Super Mario Land</em>, and “watch” the classic Nintendo logo drop as you rotate the screen downwards (you’ll have to imagine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz2QPBkDkFc">the Game Boy’s da-DING beep</a>). Or, pop in a different lenticular lens to see Link cozy up to Marin on the beach in <em>Awakening</em>’s most bittersweet scene:</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24073412/i-built-that-lego-game-boy-and-now-its-even-better">I built Nick Lever’s fan-designed Lego Game Boy myself</a>, and have the real deal that plays actual cartridges too, but I’m going to be mighty tempted to pick up the official Lego one as well. If those buttons move when you push them, I doubt I’ll resist! Do wish it came with <em>Tetris</em>, too, though.</p><div><p>Lego and Nintendo have also recreated part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3eYc6dMOhw">the original US Game Boy commercial</a> using the set. It’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMeI3BwtTje/">on Instagram</a>, and you may be able to play it (with a tap) in its embedded form below.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712786/here-is-legos-official-nintendo-game-boy-with-lenticular-display]]></content:encoded>

The campaign itself is long and arduous, filled with numerous challenges that serve to test your skills. If you're patient, then you might just reach the game's conclusion.</p><h2>How long to beat Wuchang: Fallen Feathers - Campaign length guide</h2><p>If you're ready to dive straight into a dark fantasy adventure in Ming Dynasty China, then you need to allot enough time for the campaign. On average, it should take you <strong>roughly 25 to 35 hours</strong> to beat Wuchang: Fallen Feathers on your first try. Granted, this is primarily if you just focus on the main objectives, but we also take character deaths into consideration given the challenge presented by numerous bosses.</p><p>If you want to tackle optional content, then you might spend anywhere from <strong>40 to 50 hours</strong> as you explore every nook and cranny. Of course, there's also New Game+ mode, a staple among soulslike games, which further increases your playtime.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537178-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537178" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537178-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537178"></a><figcaption>Bosses like Commander Honglan will probably kick your butt and put an end to your speedrunning goals.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537178-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-1.jpg"></figure><h3>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers campaign structure</h3><p>As far as beating Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' campaign goes, you might be wondering about the structure or presentation itself. Here's a quick summary that's fairly light on spoilers:</p><ul><li>The initial area, Worship's Rise, consists of several sprawling areas. These include Reverent Temple, Shu Sanctum, Tang Palace, and various caverns and villages.</li><li>Upon finishing the key objectives, you can head to a junction point. One path leads to the snow-capped peaks of Cloudspire, while another takes you to the temples and pavilions of Mount Zhenwu.</li><li>Naturally, there are other locations, but we don't want to spoil you with all the details here.</li><li>All of these areas are crawling with insidious enemies and ferocious bosses. Needless to say, your speed of completion will depend on the viability of your build and weapons, as well as your overall skill when it comes to soulslike action.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537179-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537179" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537179-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537179"></a><figcaption>There are various areas to explore and some have hidden secrets, too.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537179-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-2.jpg"></figure><h3>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers additional objectives</h3><p>Generally speaking, progression normally entails defeating enemies/bosses, leveling up using Red Mercury, and buying/upgrading your gear. That said, there are other activities that you can tackle while you're exploring distant lands, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Manna Vase upgrades </strong>- You can find several items that boost your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-manna-vase-upgrades-forgotten-remembrance-lost-remains-guide/2900-6791/" data-ref-id="2900-6791"><strong>Manna Vase/healing flask</strong></a>.</li><li><strong>Armors and outfits</strong> - There are dozens of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-all-armors-costumes-outfits/2900-6793/" data-ref-id="2900-6793"><strong>armors and gear pieces</strong></a> to discover.</li><li><strong>Wu Gang items</strong> - You can gather valuables to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-wu-gang-items-guide/2900-6788/" data-ref-id="2900-6788"><strong>unlock new items for Wu Gang</strong></a>, a vendor NPC in your hub.</li><li><strong>Giant Panda Bamboo Shoots</strong> - Little <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-bamboo-shoots-panda-guide/2900-6794/" data-ref-id="2900-6794"><strong>Bamboo Shoots</strong></a> run around when they spot you.

<p>Following the LEGO Game Boy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/nintendo-and-lego-are-collaborating-on-a-new-game-boy-set">teaser earlier this year</a>, this new model building set has now been officially revealed.</p>
<p>It will be available for <strong>$59.99 USD</strong> (<em>or your regional equivalent</em>) and will be released on <strong>1st October 2025</strong>, with pre-orders now available on LEGO's website in select locations. Here's a video of this new set shared by Nintendo of America on social media:</p>

<p>This new kit is described as being a "scale of near 1:1" of the original Game Boy, and includes <strong>421 pieces</strong> in total. Additionally, it comes with "all the memorable features" including the control pad, 'A' and 'B' Buttons, and select and start. There are even details such as the contrast adjustment and volume dials.</p>
<p>To enhance the nostalgia, this set comes with insertable "brick-built" versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a> Game Paks. The display can also showcase different screens, including the "classic Nintendo start" screen.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6lutgri&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEHFv10kUS0" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

Well today, as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-san-diego-comic-con-2025">San Diego Comic-Con 2025,</a> we're back with an exclusive look at some of the first cards that will actually be a part of that Standard-legal set – and this cast of five spideys will surely look familiar to any <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse">Spider-Verse</a> fans out there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the slideshow below to see all five Spider-Man cards</strong>, as well as an alternate comic book art style for the titular webslinger himself.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering x Spider-Man - First Look at 5 New Cards</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering developer Wizards of the Coast <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-magic-the-gathering-crossover-reveal-card-spoilers">previously told IGN</a> that it wasn't limiting this set to a single comic run, and that's made quite clear with this early look. All five cards are different versions of Spider-Man depicted as legendary creatures: at Uncommon you have Spider-Man Noir and the robotic SP//dr piloted by Peni Parker, at Rare are Spider-Man 2099 and the delightfully goofy Spider-Ham, and finally at Mythic Rare is the man himself, Peter Parker, who flips over to become the Amazing Spider-Man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last card is especially interesting as it is double-sided. The front is simply Peter Parker, while the back is his Amazing Spider-Man alter ego, and you have some flexibility in how to cast him. Magic has had what are called "modal double-faced cards" before that allow you to cast either side from your hand, but this is the first I know of that <em>also</em> allows you to pay a cost to flip it while the front side is already in play - in this case, you can play Peter Parker for two mana, and then pay four more on a later turn to have him transform. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you do, you get access to his very flavorful ability called web-slinging, which allows you to pay just three mana to cast Legendary spells if you also return a tapped creature to your hand. This card is sure to be a popular leader in Magic's most popular format, Commander, as it will let you cheat all sorts of big and expensive legendary creatures into play far earlier than expected. And because this card will also be legal across Magic's regular competitive formats, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/185/ghalta-stampede-tyrant" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giant dinosaurs</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/120/valgavoth-terror-eater" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">terrifying demons</a> alike could be swinging onto the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the cast here is a clear nod to Sony's excellent Into the Spider-Verse animated films, only missing a take on Peter B. Parker and Spider-Gwen to complete the first movie's main cast (though there's plenty of time for those to potentially be revealed themselves before the set launches in September). But before you get too excited, this was almost definitely just a nod to their reveal as part of this year's Comic-Con, as these cards and this set in general are not actually tied to that series in any direct way. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel's Spider-Man x Magic: The Gathering - First Card and Packaging Reveal</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And while we may not have a second version of Peter to show here, we do have an alternate art treatment for this one – one that is sure to excite any comic book fans out there. This secondary version shows off what's called the "Iconic Moments" Booster Fun treatment for this set, and all of the cards that use it will feature art from the pages of Spider-Man's adventures. This first one is taken straight from the cover of 1963's The Amazing Spider-Man #1, complete with artist credits for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prolific-marvel-creator-jack-kirby-honored-by-new-york-city-with-two-streets-named-for-him">Jack Kirby</a> and Steve Ditko. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you happen to be in the San Diego area yourself, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3lu6j5n5puv2g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wizards of the Coast is hosting a Spider-Man event</a> at the Hard Rock Hotel where fans will be able to go hands-on with the set's Welcome Decks – smaller preconstructed decks themed around Spider-man that are meant to be an intro point for new players as they learn the ropes.

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Camera" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/80a6a2352b266/nintendo-switch-2-camera.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've just heard how around "1 in 3" Switch 2 owners <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/around-1-in-3-switch-2-owners-bought-new-pro-controller-despite-high-price-point-us">bought a new Pro Controller</a>, but how did other accessories like the official camera perform?</p>
<p>Game File has now been able to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/even-85-switch-2-controllers-just">provide some additional information</a>. Speaking to Circana's gaming analyst Mat Piscatella, it was noted how Nintendo's camera had a "mid-single digit percentage" attach rate with Switch 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Switch 2’s $55 official camera had a “mid-single digit percentage” attach rate with the Switch 2, Circana gaming analyst Mat Piscatella told Game File."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This was apparently "in line" with Piscatella expectations, but we don't know yet if it's matched Nintendo's forecast. As mentioned, though, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/reminder-you-can-use-non-nintendo-usb-cameras-with-switch-2">third-party cameras are also compatible</a> with the Switch 2 – so the official one isn't necessarily an essential purchase if you want to play games with this functionality, or participate in GameChat.</p>
<p>Nintendo launches <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a> next week, which adds new minigames utilising features such as the camera as well as mouse mode. If we get an update about the sales figures of Nintendo's camera accessory in this region or elsewhere, or find out more about its performance in general, we'll let you know.</p>

                <p>There's no shortage of open-world souls-like games these days, but Hell Is Us--which launches for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on <strong>September 4</strong>--puts a new twist on the action-RPG genre by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-hell-is-us-deep-dive-shows-you-how-the-developer-refuses-to-hold-your-hand/1100-6529941/" data-ref-id="1100-6529941">emphasizing immersive exploration</a>--there's no map, waypoints, or quest markers, so you'll need to learn the in-game environments to navigate the world.

"I'm leaning toward the former--this is a game filled with bold, confident, deliberate design decisions on the part of Rogue Factor, and it'll be interesting to see how players react when it releases September 4."</p><p>Several other games are available to preorder now, so if exploring a dystopian landscape while fighting for your life doesn't appeal to you, you can instead grab upcoming titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-legends-z-a-console-bundle/1100-6533331/" data-ref-id="1100-6533331">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-an-adorable-bluey-plush-with-this-amazon-exclusive-video-game-bundle/1100-6533134/" data-ref-id="1100-6533134">Bluey: The Video Game</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rds-game-traveler-deluxe-nintendo-switch-2-carrying-cases/1100-6532022/">Amazon Restocks The $40 Licensed Alternative To Switch 2 All-In-One Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Switch 2 At Amazon - Console Restocks, Every Accessory You Can Buy, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-retrospective-box-set-gets-nice-discount/1100-6530148/">God Of War 20th Anniversary Retrospective Box Set Gets Nice Discount</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-illustrated-book-is-only-30-at-amazon-right-now/1100-6533080/">Lord Of The Rings Tolkien Illustrated Book Is Only $30 At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-anime-blu-ray-best-amazon-deals/1100-6524954/">Berserk's Best Anime Adaptation Gets Limited-Time Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/adam-sandler-happy-gilmore-billy-madison-4k-blu-ray-editions-preorder-amazon/1100-6531820/">Happy Gilmore And Billy Madison 4K Blu-Ray Preorders Steeply Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdos-new-50-iphone-controller-is-officially-licensed-by-xbox/1100-6533127/">8BitDo's New $50 iPhone Controller Is Officially Licensed By Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/superman-2025-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-preorder-amazon/1100-6533111/">Superman 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Edition Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Elgato makes some of the most popular streaming equipment on the market, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-HD60-External-Capture-Card/dp/B09V1KJ3J4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Capture HD60 X</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Game-Capture-Neo-Passthrough/dp/B0CVYKQNFH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Capture Neo</a>--and not the company has announced a new entry to its capture card lineup, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero/dp/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elgato 4K S</a>, which is positioned as the company's new entry-level option. The new capture card supports PC and all major consoles--including PS5, Xbox Series X, and Switch 2--and is capable of capturing gameplay in up to 4K resolution at 60fps. If you're considering upgrading your streaming or gameplay capture setup, the Elgato 4K S is available now for $160 at Amazon.</p><div title="6533379 - Elgato 4K S" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3951" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6533379 - Elgato 4K S" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero/dp/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero\/dp\/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero/dp/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Elgato 4K S</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero/dp/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero\/dp\/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-External-Passthrough-Near-Zero/dp/B0FFTFYGLV?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$160</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>As stated above, this new capture card records gameplay at up to 4K 60fps. For comparison, the company's previous HD60 X could only record at 60fps in 1080p, dropping to 30fps for 4K footage--that should make for an appreciable upgrade for those upgrading to this new capture card. The Elgato 4K S features a USB-C port (5Gbps) and two HDMI 2.0 ports. Setup is just as easy as Elgato's other gadgets, requiring little more a USB-C and two HDMI cables to connect the card to your display, gameplay output source, and PC or recording device.</p>                      </div><p>Early reviews of the Elgato 4K S are overwhelmingly positive, with users noting its portable form factor, minimal input lag, and capture quality. So if you're a creator looking to make the jump to 4K content without breaking the bank, the Elgato 4K S certainly seems like it's worth a closer look.</p><p>While this is a leap over the HD60 X, the Elgato 4K S is not a replacement for the premium <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-4K-Ultra-Low-Streaming-Recording/dp/B0CPFWXMBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elgato 4K X</a> ($245), which is capable of capturing 4K footage at up to 144fps. The 4K X also offers a few additional bonuses, such as added HDR support, HDMI 2.1 ports, and 10Gbps USB-C ports. While most streamers will be just fine sticking with the 4K S's 4K 60fps capture quality, those who demand the highest quality will still find the 4K X the better option.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rds-game-traveler-deluxe-nintendo-switch-2-carrying-cases/1100-6532022/">Amazon Restocks The $40 Licensed Alternative To Switch 2 All-In-One Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Switch 2 At Amazon - Console Restocks, Every Accessory You Can Buy, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-retrospective-box-set-gets-nice-discount/1100-6530148/">God Of War 20th Anniversary Retrospective Box Set Gets Nice Discount</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-illustrated-book-is-only-30-at-amazon-right-now/1100-6533080/">Lord Of The Rings Tolkien Illustrated Book Is Only $30 At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-anime-blu-ray-best-amazon-deals/1100-6524954/">Berserk's Best Anime Adaptation Gets Limited-Time Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/adam-sandler-happy-gilmore-billy-madison-4k-blu-ray-editions-preorder-amazon/1100-6531820/">Happy Gilmore And Billy Madison 4K Blu-Ray Preorders Steeply Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdos-new-50-iphone-controller-is-officially-licensed-by-xbox/1100-6533127/">8BitDo's New $50 iPhone Controller Is Officially Licensed By Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/superman-2025-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-preorder-amazon/1100-6533111/">Superman 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Edition Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>The latest Pokémon Presents broadcast earlier this week gave trainers all-new details about the upcoming Switch and Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>This included the news about a new Switch 2 bundle and details about pre-order bonuses. Now, retailers in the US have shared some bonuses you can get if you decide to pre-order the physical copy ahead of the full release this October.</p>
<p>If you place a pre-order at Walmart, you can get an exclusive mystery pin pre-order bonus. As mentioned in the fine print, this offer begins this week and is available "while supplies last" and is limited to "one gift per purchase". The Switch 2 version here will set you back $69.00 and the Switch version is available for $59.88.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fpnsmhu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Apart from this offer, Best Buy is offering a "free gamer mat" with Pokémon Legends: Z–A pre-orders. According to the description, this mat can be used for playing the Pokémon Trading Card game or as a mouse pad.</p>
<p>This item will also be available in "limited quantities" and is available while supplies last. And if you've already pre-ordered, you'll also receive the gamer mat. The Switch 2 version here is $69.99 and the Switch version is priced at $59.99.</p>

<p>As already revealed by The Pokémon Company, trainers across the globe can also get an "early-purchase bonus" in the form of a Ralts holding a Gardevoirite stone as a gift. Additionally, the digital version early-purchase bonus includes "a gift of 100 Poké Balls" (both of these gifts are available to claim until <strong>February 28th, 2026</strong>).</p>

<p>Pre-orders for the new Nintendo Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Bundle have also gone live and will arrive on the same date as the new game on <strong>16th October 2025</strong>.</p>

Per CEO Chris Cox, it brought in more new players in stores over two weeks than any other set has in 12 weeks. And in the investor Q&amp;A during the earnings call, Cox answered a question about how Final Fantasy's demand correlated to the company's expectations with the following quote (<a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-hasbro-beats-q2-2025-estimates-but-stock-dips-93CH-4148568" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">courtesy of Investing.com's transcript</a>):</p><blockquote>In terms of Final Fantasy and how it met expectations, I’ll give you a comparison between two of our biggest universe at the onsets.

I think we increased production runs on it four times pre release. It was substantially, by many, many very high double digit percentages, ahead of any other production run we’ve ever done.</blockquote><blockquote>And we left the market wanting more. And our expectation is there’s going to be a nice long tail of backlist for the product. Likewise, we’re still selling Lord of the Rings product today. So, even though we hit $200,000,000 in December ’2 for Lord of the Rings, We sold a substantial percentage of that in the several years following. We expect Final Fantasy to be no different.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s partially what’s powering our backlist, which already in five and a half months in the year did more than we’ve ever done in any year prior. So, I think that’s a little bit on what our bullishness is on Final Fantasy. What drove success for it? I think it’s a couple of things. I think first and foremost, it’s finding the right IPs that are great adjacencies to what Magic fans might appeal to or what Magic might appeal to another fan base.</blockquote><blockquote>Lord of the Rings was fantastic because it’s kind of the granddaddy of fantasy. It invented the genre, major books, major movies, major animation and games. Final Fantasy, I think, is almost as strong as Lord of the Rings in terms of IP strength, if not stronger in some regions. I think it has stronger cross regional appeal, and it has probably more of a sweet spot in gaming than Lord of the Rings has, because it was kind of born from gaming. So, I think potentially the overlap of fan bases was stronger than you might have even seen for something like Lord of the Rings.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In a follow-up question, Cox also noted that he feels "pretty good" about future collaborations and first-party sets coming next year "in terms of being Final Fantasy like in terms of the types of players, the size of community, and the adjacencies we have." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last remark bodes well for fans of the Final Fantasy set. We just saw a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-magic-the-gathering-crossover-spoilers-secret-lair">Sonic: The Hedgehog Secret Lair crossover</a> debut, and already know about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-magic-the-gathering-crossover-reveal-card-spoilers">Spider-Man</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-aang-magic-the-gathering-cards-reveal-early-look-at-upcoming-the-last-airbender-set">Avatar: The Last Airbender themed sets in September</a> and November, respectively, so with success like this, more crossovers are likely to make sense to the folks at Hasbro. In the meantime, at least this means Hasbro will keep the Final Fantasy cards stocked for a good while, for those who haven't been able to get their hands on them yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
