            <p>
Battletech, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadowrun">Shadowrun</a>, and The Lamplighters League developer Harebrained Schemes has announced its first project since parting ways with Paradox Interactive last year. It's a "post-cyberpunk survival horror RPG" called Graft and it's heading to PC.
</p>
<p>
Graft's story unfolds in the depths of a decaying continent-sized space station known as the Arc, home to forgotten technologies and unsettling wonders. Players must brave its horrors as they traverse "massive chasms, labyrinthine techno-catacombs, and self-replicating corridors", facing enemies in combat - including "ancient experiments, monstrous abominations, and relentless agents of a mad AI" - and Grafting as they go.
</p>
<p>
This is pretty much exactly what it sounds like, requiring players to scavenge body parts from fallen opponents and graft them onto themselves in order to alter their physical form, gaining new abilities and powers as they do. But Grafting a part also infuses players with its previous owner's memories, creating what Harebrained calls a "haunting interplay of survival, transformation, and self-discovery".

<p>
"Form alliances, build trust, and face the reality that anyone still living could be both an ally and a threat," teases the studio. "Your decisions will shape your journey and determine the fate of those you encounter...  Will you escape the Arc with your humanity intact, or become something else entirely?"
</p>
<p>
There's no hint of a release date for Graft, but Harebrained is currently aiming to launch it via the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/graft-c7e6c4">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3141390/GRAFT/">Steam</a>. It'll be the studio's first release since last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-lamplighters-league-review-rip-roaring-tactical-adventure-let-down-by-dreadful-real-time-stealth">flawed by entertaining</a> turn-based strategy game The Lamplighter's League, which publisher Paradox Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">later declared a $22m flop</a>.
</p>
<p>
That announcement was followed by the news Paradox was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-and-harebrained-schemes-parting-ways-following-the-lamplighters-league-flop">parting ways</a> with Harebrained Schemes - which it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-interactive-acquires-battletech-developer-harebrained-schemes">acquired back in 2018</a> following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battletech">BattleTech</a> - with the publisher retaining the rights to The Lamplighters League, BattleTech, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/necropolis">Necropolis</a>, and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadowrun-trilogy">Shadowrun Trilogy</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-shows-that-the-triple-a-pivot-to-live-service-was-always-doomed.971319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Concord</em>, the latest game in Sony’s ongoing live service salvo, came out a week and a half ago. Already, the writing was on the wall. There was no buzz. It just didn’t have the juice. Still, nobody was prepared for what happened today: <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony announced</a> that it plans to pull the game from stores and offer refunds to anybody who bought it. <em>Concord </em>was smothered as it clambered out of the cradle – the ultimate object lesson in what happens when triple-A behemoths commit to live service for live service’s sake, despite the ever-increasing production demands of big-budget video games.</p><p><em>Concord </em>faltered for many reasons. Despite what the most irritatingly ill-informed people on the internet are saying, <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1831005817702670526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diversity didn’t do it in</a>. Instead, eight years ago the game set off down what would become an impossible path, iterating on hero shooter concepts that were in vogue at the time and arriving looking polished but <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/concord-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feeling rusty</a>. In the time since <em>Concord </em>began development, <em>Overwatch </em>rose and fell, the battle royale boom redefined multiplayer shooters and petered out, extraction shooters became a thing, and an endless procession of competitive shooter hopefuls crashed and burned while a small handful – <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> among them – carved out enduring fiefdoms.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Concord </em>entered a massively competitive playing field feeling dated on day one, having to justify itself not just against other shooters, but popular live service games in general, whose audiences only tend to rove <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-concord-failure-sony-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when their friends start sniffing at greener pastures</a>. This is why Sony’s plan to release 12 live service games by 2026 – which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23954006/sony-playstation-live-service-games-marathon-last-of-us-factions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got cut in half late last year</a> – never made much sense. Live-service games do not automatically print money. On the contrary, between regular upkeep and constant streams of new content, they are hugely costly, as <a href="https://x.com/cecianasta/status/1831050133439758576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even titans like <em>Roblox </em>can attest</a>. Attracting an audience – especially with no immediately-apparent hook beyond triple-A production values – is hard, and keeping it is even harder. Perhaps Sony imagined one or two smash live-service hits would ultimately balance out the odd miss here or there, but at this scale – with so many careers on the line – that’s an unconscionably risky gamble.&nbsp;</p><p>This is hardly a problem exclusive to competitive live-service games. <em>Starfield</em>, which shared a similarly lengthy incubation period to <em>Concord</em>, launched last year feeling like it emerged from a time capsule. <em>Suicide Squad</em>, which attempted to satisfy lovers of both traditional narrative-driven games and live-service grind-a-thons, only succeeded in <a href="https://aftermath.site/suicide-squad-discourse-impressions-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letting everyone down</a>. Layoffs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently followed</a>. The latter found itself clinging to the wreckage of basically the same Titanic as <em>Concord</em>: Beyond triple-A production values, it couldn’t justify its own existence.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, it’s little wonder why major video game publishers keep trying to squeeze blood from this particular stone. With triple-A games taking <a href="https://aftermath.site/big-budget-game-development-is-not-sustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more time, money, and manpower than ever to make</a>, they want the biggest, longest-lasting return on investment possible. But big publishers’ approach to live service is an unsustainable solution born of unsustainable development practices. The arms race to make bigger, longer games – with more <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-stealth-bugs-ubisoft-1851637931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impossibly-detailed hallways</a> that most players won’t even blink at – is a dead end. It has been all along. Papering over that with a business model that only <em>appears </em>to generate infinite revenue will not, in the overwhelming majority of cases, fix this fundamental problem. Most games in this mold will struggle to break even, and even the success stories will fall into <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-controversy-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the live-service death spiral</a>, a miasmatic pit of community toxicity that burns out developers and inspires reactive design decisions over anything truly inspired or forward thinking.</p><p>This is not to say that new live-service games cannot succeed; you just have to be creative about it in ways that big companies are loath to embrace. Most indies now launch ambitious, community-driven games in early access – <em>real </em>early access, where major features and chunks of content are missing, rather than money-grubbing “pre-order now!” early access that does not actually allow for feedback or substantial changes before release. Valve, which played a pioneering role in giving developers the tools to do this, is now taking cues from the scene it’s cultivated, stealth-dropping its own hero shooter, <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-deadlock-verge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Deadlock</em></a>, in earlier-than-early access and attracting a sizable player base in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>But this approach is antithetical to major publishers’ addictions to secrecy and long lead times, as well as endless marketing drip feeds and elaborate pre-order bundles. Moreover, it still doesn’t address the elephant in the room: Big-budget game development is not sustainable, nor does it serve an apparent need. Games don’t have to be enormous; most players only experience a fraction of them. Triple-A fidelity has become a fool’s errand; <a href="https://aftermath.site/call-duty-modern-warfare-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games from more than a decade ago</a> still look great now. Developers at envelope-pushing studios like <em>Spider-Man</em> developer Insomniac <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do not believe players notice</a> the fruits of billowing budgets -- at least, not enough to make the additional investment worthwhile.</p><p>It’s <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-want-shorter-games-with-worse-graphics-and-im-not-kidding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a cliche</a> to ask for shorter games with worse graphics, but I don’t think there’s any other <em>actual </em>solution to this problem. Triple-A games have become too costly, both in terms of money and a harder-to-measure though far more important human toll. As <em>Concord </em>and <a href="https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other games like <em>Destiny 2</em></a> have shown us, live service is not a silver bullet. In fact, it can <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exacerbate these issues</a>. Every major release is now a potential catastrophe – a bomb waiting to go off, the fuse of which was lit the better part of a decade ago. The triple-A video game industry can’t go on like this. If it keeps blowing up its own foundations, it will destroy itself. Change is still possible, but as we’ve learned from <em>Concord</em>, it needed to happen yesterday. That’s no longer possible, so I guess we’ll have to settle for tomorrow.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://dragonquest.square-enix-games.com/games/en-us/dragon-quest-123-hd2d-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> has been in the works for quite some time, and it took a few years since its announcement to get a first proper look at the very first entry in a series of remakes that will allow players to experience the entirety of the Erdrick trilogy on modern gaming hardware. With the game right around the corner, Square Enix offered us a chance to try out the game during Gamescom in a short session that did not fail to show how the game is setting out to be among the best HD-2D games ever released.</p>
<p>The Gamescom 2024 demo threw players a few hours into the adventure into the town of Romaria, specifically in the Monster Arena, which has been overhauled for the remake to allow players to have a more active role in monster vs monster combat. Winning matches will provide the hero and his companions with some useful items, so I expect more than a few players will be spending quite a few hours here trying to get all the rewards.</p>
<p>Once I was done with my business at the Monster Arena, I had the chance to explore the town of Romaria, and speak with the king, who enlists the hero to recover his crown from the thieves that stole it. After accepting the task, I explored the town a little more, stocking on supplies, purchasing better weapons and gear for my party members, and appreciating the excellent recreation of the town in the HD-2D style. The game as a whole looked lively and positively vibrant, especially on the Nintendo Switch OLED, where the colors really looked incredible.</p>

<p>Despite having accepted the request of the king, I decided to wander around and see what else the Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake demo had to offer. I ended up exploring a few dungeons briefly in the surroundings of Romaria and fighting against a few enemies. The original game's turn-based combat system has been left virtually untouched, though now the characters appear on screen when choosing commands. Some welcome additions include the ability to speed up combat, which is sure to help the game's pacing considerably, though I found the encounter rate to be fair, for the most part, and the ability to set up tactics and change auto-battle settings, which should make random encounters even faster to complete. As one of my party members came with the new Monster Wrangler vocation, I was able to briefly try some of its abilities out, and it felt powerful enough. Difficulty, in general, was on the low side, but that was most likely caused by the leveled-up characters that were provided for the demo. The final game will feature multiple difficulty settings, so players will easily be able to tailor the general difficulty level to their skill level.</p>
<p>Having only played through Dragon Quest III years ago, I really can't say if there have been big changes to locations, treasure chest locations, and the like in the remake, but even so, it is undeniable that Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is likely going to set a new bar for faithful remakes of classic JRPGs. Thankfully, it won't take much longer to be able to delve deeper into the story of Ortega and his child, as the game launches in just a few months, on November 14th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch worldwide.</p>

It follows a similar compact mode for the main Xbox app on PC. Microsoft has also made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152252/microsoft-xbox-handheld-compact-mode-controller-improvements">controller improvements to the Xbox app</a>, making it easier to navigate around the app with just an Xbox controller.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series-to-consume-more-power-than-40-series/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The upcoming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 series, including the 5080 and others, is rumored to consume more power than the current 40 series, with up to a 33% increase in power consumption in some of the graphics cards. </p>



<p>It has been rumored for quite some time now that the GeForce RTX 50 series would consume more power, but a well-trusted leaker recently revealed on Twitter that the new graphics cards most definitely would require more energy to run.</p>



<h2 id="h-twitter-leaker-reveals-that-geforce-rtx-50-series-will-consume-more-power-than-40-series">Twitter Leaker Reveals That GeForce RTX 50 Series Will Consume More Power Than 40 Series</h2>



<p>The GeForce RTX 4080 and other cards in the 40 series already consume quite a bit of power when in use, meaning the 50 series will really be pushing the boundaries with power consumption.</p>



<p>This has already provided a bit of backlash amongst NVIDIA GeForce fans, as many wish for the company to work on efficiency over power consumption.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>“I know someone who got the details of GeForce of Blackwell recently,” said kopite7kimi, a Twitter leaker. “Both of them have some increase in power consumption, with higher SKUs.”</p>



<p>Then when a comment on his post said “I say 550W for 5090,” the leaker responded with “more.” This would mean more than a 100W increase from the 4090, which was at 450W. We are looking at some heavy increases in power usage for these new graphics cards.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-the-50-series-release">When Will The 50 Series Release?</h2>



<p>As of now, there is only a tiny bit of information out there regarding the NVIDIA GeForce 50 series. Despite the rumors that power consumption will be quite high, we do know that there is a possibility we will see the graphics cards showcased at CES 2025, next year.</p>



<p>For now, though, tech and gaming enthusiasts will have to wait for more additional details on the 50 series.</p>

<section><p>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is a confident reminder that this 13-year-old cult classic still has life in an era of gaming that tends to take itself a bit too seriously.</p></section>

                <p>Shadows of the Damned is a game where protagonist Garcia Hotspur's gun is called the Boner, and he refers to vine-like blockades in the hell as "demon pubes." It's a game that confidently wears its video-game-y-ness on its purple leather studded sleeve, right next to Joy Division's lyrics "Love Will Tear Us Apart" painted in thick white paint. From demonic enemies whom burst with collectible diamonds after shooting their heads off, to bosses covered in big, obvious "please-shoot-here" weak points, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered isn't just a reminder of its brash conviction in knowing its a video game or how un-seriously it takes itself, but a window into how far and <em>how little</em> video games have come since its original release in 2011.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with GameSpot at Gamescom 2024, producer and Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami said, "[Shadows of the Damned] is aware that it's a video game, and it's not trying to be something else. There's a lot of games these days that tend to take themselves a bit too seriously."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Shadows Of The Damned: Hella Remastered Is A Welcomed Reminder Of This Cult Classic's Confidence | gamescom 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">When considering the state of action-horror games of recent, like last year's Resident Evil 4 remake or Alan Wake 2, there's an attention to detail and believability that both games feature in their combat and graphics. Both games have lifelike movement that add a sense of weight to your actions, offering realistic feedback regardless of if you're getting a hatchet to the face or shooting a hole through an enemy's head. The graphical fidelity of both games creates believable worlds that closely mirror our own. Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered has similar traits to both Resident Evil 4 remake and Alan Wake 2--the over-the-shoulder perspective, fending off enemy monstrosities, and even some puzzle elements--but it accomplishes it with a brighter color palette, cartoonish animations, and a don't-give-a-shit attitude that evokes its own flavor of confidence.</p><p dir="ltr">Shadows of the Damned adapted many of those traits from the original Resident Evil 4, also produced by Mikami, but it actually has more in common with Alan Wake 2 in terms of combat design. Both Alan Wake 2 and Shadows of the Damned require cleansing its enemies of a darkness-like presence before being able to deal damage, as well as have a dedicated melee attack and a dodge button. The difference is that Shadows of the Damned isn't mirroring a world we currently live in--instead, it's a colorful and vibrant hellscape, where you're drinking sake to heal yourself and feeding strawberries to demon babies to unlock doors.</p><blockquote data-size="large"><p>A lot of games, especially now with the specs available, they go for this sort of hyper-reality. We don't really care about hyper-reality.</p><cite>Goichi "Suda51" Suda</cite></blockquote><p dir="ltr">It was through this lens that it first occurred to me how little has actually changed in the action-horror genre in terms of combat over the last 13 years--an entertaining notion given how often some players regard the standard game-design practices from that era as "arcade-y."</p><p dir="ltr">"I feel that 13 years ago, when we were making the original [Shadows of the Damned], there were a lot of things in game development that were kind of just a given at the time," Mikimi-san explained. "'This is how you make games, this is what games are supposed to be like.' A lot of things have changed since then. There's a lot of stuff in Shadows of the Damned that's a lot more casual and comical, and it's just easy to enjoy without trying to take the game too seriously, or without the game taking itself too seriously as well. So hopefully that's something that'll resonate with modern-day players as something that isn't maybe seen as much as it used to be, because back in the day, that's just how video games were."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4361179-damned_screenshot_19_068eadd5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361179" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4361179-damned_screenshot_19_068eadd5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361179"></a><figcaption>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4361179-damned_screenshot_19_068eadd5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Writer of Shadows of the Damned and founder of developer Grasshopper Manufacture Goichi "Suda51" Suda weighed in on the current state of realism in games today, saying, "I feel that a lot of games these days try really hard to go for a sense of reality. A lot of games, especially now with the specs available, they go for this sort of hyper-reality. We don't really care about hyper-reality."</p><p dir="ltr">For Grasshopper Manufacture, its philosophy is to present the game in "the most expressive way possible," according to Suda.</p><p dir="ltr">While Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is getting a 4K overhaul to its resolution, it's hard to distinguish the game's visuals from its original 2011, and it's better off for it. The game's reliance on bright colors and exaggerated character movements has allowed it to stand the test of time. While deft art design can have that lasting effect, game design tends to show its age with time. But to my surprise, Shadows of Damned: Hella Remastered seems to be holding its own in this corner of the ring as well.</p><p dir="ltr">In the 30 minutes I played, I saw a wide array of enemy types, varied environmental puzzles, and a clever use of its light and dark mechanics that kept me on my toes. The whole chapter was carefully paced, and felt considerably honed in. All these elements were in the original, too, but I had forgotten over the 13 years since I last played it. It was a welcoming surprise--a feeling that Suda himself had as well when returning to his 2011 cult classic.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's definitely things that have changed the way I view the game and the things that I think I pick up on when I'm looking at the game now," Suda-san said. "One thing looking at the game now: I actually feel that it was a lot more well-made than I felt when it originally came out."</p><p dir="ltr">"We've got another project we're working on at the moment," Suda continued. "It's a new IP, and since we're working on that while also doing the remaster, you end up sort of comparing and contrasting. So when working on this new IP, going back to work on the [Shadows of the Damned] remaster at the same time, there's definitely things I picked up on now that I maybe didn't pick up on back at the time. Like, 'Oh, hey, this is maybe something we could have done a bit better, or this is something we could have changed.' And conversely, 'Oh, hey, this is something we can maybe take and kind of tweak to fit the new IP.'"</p><p dir="ltr">According to Suda, that was a "big nope" for Grasshopper Manufacturer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4361190-ss_73110f7c7c918d44d41659e03ed1ffd36004997e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361190" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4361190-ss_73110f7c7c918d44d41659e03ed1ffd36004997e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361190"></a><figcaption>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4361190-ss_73110f7c7c918d44d41659e03ed1ffd36004997e.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"One of the main reasons that we wanted to put out the remaster was to get it on as many platforms as possible. Originally it was only on PS3 and Xbox 360, and if it was only gonna be on Origin, then that defeated the purpose, because it would further limit the number of people who would be able to play it."</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn't until Grasshopper Manufacture partnered with its current parent company NetEase--and after Origin was no longer a major focus for EA's distribution--that the studio was able to work out a deal that granted it both the rights for the remaster and the game's distribution.</p><p dir="ltr">Until now, Shadows of the Damned was only playable if you have a physical copy of the game, which severely limits its availability for new players to access the cult classic. Thankfully, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is expected to release October 31 for all modern platforms and PC.</p>

            <p>
Vampire: The Masquerade's trilogy of New York themed visual novels is set to conclude next Tuesday, 10th September, with Reckoning of New York on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.
</p>
<p>
Vampire: The Masquerade – Reckoning of New York, from developer Draw Distance, wraps up a tale that began with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-coteries-of-new-york-reveals-new-details-on-its-telltale-like-adventure">2019's Coteries of New York</a> and continued a year later in Shadows of New York. This time around, the story unfolds against a backdrop of the modern-day city, where "the delicate balance of power hangs by a thread".
</p>
<p>
"Navigate the treacherous waters of vampiric politics as you contend with the ever-shifting landscape between the Camarilla and Anarchs," teases Draw Distance. "In a city where every move could mean the difference between unlife and final death, will you carve out your own destiny amidst the chaos or will your ambition spell your doom?"

<p>
Reckoning of New York promises a journey of "discovery and deception" from two different perspectives, as well as a range of new gameplay mechanics. "Harness the powers of Disciplines to overcome challenges or evade the relentless pursuit of Hunters hot on your trail," explains Draw Distance. "But beware the insatiable Hunger that gnaws at your very being, threatening to unleash the primal Beast within."
</p>
<p>
Vampire: The Masquerade – Reckoning of New York will be available for <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/vampire-the-masquerade-reckoning-of-new-york/9mwqhhn14b2r">Xbox One</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009973">PlayStation 4</a>, Switch, and PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2658720/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Reckoning_of_New_York/">via Steam</a> when it launches on 10th September.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-76-update-launches-milepost-zero/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-passes-20-million-players-milestone-bethesda-is-planning-future-games/">Fallout 76</a> has been released, with players now able to explore Milepost Zero, a completely free update for Fallout 76 players across all platforms. This update introduces Legendary Crafting as well as a new C.A.M.P. feature called Best Builds, as well as tweaks to the combat system to make it more enjoyable. In addition to these updates, there will be a new questline for Fallout 76 players to explore in Milepost Zero, where they have to go on a trek with their Brahmin and begin a caravan delivery service in Skyline Valley.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 76 - Season 18: Milepost Zero - Country Road" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXrFWx_jwKo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new questline will be named "A Bump in the Road," which, as explained above will take players on the journey to have their own delivery service across the Shenandoah region while having to fight off raiders and creatures. On this questline, players will get to recruit companions of varying professions where you can then go on to build your own personal outpost where you get rewards.</p>
<p>For players to be able to utilize Legendary Crafting, they will need to be able to obtain the Mods that can be equipped onto the gear by either trading the Legendary Mod with another player or by scrapping Legendary items that you don't want that have the desired mod on them. This will allow players to upgrade their gear and give them better utility from their upgrades.</p>
<p>In addition to Legendary Crafting, the Best Builds system allows players to submit, visit, and rate other players' C.A.M.P.s.</p>
<p>One of the final things to be added to this Fallout 76 update is Season 18: Country Road. in this season, players can unlock new rewards from the Seasons pages such as the Blue Ridge Power Armor as well as Weapon Points and new themed C.A.M.P items.&nbsp; This new update comes with a four-month road map with the next major update and season coming in December. Before that, players can expect to see the Fallout Day Festivities taking place in October and the invaders returning in November, making it a stacked quarter for Fallout 76 players.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>To showcase the latest update, Bethesda Softworks has released a trailer just over a minute that shows players what to expect from the Milepost Zero update. <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6a0zxH7H8KwFTa5b0OlFxJ/season-18-milepost-zero-country-road" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The community calendar</a>, which is available on the Bethesda website for players to look at, goes into more detail about some of the events players can expect in the near future.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/head-of-valorant-esports-reveals-teams-in-talks-to-join-vct-partner-leagues/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/head-of-valorant-esports-reveals-teams-in-talks-to-join-vct-partner-leagues.971268/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/head-of-valorant-esports-reveals-teams-in-talks-to-join-vct-partner-leagues/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<figure></figure>


<p>The VCT is known for partnering with big Valorant esports teams, as Riot Games partnered with 30 different teams across three different leagues back in 2022. The esports teams partnered with VCT back then signed four-year contracts, with the chance to possibly resign in 2026.</p>



<p>Riot Games, though, could choose to sign different teams instead. </p>



<h2 id="h-vct-to-possibly-partner-with-new-valorant-esports-teams">VCT To Possibly Partner With New Valorant Esports Teams</h2>



<p>While there is still more than a year left before the 30 teams partnered with the VCT’s contracts expire, Riot Games is already looking at different esports organizations that they now consider to be first in line to join VCT’s partner leagues.</p>



<p>Leo Faria, the Global Head of Valorant Esports, made it known on social media that the company has its eye on quite a few teams for 2026 when it will be time to create new contracts.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>“Teams still need to meet our criteria for partnership, but there’s no question that orgs in Challengers are the first in line whenever slots open up,” said Faria.</p>



<p>With quite a bit more competition ahead of Valorant teams in the future, there is still the possibility that new teams and players enter Challengers and catch the eye of Riot Games. </p>



<p>Currently, The Challengers League has quite a few teams involved, with players from various countries around the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-valorant-challengers-2024">Valorant Challengers 2024</h2>



<p>As of now, the 2024 Challengers League has some of the biggest teams in Valorant esports on its roster. With many tournaments to be held over the next year, though, we could see other teams qualify their way into the spotlight, possibly giving them a chance at getting a VCT partnership in 2026.</p>



<p>Some large names, such as TSM, are a part of Challengers: North American Split. Will we see many large teams as such acquire VCT partnerships in 2026? Or will the league feature many unexpected teams?</p>

<p>Have you seen how positively gorgeous Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 looks? From a distance, you can watch as many hundreds of Tyranids flow from the jungles to assault your position. But up close, everything oozes detail. It’s going to take a powerhouse of a gaming computer to run this one. Or is it? Here are the Space Marine 2 PC requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2-system-requirements">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 System Requirements</h2>



<p>On the low end, running Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 on PC doesn’t appear too troubling. There are many gaming laptops that should handle the horde shooter relatively easily. But on the high end, you’ll want a beefier system to ramp up the graphics so that you can check out the Tyranids in all their inhuman glory.</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i5 6800K / AMD Ryzen 5 2600X</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 / AMD Radeon RX 580</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 75 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 75 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<p>Do you think your system can handle the game?</p>







<h2 id="h-what-warhammer-games-to-play-while-you-wait">What Warhammer Games to Play While You Wait</h2>



<p>Whether your current gaming PC can run the game or not, you might find yourself itching to do battle with heretics and Xenos in the Warhammer universe. In that case, here are a few recommendations to play while you wait for the Space Marine 2 release date:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</strong></li>



<li><strong>Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor – Martyr</strong></li>



<li><strong>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</strong></li>



<li><strong>Warhammer: Vermintide II</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While you don’t have to play Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine before Space Marine 2, it’s highly recommended as you’ll encounter numerous characters, including our main character, Titus, from the first game.</p>

What follows are eight in-game hours during which you must talk with the rest of the passengers and crew, find out any secrets or potential motives outside of your own, and cast suspicion on anybody that isn’t you so that you can start a new life in America. </p><p>Your first day will never go as well as you hope. A maid might catch you having an affair with the ship’s captain, you could uncover a stowaway on board, and more permutations and opportunities arise thanks to an incredibly dynamic mesh of systems. Each passenger has their own schedule which they follow like clockwork, and you must choose your activities carefully as every conversation and even moving between sections of the ship will make time pass. Eventually you’ll get caught on your first day and find yourself right back where you started.</p><figure id="" data-id="905ebd242e976d9939cdf960072e37c5" data-recommend-id="image://905ebd242e976d9939cdf960072e37c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman glances in a mirror and talks to herself about a missing earing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman glances in a mirror and talks to herself about a missing earing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->inkle</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="905ebd242e976d9939cdf960072e37c5" data-recommend-id="image://905ebd242e976d9939cdf960072e37c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman glances in a mirror and talks to herself about a missing earing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, in addition to being a detective game where you are the killer, <em>Overboard! </em>Is also doing a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2022/02/12-time-looping-video-games-youll-want-to-play-over-and-over/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2022/02/12-time-looping-video-games-youll-want-to-play-over-and-over/"><em>Groundhog Day</em> situation</a></span>. After every failed attempt you will be able to try new paths through the day, applying the knowledge from past lives to carve a perfect route through or choosing to scope out other options available to you. Eventually you collect so much spare knowledge on every person and item aboard that you can begin piecing together time sensitive puzzles. You may want to sneak into a passenger’s room, which means you need to know when they are on the deck taking in some air. However, you must also know when you can steal their key. It all becomes a complex web of movement and events that all fall like dominoes when you change a single choice.</p><p>That sounds overwhelming, but <em>Overboard!</em> keeps all of its time-loop shenanigans manageable by making every cycle last only 45 real-world minutes. This is perfectly timed so as not to make the loops feel too long, meaning they also don’t really require you to keep an exceedingly lengthy list of tasks in your head to be executed in perfect order. It’s bite-sized and easily digestible. Making loops this short also means you can do a lot in a relatively few sessions, which unlocks the truly surprising twists <em>Overboard! </em>keeps up its sleeve until the late game.

Sony and Firewalk spent a lot of time and money on this game as part of its big live-service push, and it’s flopping so hard that Sony is pulling the plug before it can even hit its one-month anniversary. Somewhere in PlayStation business meetings, Sony was ready to invest heavily into the game and an extended universe spun off from it. There’s even an episode based on the game coming in Amazon’s upcoming anthology series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/secret-level-amazon-armored-core-playstation-keanu-1851627812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/secret-level-amazon-armored-core-playstation-keanu-1851627812"><em>Secret Level</em> coming in December</a></span>. That episode may be the last gasp from a game that was snuffed out in just two weeks.</p><p>How did we get here? People have a lot of theories, and the implications for PlayStation and the state of the video game industry at large aren’t pretty. Let’s get into some of the internet’s reactions to the (ostensibly temporary) death of <em>Concord</em>.</p><h2 id="h677163"><a id=""></a><strong>Sympathy for the developers</strong></h2><p>Plenty of people who have worked a corporate job, especially in creative fields, know the sting of big suits making decisions that will inevitably lead to the slow decay of something people love. As the public has become more aware of working conditions within the video game industry, some people’s natural inclination is to worry about the designers, artists, and programmers who will inevitably be affected by the management decisions that led to <em>Concord</em>.</p><h2 id="h677164"><a id=""></a><strong>Weeping for the state of PlayStation</strong></h2><p>Whether it’s fair or not, <em>Concord </em>has become synonymous with the pitfalls of PlayStation’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-delayed-tlou-factions-1851007495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-delayed-tlou-factions-1851007495">live-service pivot</a></span>. Sony has been shutting down companies like Japan Studio and London Studio, while seemingly devoting swaths of its resources to live-service games like this one. It recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-online-factions-multiplayer-ps5-naughty-dog-1851101434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-online-factions-multiplayer-ps5-naughty-dog-1851101434">canceled a service game based on <em>The Last of Us</em></a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-layoffs-destiny-2-final-shape-marathon-sony-ps5-1851609905&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-layoffs-destiny-2-final-shape-marathon-sony-ps5-1851609905">cut jobs at Bungie</a></span>, and just seems to have had an impossible time getting the PS5 era of first-party games off the ground. While <em>Astro Bot </em>is coming this week on September 6, things look bleak for PlayStation right now in terms of quality first-party games. It has folks wistful for games like <em>Gravity Rush</em>, which might not have been a big seller like <em>The Last of Us </em>or <em>God of War</em>, but was certainly more memorable than a live-service game that crashes and burns in mere days.</p><h2 id="h677165"><a id=""></a><strong>Could this have been prevented, or was this always <em>Concord</em>’s destiny?</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of reasons <em>Concord </em>turned out this way. The game was divisive on a few fronts, even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-playstation-5-pc-state-of-play-reaction-reddit-1851516496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-playstation-5-pc-state-of-play-reaction-reddit-1851516496">when it was first shown at the State of Play in May</a></span>. It’s jumping into an overcrowded genre that games like <em>Overwatch 2 </em>and <em>Apex Legends</em> dominate. It had a $40 price tag instead of being free-to-play like several of its competitors. But overall, it lacked that certain character-driven spark that you need to get people to play a hero shooter. It’s not enough to be mechanically sound if people aren’t drawn to the heroes they’re playing. PlayStation and FIrewalk clearly hoped <em>Concord </em>could become as ubiquitous as its contemporaries, and it failed to reach whatever internal metrics it had so badly that it’s going dark two weeks after launch.</p><p><em>Concord </em>was misguided, but considering the market it was entering, it would have been hard for even a much better game to penetrate the cultural consciousness, much less one that was so generic that it’s often only described in comparison to other works.</p><h2 id="h677166"><a id=""></a><strong>Is there hope?</strong></h2><p>Officially, Sony and Firewalk Studios are planning to bring <em>Concord</em> back at some point. I think most people probably figured the game would go free-to-play to get rid of the $40 barricade between the shooter and its potential player pool. That seems like a reasonable path forward, and would certainly be more sensible than dumping years of work and millions of dollars down a well. But we’ve also seen games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964">BioWare’s looter shooter <em>Anthem</em></a></span> retreat for a retooling, only to end up dying anyway. How many live-service failures and missteps do we have to see this industry make before the suits realize this isn’t sustainable? I care more for the human cost of this failure, so I hope <em>Concord </em>gets a second chance at life in a better position for success. The PlayStation fan in me hopes that if it all comes crashing down regardless, someone at Sony realizes that this cannot continue and is righting the ship as we speak. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-tanks/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-stock-tanks-to-10-year-low-after-lukewarm-star-wars-outlaws-launch.971217/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-tanks/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft stock prices have tanked by over 10% in the past two days following a lukewarm reception to Star Wars Outlaws.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Ubisoft Entertainment SA stock prices are at €15.50, a level not seen since December 2014. The <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/UBI:EPA?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiNvP-_w6eIAxU7VEEAHXOhMLsQ3ecFegQIPhAh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stock price</a> puts the company’s market cap just shy of €2B at €1.99B.</p>



<p>The stock price drop follows the release of Star Wars Outlaws, which released with a mere 4.9 user score out of 10 according to review aggregator <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/star-wars-outlaws/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a>. As a result, the tepid response led J.P. Morgan to slash sales forecasts by 2 million units, predicting 5.5 million units sold by March 2025. Combine a slash in sales with Disney’s hefty licensing and it’s not hard to see why investors are skittish on the company’s immediate future.</p>



<p>But that’s not all. Just last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported that XDefiant</a>, the publisher’s free-to-play hit that firmly contributed to the company’s Q1 financial success, was in big trouble. According to our sources, the game is on borrowed time, and it risks losing its much-needed post-launch support if the developers can’t bring back players by the end of Season 3. Ubisoft declined to comment on the report.</p>



<p>Still, investors remain optimistic about the publisher’s future. With the game set to release on November 15, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be crucial to making this fiscal year a financial success. Despite the game already seeing its fair share of online discourse, our sources suggest its pre-order numbers are strong.</p>



<p>Looking ahead past this fiscal year, things look a little brighter for the company. Next year, we should hear about some huge titles, including the next mainline entries into Far Cry and Ghost Recon and the hotly anticipated Splinter Cell Remake. Who knows, perhaps one could even be announced later this year to perk up investors and, frankly, players, too.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ubisoft’s future? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234889/castlevania-dominus-collection-review-switch-xbox-playstation-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For anyone looking to explore the best <em>Castlevania</em> has to offer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24229521/castlevania-dominus-collection-nintendo-switch-ds-trilogy">the just-launched <em>Castlevania Dominus Collection</em></a> is pretty much a no-brainer. It includes a trilogy of games from the Nintendo DS era that show <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/19/15830788/koji-igarashi-bloodstained-castlevania-interview-e3-2017">designer Koji Igarashi</a> arguably at the height of his powers: the experiences combine smooth, satisfying action with worlds that are intricate labyrinths to be mastered slowly over time. Bringing that experience to modern platforms alone makes the collection worth it. But the <em>Dominus Collection</em> also goes a step further and includes some smart options for porting over a dual-screen game. Then, it throws in an unexpectedly excellent remaster just for fun.</p><p>Part of what made <em>Castlevania</em> such a good fit for the DS was how much information could be displayed at once. While the side-scrolling action took place on one screen, the other could show character information or, more crucially, the map. For a game that’s all about traversing a complex castle, with lots of backtracking and blocked entrances to contend with, having that map always on is incredibly helpful. And not only is that option still present in this modern rerelease but Konami has also given players a few choices for how they want their info displayed.</p><p>By default, the <em>Dominus Collection</em> — which includes <em>Dawn of Sorrow</em>, <em>Portrait of Ruin</em>, and <em>Order of Ecclesia</em> and is available on PlayStation, Switch, Xbox, and PC — displays the games as shown in the screenshot above. The action is largest on the left side of the screen, while both the map and character info are displayed beside it. There are a few other options, though, which really let you customize the experience. For two examples: you can have just the action and the map side by side, or you can have it top and bottom to mimic an actual DS, like this:</p><div><figcaption><em>Two different looks for </em>Portrait of Ruin<em>.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Konami and Image: Konami</cite></p></div><p>I’ve been playing through <em>Portrait of Ruin</em> mostly using the side-by-side option, but the fact that there’s so much choice here is important. It’s a thoughtful approach to porting games from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21441254/nintendo-ds-3ds-discontinued-eulogy">a distinct piece of hardware</a> and means that these excellent titles are available in a way that both feels native to modern platforms and honors the original releases.</p><p>There’s also an added bonus included in the <em>Dominus Collection</em>. While <em>Castlevania</em> is a series with some beloved highs, it has also had some notable duds over the years. And while the arcade spinoff <em>Haunted Mansion</em> always looked good, it plays like, well, a game that’s trying to suck up all of your quarters. It’s hard and tedious and missing that <em>Castlevania</em> oomph. Including it in this collection is therefore a surprising choice but also one that is very welcome because, in addition to the stodgy original, you also get a full-on remake that spruces up the graphics and tweaks the design and difficulty to make it actually fun to play. It turns an inaccessible arcade release into a decidedly old-school <em>Castlevania</em>, from before the series shifted to an exploration focus.</p><p>It’s also the kind of oddity that’s perfect for a retro bundle like this. In the absence of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23451349/atari-50-review-xbox-playstation-switch-steam">a playable documentary</a>, the <em>Dominus Collection</em> is about as good as it gets.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony's team-based online shooter <em>Concord</em> has been removed from sale and will be taken offline on Friday, September 6, just two weeks after its August 23 launch. Firewalk Studios Game Director Ryan Ellis <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">said in an announcement Tuesday</a> that publisher Sony will offer refunds to all players who purchased the game on PC or PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Sony may not need to pay out that many refunds. GameDiscoverCo analyst Simon Carless <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">told IGN</a> last week that he estimated an underwhelming 25,000 total sales for the game across PS5 and PC. Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, meanwhile, said that just 0.2 percent of all active PS5 players were playing the game last Monday, making it the 147th most-played title for that day.</p>
<p>The Steam version of the game peaked at well under 700 players just after launch, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/%3Ca%20href=">according to SteamDB tracking</a>. On PlayStation, popular opt-in trophy tracking site PSNProfiles logged <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/28912-concord">just over 1,300 players who owned <em>Concord</em></a>, a relatively small showing compared to popular recent releases like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> (<a href="https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/28905-star-wars-outlaws">4,300 PSNProfiles owners</a>) and Black Myth: Wukong (<a href="https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/28916-black-myth-wukong">16,000 PSNProfiles-tracked owners</a>).</p>
<p>"While many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended," Ellis wrote.</p>
<h2>What went wrong?</h2>
<p>Suffice it to say, this quick shutdown is not what Firewalk or Sony envisioned for the game. Just under a month ago, Ellis was <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/13/concord-launch-and-the-adventure-ahead/">talking up <em>Concord</em>'s impending launch</a> by teasing a "major content drop" planned for October and the long-term potential for custom crew buildouts.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>"We see launch as just the beginning," Ellis said in the August promotional post. "The beginning of not only the vision we’ve set out for <em>Concord,</em> but also the beginning of how we support and grow the game with our players."</p>
<p><em>Concord</em> was the first game from Firewalk Studios, which <a href="https://www.firewalkstudios.com/">formed in 2018</a> before <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/04/20/welcoming-firewalk-studios-to-the-playstation-studios-family/">being acquired by Sony just last year</a>. The game has been in development for around eight years, <a href="https://x.com/sharkeatsman/status/1826122649963245882">according to lead character designer Jon Weisnewski</a>, meaning work on the title started when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/overwatch-early-impressions-a-shooter-with-character/">Blizzard's <em>Overwatch</em> was a hot new concept</a> rather than the aging progenitor of a crowded genre.</p>
<p><em>Concord</em> was <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/introducing-concord-a-new-pvp-multiplayer-fps-from-firewalk-studios-coming-to-ps5-and-pc/">teased at Sony's PlayStation Showcase last May</a> and <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/concord-gameplay-revealed-launching-august-23-2024-on-ps5-and-pc/">was first shown in a rough playable form this May</a>. By August's launch, though, it was clear there was little market appetite for yet another live service team shooter that didn't bring much new to the table. <em>Concord</em> was only recommended by 24 percent of reviewers <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17198/concord">tracked by OpenCritic</a> and is sitting at an extremely underwhelming score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/concord/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">65 on Metacritic</a>.</p>

<p><em>Concord</em>'s fate brings to mind that of Amazon's <em>Crucible</em>, another newcomer that found it hard to find a place in a crowded shooter market. That game managed to limp along for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/amazon-games-kills-its-ambitious-shooter-crucible-after-only-five-months/">just six months before being shut down</a>, though it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/amazons-latest-video-game-will-be-delisted-from-steam-hidden-as-closed-beta/">delisted from Steam</a> well before that death.
</p><p>Despite <em>Concord</em>'s quick shutdown, the door has been left open just a crack for a potential revival at some point.

			<p>At Gamescom 2024, I had the chance to speak to Derek Qiu, Head of Overseas Operations for Once Human, the 'New Weird' free-to-play survival game published by NetEase and developed by Starry Studio. The game launched on PC on July 10 and immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-the-new-weird-survival-game-is-out-now-and-already-in-steams-top-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> strong player numbers.</p>
<p>Qiu discussed the upcoming features and updates, answered some questions from the Once Human community, and confirmed that the mobile and console launches are on the way. The plan is to merge everything into a single unified community thanks to cross-play.</p>
<p><iframe title="Once Human丨Version 1.1 Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NkEIqrlIi3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Tell me about the recent launch. How is it going so far?</strong></p>
<p>It's beyond our imagination and expectation. It's been over one month after the launch, and we have reached $110 million. Most importantly, I think the record we achieved cannot be achieved without gamer support, so often, we also ranked number 5 globally in the most played games on Steam. Last week, we reached number 2 in the revenue ranking, so the launch is actually really beyond our expectations.</p>
<p><strong>I think you already published an update. What's next in your Once Human roadmap?</strong></p>
<p>We are going to publish another PvP scenario, which will come in September. This one will be a refreshing gaming experience for the PvP players, and then in October, we will have another PvE scenario, which is still in progress. But we will have new Tyrants, and new monsters. In the long-term pipeline we will also go on mobile and on consoles. We haven't published our official announcement on those yet, but it will be published very soon.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game have crossplay?</strong></p>
<p>That's going to be crossplay enabled, yes.</p>
<p><strong>With everything, even mobile?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it's gonna be a very big community.</p>
<p><strong>I have also been watching some of the feedback from the Once Human community. Many people would like simplified currencies, as they believe they are confusing.</strong></p>
<p>What do you mean by simplified currencies?</p>
<p><strong>Consolidating currencies, so there are fewer and it is clearer what they are for.</strong></p>
<p>I haven't received that feedback. I noticed that recently, on the 15th of August, we launched a monetization event, and that came up with a new currency. If you are referring to that, we will modify and adjust the monetization system. But if you are referring to the current currency system, we haven't received a lot of feedback from the players yet, not as I understand. So, we don't have that plan yet.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to expand customer support? Some users believe it is a bit lacking in that area.&nbsp; Are you going to hire some more people for customer support?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, we've been discussing for a while that we need to have more customer support for our games. The current user base is beyond our expectations, so we need to catch up for sure. That's in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The thing is that we have only qualified customer support for English speakers right now, and we are seeking more people to cover other languages like French and Spanish. So, it's pretty hard for us. Actually, NetEase is responsible for the publishing, so we have to request other resources for that as well. So it's kind of like in the process, but we are trying our best to fulfill the manpower for the customer support. In September, we will launch another website to collect the player's feedback and suggestions as well. That will probably solve some players' concerns about customer support issues.</p>
<p><strong>I don't know if you're aware, but there's been a report of people being erroneously banned from Once Human following a recent premium currency bug. Do you have a statement on this?</strong></p>
<p>Oh yeah, I am aware of that. Yes, so actually the players used a bug to get permanent currency. We're discussing the resolution to that one. We have zero tolerance for people using our bugs to get a profit. That's the baseline because that's unfair to the paid users.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, is there another solution that we can show our baseline to those players without banning them directly? So, for the resolution, we're still working on it, and it's not a final decision. We are still debating on this. It's a quite hard decision for us.</p>
<p><strong>Are you still working on improving the performance?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that's also one of the reasons we delayed the mobile plan as we promised. We wanted to stabilize and improve the optimization for the PC gamer's user experience. We also want to implement some technologies, such as NVIDIA DLSS. After that, we will stabilize the mobile experience and then we'll launch it.</p>
<p><strong>Are you open to allowing a mid-season server progression transfer? Some people are saying, you know, that the server they are on is not very populated, and if they change server, they need to start over from scratch. What do you think about that?</strong></p>
<p>When players have played a scenario or a season for six weeks, they will have the option to change to another scenario, but within the six weeks, we don't have a plan for them to transfer to other servers or scenarios, so they have to start over. That's also because we want to stabilize the players in the server because if they left in the middle, that would not be fair to other players who are playing the same scenario and season with them, and it would also impact the server's ecosystem. The current design is that they have to finish at least six weeks. So after that, it can change to other scenarios they want.</p>
<p><strong>Are you still adding voice work and translations to Once Human?</strong></p>
<p>Oh yeah. Voice translation is also one of the things that we are looking at right now. Previously, we didn't do it because the cost was relatively high. So, if we want to do it, we have to do all the languages, and we don't have the budget and manpower to cover all the languages. But we will re-evaluate. Currently, we only have English, so we are evaluating which language should be the next one.</p>
<p>We don't have a plan to cover all the languages. We're trying to support as many languages as possible for the textual translation, but if we try to do a voiceover for all of the languages, the package will become very big for players to download. Secondly, we need to make sure that no countries will feel neglected while we are doing voiceover for other countries, so it's also a hard decision for us to make.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Currently, we have 300 people, but we are expanding our development team right now. We look forward to reaching 400 and seeing if that's enough for content production and live issue fixes.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you think there will be more ways to get Starchroms in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there will be. We are already working on this, either with the current season rewards or with events we're trying to give more Starchroms to the players.</p>
<p><strong>Something else people are wondering is if you would lower the number of channels on a server. They say there are a bit too many, so it feels like the server is not very populated because there are too many channels. Especially on PvP servers, they feel like it would be better to have like three or four channels instead of 10.</strong></p>
<p>For this one, we are trying to have a server monitoring system that can dynamically monitor the server's capacity. So far, we have opened a server manually, to be honest. So, if we see that a server has less population, we will stop opening more servers. That's one of the directions. If the server has very few people to play, and they can't even start a fight, we might consider merging servers together, so that will be a direction as well.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to add transmogrification to Once Human?</strong></p>
<p>That's a very good question because our monetization model is based on cosmetics, so we are certainly interested in giving players more options to change their look for the gear and the weapon. But I would say it's still on the way, and then we're trying to see the best way to output all of those features in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think there will be new full maps in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. As the players can see right now, the map is kind of locked, and there are a lot of unexplored areas to be filled, so all of those maps will be designed, and we will have a new map in October, so yes, there will be an update on this.</p>
<p><b>Are there any plans to extend your development studio to accommodate the content pipeline?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we're already expanding that. Currently, we have 300 people, but we are expanding our development team right now. We look forward to reaching 400 and seeing if that's enough for content production and live issue fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Are you looking into cheats and exploits in Once Human PvP? Are you doing something to improve that?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. What we are currently doing is that on a regular basis, we will post the list of everyone who has used cheats. We are also trying to invest more into investigating those issues. Because we have a PvP game experience, we have zero tolerance for any action that breaks the fairness among our players, so this one will be the top priority for our game.</p>
<p><strong>The community also says that Prime Wars are a bit laggy right now. Are you trying to improve that?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, actually, we've already done quite a profound research on Prime Wars. We've collaborated with our community to discover what kind of issue Prime Wars have. Laggy is one of the issues, so we identified the root cause and are revamping it. Hopefully, the new version of Prime Wars will come out for players very soon.</p>
<p><strong>How often are you looking to add new weapons? Is it every season?</strong></p>
<p>The weapon system is absolutely something that we're trying to enrich because we want to provide different gameplay styles to the players, so we do have the weapon enrichment system, and also, we are trying to adjust the current balance of the weapon system. And yes, in the future there will be more and more weapons introduced to the game.</p>
<p><strong>Once Human is powered by your own proprietary engine. Do you plan to add some high-end features like ray tracing? I know that you work with NVIDIA on PC.</strong></p>
<p>Oh yes, that's something we are working with for DLSS and other high-tech, high-end technology we're trying to implement into our game. However, we still need to collaborate well with the third party to fit into our self-made engine because it's not Unreal Engine or Unity, so it takes longer to fit in.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any new blueprints in the next season of Once Human?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there will be. There will be new blueprints for the weapons and armor as well.</p>
<p><strong>Since the seasons reset progress, are you going to add some kind of progress retention for existing players at some point? Old players feel like they've lost everything and they'd like some acknowledgment of their previous work.</strong></p>
<p>Actually, we don't call it season reset; we call it season renewal because they don't actually lose what they've got, even though their level will be reset to level one. That's due to the consideration of providing fairness to the new players. Imagine if you were level 15 and you played against a level one; it's not fair to new players, and that's also the reason why we bring the scenario features because different seasons will have different rules of play.</p>
<p>So, even though they start again from level one, they will still enjoy the game as much as possible. It will not be a very repetitive growth path for them, even though they have to explore the same map or they have to level up from level one, but we gotta make sure that the content we provide in this scenario is interesting enough for them to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe some kind of badge, some indication on the display name that they are veteran players of Once Human.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that would make sense. The system I would say is not perfect yet, so we're trying to introduce more rewards for the old players, and the achievement system will be enriched in the future, so we are working on this, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

The campaign went live today and raised over $1 million on day one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-scorestreaks-black-ops-6-and-how-to-unlock-them/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Not that I would know from personal experience, but Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 features a compact selection of scorestreaks that reward you for playing well. The more you achieve in a match, the greater your chance of unlocking a killstreak, and some of these may change the outcome of a round. Here is a look at all scorestreaks in Black Ops 6 and how to unlock them!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-scorestreak-in-black-ops-6">Every Scorestreak in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>As of right now, these are the six scorestreaks in the Black Ops 6 multiplayer beta. We may see additional streak rewards added to the full release in October, and if that happens, we’ll update this piece with further information. For now, let’s look at what you can currently unlock by performing well in a match:</p>



<h3 id="h-scout-pulse">Scout Pulse</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Radar ping that reveals nearby enemies on the user’s minimap.”</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Requirement </strong>– Score 400</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-rc-xd">RC-XD</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Deploy a small remote-controlled, remote-detonated explosive vehicle.”</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Requirement </strong>– Score: 450</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-uav">UAV</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Aerial recon drone that reveals enemy locations on the minimap for your team.”</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Requirement </strong>– Score: 675 / Level 9</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-counter-uav">Counter UAV</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Launch a drone that scrambles enemy minimaps.”</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Requirement </strong>– Score: 700 / Level 15</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-watchdog-helo">Watchdog Helo</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Watchdog Helo that engages enemies and pings enemy locations for your team.”</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Requirement </strong>– Score: 1100</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-hellstorm">Hellstorm</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Control a long-range missile with brake and boost capabilities and secondary missiles.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Requirements </strong>– Score: 1200</li>
</ul>



<p>As the game will feature significantly more player levels than what’s in the current multiplayer beta, we suspect the unlock requirements for these scorestreaks will change before release. If they do, we’ll update this guide to keep you informed!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-scorestreaks-in-black-ops-6">How to Unlock Scorestreaks in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You’ll note that when you look in the Scorestreaks menu, a few options remain locked, while others are automatically equipped. Those that are closed off will have a lock icon in the top right corner, indicating a specific requirement before you can use that scorestreak.</p>



<p>More specifically, the UAV and Counter UAV are locked by default until you reach a specific level. Furthermore, with the Dispatcher Perk, you can reduce the cost of the Scout Pulse, UAV, and Counter UAV.</p>



<p>You can use any of the other killstreaks without any perks, though.</p>

Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics and Capcom Fighting Collection 2 are both now set to launch for Xbox next year following "technical discussions" with Microsoft, after the platform was omitted from Capcom's original release announcements.
</p>
<p>
Word of an Xbox release was conspicuously absent when Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection and Capcom Fighting Collection 2 were announced for PS4, Switch, and Steam back in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-nintendo-direct">June</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-in-todays-nintendo-direct-and-indie-world-showcases">August</a> respectively, frustrating fans on Microsoft's platform.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, with Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics' 12th September release looming, Capcom has <a href="https://x.com/CapcomUSA_/status/1830984496260219001">taken to social media</a> to reveal both upcoming titles will be making their way to Xbox after all. "We're excited to announce that after technical discussions with our partners at Microsoft, we can confirm that Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics will release on Xbox One," the publisher wrote.

Currently, both titles are scheduled for a vague "2025" release on Xbox One, so it's possible Capcom Fighting Collection 2 might just manage to launch at the same time as next year's previously announced Steam, Switch, and PS4 versions.
</p>
<p>
Capcom Fighting Collection 2, if you're unfamiliar, includes eight games: Capcom vs SNK, Capcom vs SNK 2, Project Justice, Capcom Fighting Evolution, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-alpha-3-upper">Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper</a>, Plasma Sword, Power Stone, and Power Stone 2.
