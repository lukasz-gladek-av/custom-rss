            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-legends-wild-rift">League of Legends: Wild Rift</a> executive producer David Xu has said Riot "can and will do better," after sharing an anniversary video to the game's account on Chinese social media site Weibo that very much looks to be AI slop.</p>
<p>However, Xu hasn't confirmed that the video did use AI in this sort-of-apology, instead claiming this was a "creator-made" video that'd found its way onto the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>' spin-off's official channels.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The video, since taken down from Weibo (but preserved for prosperity via Reddit and <a href="https://x.com/AroushTheKween/status/1952415263464603741">Twitter</a> reposts from bemused fans), depicts a big concert in celebration of Wild Rift's third anniversary. Or, as the text in the video spells it "aniversary," with the R in "3rd" looking very janky to boot. Several of your faves, including Jinx, Seraphine, and Yasuo, are doing their best to entertain a crowd who at several points look terrifyingly rubber-faced.</p>
<p>While I can't make out any six-fingered hands, there are plenty of visual glitches that you'd expect from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">generative AI</a>, from misbehaving tails to shapeshifting handguns that can't quite decide if they're firing bullets or lasers. Also, this might just be a mistranslation, given this vid appeared on Chinese socials, but one of the song's main lyrics being 'Can we turn up the blower higher' is sending me because it sounds like a Northern teenager gently moaning that they want the air con in their mum's car cranked up.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/comments/1mh5tlc/wild_rift_china_version_got_backlash/">Wild rift china version got backlash.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Winter_underdog/">u/Winter_underdog</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildrift/">wildrift</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Cue lots of miffed fans, and <a href="https://x.com/PapaSmoothie/status/1952850894137246151">Xu's response</a>. "Yesterday we posted a creator-made video on our official Weibo channel that, frankly, did not hit the mark," he wrote. "When we post content on our official channels, it's on us to maintain a high quality bar and be clear about where it came from. Thank you for all the feedback, we can and will do better."</p>
<p>So, allegedly it's all third-party content that shouldn't have gone up on main, but there's been no direct acknowledgement of the AIlephant in the room - or whether Riot might put out more stuff like this in the future. Xu also neglects to mention the video's apparent point of origin, which looks to be an AI production company called '异类Outliers', whose <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/696326982">BiliBili page</a> includes the Wild Rift anniversary video and a section header that machine translates as "Collection: Alien uses AI to introduce you to 100 aesthetic styles".</p>
<p>Thanks, Mr Alien, but I'm good.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/league-of-legends-wild-rift-exec-producer-says-ai-slop-looking-anniversary-video-did-not-hit-the-mark]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s Portal mode has been designed to make the game feel fresh “years after you first picked it up”. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-portal-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Battlefield Portal was returning to the main series this year, and we finally got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-upgrade-players-build-own-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmation</a> during BF6’s multiplayer reveal. The new Portal mode puts the tools for creating in the hands of players, allowing them to craft custom and unique experiences. Now, developers have revealed the philosophy behind the Portal mode. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-portal-mode-is-for-players-that-want-to-do-more-than-completing-a-game">Battlefield 6’s Portal Mode is For Players That Want to Do More than Completing a Game</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/battlefield-6-devs-explain-portal-map-maker-absolutely-essential-for-modern-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, UX director Alan Pimm revealed some new insights for BF6’s Portal mode. Pimm first spoke about how the developers are looking to improve the Portal from 2042. The mode had several “clever tools,” such as scripting your own AI, customising the mode to your preferences, and more. They realised that people want terrain options, where they can pick different bits and not just their modes, and also manipulate and play with them. </p>



<p>Pimm goes on to say that the new Battlefield 6 Portal creations can be certified as modes in their own right, such as a “locked weapons mode”. However, if players try to make an XP farm for themselves, they will be told, “Actually, you won’t get XP from this one”, along with other warnings in the Editor.  </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Pimm elaborates that players don’t want a game they can complete, they want to grow with it, evolve with it or “make their dreams come true”. Battlefield 6’s Portal mode was designed with one philosophy in mind: longevity. The developers want to make the game feel fresh, “years after you first picked it up”. </p>



<p>Pimm concluded, stating that some players play for only an hour, while others play for 8 hours straight. These tools will cater to all types of players, “listen to the whole community, and make it accessible to do as much as possible.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98battlefield-6-game-servers-full%E2%80%99-40-000-players-are-waiting-for-the-beta-to-start.1263375/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If this isn’t the biggest indication of how excited fans are for the Battlefield 6 beta to start, I don’t know what is. As I write this, more than 40,000 players are sitting in a queue to play the beta, being met with nothing more than a ‘Game Servers Full’ message on Battlefield 6’s title screen.</p>



<p>The number has skyrocketed in the last couple of hours, and it’s easy to see it hitting six figures soon enough. The first portion of the Battlefield 6 beta starts tomorrow, let’s just hope that the ‘Game Servers Full’ message disappears…</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-join-the-queue">Join the Queue</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is set to erupt this weekend as the beta welcomes millions of players (probably). From the multiplayer reveal last week to the countless leaks we’ve seen surface on social media in the last few months, everything is shaping up in Electronic Arts’ favor with Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Could this be the year it overtakes Call of Duty? The hype for Black Ops 7 couldn’t be lower right now.</p>



<p>If you open Battlefield 6 right now, you’ll be met with a message advising you: ‘Game Servers Full’. It’s not a representation of any technical error (I hope), but it’s more of a placeholder that’ll keep things contained and buttoned up until the beta goes live.</p>



<p>If nothing else, it’s entertaining to watch the number ebb and flow as more players attempt to open the Battlefield 6 beta, only to find it’s not live and they’ve got their timings wrong. Perhaps I need to get out more.</p>



<p>Here are a few handy resources if you’re sitting there and staring at the ‘Game Servers Full’ message:</p>

<p>The first round of the Battlefield 6 beta starts tomorrow at 08:00 UTC (1 AM PT). Have you got your squad ready? Let me know in the comments what role you’ll be playing.</p>

  </div><p>While it's a bit awkward to use with a mouse--the Tinder-like quality makes it more suited to smartphones or tablets--there are a huge range of games it can suggest. You can start "runs" in a few different ways, like starter packs based on the staff's personal picks, new and upcoming games, and recent discoveries. You can also start from specific games you like, or even based on the tastes of "experts." These include developers, journalists, streamers, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">While on runs, you can view trailers for each of the games to see if they take your fancy, and if they do, you can pin them to remind yourself to play them later. Don't worry about skipping past games either, as there's an undo button, and the whole thing is free too. Perhaps this will be a good way to cut down your Steam wishlist full of games you swear you'll buy eventually.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-battlefield-6-multiplayer-early-access-code</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-battlefield-6-multiplayer-early-access-code.1263357/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
You probably already know EA's about to hold a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta so you can check out its multiplayer component ahead of release, and you probably also know EA's holding an open beta <em>early access</em> event so you can get stuck in even earlier. But you might not be aware there's another way to get an early access key if you missed out previously.
</p>
<p>
As its name suggests, Battlefield 6's open beta is open to all, but the early access bit, running from 7th-8th August, is restricted. Everyone who signed up to EA's Battlefield Labs programme prior to 31st July is eligible to play early access, as is anyone that got a code from Battlefield 6's recent streamer showcase. EA Play Pro subscribers are also in, and key giveaways are seemingly still happening on Battlefield's official Discord, but the sentiment from EG team members who've tried there is basically be "good luck with that lol". Luckily, there's still one more opportunity to get involved if you don't yet have access, and it sounds relatively foolproof. 
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-open-beta-twitch-drops">detailed on the Battlefield website</a>, EA is also giving away keys during the early access period itself. Interested parties just need to link their EA and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> accounts, which you can <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/login?client_id=rg5jwqeyulmyy5s5zsu7juu2l3q1ue&amp;redirect_params=client_id%3Drg5jwqeyulmyy5s5zsu7juu2l3q1ue%26prompt%3Dnone%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Faccounts.ea.com%252Fconnect%252Flinking%252Fthirdparty%253Fcallback%253Dtrue%26response_type%3Dcode%26scope%3Duser_read%2Bviewing_activity_read%2Buser%253Aread%253Aemail%26state%3DRVMxOjIuMDoxLjA6U1Qya2ZocXJKQ3h1dE5jVWg6cnNjMmg">do can over on Twitch</a>, then simply watch 30 minutes of a participating Battlefield 6 streamer playing the open beta early access on either 7th or 8th August. Obviously, the sooner you watch, the sooner you can get stuck in yourself. One small caveat to all this: it's not entirely clear just how many keys will be available this way, with EA only saying "while supplies last".

It's probably also worth noting the Twitch giveaways continue beyond early access and into Battlefield 6's two open access weekends, which take place 7th-8th and 14th-17th August. Watch a participating streamer for one hour during these times and you'll unlock the Mimic Weapons Package; two hours unlocks the Landslide Soldier Skin, three hours unlocks the Shattered Vehicle Skin, and four hours unlocks the Imperial Skin. Don't forget to manually claim them from your Twitch Drops Inventory (you'll need to do this before the promotion expires), and they'll then be available when the full game launches for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 10th October. If you don't already know, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-where-to-buy">here's what's included in each edition</a>.
</p>
<p>
To access the beta itself, you'll need to download the Battlefield 6 open beta client from the platform store of your choice, and PC players looking to get involved should also be aware some prep work may be required ahead of time. EA has elsewhere noted players will <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/technical-issues/secure-boot/">need to activate Windows 10 and 11's Secure Boot security feature</a> in order to play. This, it says, "allows games supported by EA Javelin Anticheat to detect and remove bad actors, resulting in fewer cheaters and a better experience for players."
</p>
<p>
There's a lot riding on Battlefield 6 after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">disastrous Battlefield 2042</a>, and EA has spent plenty of energy trying to reassure fans it's getting things right this time. There've been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">plenty of community playtest sessions</a> via Battlefield Labs, and developers assurances have included promises this latest entry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">will avoid goofy crossover skins</a> in order to "stray true" to the series. There's also been talk of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">more focused maps and the return of classes</a>, but Eurogamer's Connor Makar was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">left "unconvinced" after a recent Battlefield 6 preview</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a> is, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/22/powerwash-simulator-review/">just like the original</a>, a pretty chill time. Presented with utterly implausibly dirty things to clean, you just methodically spray unending streams of water at them, scrubbing out that dirt one section at a time. It’s a borderline therapeutic experience, but how can a sequel be much more than just having more dirty things for you to spritz? Well, by giving you a few more ways to clean them for starters.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/ono5XRUQIzY</p>
<p>The core of PowerWash Simulator 2 remains pretty much identical, as each mission gives you something to clean that is literally caked in dirt from top to bottom, inside to out. It doesn’t matter if it’s a car, a piano or a whole building, it’s absolutely filthy to a comical degree. You’d think that a removals van would just be caked around the outside with the general grime from driving around –&nbsp;the kind that some kid would write a cheeky message in –&nbsp;and maybe a bit of dust and detritus from moving boxes inside, but no, it’s like a horror movie inside there as well.</p>



<p>Cleaning is a simple task or just pointing and squirting, choosing from a couple of different pressure washers, the spray width (which affects the range at which it can clean), and a handful of new options. You need to clean everything from every angle, so you’ll be getting right down to the ground to get under metallic trim and into wheel arches, angling into the grooves around the rear door, and climbing up to the roof to clear that as well! Each job is broken up into mini-goals that reward you with the ring of a bell for each sub-section you clean. A wing mirror here, a door handle there, and you’ve got that satisfying chime as you tick them off the list.</p>

<p>But that list can grow and evolve now through multi-stage levels, revealing messy horrors one section at a time. A rather futuristic public lavatory hides its filthy shame underground, asking you first to clean the top before it smoothly slides up and presents the full exterior, and once you’ve cleaned all of that up comes the abject horror of needing to clean the interior. It’s nice to have something dished out piecemeal like this, helping things feel more manageable, and also meaning that I didn’t need to break out any ladders to get up and clean the roof.</p>

<p>The art deco house, though, is a completely different kettle of fish. Here’s just this one monolithic task to clean, and we barely scratched the surface as time with our hands on session ticked away. I can absolutely see why having multi-stage levels helps in a game that’s all about being chill and relaxing, just breaking up some of the mental load of having a big hour-long clean up job.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of new tools and reworked ideas within PowerWash Simulator 2. There’s a new surface cleaner, which is a bit like a water jet-powered mop on an extendable arm –&nbsp;it’s nice, but as you need to get pretty close up for it to reach out and work, I’ve not really felt the need to use it over a wider angled spread, though it’s no doubt going to please a bunch of carpet cleaning enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Soap is now fantastic, though. Instead of being a strange modifier spray that washed away particular types of dirt, it’s now a grime-busting lather that combines all the strengths of Mr. Muscle, Jif – I still refuse to call it Cif – and Cillit Bang into one. Basically, you spray the soap over everything and then, where you might have had to switch nozzle strengths to scrub away stubborn dirt, any strength spray will wash it all away. It might actually be a bit more work as you do actually have to go over everything twice, but it doesn’t really feel like it. Just note that you can only cover so much with soap before you need to reload… which here will actually remove all the soap that you’ve put down.</p>
<p>Some tasks will need you to get up and down the sides of buildings, and there’s some great new tools to let you do just that. A platform scissor lift is a handy accompaniment to more traditional scaffolding and ladders, but the star of the show is a window cleaner’s dream abseil, a simple dangling seat that you can move up, down, left and right to clean the side of high up places. This was put to great use when cleaning a huge billboard advert. Too high up for scaffolding to reasonably reach, and with a platform that only lets you get back so far, the abseil seat is the only real option for getting access to these large spaces. It works great, though there is a momentary fumble as you get on and off and have to adjust to the shifting axis of movements.</p>

<p>There’s plenty more to PowerWash Simulator 2 that we didn’t really get to toy with, from the customisable home base, to designing van liveries, to playing co-op online or in split-screen, and the career story, though we did at least get to give Ulysses the cat and some random kittens a little tickle every now and then. What’s most important, though, is that this retains that soothing essence of the reverse colouring book gameplay, with a few new options and tools just adding a smidgeon more variety.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-indie-world-direct-hollow-knight-silksong/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-expect-to-see-hollow-knight-silksong-at-the-nintendo-indie-world-direct-tomorrow.1263330/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Nintendo <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1952716473656385840">announced</a> that it would be hosting a Nintendo Indie World Direct on Thursday, August 7, 2025, at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST. Like its previous indie-focused presentations, it'll be a shorter, 15-minute long direct, with updates and announcements for several indie games, but according to Nintendo-focused creator and leaker Switchforce, don't expect one of those games to be Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>



<p>Last week, Nintendo hosted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">Partner Showcase Direct</a>, which included several announcements from its third-party partners, like the release date reveal for <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-launches-september-5/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, a new Octopath Traveler game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-announced/">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-nintendo-switch-2-2026/">Monster Hunter Stories 3's</a> reveal, and a new HD-2D action-RPG from Square Enix called <a href="https://wccftech.com/hd-2d-arpg-the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2-demo-now-available/">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>, to name a few.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It was technically a showcase where Silksong could have shown up, but like many other potential games that could've appeared, it was absent. Tomorrow's Indie World direct is the second Nintendo presentation in two weeks, and while it's once again another place where Silksong could appear, Switchforce claims that it's not going to happen.</p>



<p>"<em>You do not have Hollow Knight: Silksong being shown off this Thursday, I'll just tell you that right now. I know some people are getting very excited, but as far as I'm aware, that is not in the cards.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Just Got Even Better — And There’s MORE Coming👀" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tuvr5j3HvXQ?start=203&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Switchforce continues to point out a key factor as to why we probably won't see it tomorrow, which is the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Silksong is confirmed to be at Gamescom 2025</a>, and that there will be a demo available for attendees to check out the game themselves. If any Silksong news is coming soon, it'll likely happen at the same event where people could immediately try it out after learning of a release date, for example.</p>



<p>So if you're anxiously awaiting any spec of news on Silksong, keep your anxieties under control until <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/onl">Gamescom ONL 2025</a> on August 19, 2025. Silksong is very likely to grace that showcase, since those at Gamescom will be able to watch the new trailer, potentially have a release date to look forward to, and then try it out for themselves on the show floor the next day.</p>



<p>Which is hopefully what happens. It's been years of players waiting and hoping to see Silksong at every big showcase, whether it's a Nintendo showcase or not. It'll be good to put this all to bed when we finally get a release date, and when Silksong is finally on store shelves. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) has announced that it's acquired the rights to&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer</em>, an influential video game magazine from the 1980s that may well be able to claim a number of firsts.</p>

<p>In a press release, the foundation calls&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer&nbsp;</em>"one of the most important video game magazines of the industry's 'golden age'", which is the motivating factor behind the charity's mission to "locate and meticulously digitize" the magazine's "entire eight-year run" between 1982 and 1990.</p>

<p>According to the VGHF,&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer&nbsp;</em>is the first female-owned gaming magazine in history; it was owned and operated by sister duo Marylou Badeaux and Celeste Dolan. Not only that, but it was also "the only console-focused magazine" to survive the infamous '80s gaming industry crash.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/computer-entertainer-video-game-history-foundation-page.jpg?itok=ieD3_i-I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/computer-entertainer-video-game-history-foundation-page.jpg?itok=-7G0LaaL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Computer Entertainer&nbsp;</em>is a real blast from the past.</figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to VGHF's efforts,&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer</em>'s entire back catalog is now available to read for free via the foundation's <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/519c0dbd-0f5d-45fe-83c2-355a756391a95a756391a9" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Archive</a>, a repository of gaming-related materials that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-game-history-foundation-free-online-library" rel="nofollow">opened earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>The library is free for anyone to access, and thanks to its Creative Commons 4.0 license, you can even use it commercially if you wish. Since the VGHF is a nonprofit, though, a <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">donation or two</a> might not go amiss if you're intending to do so, eh?</p>

<p><em>Computer Entertainer</em>'s firsts go beyond its origins and its longevity; it may, according to VGHF, have been the only English-language gaming magazine to cover the original&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>at launch, and it was also one of the first publications to review games like&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Metroid</em>.</p>

<p>You can check out a video detailing the Video Game History Foundation's acquisition of&nbsp;<em>Computer Entertainer</em>, as well as a history of the magazine and its importance in the industry, right here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh light has been shone on an interview that claims Nintendo once suggested Pokémon's beloved mascot Pikachu should have breasts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The interview, with The Pokémon Company's veteran CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara, dates back around 25 years, and is in Japanese — something that has prompted debate over the exact translation of what Ishihara originally said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, however, Japanese site <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/07/29/155531.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game*Spark</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-of-america-really-did-suggest-giving-pikachu-large-feminine-breasts-at-one-point-japanese-media-confirms/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>) has examined the original interview in detail to uncover as firm an interpretation as possible — and yes, it really does seem to be what it sounds like.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Firstly, let's examine what Ishihara says, before further discussing the specific issue over the word "breasts." For context, Ishihara is discussing an early conversation he had with Nintendo of America employees regarding the localisation of the Pokémon franchise — before it launched in the West and became the global phenomenon it is today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When I first showed Pokémon to them, they told me it was too cute," Ishihara recalled. "The staff at Nintendo of America then suggested their own designs for the characters – I won't show those illustrations to anyone as long as I live, but they kind of looked like the characters from the Cats musical.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, for example, Pikachu was changed into a character shaped like a kind of a tabby cat with huge breasts."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/cats-official-trailer-00-01-54-1754483355008.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Taylor Swift in the Cats Musical movie. Image credit: Universal.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Automaton notes, there is some debate here about the exact Japanese word used to describe "breasts," which could also mean pronounced masculine pecs. However, there's added context in what is said next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Ishihara is asked whether he means breasts "like those girls who do Pikachu cosplays at anime conventions," the CEO replies in the affirmative. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yes, exactly," Ishihara states, "they presented that kind of design to us for real. I thought it was interesting, in a sense of appreciating such cultural differences. However, I didn't want to compete in the [overseas] market with that kind of thing."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/untitled-1-1754483413321.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Cosplay Pikachu.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One final wrinkle in the matter is a subsequent anecdote from the late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, who in 2008 recalled early localisation conversations that featured a westernised Pikachu concept with big muscles, in an attempt to make the mascot "stronger and scarier." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, as Game*Spark notes, this could simply refer to an additional concept also being discussed in the same meetings, as Nintendo suggested a range of alterations. And, if anything, it's yet more proof that Nintendo once had some eye-opening ideas to change the design of some Pokémon for the franchise's rollout outside of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Judging by the popularity of Pokémon today, and the failure of Cats' movie adaptation, that's probably for the best.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Universal.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p dir="ltr">Xbox is going through an identity crisis. The most recent wave of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#8">layoffs at Microsoft</a>, which cut about 9,000 jobs including numerous positions at studios under the Xbox banner, suggests as much. These cost-cutting measures are said to be in the service of some realignment or reorganization that's always purported to set up these companies for greater success. And yet they keep happening, further eroding any trust and goodwill the brand may have built up from previous successes. After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-10000-people-cuts-reportedly-include-xbox-and-bethesda/1100-6510650/">several waves of job cuts</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/">restructurings</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/">pivots in strategy</a>, and any other corporate jargon I've neglected to mention, I'm beginning to suspect that Xbox's growing instability deserves more scrutiny and concern from its developers and consumers alike.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's be direct: The journey that Xbox has been on over the last decade appears to be a failure. Its famous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-criticism-of-lack-of-xbox-one-games-microsof/1100-6459602/">spree of purchases</a> and the subsequent management of its studios has churned out about as many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-launch-was-like-a-runner-tripping-and-falling-at-the-finish-line-xbox-boss-says/1100-6508915/">blemished games</a> as it has delays, cancellations, and studio closures. That isn't to say Xbox hasn't produced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-series-x-games/2900-3818/">hits and gems</a>, but along the way there, Xbox has also built up quite the track record of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xboxs-recent-history-of-missing-and-or-canceled-games/2900-6775/">critically panned games, cancelled projects, and defunct teams</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Xbox Studio Closures Are Confusing | Spot On</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">No matter the aspect that you place under the microscope, Xbox is clearly bleeding through the bandages it keeps applying. Take a glimpse at the stable of teams at Xbox Game Studios, Microsoft's internal publishing division. Its most recent layoff resulted in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/">closure of at least one team</a> under the banner, The Initiative, and the cancellation of its game Perfect Dark. Turn 10, one of its stalwart developers on the Forza franchise, has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/">reportedly cut</a> to the bone. Rare, which was working on Everwild while maintaining the live-service title Sea of Thieves, is invariably in a worse position on the other side of the layoffs than it was before.</p><p dir="ltr">The brunt of the damage from moves like these falls on the affected teams and their workers, and it's a disappointingly common move for Xbox, which has done this at least once before when a similar reorganizing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/">shuttered four teams</a> in May 2024, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. These closures came within a few short years of Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/">Another layoff</a> followed shortly after the completed purchase of Activision Blizzard, cutting several jobs across its teams and leading to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-untitled-survival-game-has-been-canceled-after-president-leaves-report/1100-6520603/">cancellation of a survival game at Blizzard</a>. The fact remains that bringing Bethesda's tremendous portfolio of megaton hits like Fallout and The Elder Scrolls in-house, as well as Activision Blizzard (and mobile developer King), should've stemmed the bloodloss, but Xbox's hemorrhaging and proclivity for retail therapy only seemed to worsen with each purchase. Anything else suggests the reckless endangerment of an entire industry.</p><p dir="ltr">These moves should've uniformly led to greater stability for developers under the Xbox banner and a greater deal of games on the platforms. They didn't. Some studios, like Obsidian, have miraculously flourished under these conditions, producing new franchises and hits in existing ones, solidifying its place in Xbox's crumbling hierarchy of studios. Others, like Arkane Austin, haven't been as lucky. And gamers and developers alike suffer when that's the case. If everyone's going through it, who exactly is benefitting from Xbox's continued vision--or lack thereof?</p><p dir="ltr">The motivation behind many of these purchases is an obvious one: Game Pass. Since its launch in 2017, the subscription service has been Xbox's biggest talking point, and as the years have passed, it has grown into the single biggest driver for engagement with the gaming division. Following the Xbox One's opening fumbles and hurdles, Microsoft devised a silver bullet that could rebuild its ecosystem and assure its biggest and smallest games had an audience. The service has even paid for the development of independent and third-party titles, making it a lifeline to some.</p><p dir="ltr">But Game Pass has been a pain to grow despite its occasional surges, and its continued upkeep remains costly despite <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1942469649423052857" rel="nofollow ">Xbox's claims that the service is profitable</a>, with some major caveats. As a result, Xbox has even transformed Game Pass for the worse, introducing tiers that sell greater benefits for high-paying subscribers, all the while stripping access to portions of the expansive game library from members at the lowest levels. This move is a sharp reversal of Game Pass' earliest promises to connect gamers to the breadth of the console's titles. What once was often touted as the best deal in gaming has now become so diluted that it is now more anti-consumer than its original incarnation. Another line crossed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544850-4525152-perfectdarkcanceled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544850" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544850-4525152-perfectdarkcanceled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544850"></a><figcaption>An image from the recently cancelled Perfect Dark reboot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544850-4525152-perfectdarkcanceled.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And though Game Pass <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-microsoft-has-paid-hundreds-of-millions-to-devs/1100-6501901/">funds the development</a> of a number of projects, and still does, many developers have spoken up about how Game Pass has actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-hurts-sales-says-dev-behind-xbox-game-pass-title/1100-6514084/">hurt their teams and titles</a>. Mike Rose of the indie publisher No More Robots has been pretty open in the past about how Game Pass can assure a huge launch audience, which is great for teams struggling to find players, but also noted how the team's games would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-xbox-game-pass-is-so-attractive-for-devs-whether-it-cannibalizes-sales-or-not/1100-6512698/">see little change in sales after being on the service</a>. Instead, it typically got spikes just as it was entering the subscription service. Raphael Colantonio, founder of Arkane and later Wolfeye Studios, has become one of the service's biggest critics, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arkane-co-founder-unloads-on-game-pass-calls-it-unsustainable/1100-6532991/">recently opining</a> that it is an "unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by [Microsoft's] 'infinite money.'" An isolated incident would be one thing, but grievances like Colantonio's have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-who-launched-game-into-game-pass-warns-against-launching-games-into-game-pass/1100-6532306/">continually cropped up</a> over the years, even if there are other stories that cite Game Pass as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-release-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-report/1100-6531671/">instrumental to a game's success</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The evidence points to a concerning trend in the Xbox camp that doesn't appear to be going anywhere, and the more it's left as-is, the more likely it seems that developers will have to make a tough decision about their futures in Microsoft's ecosystem.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it's hard to prove either side is wrong or right due to the fact that Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-a-new-paradigm/1100-6498307/">obscures any numbers</a> that could illuminate or disprove these arguments--numbers that Bloomberg's Jason Schreier refers to as "<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ltheyncqbc2h" rel="nofollow ">squishy metrics</a>" subject to the whims of "dark accounting wizardry." This means that teams looking for a publishing deal with Xbox simply need to take the company at its word when evaluating whether Game Pass is the right move for their game and their business. But what good is that word with the uncertainty that has persistently hung over Xbox's motivations and decisions for much of the last decade? Is it worth it to take that opportunity and fund that game if the near-future of your team continues to hang in the balance? Doesn't Xbox owe its developers more than false promises of stability once they join the Game Pass service considering how impactfully it can hurt a team's bottom line? Doesn't it owe the same kind of dependability to its subscribers?</p><p dir="ltr">I feel that answering these questions requires more foresight than I've observed from the brand. After all, this is the gaming giant that settled on the multimedia-heavy approach to the Xbox One that crippled the console out of the gate, and then took away Xbox users' ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-no-longer-offers-movies-and-tv-shows-to-buy-or-rent-but-there-are-other-ways/1100-6533271/">purchase and own digital movies and TV shows</a> recently. It's also the company that settled on an "Everything is an Xbox" marketing campaign that deemphasized the system itself after giving up so much ground to its contemporaries. The campaign isn't an affront itself, but when paired with the worsening Game Pass service, which is how the company can afford to turn smart TVs, Amazon Fire Sticks, and even your PC into an Xbox, the rottenness of the tactic becomes more apparent. Xbox's direction seems to pivot with the wind, and it means that the consumers who buy into its products, as well as the engineers who make them, and the developers that then work to give them value, constantly feel like they're sold up the river for the next big thing that the company does.</p><p dir="ltr">I don't feel answers coming any time soon. If the latest layoffs are any indication, Xbox's path forward is set in stone, and whatever may come of it has already been deemed worthy of the sacrifice it took to to be realized. As Christopher Dring of The Game Business succinctly puts it, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/the-xbox-we-knew-is-dead" rel="nofollow ">the Xbox we knew is dead</a>. And with it is any semblance of faith this industry and culture can muster for it.</p>

However, it's not the only game set to release that day; a new contender has appeared on the horizon, riding like the wind to try to steal the throne. Today, Outright Games and Mattel have announced Barbie: Horse Trails, a new "open-world adventure" featuring the iconic character.</p><p dir="ltr">Barbie: Horse Trails will let players choose between two characters--Barbie "Brooklyn" Roberts and Barbie "Malibu" Roberts--as they ride through Canterbury Trails Park, a landscape made up of multiple open areas. Each area holds new mysteries to solve, items to collect, and quests to complete as the duo, along with park rangers, try to "refresh and beautify" the park.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCm0_iOihMg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dCm0_iOihMg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Along with the main quest, multiple side missions will feature characters from the Barbie universe, including Ken, Teresa, Nikki, and Daisy. Other activities included in this new game will include a photo mode that players can use to document clues while solving mysteries, horse-care mechanics that will allow them to build their relationship with their horse, as well as customizable outfits, riding gear, and accessories.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with Battlefield 6 and now Barbie: Horse Trails, October is shaping up to be the busiest month of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025-upcoming-games-release-schedule/1100-6526471/">2025 schedule</a> for the video game industry, as multiple high-profile titles are scheduled to launch between October 1 and Halloween.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>THQ Nordic and developer Grimlore Games have announced that their action RPG&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>has hit a big sales milestone just three days out from its release.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/TitanQuestGame/status/1952717544046915624" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a>, the two studios confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II</em>, which was released in Early Access on PC via Steam on August 1st, managed to hit 300,000 sales just under 72 hours after its launch.</p>

<p>The game has already managed to reach number 17 on Steam's top sellers list at time of writing, beating out longtime stalwarts like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sims-4" rel="nofollow"><em>The Sims 4</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rimworld" rel="nofollow"><em>RimWorld</em></a>, and Valve's own&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/team-fortress-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Team Fortress 2</em></a>&nbsp;(two of which are, admittedly, free-to-play, but microtransactions are a big business, after all).</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>is, it's the sequel to the 2006 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em>, which was developed by the Massachusetts-based studio Iron Lore.</p>

<p>Sadly, following the release of the original&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em>, Iron Lore folded, but former members of the studio would go on to found Crate Entertainment, whose name you might recognize from action RPG (and unofficial&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor)&nbsp;<em>Grim Dawn</em>.</p>

<p>The new game, meanwhile, is being helmed by German outfit Grimlore Games, the studio responsible for fantasy RTS&nbsp;<em>SpellForce 3&nbsp;</em>(but not for 2023's spinoff&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spellforce-conquest-of-eo" rel="nofollow"><em>SpellForce: Conquest of Eo</em></a>, if you're still following me).</p>




<p><em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>pits you against Nemesis, the Goddess of Retribution, who is "corrupting the Threads of Fate and condemning all who oppose her to Eternal Punishment". You'll be battling creatures from Greek mythology in&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-style action RPG combat to put a stop to her schemes.</p>

<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, where it'll set you back $23.99 (at time of writing; it's available at a 20% discount right now).</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-wont-feature-at-upcoming-indie-world-showcase-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-won%E2%80%99t-feature-at-upcoming-indie-world-showcase-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1263285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new claim suggests that Hollow Knight: Silksong will not be featured during the Indie World Showcase this week, on August 7, 2025. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Nintendo recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-indie-world-showcase-for-august-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> an Indie World Showcase for this week, and what surprised players was that the announcement came less than a week after their Nintendo Direct <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-july-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partner Showcase</a>. Many players got their hopes high, thinking they might get to see more of Hollow Knight: Silksong at this event, but new reports say otherwise. </p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-is-not-on-the-cards-for-indie-world-showcase">Hollow Knight: Silksong is ‘Not on the Cards’ for Indie World Showcase</h2>



<p>The claim about Hollow Knight: Silksong comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tuvr5j3HvXQ&amp;t=203s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SwitchForce</a> (via <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/08/06/nintendo-indie-world-leaker-says-hollow-knight-silksong-wont-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MyNintendoNews</a>), the person responsible for leaking a Nintendo showcase for this week. In his new YouTube video, SwitchForce states that, as far as he is aware, Hollow Knight: Silksong is “not on the cards” for the upcoming event, and he doesn’t expect it to get the “Indie World treatment” as it’s grown far bigger than that. </p>



<p>SwitchForce notes that players will be able to see Hollow Knight: Silksong at Gamescom, as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> will also be available there. He added that “a lot of the marketing has now shifted towards Xbox” for the upcoming title, and they will be “housing that demo for their upcoming portables at Gamescom. </p>

<p>The last update we received for Hollow Knight: Silksong was in June, when the game’s website <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-website-receives-big-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwent a major refresh</a>. Additionally, a leaker has claimed that the game is expected to release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-before-end-of-summer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before the end of Summer 2025</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">There's no question that continuing the success of the PlayStation 5 is one of Sony's top priorities, especially given that its latest console is getting closer to five years old. The Japanese tech giant has yet to formally announce the PlayStation 6, but over the past few months there have been some developments that have allowed us some rare insight into what shape the eventual console might take.</p><p dir="ltr">In this post, we're rounding up everything we know about Sony's PlayStation 6, a potential new Sony handheld, and what the future of console gaming might look like. Keep checking back for more as we update this post as new information comes to light the closer we get to an eventual release date in the next few years.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="PS6_Release_Date__Potential_Price">PS6 Release Date, Potential Price</h4><p dir="ltr">Since no formal announcement has been made for the PlayStation 6, there's no release window to speak of. Taking the company's previous console generation cadence into consideration, one could assume that a PS6 could release in 2027. That would be seven years after the PS5, which itself launched seven years after the PS3. But the gaming industry has changed dramatically since then, which is evident in how long support for the PS4 has stuck around this far into a new generation of hardware. Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida recently shared that "2028 feels right" when asked about the PS6, but notably hasn't been at Sony since the end of 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite this, Sony Interactive Entertainment‘s new president and CEO <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-6-sony-says-future-platforms-top-of-mind-exploring-new-and-enhanced-ways-to-play/" rel="nofollow ">Hideaki Nishino stated in a business segment meeting</a> in 2024 that "the future of the (PlayStation) platform is top of mind. We are committed to exploring a new and enhanced way for players to engage with our content and services.”</p><p dir="ltr">Pricing would be similarly difficult to estimate, especially without any indication of the hardware specification that Sony is targeting. Most recently, Sony released the PS5 Pro, which retailed for $700 and offers the most powerful console-gaming experience on the market. That was a $200 premium over the price of the PS5 at launch. Whether the PS6 matches the pricing of the best PS5 on the market or falls between the two has yet to be seen, and will likely be affected by the continuing trade war and inflation.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="PS6_Potential_Specs">PS6 Potential Specs</h4><p dir="ltr">Sony has committed to hardware in the face of the growing popularity of cloud-based services, saying that the majority of players still want a console that plays games locally.</p><p dir="ltr">"Cloud gaming is increasingly providing an additional option for players to access content, but our belief is that the majority of players continue to want to play and experience gaming through local execution without dependency on network conditions," Nishino said. "PS5 and PS5 Pro have validated this thesis, I believe."</p><p dir="ltr">There are no current concrete specifications for the PS6, but we do at least know that AMD will be providing hardware for the next-generation console. This shouldn't be that surprising, given that AMD has powered both the PS4 and PS5, and could bode well for backwards compatibility.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="PS6__The_Role_of_AI">PS6: The Role of AI</h4><p dir="ltr">Sony's partnership with AMD extends beyond hardware alone. Sony announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324317/amd-playstation-ai-work-better-graphics-project-amethyst" rel="nofollow ">Project Amethyst</a> in partnership with AMD when lead architect Mark Cerny revealed the news during the PS5 Pro breakdown, suggesting that the two companies are planning to work closely together on the future of graphical enhancements and the hardware that empowers it.</p><p dir="ltr">This has already borne fruit, with Cerny saying that the latest version on the PS5 Pro-exclusive upscaler, PSSR, will be using AMD's recently released RDNA 4 suite of AI-powered upscaling options, which debuted with the RX 9070 series of graphics cards. Cerny says that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pros-pssr-will-get-an-upgrade-in-2026/1100-6530019/">latest version of PSSR </a>will be a drop-in replacement for the current implementation in 2026 and, more importantly, it will help inform the future of this technology for newer hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">While AMD is expected to release new graphics cards in 2026 that support a newer version of RDNA, Cerny cautioned that Sony isn't exactly beholden to the same timelines. "AMD is moving extremely quickly," <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-mark-cerny-explains-why-your-ps5-pro-is-getting-an-upgrade-in-2026" rel="nofollow ">Cerny said</a>. "What I'm trying to do is prepare for the next generation of consoles, so my timeframe is multi-year here."</p><p dir="ltr">What this all means is that hardware is no longer the only determining factor in the power of a future console. PSSR is only supported on the PS5 Pro currently, given its requirement for hardware to drive its AI-powered upscaling, and suggests the same will be true for the PS6. AMD is expected to power the next Xbox too, and the ways in which both Microsoft and Sony work with AMD might determine how well any platform-specific branches of these upscaling features work. Those alone could be big differentiators during the next console generation.</p><p dir="ltr">With that said, AMD Computing &amp; Graphics SVP and GM Jack Huynh did state in a <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1940049247920943136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1940049247920943136%7Ctwgr%5Ef7c487b8895af695c0410a305a57a77e4f7492d6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstationlifestyle.net%2F2025%2F07%2F01%2Fps6-push-boundaries-graphically-amd-playstation%2F" rel="nofollow ">tweet</a> about Project Amethyst that AMD and Sony are "developing high-quality neural networks that push the boundaries of real-time game graphics," suggesting that the PS6 will hopefully be a meaningful leap forward in terms of visual rendering that some have suggested was lacking with the PS5.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="A_PlayStation_Handheld_With_The_PS6_">A PlayStation Handheld With The PS6?</h4><p dir="ltr">According to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-reportedly-developing-a-ps5-portable-system/1100-6528023/">Bloomberg report in 2024</a>, Sony is potentially in the planning phases of a new gaming handheld--the company's first since the PS Vita. The handheld is reportedly being designed to play PS5 games natively, but might still be years away from announcement if Sony decides to pursue its development.</p><p dir="ltr">Sony did launch the PS Portal in 2023, which initially acted solely as a means to play your PS5 games remotely over a local network. It has since received an update to add the ability to stream games from the cloud to expand its capabilities away from your console.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS Portal was reportedly initially conceived as a new handheld platform entirely before plans changed closer to its release. Given its popularity, and that of other handheld consoles such as the Nintendo Switch 2, Steam Deck, and Asus ROG Ally, Sony might be thinking the time is right for another attempt at the handheld market. Microsoft is planning the same too, albeit with a partnership with Asus for the time being.</p>

<p>The original Fallout was created as a sequel to EA’s 1988 title, Wasteland, Interplay’s former co-founder has revealed. However, they did all they could to avoid being sued by EA. </p>



<p>The original Fallout title came almost a decade after (1997) the first Wasteland game (1988), and both games had the same developers, Interplay. However, Wasteland was published by EA, and Fallout was developed and published by Interplay. Now, Interplay’s co-founder has revealed that many people are unaware that Fallout was a sequel to Wasteland. </p>



<h2 id="h-interplay-did-everything-to-avoid-being-sued-by-ea">Interplay Did Everything to Avoid Being Sued by EA</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-was-a-sequel-to-wasteland-says-interplay-co-founder-and-we-did-everything-we-could-not-to-be-sued-by-electronic-arts-after-the-devs-had-to-pivot-out-of-the-follow-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Brian Fargo, the co-founder of Interplay, revealed new details about Fallout and Wasteland during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjeRn2eA3y4&amp;t=2766s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mr.MattyPlays</a>. Fargo explicitly stated that a lot of people don’t know that Fallout “was a sequel to Wasteland.” Fargo explained that players are unaware of the story behind it, but “that’s why it went from tunnels and trolls and then we needed a system – mercenaries, spies, and private eyes – and then that’s how we got the skill-based system with Wasteland, and then that went to Fallout.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The former co-founder explains that while developing Fallout, even though it took heavy inspiration from Wasteland, Interplay did everything they could “not to be sued by Electronic Arts”. Fallout even had “your life ends in the Wasteland”, Fargo stated. However, he loves that the game has an origin story that he is very proud of, and he learned a lot from his time on the original Wasteland. </p>



<p>Fargo eventually did make sequels for the Wasteland series as the studio head at inExile Entertainment, with Wasteland 2 releasing in 2014 and Wasteland 3 releasing in 2020. </p>



<p>In other news, the Fallout: Bakersfield trailer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-bakersfield-trailer-reveals-insane-take-1997/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveals an insane take</a> on the 1997 classic. Additionally, Fallout 5 has reportedly been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-bethesda-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fully greenlit</a>, according to a recent claim.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-crossplay-cross-platform-status-explained.1263246/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded embraces unity and squad goals. With multiplayer available, implementing crossplay is a must, but it isn’t always easy. This handy guide has answers to all key crossplay and cross-progression questions.</p>



<p>The Coalition could have simply brought back Gears 1’s campaign, and that’s it. But no, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> has the campaign, co-op, and authentic multiplayer. It’s the complete package for one of the most beloved shooters of our time.</p>



<p>The second you mention multiplayer, the word ‘crossplay’ usually follows. Many games utilize crossplay, so let’s see if Gears of War: Reloaded is the same.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-crossplay-in-gears-of-war-reloaded">Is There Crossplay in Gears of War: Reloaded?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>My brother. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Gears of War: Reloaded boasts complete crossplay functionality at launch, meaning you can hop into online campaign sessions and multiplayer matches with players from other formats.</strong></p>



<p>It really is the total package, isn’t it? The Coalition has confirmed through the official <a href="https://www.gearsofwar.com/games/gears-reloaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reloaded</a> website that the game has: “Crossplay across platforms, allowing you and your friends to squad-up wherever you play.”</p>



<p>There’s nothing wrong with you flying solo. However, if you desperately need allies to help you complete the impossible Insane difficulty, crossplay allows you to team up and take down Locusts without restrictions.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-have-cross-progression">Does Gears of War: Reloaded Have Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p><strong>Cross-progression is available for Gears of War: Reloaded, which allows you to transfer your save data across compatible platforms.</strong></p>



<p>We’re two for two so far in this guide! We defer to Reloaded’s official site once more on this one: “Jump from one platform to another and your campaign saves as well as multiplayer progression will come with you.”</p>



<p>This is two-fold:</p>



<ul>
<li>You can save your campaign progress on one format and resume where you left off elsewhere.</li>



<li>Your online multiplayer data you’ve accrued is also transferable across Reloaded’s applicable platforms.</li>
</ul>



<p>You’re not hindered by one platform. Let me explain more about that below for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-platforms-is-gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-compatible-with">Which Platforms is Gears of War: Reloaded Crossplay Compatible With?</h2>



<p><strong>Gears of War: Reloaded’s crossplay and cross-progression functions apply to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>You can buy and own Reloaded on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. In short, any save data on one console can be loaded on another or a PC. I know many of you own multiple platforms in this day and age, so it’s nice to see The Coalition fully embrace this.</p>



<p>Sorry to Nintendo Switch 2 owners, it doesn’t look like there’s any love for you guys right now.</p>



<hr>



<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has everything and more. Is it an easy day-one purchase for you? What’s the first thing you’ll do when you get it? Let me know through the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Genshin Impact "Memories of This Life" Animated Short</p>
      </div>
<p>Starting February 25, 2026, all in-game purchases for the PS4 edition will be removed from the PlayStation Store, and all update support for Genshin Impact will end on April 8, 2026. This will result in players no longer being able to log in to the game on PS4. MiHoYo says it will start reminding players of this change later this year. As for the mobile versions of Genshin Impact, <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408846" rel="nofollow ">MiHoYo says</a> those devices will need to meet these updated requirements:</p><h3>Genshin Impact: Updated Minimum and Recommended Android Requirements</h3><ul><li>ARMv8-A 64-bit architecture</li><li>Non-PowerVR GPU</li><li>SoC: Snapdragon 660 (Adreno 610) or Helio G88 (Snapdragon 855 or Dimensity 1000 or Kirin 980 and above recommended)</li><li>RAM: 4GB (6GB or more recommended)</li><li>Operating System: Android 10.0 and above (Android 12.0 and above recommended)</li></ul><h3>Genshin Impact: Updated Minimum and Recommended iOS Requirements</h3><ul><li>Supported iOS devices: iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X, iPad mini (5th generation) or iPad Air (3rd generation) or iPad (8th generation) and later models (iPhone 12 series or iPad (9th generation) and later models recommended)</li><li>iPhone devices with Apple A11 or later, or iPad devices with Apple A12 or above</li><li>RAM: 3GB (4GB or more recommended)</li><li>Operating System: iOS 13.0 and above</li></ul><p>While Genshin Impact could be losing a chunk of its audience with the discontinuation of the PS4 edition, it is worth noting that the number of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-4-years-later-ps5-has-more-monthly-users-than-ps4/1100-6532430/">monthly active users on PS5 recently surpassed those on PS4</a>, according to Sony. Both consoles had a combined playerbase of 124 million users--as of March 31--and spending on peripherals, services, and content has also increased on PlayStation consoles.</p><p>Genshin Impact is also playable on PC and Xbox Series X|S, and MiHoYo has several other live-service games under its umbrella like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/honkai-star-rail/">Honkai: Star Rail</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/zenless-zone-zero/">Zenless Zone Zero</a>.</p>

            <p>The Humble bundle building team has detailed its August Choice collection of games, which includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5 Royal</a>, Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and My Time at Sandrock, to name three.</p>
<p>The Humble Choice subscription offering provides a monthly set of PC games which members claim to own forever. This month, members can get their hands on the following titles as part of their Humble subscription:</p>

<li>Let's School!</li>

<p>As ever, Choice membership fees include a five percent donation to charity. This month's charity is DonorsChoose. Here's a little bit about it all:</p>
<p>"DonorsChoose is the leading way to give to public schools. Since 2000, 6.5 million people and partners have contributed $1.8bn to support more than three million teacher requests for classroom resources and experiences.</p>
<p>"As the most trusted crowdfunding platform for teachers, donors, and district administrators alike, DonorsChoose vets each request, ships the funded resources directly to the classroom, and provides thank yous and reporting to donors and school leaders."</p>
<p>You can find more information via <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/">donorschoose.org</a>.</p>

<p>So, what of the games themselves? Personally, i quite like the sound of Wildmender, pictured above, which is described as a "desert gardening survival game".</p>
<p>Then there's My Time At Sandrock , which fully released in 2023, after a successful Kickstarter in 2020 followed by an early access period in 2022. It's a follow-up to My Time at Portia, and treads a similar path to its gentle farming and life simulation predecessor, though this time set in sandier frontier-esque surroundings.</p>
<p>Banishers: Ghost of New Eden, meanwhile, is a supernatural action-RPG from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> studio Don't Nod. We awarded it four out of five stars on its release. "Don't Nod drops the melodrama for a poignantly performed story about grief and injustice, where the difficult choices tug at your heart and principles," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">Eurogamer's Banishers: Ghost of New Eden review</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out this month's <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/membership">full Choice bundle collection via Humble here</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Starfield Could Be Getting a Higly Requested Feature in the Future]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/starfield-highly-requested-feature/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-could-be-getting-a-higly-requested-feature-in-the-future.1263225/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Starfield could be getting a highly requested feature in <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-beta-update-bethesda-reiterates-exciting-things/">future patches</a>, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>As reported on the game's subreddit, plenty of evidence has been found in the code of the latest two updates which suggests that an <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-mod-interplanetary-engines-adds-in-system-travel-without-using-the-console/">interplanetary travel mechanic</a> that would allow players to travel between two different planets in the same system, which is a feature many have been asking for since the game's release, could be in the works. Sadly, seamless space to planet surface landing doesn't seem to be in the works, at least going by the game's current code, so we shouldn't expect the game by Bethesda to suddenly turn into Elite Dangerous or No Man's Sky anytime soon, if ever.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although there's the chance that this feature will never make it into the game for any reason, the fact that a new big feature is seemingly in the works aligns with other rumors that have been circulating on Starfield these past few weeks. Reportedly, new quality-of-life improvements are coming to the game, alongside a second expansion, when the game will debut on PlayStation 5 during <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-2026-poor-sales/">Spring 2026</a>. The PlayStation 5 release was originally planned for <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-announced-playstation-5/">this year</a>, but a decision to delay this new version of the game to 2026 was made folliwing the low sales of the first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">Shattered Space</a>.</p>



<p>Although&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">I did enjoy Starfield</a>&nbsp;when it launched in 2023, my opinion of the game soured rather quickly as I returned to it before the launch of the Shattered Space expansion, which did little to alleviate the base game's most critical issues. Hopefully, the rumored new quality of life improvements and the new expansion will breathe new life into a game that has yet to achieve the full potential its solid foundation offers.</p>
