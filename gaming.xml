            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-the-veilguard<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare has announced that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>has a new name, and that it won't be long before we finally get to see some gameplay for the long-awaited RPG.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a blog post</a>, BioWare outlines the reasons for the change and teases what you can expect from the next major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>franchise, although no release date or release window have been revealed as yet.</p>

<h2><em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>is now&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></h2>

<p><em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>executive producer Gary McKay says that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s previous name,&nbsp;<em>Dreadwolf</em>, didn't adequately capture "what this game is all about" or "how strongly" the studio feels about the game's characters and narrative.</p>

<p>By contrast,&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>apparently expresses that fervor much more strongly, although given that we still don't know much about the game or its setup, I think the difference is relatively moot at the moment.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dreadwolf-city.jpg?itok=-4_juBWx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dreadwolf-city.jpg?itok=AyENxo3z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>has a snazzy new name.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned blog post, McKay says that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>will introduce seven companions, each with "deep and compelling storylines" associated with them.</p>

<p>McKay also points to the fact that each&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>game introduces a new hero with a new identity: the Gray Warden, Hawke, and the Inquisitor. Perhaps "The Veilguard" will be the name of the new game's hero.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it won't be very long before we get to find out what's going on with<em>&nbsp;Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, because BioWare says it's planning to unveil the first gameplay footage for the game on June 11th at 8am Pacific.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-solas.jpg?itok=zJMCMi69 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-solas.jpg?itok=fXuZTOBZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</em>'s original name was based around the elf Solas.</figcaption></figure><p>At that time, BioWare will show off "over 15 minutes" of gameplay from the opening moments of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, so we'll finally learn what kind of game&nbsp;<em>Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>(or&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>) actually is.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Age 4&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-named-as-next-dragon-age-game">officially unveiled</a> as&nbsp;<em>Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em>back in June 2022, having been in development for some years prior. The game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-reaches-dragon-age-dreadwolf-alpha-milestone">passed its alpha development milestone</a> in October that same year, and BioWare subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-will-be-fully-revealed-in-summer-2024">promised a full reveal this summer</a>, which it looks like we're about to get.</p>

            <p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-confusion-over-whats-happening-with-dragon-age-dreadwolf-this-week">Eurogamer reported earlier today</a>, Dragon Age Dreadwolf has a new name - which has now been formally announced as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. 
</p>
<p>
BioWare boss Gary McKay revealed the game's new title in a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/theveilguard/">blog post</a> today that also offered fresh details on the game - and an explanation for why its name has changed at the eleventh hour. 
</p>
<p>
"Every Dragon Age game has delivered a new standalone story," McKay wrote. "Set in the world of Thedas, these tales explore epic locales and threats, always thrusting you into a new conflict. Each game also introduces a new lead hero – The Warden, Hawke, The Inquisitor – that you can call your own. You can expect all that, and more, with the new game. 
</p>

<p>
"And of course, much like your unique hero, it wouldn't be a Dragon Age game without an amazing cast of companions - right? Each of the seven unique characters that make up your companions will have deep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them - as well as their lives. 
</p>
<p>
"You'll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world," McKay continued. "Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions – not your enemies – are the heart of this new experience.
</p>
<p>
"So, to capture what this game is all about, we changed the name as the original title didn’t show just how strongly we feel about our new heroes, their stories and how you'll need to bring them together to save all of Thedas."
</p>
<p>
In Dragon Age, the Veil is known to fans as the magical barrier that separates the normal world from the mystical Fade. The suggestion that players will form some kind of defence force - a Veil guard - of this is an intriguing new clue as to what we'll be getting up to when the game launches. 
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, BioWare has said we'll get our first look at 15 minutes of gameplay for Dragon Age: The Veilguard next week, on Tuesday 11th June at 4pm UK time. Another date to add to your bustling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">not-E3 / Summer Game Fest week calendar</a>!

<p>Back in the day I used to be one of those Counter Strike players who'd hop into a custom aim-training 'environment'. I'd spend a good ten minutes or so darting my eyes between blobs or skittish enemy models then whipping my wrist to blast them with an AK.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/glyphica">Glyphica</a> reminds me of those heady days. It's a roguelite horde survival game where you've got to protect your central pewpew from an onslaught of words. I think it's the perfect warm up for someone who's about to do a big essay or maybe defend <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a> in an errant comments section. It's fun!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Glyphica's got this minimal aesthetic, all clean lines and inoffensive shapes that lend it a subtle cool. In the demo there's only one choice of shooter, which is a regular gun that spits bullets at whatever words you've typed in correctly. You see the words are relentless, pouring in from the sides slowly at first, but then picking up pace and upping in number as the timer ticks up. If they hit your base too many times, that's your run over.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/glyphica-upgrades.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/aliasBLACK/Squeaky Pixel</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Type in words quickly and correctly, and you'll level up. This lets you choose clever upgrades that'll defend you from the evil word salad. There's one called "Hunter", that spawns friendly drones that'll attack words for you, but only when you complete words containing the letters i, o, and u. There's another that spawns electricity fields that zap and slow down words caught in their radius, again, only when you complete words with certain letters in. As words grow stronger and in number, I like how you're rewarded for remaining calm and thinking somewhat tactically: if there's a big fatberg of words hurtling towards you, it might be worth targeting one that contains an "i", for example.</p>
<p>Words don't only get lengthier, they also develop traits. Some are encased in armour. Some hide their letters, forcing you to type in only the letters they gradually unveil and forcing your attention away from the other words at that moment. Others are simple, but launch themselves at your base with speed. Later on, some have spinny shields and buff other words, so you have to time your word completion to hit their weak spot.</p>
<p>Glyphica is a simple thing that trains your typing skills in a way that seems well-balanced and clean. It also reminds me of a game I'd play in school, which grants it an automatic, "Yeah, this is the good shit" bonus. You can nab the demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400160/Glyphica_Typing_Survival/">here</a>, if you're keen.</p>

			<p>Today, BioWare has revealed Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the new name for the fourth mainline installment in the fantasy roleplaying game series. The previous name was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-more-info-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreadwolf</a>, and the developers decided to switch the naming to focus on the hero and their companions rather than the (supposed) villain, the elf trickster god Fen'Harel.</p>
<p><em>After Dragon Age: Inquisition launched, the studio was given an incredible opportunity to explore, test, and validate a variety of gameplay concepts as we worked to determine what the next Dragon Age could look like. We brought everything to the table which, yes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-anthem-tech-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even included a multiplayer concept</a>. The time we spent experimenting and iterating gradually taught us a lot. This work, and the amazing support from EA, helped us re-focus on creating an incredible single player game, with all the choices, characters and world building you’d expect from us.</em></p>
<p><em>At BioWare, we create worlds of adventure, conflict and companionship, where you’re at the center of it all. As fans of our franchise know, every Dragon Age game has delivered a new standalone story. Set in the world of Thedas, these tales explore epic locales and threats, always thrusting you into a new conflict. Each game also introduces a new lead hero – The Warden, Hawke, The Inquisitor – that you can call your own. You can expect all that, and more, with the new game. And of course, much like your unique hero, it wouldn't be a Dragon Age game without an amazing cast of companions - right?</em></p>
<p><em>Each of the seven unique characters that make up your companions will have deep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them – as well as their lives. You’ll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world. Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions – not your enemies – are the heart of this new experience.</em></p>
<p>BioWare also confirmed that Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be revealed to the world on Tuesday, June 11, at &nbsp;8 AM Pacific Time, with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dragonage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube premiere</a> that will show off more than 15 minutes of gameplay from the very beginning of the game.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, BioWare said this new game would include more explorable locales than ever before in the Dragon Age franchise, including Anderfels, Antiva, Rivain, and more. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is powered by the Frostbite engine and will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X; <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-devs-pretty-confident-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to rumors</a>, it should be out before the end of the year.</p>

<p>GTA 6 might be a mere year (or so) away, but that isn’t stopping Rockstar Games from pouring updates into GTA Online, the cash cow title that has been front and centre of the franchise for over a decade. In a recent post, Rockstar revealed that the next major update for GTA Online – which is set to drop in the coming weeks – will bring a new bounty hunter-themed venture to the game, allowing players to set up their own twisted law enforcement agency and chase down nefarious criminals. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-still-going-strong">Still Going Strong</h2>



<p>Many players are still locked in firmly on GTA Online and Grand Theft Auto 5, whether they’re playing the ‘vanilla’ offering or enjoying something more bespoke through one of the many GTA RP platforms around. One of the most popular practices in the world of GTA RP is assuming the role of a police officer and attempting to stop virtual crimes in a digital world, with many players seeing success in streaming these activities online.</p>



<p>Of course, many of them are mocked for taking it way too seriously, but who are we to judge how people spend their time in GTA Online?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/1774797o5ka358/coming-this-summer-a-new-brand-of-vigilante-justice" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockstar Games recently revealed</a> that the next major update in GTA Online will introduce a new pursuit based on that concept: being a cop in San Andreas. In a few weeks, players will be able to set up a bail enforcement agency, hunting down bounties and capturing criminals on the run from the courts. It’s the perfect time to RP as Dog the Bounty Hunter in GTA Online, and Rockstar is even introducing a range of outfits to help you become immersed in that practice.</p>



<p>The next update will bring further changes to the GTA Creator tool as well as several quality-of-life changes that will impact mission times and rewards, snacks, and the armour ratings on certain vehicles.</p>

That amounts to up to 72 hours of early access before the global launch on August 23.</p><p>As already announced, a pre-launch beta is set for PlayStation 5 and PC with cross-play support. Those who pre-order get early access to this. Pre-ordering any edition of Concord grants you five codes for the beta early access weekend in July.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>By launching Concord on PS5 and PC simultaneously priced $39.99, Sony is replicating the release strategy employed for Arrowhead’s co-op shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>, which went on to become the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time with an incredible 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks.</p><p>Cheaper price points and simultaneous releases on PS5 and PC may be the way forward for Sony’s live service games, if Helldivers 2 and now Concord are evidence of an overall strategy. Sony has insisted it will continue to release its big ticket single-player games on console first before coming to PC later.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-6-xbox-handheld-and-doom-what-to-expect-from-the-xbox-showcase<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>With the PlayStation State of Play done, Nintendo and Xbox still have yet to show their hand during this summer of gaming. Next up, Microsoft kicks off its Xbox Games Showcase on June 8, followed immediately after by a big reveal for the next Call of Duty. While we already know the next Call of Duty is set to be Black Ops 6, there’s plenty from the main show that remains a mystery and rife for speculation.</p><p>It feels like every year is a make-or-break year for Xbox and, well, this year is make-or-break for Xbox. With the dust from the Activision Blizzard acquisition settling down but closures of high-profile studios like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin</a> still fresh in everyone’s minds, it’s a summer for Xbox to find its center, take a breath, and share what the future looks like.</p><p>As such, here are some big announcements we hope to see at the Xbox Games Showcase that I think could help get Xbox back on track.</p><h3><strong>Return to Your Roots: Gears 6</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/06/11/gears-5-kait-hero-4k-1528680467219.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Please rediscover your fun side, Gears!</figcaption></figure></output><p>With the acquisition of Activision Blizzard and many other studios over recent years, Xbox is now home to tons of iconic franchises. But the Xbox brand was built on the likes of Master Chief and Gears of War.</p><p>If rumors are true, we are likely going to see a new Gears of War game announced this weekend, and it’ll be a welcome return to one of Xbox’s most iconic franchises. The over-the-top gore lost a bit of favor a few years ago when everyone was trying to make realistic, cinematically-inspired games, but I believe we’ve rounded the corner and are back to wanting a little fun with our sadness. Who needs existential dread when you can have a chainsaw attached to a gun?</p><p>Furthermore, it’s never been a better time to revisit a series known for its popular online multiplayer. What’s the biggest genre of games today? It’s online PvP gaming. Games like Apex Legends, Valorant, and Fortnite dominate the gaming landscape and Gears of War could be for Xbox what Helldivers is for PlayStation.</p><p>A new Gears of War game has been heavily rumored as has a Gears of War collection, which should hopefully bridge the gap during the wait for the newest Gears game.</p><h3><strong>The Xbox Handheld</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/xboxwirelesscontroller-1715885602639.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>It's an Xbox you hold in your hand, but we want a proper Xbox handheld.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Rumors of a handheld Xbox have been circling for months and Xbox boss Phil Spencer certainly loves <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-official-xbox-handheld-rumors-swirl-phil-spencer-reveals-what-he-wants-from-it">talking about the possibility of one</a>. And as we approach this weekend’s showcase, it certainly seems like some kind of official announcement is looming.</p><p>But what will the Xbox handheld be, apart from the obvious (it’s in the name, right?)? Our best guess is something akin to the Steam Deck, offering high-end portable gaming so you can play everything in your Xbox collection – and everything on Game Pass too, if you’re a subscriber – any time, any place. Sony recently tested the waters with the PlayStation Portal but that’s really a half-step than a full-fat portable, and with Nintendo’s Switch 2 on the horizon I wonder if Xbox is attempting to get ahead of the competition by offering a home console experience – high-definition graphics and a control pad setup that feels as natural and comfortable as a traditional Xbox controller – before Nintendo makes its move.</p><p>An Xbox handheld might not be the magic bullet for Xbox – that all depends on the capabilities of the machine itself and, more importantly, its price – but it will instantly become the Xbox Game Pass device the Xbox Series X and S currently are not. The idea of a high-end portable device capable of running Xbox games seems custom-built to combine with a subscription to Xbox Game Pass. Add in xCloud’s streaming capabilities, and the success of expensive hardware like the Steam Deck, and it feels like the time is right for Xbox to <em>finally </em>make a handheld game device.</p><h3><strong>Doom: The Dark Ages</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/06/10/e32019-bethesda-doom-eternal-screenshot-21-1560130978044.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Remember when I said we’re back to enjoying mindless schlock? 2016’s Doom helped pave the way for that. While returning to the big Xbox titles of yesteryear will go far in reminding audiences of the iconic brands under the Xbox banner, it’s also time to bring back a beloved franchise from one of the acquired Xbox Game Studios flagships.</p><p>2016’s Doom and its follow-up Doom: Eternal are some of the best first-person shooters of the modern era. While opinions are divided on which is better (I still prefer 2016 over Eternal, but that’s just me) what we can all agree on is it’s time for another Doom murder-fest. Word on the street is id Software is preparing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-doom-game-has-a-name-will-be-revealed-at-xbox-games-showcase-report">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, a heavy metal-like dark fantasy Doom game with big swords and bigger demons.</p><h3><strong>New Xbox Console</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/08/23/xbox-series-family-23-1686580123464-1692815463407.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Okay, so a new gaming hardware model actually isn’t that high on my list of things I’d like to see from Xbox but, based on various reports, it sounds like we’re fast approaching a mid-gen refresh from both PlayStation and Xbox. So far this gen, Xbox has beaten PlayStation to the punch when it comes to hardware reveals so if a pro is indeed coming, I feel it’ll be announced by Xbox first.</p><p>Rumors are abound that Xbox has a few different consoles currently in development, including a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/consider-the-next-xbox-series-x-a-slim-not-a-pro">new all-digital console</a> as well as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-console">a next-gen system</a>. Sony, meanwhile, seems intent on launching a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-everything-we-know">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> with the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 specifically in mind. If true, I wouldn’t be surprised if Xbox also launches a ‘pro’ device and if Xbox is first out of the gate to announce a new system, it could give us a clear idea of what to expect from both Sony and Microsoft when it comes to their mid-gen refresh plans. True ray-tracing and more power seem to be the name of the game, but we need to see it in practice to grasp what this means in terms of practicality for the average gamer who already spent half a grand on the soon-to-be-kind-of outdated systems.</p><h3><strong>What About All the Other Xbox Games?</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/08/14/perfect-dark-1692035693301.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>So far for the remainder of 2024 we’ll have <strong>Avowed</strong>, the new fantasy RPG from Obsidian, to look forward to as well as MachineGames’ <strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</strong> and Bethesda’s <strong>Starfield Shattered Space</strong> expansion. That’s three, but Xbox has announced then hidden away tons of other games including <strong>Blade</strong>, <strong>Fable</strong>, <strong>The Outer Worlds 2</strong>, <strong>Perfect Dark</strong>, <strong>State of Decay 3</strong>, and more. Where are they?</p><p>Fable from Playground Games and Blade from Arkane top my personal list of anticipated Xbox titles we haven’t heard from in a while. But even without those there’s still <strong>Everwild</strong> from Rare and The Initiative’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-years-away">Perfect Dark reboot</a>. Plus there’s a lot of Fallout chatter for Bethesda despite publicly announcing <strong>Elder Scrolls 6</strong> as its next game. It’s a good time to double-down and triple confirm what Bethesda RPG we should all expect to see next, or maybe announce a change of plans (I <em>really</em> want a new Fallout)?. Either way, Xbox doesn’t just have a bunch of irons in the fire, it has the entire mill on the burner.</p><p>These are the big announcements we’re hoping to see at the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9 at 10 am PT / 1 pm ET. You can watch the whole show as well as our pre- and post-show right on IGN.</p><p><em>Matt T.M. Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-2-player-board-games-2024.891354/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Many of the most ancient and enduring board games around, from Chess to Checkers, are for two players only, and with good reason. Two going head-to-head is an undiluted contest of skill and, sometimes, luck. As soon as you introduce a third player into the mix, you have a problem. If there’s any interaction in the game, that third player may ally with or otherwise help one of the other two. If there’s not any interaction, then you either risk a dull game, or you risk a player of unequal skill inadvertently helping one of the others by making poor choices. So there’s a lot to be said for sticking to just two players, and that category contains some of the best, most exciting strategy games around.</p><p>Because it’s such a wide and flexible genre, we’ve broken our selection of the very best among this august club into three sub-sections. Quick games are great to break out with kids, but our picks will also suit adult gamers too. Co-operative games can be great for couples. Finally, the competitive games section contains the most intense and challenging titles for your enjoyment.  </p><p>And if you're looking for more recommendations, check out our lists of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults">best board games for adults</a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">best board games for kids</a>. For larger groups, explore the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-6-player-board-games">best 6-player board games</a>. </p><h2>TL;DR The Best 2-Player Board Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Gvl28" target="_blank">Mindbug: First Contact</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/LxeGM" target="_blank">Redlands</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/NwjJd" target="_blank">Schotten Totten</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3xBP2" target="_blank">Jaipur</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3qAxM" target="_blank">Arkham Horror: The Card Game</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/qL0Xq" target="_blank">Fog of Love</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/o4D70" target="_blank">Spirit Island</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/jdZwP" target="_blank">Sky Team</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/gN0ee" target="_blank">Sleeping Gods</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/R6YmE" target="_blank">Splendor: Duel</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/kPmJX" target="_blank">YINSH</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/VAerx" target="_blank">Race for the Galaxy</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/pVOdg" target="_blank">Unmatched: Cobble and Fog</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/8vwdO" target="_blank">Watergate</a></li></ul><h2>Quick Games</h2><p>These are easy to set up and play in less than 30 minutes. Perfect for baby nap times or killing a little time with a friend or loved one without taking up all evening.</p><h3>Mindbug: First Contact</h3><div id="195789"><p><h3>Mindbug First Contact</h3></p></div><p>A richly tactical <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy board game</a> that plays in 10 minutes and is easy enough for an eight-year-old to play sounds like a dream, but Mindbug: First Contact has made it a reality. It comes with a selection of creature cards, 20 of which will get used at random in each game. On your turn, you can either play a creature from your hand or attack your opponent with a played creature. They can defend with one of their own, comparing a single-digit strength value, or take the pain. This is a fascinating face-off in its own right, given the various simple keywords and special power on each creature. But the real kicker is that both players have two Mindbug cards, which they can use to steal enemy creatures. Not only is this a taut and fascinating exercise in timing - play it now, or wait in case something more powerful appears - but it’s a brilliant balancing exercise, since your most powerful cards can easily become your opponent’s. A minor stroke of genius in a tiny box.</p><h3>Radlands</h3><div id="155159"><p><h3>Radlands</h3></p></div><p>Radlands came out of the wastelands to huge critical acclaim. Players get a random selection of three camp cards that they must defend with irradiated warrior and event cards from their hands while also attacking the enemy camp. Cards cost water, however, and resources are extremely tight, meaning you have to balance discarding cards to gain short-term bonuses against spending to play them into your battle lines. Taut, thematic and rich with tactics, Radlands is shaping up to be a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">classic board game</a>.  </p><h3>Schotten Totten</h3><div id="155160"><p><h3>Schotten Totten 2</h3></p></div><p>In theory, Schotten Totten sees you lining up members of a Scottish clan, represented by superb cartoon art, for a factional showdown. In practice, it's more like Poker as you try to collect triplets of colour or number which you assign to one of nine flags. The secret of Schotten Totten is that you're forced to start making plays before you collect complete sets. That makes every card down and every card drawn an agony of anticipation where bluff and timing are everything. It's a fine game but, better still, you can also use the cards to play a related 2-player game, Lost Cities (<a href="https://zdcs.link/pVd8Y" target="_blank">see it on Amazon</a>).</p><h3>Jaipur</h3><div id="155161"><p><h3>Jaipur</h3></p></div><p>Trading games tend to work best with multiple players, so you've got a bit of bargaining going on. Jaipur solves this problem with an elegant economic system. As an Indian merchant you want to collect goods like cloth, gold and tea to sell in bulk. But the market is one of diminishing returns. That creates constant tension between hoarding goods and selling early to get the best prices and deny them to your opponent. With other smart, interlocking mechanics, Jaipur is a slippery customer. Whenever you feel like you've mastered it, it reveals new tricks: so it rewards repeat play against the same person. </p><h2>Co-operative Games</h2><p>These <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">co-op board games</a> are challenging and only those who work together can hope to come out victorious. Plus they won’t have you going to bed angry at one another.</p><h3>Sky Team</h3><div id="195589"><p><h3>Sky Team: Prepare for Landing</h3></p></div><p>Sky Team is a super-quick cooperative game made especially for two players, who are working to land a plane as pilot and co-pilot. Each has their own set of instruments and pool of dice to assign to them, trying to keep the plane steady in the air, clear the approach of other aircraft and deploy all the necessary equipment for landing as it descends. Both the randomness of the dice and limited communication rules make this far trickier than it sounds, especially given that several of the instruments require a balance between the two player’s assigned dice. The consequences of failure don’t bear thinking about ... but fortunately it’s just a game, and you can just reset and give it another fifteen minute try.</p><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h3><div id="155163"><p><h3>Arkham Horror: The Card Game</h3></p></div><p>There are many H.P. Lovecraft based games on the market. And many are co-operative. After all, if you're going to go mad in the face of eldritch extra-dimensional horrors, it's best to do it with a friend. This is the best of them and, as a bonus, it's fairly fast and simple, too. Each player makes a deck for their character from the cards provided. Then you find forgotten secrets and vanquish horrors in scenarios that link together into a narrative campaign. Numerous expansions add not just more card options to add to your deck, but new horrific scenarios to defeat… or go insane trying.</p><h3>Fog of Love</h3><div id="155164"><p><h3>Fog of Love</h3></p></div><p>In co-op games, you don't fight each other. In Fog of Love, you don't fight anything: you're a couple, playing out a romantic relationship. Each player builds a character from a selection of trait, feature and occupation cards. These then inform what they want from, and how they behave in, the scenes of that make up each game. But there's a catch: traits must remain hidden so, like in the real world, the partners can have competing goals. Each play flowers into a complex story which can lead to love or loss or anything between. Their subtlety and realism make up for the lack of well-defined win conditions.</p><h3>Spirit Island</h3><div id="155165"><p><h3>Spirit Island</h3></p></div><p>If you've ever sympathized with the underdog, Spirit Island is for you. As ancient spirits, it's your job to help native islanders resist an invasion. But growing powerful enough to head off the colonists is slow going. Building up your spirit's abilities is an addictive draw, but to reach your potential, you must deal with those pesky explorers. You'll need to allocate precious energy and actions each turn to destroying their soldiers and cities. Take too long and their expansion will blight the landscape, causing you to lose. It's a heavy game in both rules and depth but brilliantly blends unusual mechanics with its unusual theme.</p><h3>Sleeping Gods</h3><div id="155166"><p><h3>Sleeping Gods</h3></p></div><p>If you want a single title you can immerse yourselves in to enjoy weaving your own narrative together, look no further than Sleeping Gods. It’s a behemoth of a game in which you’ll guide the crew of a small boat, lost in a strange and exotic dimension, and trying to get back home. On the one hand, this is a game of survival in which you must marshal crew and resources through dangerous encounters, trying to keep everyone alive. On the other, it’s a game of narrative, with a branching story, clues and puzzles that keep feeding back cleverly into the mechanical strategy of survival. If you do manage to pilot through to the conclusion, additional plays will tell an entirely different tale. </p><h2>Competitive Games</h2><p>Competition where you go up as the other player goes down can feel mean and unfair. Fortunately lots of board game designs have found ways to let couples compete without the cruelty.</p><h3>Splendor Duel</h3><div id="195790"><p><h3>Splendor: Duel</h3></p></div><p>Splendor Duel is part of a wave of designs that re-interpret popular classics as 2-player only affairs, and it’s the best of the lot. The core loop, a simple yet deep efficiency engine exercise where you buy gems that can later be used to help purchase other, bigger gems, remains intact and is as enthralling as ever. It also boasts the same satisfying poker-chip gems to play with. But the recipe has been extended in several fascinating ways. There’s a spatial element now, as you pick up adjacent gems from a pattern on a board, as well as gems with special powers and new win conditions. The result is a rich, crunchy game full of twist, turns and one-upmanship that’s far deeper than its straightforward rules suggest. </p><h3>YINSH</h3><div id="155167"><p><h3>YINSH</h3></p></div><p>No, no-one sneezed. YINSH is the best of a series of abstract games known (of course!) as the GIPF project. No, I don't know, either. Ignore the names and get stuck into this fascinating challenge instead. Players go head-to-head on a hexagonal board, moving rings which leave markers behind. To win you need to make chains of your own colour, but moving rings alternate between black and white. So you need to plan patterns ahead to get those connections. With several rings in play, YINSH weaves worrying webs in your head, but when you complete a chain you lose a ring. This elegant twist makes strategy easier but winning harder and ensures timing is part of the tactics.</p><h3>Race for the Galaxy</h3><div id="155168"><p><h3>Race for the Galaxy</h3></p></div><p>The icons in this game start out looking like an alien language, but Race for the Galaxy is fast and engaging. It's all about building an intergalactic empire from the planets, aliens and technologies in your hand. The hook is that you aren’t always in control over what cards you can play, as the players select what game phases get executed each turn. This makes everything into a tricky balancing act, with a thousand things to do funneling down into your limited actions. Pick the right priorities and construct the right card combos and your reward isn't just a win. It's a real sense of a space-born society growing and flourishing.</p><h3>Unmatched: Cobble and Fog</h3><div id="155169"><p><h3>Cobble and Fog</h3></p></div><p>If you fancy a bit of no-holds-barred, head to head fighting action, you won’t do any better than the Unmatched series. Each box has a set of unique characters with their own special power and deck of cards with which to attack, defend and pull off special moves. Play is all about combining tactical movement on a cramped board with managing your hand to build up powerful chains of cards. Despite the variety, the core rules are simple and can be learned in minutes. Cobble and Fog is the best set so far, with four characters from gothic literature to enjoy, but all the boxes can be combined with each other for even more options. See our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-cobble-and-fog-board-game-review">Unmatched: Cobble and Fog review</a> for more info.</p><h3>Watergate</h3><div id="155170"><p><h3>Watergate</h3></p></div><p>There’s a whole genre of games in which card play replicates key real-life events in order to explore alternative histories. Most are long and complex, but Watergate puts their tension and detail into the reach of any gamer. One player represents Nixon, the other the Washington Post, as each plays cards trying to connect or block connections on a web of evidence and witnesses linking the President to the famous scandal. Multi-use cards and a see-saw of supporting mechanics ensure plenty of depth and replay value alongside the excitement of trying to weave the web together.</p><h2>Upcoming 2-Player Board Games</h2><p>Salt &amp; Pepper are a small Spanish publisher that make very innovative, accessible games based on historical themes. Their latest title, <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/saltandpepper/operation-barclay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation Barclay is currently available to back on GameFound</a>, and it promises to be just as fun and as clever as their previous releases. It’s based loosely on making Poker-style hands in order to win board regions but with several neat twists, included bonuses marked on certain cards and a bidding element where you guess who’s likely to win before the reveal. Your reward for a winning meld is to reveal tokens that represent the intelligence war between the Axis and Allies prior to the invasion of Sicily in World War 2: find enough secrets, and you’ll win the game!</p><p>Open Season is the latest take on the appealing, and under-served theme of monsters taking their revenge on the infuriating adventurers that hunt them. It takes the form of a fast, novel, tableau-building game where you arrange the heads of the various heroes that you’ve hunted on your wall, with each card and its position influencing the scoring of the others. The fresh twist is that laid cards also trigger actions, giving a third dimension to the placement and another layer of strategy to explore. It works with up to four, but is best with two.

We brought everything to the table which, yes, even included a <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [321 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> concept. The time we spent experimenting and iterating gradually taught us a lot.

As fans of our franchise know, every <em>Dragon Age</em> game has delivered a new standalone story. Set in the world of Thedas, these tales explore epic locales and threats, always thrusting you into a new conflict. Each game also introduces a new lead hero—The Warden, Hawke, <a title="Games > The Inquisitor [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-inquisitor">The Inquisitor</a>—that you can call your own. You can expect all that, and more, with the new game.

You’ll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world. Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions—not your enemies—are the heart of this new experience.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>So, to capture what this game is all about, we changed the name as the original title didn’t show just how strongly we feel about our new heroes, their stories and how you’ll need to bring them together to save all of Thedas.</p></blockquote><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,153 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,424 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,247 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_Dreadwolf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/dragon-age-dreadwolf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>.

                <p>Destiny 2: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-release-date-new-exotics-and-everything-we-know/1100-6517377/" data-ref-id="1100-6517377">The Final Shape</a> introduces a new Exotic sword to the game in the form of Ergo Sum, and if you're lucky, this could be one of the most powerful weapons in the game. Ergo Sum is unique in a variety of ways: Not only can it be wildly different based on rolls you obtain, but it's also a sword that goes in the Energy weapon slot, unlike any previous weapon of this type.</p><p>Where things get really interesting is with Ergo Sum's intrinsic trait, as it can inherit one of several abilities from other Exotic weapons. With the right roll, you could get the sword with Gjallarhorn's Wolfpack Rounds or Cloudstrike's Stormbringer. Getting the weapon is also simple, and you can farm the Overthrow public event in the Pale Heart to potentially get new rolls.</p><p>It's worth pointing out that Ergo Sum's form isn't set in stone either, as you can get one with a different frame. Each unique sword frame has its own characteristics, like a Wave Sword frame allowing for shockwave uppercuts when you trigger its heavy attack. If all of this sounds like a recipe for success, here's how you can get Ergo Sum and the possible rolls you can unlock.</p><p>For more walkthroughs, you can check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Destiny 2: The Final Shape guides hub</a> to help you get through some of the trickier parts of the game.</p><h2 id="How_to_get_Ergo_Sum">How to get Ergo Sum</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4313865-ergo-sum-exotic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313865" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4313865-ergo-sum-exotic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313865"></a><figcaption>Ergo Sum</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4313865-ergo-sum-exotic.jpg"></figure><ol><li>Complete The Final Shape campaign</li><li>Start the "Destined Heroes" quest</li><li>Complete the mission "Queens I"</li><li>Complete the mission "Lost in the Light"</li><li>Complete the mission "Found in the Dark"</li><li>Visit Ghost to acquire the Dyadic Prism so that you can access a new landing zone and Ergo Sum</li></ol><p>After completing the campaign, you can obtain the Destined Heroes quest to unlock Ergo Sum through several objectives. This is an uncomplicated questline to go through, though it does involve quite a few individual steps and missions. But you'll be progressing not just toward getting Ergo Sum, but also obtaining additional Prismatic grenades, Super, and Aspect options.</p><h2 id="How_to_farm_Ergo_Sum">How to farm Ergo Sum</h2><p>Unlike most Exotic weapons, there is a reason to farm for Ergo Sum: As noted above, multiple aspects of the weapon can be different from version to version.</p><p>The first way to get more Ergo Sum swords is by checking out the Pathfinder system for the Pale Heart specifically. You can grab two more rolls of the Exotic by completing certain objectives and creating a path toward the prize. You can also farm for Ergo Sum through the new Overthrow activity in the Pale Heart.</p><h2 id="Ergo_Sum_weapon_perk__Transcendent_Duelist">Ergo Sum weapon perk: Transcendent Duelist</h2><p>This weapon collects less ammo. Final blows with this weapon accelerate Light and Darkness mastery. Deals increased damage while Transcendent; defeating targets lengthens Transcendence.</p><h2 id="Ergo_Sum__Possible_intrinsic_traits">Ergo Sum: Possible intrinsic traits</h2><p>Now it's time to look at the exciting potential of Ergo Sum. A few Guardians equipped with Ergo Sum swords that have Stormbringer intrinsic traits could unleash a superstorm of lightning strikes on enemies. Or imagine how you'll melt through bosses if you and your teammates have an Ergo Sum with the Perfect Fifth trait, attaching solar explosives with every fifth attack.</p><p>Throw one of these abilities on a sword like Falling Guillotine, which has a powerful spinning attack, and Ergo Sum looks like a fun new weapon to use and experiment with.</p><hr><table dir="ltr"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Wolfpack Rounds</strong></td><td>Powered heavy attacks cause nearby Sword-wielders to emit tracking missiles with every attack.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gathering Light</strong></td><td>Final blows with this weapon grant stacks of Gathering Light, improving guard stats and lunge range.

                <p>A Lego Horizon game, called Lego Horizon Adventures, is reportedly going to be announced during Summer Game Fest.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-tout-nouveau-jeu-de-playstation-a-paraitre-bientot-et-day-one-sur-ps5-mais-surtout-sur-pc-egalement-52357" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, the game is an action-adventure one and will be released simultaneously on PS5 and PC. It also reportedly supports co-op as well as cross-platform play between both platforms. For the PC version of the game, it will apparently require a PSN account to access, something that players have taken issue with in the past, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">especially with Helldivers 2</a>. However, it seems like Sony is still moving forward with the requirement for future releases on PC.</p><p>Additionally, the game will also reportedly support in-app purchases. Whether it's in the form of microtransactions or DLC is currently unknown.</p><p>Back in 2022, developer Guerrilla Games confirmed that it was working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-horizon-online-co-op-game-confirmed-in-job-listing/1100-6510122/" data-ref-id="1100-6510122">separate online project</a> set in the Horizon universe. It was said to have a new cast of characters and a unique stylized look. The Lego franchise does have a unique aesthetic, so it's possible that this is what the studio was referring to.</p><p>Two other rumored Horizon games are a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-ps5-remake-remaster-and-multiplayer-spin-off-reportedly-in-development/1100-6507954/" data-ref-id="1100-6507954">PS5 remake or remaster</a> of the first game and a separate multiplayer online game. However, Sony has not confirmed either of these at the moment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/06/dragon-age-4s-new-name-is-dragon-age-the-veilguard-first-gameplay-look-next-week<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, the next game in the series, has a new name – Dragon Age: The Veilguard. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2018/2018/12/06/bioware-teases-next-dragon-age-game-with-the-dread-wolf-rises">BioWare first teased the game back in 2018</a>, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/06/02/dragon-age-dreadwolf-is-the-official-name-of-biowares-new-rpg">we later learned it was called Dragon Age: Dreadwolf in 2022</a>. Now, BioWare has changed the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, with a promise of a first look at its gameplay next week on Tuesday, June 11.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for why, the team explains it's about the characters that will make up the companions you meet in the game in a new <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/TheVeilguard/">blog post</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tCokMTQ6qKk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"At BioWare, we create worlds of adventure, conflict and companionship, where you're at the center of it all. As fans of our franchise know, every Dragon Age game has delivered a new standalone story. Set in the world of Thedas, these tales explore epic locales and threats, always thrusting you into a new conflict. Each game also introduces a new lead hero – The Warden, Hawke, The Inquisitor – that you can call your own. You can expect all that, and more, with the new game. And of course, much like your unique hero, it wouldn't be a Dragon Age game without an amazing cast of companions – right?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each of the seven unique characters that make up your companions will have deep and compelling storylines where the decisions you make will impact your relationships with them – as well as their lives. You'll unite this team of unforgettable heroes as you take on a terrifying new threat unleashed on the world. Naturally, the Dread Wolf still has an important part in this tale, but you and your companions – not your enemies – are the heart of this new experience.</p>

<p>So, to capture what this game is all about, we changed the name as the original title didn't show just how strongly we feel about our new heroes, their stories and how you'll need to bring them together to save all of Thedas."</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the announcement, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/25/dragon-age-4-reportedly-being-reworked-into-a-more-single-player-focused-experience">BioWare seemingly confirms earlier reporting that this game</a> – the fourth mainline Dragon Age entry in the series – was at one point being experimented on as a "multiplayer concept." However, as time and experimentation went on, the team decided to re-focus on its roots with "an incredible single player game, with all the choices, characters, and world building you'd expect from us."&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's no release date for Dragon Age: The Veilguard but <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/12/04/dragon-age-dreadwolf-teaser-announces-full-reveal-next-summer">BioWare said last year the game's full reveal would be happening this summer</a> – it sounds like that's next week.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/concord-pre-orders-beta-price-post-launch-updates-free/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, Sony finally pulled the curtain back on Firewalk Studios’ new hero shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-first-trailer-gameplay-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord</a>, and now they’ve provided some more details about <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/concord-is-now-available-to-pre-order-early-access-and-beta-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pricing, editions, launch content, and more</a>. Somewhat surprisingly, the standard edition of Concord will only set you back $40, although there will be a $60 Digital Deluxe Edition of the game.</p>
<p>Sony his promising that Concord will launch with “16 playable Freegunners, 12 unique maps set on various worlds, and six distinct team-based game modes” and that post-launch content updates will be free. Presumably, there will be some sort of cosmetic purchasing scheme, and likely regular battle passes, but Sony isn’t talking about those details just yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002695" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-ordering any edition of Concord</a> will get you access to five codes for the game’s early access beta in July, as well as the “Monarch” cosmetic pack for character Vale. Those who plop down the full $60 for the Deluxe Edition will get three-day early access, a hefty cosmetic pack, and more. Get the details, below…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFconcord2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em>“Alongside the Standard Edition, we will also have a Digital Deluxe Edition that includes additional cosmetics to personalize your Freegunner crew and, for those eager to jump in and play, early access to Concord when it launches this August. The Digital Deluxe Edition will grant up to 72 hours of early access before Concord’s global launch on August 23. It also includes the Northstar Freegunner’s cosmetics pack, which grants you 16 Northstar themed Freegunner outfits -- one for each of the 16 playable Freegunners available at launch.”</em></p>
<p>Initial reaction to Concord has been quite mixed, but at least the game’s pricing seems pretty easy to follow and fair. Hopefully, those free post-launch updates are meaty enough to provide the game with some momentum.</p>
<p>Concord launches on PC and PS5 on August 23 (or, again, three days early for the Deluxe Edition folks). What do you think? Given it's budget price point, is Concord the kind of thing you might consider?</p>

<p>This year is looking pretty good for upcoming horror games. We have many indie titles, and then there’s the extraordinarily aesthetic and immersive Still Wakes the Deep from The Chinese Room. It’s a narrative-driven horror game set on a crumbling oil rig in the middle of the ocean, and it’s coming soon. But can you play Still Wakes the Deep on Game Pass on day one?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-still-wakes-the-deep-on-game-pass">Can You Play Still Wakes the Deep on Game Pass?</h2>



<p>In a recent reveal, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reveals-new-game-pass-titles-for-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported</a>, Xbox confirmed four upcoming Game Pass titles in June. One of those titles is Still Wakes the Deep. The upcoming horror game launches on Xbox Game Pass on June 18, the same day as its official release.</p>



<p>So yes, you can play Still Wakes the Deep on Game Pass on day one. If you’d rather support the developer and purchase a copy, it’s available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-still-wakes-the-deep">What is Still Wakes the Deep?</h2>



<p>Still Wakes the Deep, an upcoming story-rich horror experience, blends terrifying scenery and scares with immersive gameplay set aboard Beria D—a crumbling oil rig off the coast of Scotland.</p>



<p>You see, something’s come up from deep below. It’s an otherworldly horror that, almost immediately, reminds us of Lovecraftian creatures. Will we see Cthulu in Still Wakes the Deep? I certainly hope so. But in the meantime, we’ll have to navigate the collapsing structure and untold horrors from the murky waters around us.</p>

<p>If you love story-rich experiences, you’ll want to hear what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-the-last-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neil Druckmann says about The Last of Us</a>.

<p>Regarding Starfield, most players find themselves in one of two camps. You either genuinely love the experience or despise it, calling it the downfall of Bethesda. No matter which category you fall into, we can all admit it’s nice to see a redemption arc, right? Bethesda has an opportunity to expand upon the game in all the right ways, and it begins with the introduction of mods and the game’s first expansion. With that in mind, will we see Starfield at Xbox Games Showcase?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-starfield-coming-to-xbox-games-showcase">Is Starfield Coming to Xbox Games Showcase?</h2>



<p>We know with certainty that Starfield is coming to the Xbox Games Showcase. It won’t receive its deep-dive event following the main showcase like it did last year. That slot is now claimed by Black Ops 6. However, we’ll see more about Starfield during the event, revealing its future, including the expansion and long-awaited, highly-requested features from the community.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-starfield-in-2024">What’s Next for Starfield in 2024?</h2>



<p>Of course, as is common with these types of events, there have been numerous leaks regarding upcoming announcements and reveals. More specifically, there have been a few surrounding Starfield, but there’s nothing yet to confirm their validity. For now, it’s best to take such leaks with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>In any case, we’d love to see more of Starfield in 2024. More specifically, we hope to see:</p>



<ul>
<li>Starfield Mods</li>



<li>Shattered Space (Trailer and Release Date)</li>



<li>Land Vehicles (Beyond the short teaser we previously saw)</li>
</ul>



<p>On a personal note, I’d love to see the studio flesh out the game’s factions, specifically the Bounty Hunters!</p>



<hr>



<p>If you’re looking for a different type of RPG, there’s an upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pax-dei-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MMO called Pax Dei</a> that looks rather interesting! In the meantime, signing up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a> is the best way to keep up-to-date with the gaming industry!</p>

Games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was already clear the project had rocky road to launch thanks to multiple delays and the fact Warner Bros. revealed it has taken a $200 million loss on the multiplayer shooter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, the full extent of the chaos has been laid bare. Almost two dozen sources told Bloomberg the project was hamstrung by a fluctuating vision, a rigid culture of perfectionism, and a live-service genre switch that clashed with the sensibilities of Rocksteady–which had previously cut its cloth making single-player experiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It details how Rocksteady leaders began to parrot the live-service enthusiasm of publisher Warner Bros., expanding the studio to 250 people (from 160) in a bid to deliver an online multiplayer hit that would validate their belief in the sometimes lucrative, sometimes catastrophic business model.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources claim that expansion turned Rocksteady into an unwieldy studio–albeit one still smaller than those making rival titles. Worse still, some new recruits swiftly left the developer after realizing they'd be put to work on a live-service project. Rocksteady reportedly refused to share details during the hiring process, resulting in retention issues when the expectations of new hires failed to manifest.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A sprawling studio without clear direction">A sprawling studio without clear direction</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The vision for the game also remained in a constant state of flux, with Rocksteady leaders eventually choosing to focus on gunplay over melee combat as first pitched. It was a shift that left some devs wondering why they had chosen to place characters such as Captain Boomerang and King Shark–who generally don't wield firearms–at the heart of the experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other leadership decisions left devs puzzled. Studio co-founder Sefton Hill reportedly wanted moddable vehicles that could be used to navigate the open-world sprawl. This was after the team had already implemented unique traversal mechanics for each playable character. It was eventually scrapped after months of development and prototyping.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another issue arose from the need to make bosses and battles endlessly replayable to scratch the live-service itch. Rocksteady only had single player experience to draw on, and ultimately struggled to ensure those encounters could go the distance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those who worked on the project said concerns were raised internally, but would be met with "toxic positivity." Management reportedly adopted an 'it'll be all right on the night' mentality and told staff </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Suicide Squad's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> disparate parts would come together on the final stretch. Warner Bros. execs apparently took a similar stance, lauding various incarnations of the title and claiming it had the potential to become a billion-dollar franchise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The rest, as they say, is history.

<p>That same blog post says Concord will launch with 16 playable characters known as Freerunners, 12 unique maps set on various in-universe worlds, and six distinct team-based modes. And that content will "expand shortly after launch with regular, post-launch updates" for all players at no additional cost.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here's a look at the Concord box art</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>Alongside the standard $39.99 edition of the game, PlayStation and Firewalk are releasing a Digital Deluxe Edition for $59.99 that includes additional cosmetics to customize your Freegunners and 72-hours early access to the game's August launch. Preordering the game, regardless of edition, also gets you (and up to four friends) beta access and the Monarch cosmetics pack.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here's a look at the Concord Digital Deluxe Edition</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>"Seeing Vale and other Freegunners in action in gameplay footage is one thing, but there's no substitute for experiencing the game for yourself," the blog post reads. "That's why we're hosting a pre-launch beta, simultaneously on PS5 and PC with cross-play support. Those that pre-order will have an opportunity to be among the first to play Concord."&nbsp;</p>

<p>That beta is set to happen this July before Concord launches on PS5 and PC on August 23.&nbsp;</p>

The threequel to the hit animated films is being produced by Rovio Entertainment, creators of the Angry Birds franchise, in collaboration with Sega and Prime Focus Studios.</p>

<p>Red and Chuck are back, with Jason Sudeikis and Josh Gad reprising their roles, respectively. It will be directed by John Rice (<em>The Angry Birds Movie 2</em>, <em>Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe</em>) with a screenplay written by Thurop Van Orman (T<em>he Angry Birds Movie 2, Adventure Time, The Misadventures of Flapjack</em>). DNEG Animation will bring the film to life, as opposed to being handled by Rovio and Sony as with the last two films. Prime Focus Studios, which co-produced<em> The Garfield Movie</em>, is set to produce.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A press release provides no details on the plot nor a release window. If you’re wondering why Sega is now involved, the company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/04/17/sega-to-acquire-angry-birds-developer-rovio-entertainment">purchased Rovio last year</a>.&nbsp;Given that the two previous films were<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/05/22/the-angry-birds-movie-soars-to-top-spot-at-weekend-box-office-with-nearly-40-million.aspx"> box office successes</a> and have grossed a combined $500 million worldwide, it’s a little surprising we haven’t gotten a third film already.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/search-destroy-is-coming-to-xdefiant-but-fans-are-worried/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=search-destroy-is-coming-to-xdefiant-but-fans-are-worried<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Search &amp; Destroy is one of <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s most popular and iconic game modes, and we now know that it’ll be arriving in <em>XDefiant </em>too. Interestingly, despite being such a fan-favorite mode among CoD fans, XDefiant players have voiced concerns about its arrival. </p> <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">The news that Search &amp; Destroy would be added to <em>XDefiant</em> was confirmed by the game’s executive producer Mark Rubin on June 5, telling a fan that “It’s coming,” in response to a <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1798335914504298764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a> begging for its inclusion. Unsurprisingly this got a lot of people excited, but some voiced concerns about how the game’s abilities could affect the mode for the worse. </p> <figure data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Spiderbots jumping on your face in Search &amp; Destroy would be… interesting. Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">“[Search &amp; Destroy] with broken abilities will be horrible [and] unbalanced so no thanks,” wrote Necrosczzz, while According-Music7506 suggested: “They need to disable abilities for like the first minute of the game or something in SnD, or rushing would just land you with a spider on your face, or the whole team pre-aiming you because of an intel suit.”</p> <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">S_Squar3d agreed, saying: “Definitely excited for SnD but the abilities for it will need [to be] tweaked. Everyone being able to use their ability every round will be an issue.”</p>
 <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false">Still, not everyone is against the idea, and they believe that XDefiant’s Search &amp; Destroy mode will be a faster-paced version of the mode which could make it more fun and discourage camping out in spots. </p> <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">As for the idea of abilities in Search &amp; Destroy, <em>Black Ops 3</em> and <em>4</em> both featured them, and SnD played perfectly fine. The key was, however, that you started off with no available ability and had to earn it through the match, and often you only got to use it once. This created great moments where you could completely change a round without having to deal with them every single time. </p>
 <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">For me, that would be the ideal way to use abilities in the mode—you get them once per match, and when you use them is up to you. This would encourage players to think about when to use them and create opportunities for teamwork. We’ll see what Ubisoft does when the mode releases, however, we don’t have a release date just yet. </p>

But in lieu of that, a spiritual successor to<em> SSX Tricky</em> will do.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2743850/Tricky_Madness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tricky Madness</em></a> is an indie snowboarding game that unabashedly owes a lot to EA’s lost-but-not-forgotten arcade-y snowboarding series. It just released a demo that’s so lacking in meat as to nearly qualify as vegan, but the bones are there. The demo contains just one level with a handful of branching paths and two modes: freestyle and time trials. You can see pretty much all it has to offer in 15 minutes or so. The final game is set to include eight maps and a campaign with an open-world mountain -- ala <em>SSX 3</em> -- but this is a far cry from that.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tricky Madness Re-announcement Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f6q3RzCQjZ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That said, <em>Tricky Madness</em> nails the <em>feeling </em>of <em>SSX</em>: the speed, the rhythm of bracing yourself for a big jump and then chaining together as many flips, spins, and tricks as possible before just barely sticking the landing and picking up another speed boost. Just in case you weren't already certain of its primary inspiration, the game also includes a Tricky Meter you can fill up by successively landing tricks, at which point you gain access to a special suite of Uber Tricks. Oh, and there are giant yellow and orange snowflake-shaped score multipliers everywhere in the sky. It's all there.</p><p>The soundtrack, too, feels very intentionally reminiscent of <em>SSX Tricky</em>, albeit sans licensed songs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnXZUIYagC4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“It’s Tricky” by Run DMC</a>, an anthem that defined an era. What’s already there is solid, though (and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6DlyffT7N4QJBB1y0lyacn?si=mHRXIaHVSc2T758uzCwCRw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available on Spotify</a>, for those who hate snowboarding games but love music written <em>for </em>snowboarding games).</p><p>At this point, I’m most interested in seeing how <em>Tricky Madness</em> develops its own identity over time. The <em>SSX </em>games had a cast of colorful characters who’d perform all sorts of wacky tricks and holler about how great they were as their combo meters rocketed into the stratosphere. Remember the orange afro guy whose signature move was performing The Worm on his board? Right now, <em>Tricky Madness</em> just has… a few very normal-looking snowboarders with no voice lines, though it seems like the developer is at least <a href="https://x.com/_Tricky_Madness/status/1798026240089260469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hoping to change that last bit</a>.</p><p>If nothing else, they’ve got plenty of time. <em>Tricky Madness</em> is not set to release in full until Q4 2025, with early access planned for this summer. It’s off to a promising start, but can it, like so many snowboarders both real and digital, stick the landing? I sure hope so. After more than two decades of waiting, we definitely can’t count on EA to give us what we (read: I) want. Even if <em>Tricky Madness</em> somehow ends up being a total wipeout, I at least appreciate the effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Sony's rumoured Lego game based on Guerrilla's Horizon series will launch day one on both PlayStation 5 and PC, it is claimed. 
</p>
<p>
The latest word on this yet-to-be-announced project comes from reliable leaker Billbil-kun of <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-tout-nouveau-jeu-de-playstation-a-paraitre-bientot-et-day-one-sur-ps5-mais-surtout-sur-pc-egalement-52357">Dealabs</a>, who said we can expect to hear more about the Lego Horizon game in the coming days, as part of Summer Game Fest. 
</p>
<p>
"In addition, the pre-order phase of the game will open right after this announcement. Thus, we can also conclude that we will probably be treated to a gameplay trailer during the Summer Game Fest 2024," Billbil-kun wrote.

<p>
While Billbil-kun said they were unsure when the Horizon Lego game would be released, they said it will be playable in both single-player and co-op, with cross-platform support. 
</p>
<p>
It will come in two editions, standard and a 'deluxe' edition, although what this deluxe edition will be known as or how much the game will retail at remains unclear. There are also mentions of "in-app purchases", Billbil-kun said, but they don't know more details about this yet. 
</p>
<p>
Lastly, Sony's upcoming Lego Horizon game will require users on PC to have a PSN account. This is the same as Sony's other recent PC announcements, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc">Until Dawn and God of War Ragnarök</a>.

<p>
We <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-and-lego-are-collaborating-on-a-project-based-on-guerillas-horizon-franchise-leaker-teases">first got word of this rumoured Horizon project last month</a>, when leaker Kurakasis suggested that "Sony is preparing something in collaboration with Lego", adding that it was "related" to a well-known series and that an announcement is "expected soon".
</p>
<p>
We will update you when we hear more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24172776/hunger-games-haymitch-prequel-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="JeqZ44"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/20/21264857/the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes-hunger-games-prequel-suzanne-collins-review">Suzanne Collins</a> is writing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23632809/hunger-games-books-movies-tesserae-reaping-explained">a new Hunger Games book</a> — and congrats everyone, it’s the Haymitch prequel story many (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24025446/polygons-best-ships-2023-fanfic-legend-of-zelda-genshin-impact-baldurs-gate-3">myself included</a>) have been clamoring for. </p>
<p id="8NXU5E">(Everyone say thank you to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23952899/hunger-games-ballad-songbirds-snakes-review"><em>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em></a> star <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23971450/hunger-games-the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes-casting-rachel-zegler-tom-blyth">Rachel Zegler</a> for manifesting this back in 2021). </p>

<p id="TVRYMb">Titled <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em>, the new book will take place 24 years before the first Hunger Games book — on the dawn of the Second Quarter Quell. If you’re not super plugged into the Hunger Games timeline, that’s the game that Katniss and Peeta’s grumpy mentor Haymitch Abernathy (played by Woody Harrelson in the movies) won, by outsmarting the Gamemakers. </p>
<p id="Z53BYJ">A new Hunger Games book right after the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23987856/hunger-games-new-movie-ballad-songbirds-snakes-box-office-marvel-sequels-delay">box office success</a> of Hunger Games prequel movie might seem like a cash grab, but as longtime Hunger Games movie producer <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23848083/hunger-games-ballad-songbirds-snakes-release-cast-preview">Nina Jacobson told Polygon</a> last year, Collins is selective about when she <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23959046/hunger-games-new-movie-fandom-songbirds-snakes">returns to this world</a>. </p>
<p id="bIlGNz">“Suzanne, the originator and North Star of everything that we try to do with these books, she doesn’t write just to make money,” Jacobson said. “She writes when she has something to say.”</p>
<p id="cxLVgf">And boy, does <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23632809/hunger-games-books-movies-tesserae-reaping-explained">Collins have something to say</a> this time! </p>
<p id="T8HCC6"><em>“</em>With <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em>, I was inspired by David Hume’s idea of implicit submission and, in his words, ‘the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,’” Collins said in a press release from Scholastic. “The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question ‘Real or not real?’ seems more pressing to me every day.”</p>
<p id="vSckjR">Will <em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em> get a Lionsgate film adaptation? It’s very likely, especially since Jacobson seemed super hopeful that Collins would write another book. And Haymitch’s backstory was cut from the main Hunger Games films in order to streamline them, so this would be a perfect chance to showcase it. But news is quiet on that front (for now). </p>
<p id="SazaeW"><em>Sunrise on the Reaping</em> comes out on March 18, 2025. </p>

These can, again, be earned through gameplay or purchased in the store.</p><p>The competitive first-person shooter is free to play but has an extensive economy surrounding the contents of these loot boxes: weapon skins. Players can buy, trade, and sell them to each other, and the rarer pieces have sold in the past for hundreds, thousands, and even hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The most expensive skin in Counterstrike history was publicly sold this morning, a StatTrak Factory New AK-47 Blue Gem pattern 661</p><p>For over $1 million <a href="https://t.co/1FdxoNM2ov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1FdxoNM2ov</a></p></div>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1798387413313868135?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/counter-strike-blue-gem-skin-sells-one-million-dollars-1851521593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotaku</a>, the StatTrak Factory New AK-47 Blue Gem pattern 661 has blown away all previous records, however, after it was sold by X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/roflm0nster/status/1798357534220374247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@roflm0nster</a> for more than $1 million. A look at the gun can be seen in the post above.</p><p>The exact amount it sold for is unknown, as the seller is "not at liberty to disclose the buyer or exact amount", according to a post on the platform. But @roflm0nster confirmed to IGN it was a seven-figure number. "What I can say is that $1 million offers were rejected multiple times," they said. "Make your own conclusions."</p><p>Such high offers came in as a result of the skin being truly unique, meaning only one exists within Counter-Strike. Its existence was discovered earlier in 2024, when fans marveled at its Blue Gem coloring, which adds a metallic blue look to the gun.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"What I can say is that $1 million offers were rejected multiple times.</p></div><p>It's also of Factory New condition, which is the rarest form of such a skin. A near identical version of this gun, just with the lesser Minimal Wear condition, sold for $400,000 in 2022, as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/counter-strike-skin-sells-for-dollar400k-probably-the-most-expensive-gun-in-videogame-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>. Experts therefore valued the Factory New version to sell for up to $1 million, but it's now gone above even that.</p><p>CS:GO is a PC classic which remains as popular as ever despite the forced transition to Counter-Strike 2 in September 2023, more than two decades after the original first released.</p><p><em>Image Credit: </em><a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1798387413313868135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Jake Lucky on X/Twitter</em></a></p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Highlights include <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-shadow-drops-octopath-traveler-1-and-2-alongside-surprise-update">today’s surprise shadow drop of Square Enix’s Octopath Traveler series</a>, The Callisto Protocol, and Still Wakes the Deep.</p><p>First up are the aforementioned Octopath Traveler and Octopath Traveler 2. Octopath Traveler (Cloud, Console, and PC) returns to the Game Pass library today, June 6, whereas Octopath Traveler 2 (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) launches on Xbox and Game Pass for the first time having released on other platforms last year, alongside a new update.</p><p>IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/12/octopath-traveler-review"><u>Octopath Traveler review</u></a> returned a 9.3. We said: "Octopath Traveler's beautiful style and outstanding take on traditional turn-based combat make it a game that pushes JRPGs forward rather than simply paying homage to the greats." IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/octopath-traveler-2-review"><u>Octopath Traveler 2 review</u></a> scored a 7: "Octopath Traveler 2 is a very enjoyable JRPG sequel that feels a little too safe and familiar," we said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>All Characters in Octopath Traveler 2</h3></div></output><p>Moving on, Depersonalization (PC) hits Game Pass on June 12. It’s a tabletop role-playing game inspired by Call of Cthulhu with rich branching narratives. Then, on June 13, Isonzo (Cloud, Console, and PC) is added to Game Pass. This authentic World War 1 first-person shooter is set on the Italian Front. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/isonzo-review">Isonzo review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Isonzo is a well-made shooter that welcomes all comers to its gorgeous, mountainous World War I multiplayer battlefields, though a lot of that approachability and familiarity comes at the cost of period authenticity and distinctive gameplay.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Isonzo Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Then, on June 13, The Callisto Protocol (Cloud, Console, and PC) arrives on Game Pass.

We said: “The Callisto Protocol is a satisfyingly gory spiritual successor to the Dead Space series, but it’s ultimately more of a striking modern mimic than a scary new mutation.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Callisto Protocol Review Screens</h3></div></output><p>And finally, Still Wakes the Deep (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) rounds out wave one on June 18 as a day-one Game Pass launch.

 <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="231" data-injectable="false">Martians Treasures is different from previous dig events, as it has more rewards at the cost of having extra levels. In other words, while you can get more dice and cash from it, you’ll also need more pickaxes to complete it.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-the-monopoly-go-martian-treasures-dig-event" data-injectable="false">How to complete the&nbsp;Monopoly GO&nbsp;Martian Treasures dig event</h2> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true">Advancing through the Martian Treasures dig event requires <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-how-to-get-free-martian-treasures-pickaxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collecting pickaxes</a> and digging through the event’s level grids to uncover hidden treasures. As you find every hidden treasure in a level, you’ll claim its rewards and move on to the next. You’ll have to do this through all 25 levels, with each one increasing in complexity and size as you progress.</p>
 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="false">Unlike banner events and tournaments, you do not need to collect points to complete the Martian Treasures dig event. Instead, obtaining pickaxes and digging through the grid is the only way to progress. However, you can use events like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-all-mars-metropolis-rewards-and-milestones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mars Metropolis</a> and ongoing daily tournaments to get pickaxes. Alternatively, you can claim pickaxes from your Daily Quick Wins and free shop gifts, giving you multiple ways to gather enough to complete the event.</p>

            <p>Sony is removing mention of 8K support for the PlayStation 5 on console packaging.</p>
<p>While retailers such as <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/4884404?clickSR=slp:term:playstation%205:2:512:1">Argos</a> still have pictures of the PS5 Slim model with 8K written across the side of the console's box - as shown in the header image above - mention of this support has been scrubbed from Sony's own site.</p>

<p>As you can see in the image below, which was taken from PlayStation's own <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim?smcid=pdc:en-gb:web-pdc-ps5:subnav-Buy%20now">direct store</a> earlier today, the mention of 8K has been removed from the box side.</p>
<p>"So they apparently removed the 8K from the box on PS5s? Ha ha, that's pretty funny and should have been done years ago," Digital Foundry's <a href="https://x.com/dark1x/status/1798377023162999196">John Linneman</a> observed. "It's pretty obvious that not only is 8K not suitable for these machines (aside from The Touryst) but 8K displays are not desirable. I wouldn't want one."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-the-touryst-8k-60fps-on-ps5">The Touryst was the very first native 8K rendered game</a> on the newest generation of consoles, and released in 2021. </p>

<p>Back in 2020, when the PlayStation 5 first released, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/11/09/ps5-the-ultimate-faq/">Sony</a> said: "PS5 is compatible with 8K displays at launch, and after a future system software update will be able to output resolutions up to 8K when content is available, with supported software."</p>
<p>Is Sony now saving this 8K support exclusively for its unannounced but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-expected-this-year-report">widely-expected PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, which looks set to launch later this year?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172102/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-steam-early-access-impression<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It seems like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">roguelikes</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24147616/manor-lords-steam-early-access">early access games</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754342/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-release-date"><em>Prince of Persia</em></a> are all the rage this year. So, it makes sense to release a game that combines all three. <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia, </em>developed by <em>Dead Cells</em> studio Evil Empire, released in early access late last month after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/10/24153572/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-postponed-hades-2">being delayed by a week</a> to get out of the way of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150249/hades-2-early-access-release-date-steam-egs"><em>Hades 2</em> stealth drop</a>. </p><p>The game takes the elements the <em>Prince of Persia</em> series is known for — combat, platforming, and time manipulation shenanigans — and remixes them to fit the roguelike format while also remixing the roguelike format itself into something interesting and different. You play as the Prince desperate to stop an invading force of Huns that have devastated his home and people. Whenever the Prince dies during his assault, he’s sent back in time to start over again, except each time, the landscape, enemy placement, and platforming hazards change.</p><p>Neither combat nor platforming gets as intensive as they do in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035933/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em></a>. At first, I was tempted to think both elements were so simple as to be boring. But as I got further into the game, both improved to a pleasant level of difficulty. And unlike in <em>The Lost Crown</em>, you can be reasonably assured that you’ll always find something worthwhile like a powerful weapon upgrade or health at the end of an extensive platforming sequence instead of a measly collectible. </p><p>With roguelikes, there’s always an initial difficulty spike to surmount, getting used to the combat and learning what upgrades are worth my time. So, even though I was prepared to die a lot at the beginning, I still found myself getting annoyed battling my way through the starting area over and over — until the game switched up on me. I was so preoccupied with progressing that I didn’t take the time to explore the starting area each time it changed. After returning to the game after a short frustration break, I took my time to explore like I should have and wound up finding a special encounter that unlocked a new starting area. </p><p>Now when I died, I could choose a new location from which to begin my assault, injecting a bit of variety into each run. On top of that, the new area itself had another one of those special encounters that unlocked yet another new location. Evil Empire seemingly understood that the initial fight-die-repeat cycle can get grating and introduced a novel way to experience new areas that don’t require brute-forcing progression.</p><div><figcaption><em>Some boss fight animations look like they’re missing.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ubisoft</cite></p></div><p><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> is very clearly an early access game. I ran into some UI glitches that made it look like upgrades I picked up persisted through death (they don’t). And the first boss fight seems to be missing some attack animations as it frequently blinked in and out, making it hard to anticipate attacks. I’m also guessing more robust tutorials are coming in future updates because the game’s upgrade system feels a little opaque. </p><p>During each run, you can collect and equip medallions that grant special abilities and stat bonuses and can upgrade the medallions around it. Placing a medallion in one slot can upgrade adjacent slots, meaning that when a medallion is placed on that improved slot, you’ll get access to higher bonus levels. Medallion placement then becomes just as important as medallion choice, but the game doesn’t do a good job of explaining that, leaving me to piece all that together myself. </p><p>Overall, <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> isn’t bad for a $20 early access game. I appreciate its attempt to do something different with the roguelike format, and I’m eager to see how future updates improve the little problems I had with the game. </p><div><p><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2717880%2FThe_Rogue_Prince_of_Persia%2F">available in early access on Steam</a> and another great example of a game made for the Steam Deck.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
