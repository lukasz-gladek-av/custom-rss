			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing some welcome new features and quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p>The 0.7.0 version of the emulator, which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/releases/tag/v.0.7.0">here</a>, introduces, among other things, mouse and keyboard input remapping, shader recompiler fixes, gyro, and acceleration sensor handling fixes, improved compatibility with older CPUs and games powered by the Unity engine, AMD FSR and HDR support, and more. The full changelog over the previous version can be found <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/compare/v.0.6.0...v.0.7.0">here</a>.</p>
<p>Even before the launch of version 0.7.0, the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator made some excellent progress in the past few weeks, as highlighted in a new video put together by BrutalSam. While Bloodborne continues to be one of the games the emulator runs best, there's been great progress in the emulation of other PlayStation 4 exclusives, including Killzone: Shadow Fall, The Last Guardian, and the original Until Dawn. These games are not exactly in a playable state due to visual glitches and performance issues, but the progress is nonetheless amazing.</p>

            <p>
Earlier this month I had the chance to check out Remedy's forthcoming Control spin-off game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, which casts you as a bunch of weaponised office gremlins fighting the extra-dimensional Hiss and other "paranatural" lifeforms in the corridors of the Oldest House. The game is a co-op first-person shooter, which is a bit of a departure from the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>. How, if at all, has Remedy had to change to make a game like Firebreak? Have they, for example, hired up a bunch of seasoned FPS devs? I put the question to game director Mike Kayatta and Remedy's comms director Thomas Puha.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
First-person multiplayer blasting isn't a genre Remedy are "known for", Kayatta acknowledged, but that doesn't mean there's no in-house wisdom to call upon. "Remedy is now, I think, almost 400 people," he said. "We have people with all sorts of backgrounds and experience that extends far beyond the boundaries of Finland and the boundaries of Remedy itself. And those people have brought in quite a bit of experience and passion from these spaces. So, no, we haven't done any specific kind of, you know, like [company adjustments] in reaction to Firebreak. Actually, Firebreak was born out of the expertise and the passion of the people that we had."
</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNGdDTGTFNY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
Which isn't to say that Remedy haven't done any hiring whatsoever with Firebreak in mind, Puha added. "It's more people who are a lot more experienced with things like the backend, these sorts of things.... Because way, way, way back in the day we made mobile games, and that involved networking granted, but it's all very, very different than what the requirement is here. That was more of a thing where, OK, clearly here we're a bit lacking, so definitely we needed a couple of hires there."
</p>
<p>
As for making a game with a first-person perspective, Kayatta added, "we kind of started with one person who knew what they were doing with that, and we told him: you have exactly one thing that you are not allowed to do, and that is get hit by a bus at any time, because the game will cease to exist." 
</p>
<p>
Still, Puha and Kayatta both maintain that all of this builds upon a sturdy existing foundation of insight and skill at Remedy. The company has, after all, been around for three decades, and hasn't spent all that time working on moody third-person action fare like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a>, Control and Max Payne (which are, of course, very different games in other respects). 
</p>
<p>
The company's very first game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-rally">Death Rally</a>, was a combat racer. As Puha pointed out, they've also worked on mobile games like 2014's Agents of Storm. As is the way of game developers, Remedy have any number of projects that have never seen daylight, such as their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-and-tencents-co-op-multiplayer-game-kestrel-has-been-cancelled">cancelled "Kestrel" game</a> for Tencent. Less positively, there's at least one FPS gig they'd perhaps rather forget. The elephant in the room throughout my chat with Puha and Kayatta was Remedy's 2022-released single player campaign for Tencent's CrossfireX. I've yet to play it, but the verdicts elsewhere <a href="https://kotaku.com/crossfire-x-catalyst-campaign-review-control-remedy-xbo-1848564528">ain't brilliant</a>.
</p>
<p>
Still, experience is experience. "Not that we feel like we have to prove it, but there's people [working on Firebreak] like our lead designer who have been here for like, 25 years," Puha said. "Like, he's been on all of the games. And he's building a lot of systems, and just seeing just how up for it and excited he and many others are - I'm not saying people aren't excited for the other games, but it's just something where the challenges are so different. 
</p>
<p>
"And there's challenges every day, when you make games, and I love seeing that. I mean, there's lots of new folks on the game, but veterans were like, yeah, I get to do a bunch of stuff, it's a small team [of 50 people]. It is very invigorating in that way as well."</p>
<p>Kayatta echoed the point. "I think I've realised that Firebreak is Remedy," he said. "It's just a Remedy that the world hasn't had a chance to see yet. And I think that's honestly what we're really excited about, is actually showing that we are more than the things that we've gained prominence and attention for - although we're that too, and we're happy to continue doing that." 
</p>
<p>
While managing Remedy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-now-own-all-of-control-including-sequel-and-multiplayer-spin-off-after-buying-rights-from-publisher">current spread of parallel projects</a> can be "scary and difficult", Kayatta added, "what it means is that we're going to be able to put things out more often, and we're going to be able to put out, you know, a larger diversity of experience."
</p>
<p>
Puha noted that it's "fascinating" to see how developers become associated with specific genres. "You do one genre, and the expectation seems to be that, oh, you've got to stick to that. And I always wonder, like, if some of the various prototypes that were under works, when the very painful birth of Alan Wake happened - what if the company had gone with one of those very different games?"
</p>
<p>
This is perhaps a good time to mention that Remedy have at least one other unannounced project on the hob right now, as revealed during investor presentations. According to Kayatta and Puha, it'll be a while before we hear anything more about it. Intrigued by Firebreak? Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/controls-office-junior-firebreak-cant-decide-if-its-a-job">my hands-off write-up</a> of the game's mission structure, which explores Remedy's thoughts about "live service", whatever that now means.

A message posted by the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> development team has thanked fans of the franchise for "the sheer amount of love and positivity" received since the game's long-awaited launch last week, which, the team said, had been "incredibly heartwarming".
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows had a particularly rocky road to release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">beset by delays</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">numerous online controversies</a>, and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent">uncertain future for publisher Ubisoft in general</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-tops-2-million-players-surpassing-the-launches-of-origins-and-odyssey">four days and two million players later</a> - the end result appears to be a game the Assassin's Creed fanbase has taken to warmly, with numerous positive threads on the Assassin's Creed reddit, and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/">Very Positive user rating on Steam</a> from those who have played.

<p>
"This weekend, many of us on the Dev Team spent time reading your reactions across the Assassin's Creed subreddit - and we just want to say thank you," a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ji1c9q/thank_you_a_message_from_the_assassins_creed/">message from the Ubisoft Quebec development team</a> stated. "The sheer amount of love and positivity we've received has been incredibly heartwarming."
</p>
<p>
The team's message comes in response to a popular thread on the Assassin's Creed subreddit over the weekend with over 2.3k upvotes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1jhpbax/thank_you_to_the_assassins_creed_shadows_team/">sending thanks to the Shadows team for a job well done</a>, with particular praise for the game's visuals, combat and exploration mechanics.
</p>
<p>
"We came across this post in particular," the team continued, referencing that fan thread, "and it really moved us. Seeing your excitement, your thoughtful reactions, and your joy has meant the world to us. After years of hard work, there's nothing more rewarding than watching the community connect with what we've created.
</p>
<p>
"While we don't reply directly, please know we're listening. The entire Dev Team has been reading your posts - the celebrations, the feedback, the theories - and it's been inspiring. It fuels us. And it helps us keep improving."
</p>
<p>
The Assassin's Creed Shadows team closed with a nod to the future, and the game continuing to change and grow over the coming months through future patches and expansions - the first of which comes free to anyone who pre-ordered the game.
</p>
<p>
"Thank you for being part of this journey with us. This is just the beginning for Shadows, and we're thrilled to see the game evolve with you by our side.
</p>
<p>
"'Where other men blindly follow the truth, remember... nothing is true.'"
</p>
<p>
"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Ubisoft's epic adventure honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>.

            <p>In the words of Lady Gaga, baby I was born this way. Errr, excuse me, what does that have to do with Minecraft, Victoria? OK, I admit opening like this may be a bit tenuous, but it's the song that got stuck in my head after I read a recent interview with Minecraft developer Mojang, so I am going with it.</p>
<p>While some developers have made the switch to free-to-play, such as Blizzard with the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>, Mojang won't be doing the same with Minecraft. Why? Because it wasn't born that way! (Oooh, I get it now.)</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-its-the-best-deal-in-the-world">IGN</a>, executive producer Ingela Garneij said Mojang's game wasn't made to be a free-to-play release. "Yeah, it doesn't really work with the way we built it," Garneij explained.</p>

<p>When the topic of a hypothetical free-to-play Minecraft came up, the executive producer said the studio "built the game for a different purpose" and therefore, "monetisation doesn't work in that way for us".</p>
<p>Said Garneij: "It's a purchase of the game and then that's it. For us it's important that our game is available for as many people as possible. And so I think that's a very core value that it should be accessible for everyone.</p>
<p>"It's the best deal in the world."</p>

<p>As as this little nugget of information, this weekend we also got a sizable list of announcements thanks to Minecraft Live 2025.</p>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of everything announced in a handy list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First game drop of the year</strong>: Mojang's Agnes Larsson introduced the next game drop, Spring to Life, which launches on 25th March 2025 and features the following:</li>
<li>New mob variants for the pig, cow, and chicken: Besides the original pig, cow, and chicken, <strong>warm and cold pigs/cows/chickens</strong> can be found in sandy biomes and chilly biomes respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Sheep spawning</strong>: Sheep have adapted to the climate and most brown sheep now spawn in sandy biomes, black sheep in chilly biomes, and white sheep in green biomes. The famously rare pink sheep are unchanged and can still be found in all climates.</li>
<li><strong>New wolf variant sounds</strong>: When a wolf spawns, it will now get one of seven personalities, unrelated to their variant or biome. From cute to grumpy, each wolf will now bark, growl, pant, whine, and express themselves in their own unique way.</li>
<li><strong>Ambient desert sounds</strong> - Howling wind, chirping crickets, or whispers of sand can be heard coming from terracotta blocks, sand blocks, and the dead bush.</li>
<li><strong>Falling leaves</strong> - Matching the color of the trees they fall from, these particles will make strolls (or chases) under the trees even more ambient.</li>
<li><strong>Leaf litter (including ambient sounds)</strong> - Leaf litter can be used to decorate blocks and makes a rustling sound when players walk through it. Explore forests, dark forests, and wooded badlands to find different colored leaf litter, or craft it by placing leaves in a furnace.</li>
<li><strong>Wildflowers</strong> - These white and yellow flowers can be crafted into dye and placed at different angles up to four times on the same block. Wildflowers can be found in meadows, birch forests, and old growth birch forests or grow more using bone meal.</li>
<li><strong>Dry grass</strong> - Two types of dry grass now grow in deserts and badlands. Use bone meal on short dry grass and it'll grow tall, or on tall dry grass to grow another short dry grass plant. Sheep will also regrow their wool once they eat either variant of dry grass.</li>
<li><strong>Cactus flower</strong> - The new cactus flower is pink, grows on our prickliest plant block, and can be crafted into dye. Place this desert flower in builds for a pop of color and to attract bees.</li>
<li><strong>Firefly bush (plant block)</strong> - Growing in swamps and near water, this new plant block spawns moving firefly particles that glow in the dark. Bury the firefly bush below blocks to make builds sparkle and use bone meal to grow more firefly bushes.</li>
<li><strong>Bush</strong> - Find this tuft of greenery sprouting in forests, birch forests, plains, windswept hills, and other green biomes, or grow more bushes by using bone meal.</li>
<li><strong>Lodestone (updated recipe)</strong> - Only an iron ingot is needed with chiseled bricks to craft a lodestone. By using a compass on a lodestone placed in players' bases, the compass will always point home, which means players can dare venture even farther!</li>
<li><strong>New maps for cartographers</strong> - Instead of hoping to stumble upon a certain biome or village, maps leading to them are now purchaseable from cartographers. Each cartographer has their own selection of maps, so the more village types are explored, the more maps can be found!</li>
<li><strong>Updates to the wandering traders</strong> - Our llama-leading traders have changed their business strategy: not only are they selling and buying more things, but at lower prices too! A great way for new players especially to stock up before a journey.</li>
<li><strong>Spawn egg textures (Creative mode)</strong> - Spawn eggs in Creative mode now look like the mob type it spawns. With their different colors, sizes, and distinct characteristics like horns, snouts, or wings, it'll be easier to find the right spawn egg in players' inventories.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second game drop of 2025</strong>: Mojang's Agnes Larsson introduced some of the features coming to our next game drop, including the exciting ability to fly across the Overworld on the back of a happy ghast! Find a dried ghast (can be found in the Nether or crafted from ghast tears and a bone block). Then, players will need to revive the dried ghast with water to spawn a ghastling! Only once a ghastling has grown into a full-sized happy ghast will they be able to equip a dyeable ghast harness and fly. Multiple players can also fly together atop the same ghast! These features will be coming into testing soon after Minecraft LIVE, so that players can test these new blocks, meet the ghastling and happy ghast, test flight in Minecraft, and provide feedback. New features for this drop announced at Minecraft LIVE include:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>New block: dried ghast</strong> - The dried ghast is a new block that holds the secret for unlocking a flying mount in Minecraft. Found in the Nether or crafted with ghast tears and a bone block, this unassuming little block will spawn a ghastling when submerged in water!</li>
<li><strong>New mob variant: ghastling</strong> - Meet the ghastling - a baby version of the happy ghast with adorable gills and an appetite for snowballs. Spawned by waterlogging a dried ghast block, ghastlings love to follow players around. They grow into a happy ghast, which lets players soar across the skies!</li>
<li><strong>New mob variant: happy ghast</strong> - The happy ghast is a new mob that thrives in the Overworld - and lets players fly alone or with friends! Once raised from a dried ghast block to a ghastling to a fully grown happy ghast, equip it with a dyeable ghast harness and take to the skies!</li>
<li><strong>Ghast harness</strong> - Saddle up your happy ghast with the ghast harness and get ready to fly! Crafted from leather, glass, and wool, this unique harness can be customised with dye.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vibrant Visuals:</strong> Mojang's Jens Bergensten introduced a visual graphics upgrade that will transform the way players experience Minecraft. Initially releasing for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, it is our developers' vision for what Minecraft looks like with improved visual elements such as directional lighting, volumetric fog, and more. This is a visual enhancement - there are no changes to Minecraft's gameplay. For example, visual shadows will not impact light levels in a game-mechanics sense, or affect where hostile mobs spawn. Vibrant Visuals will be easy to access and approachable for many more Minecraft players, as it will be available on many platforms as a simple menu toggle. While Vibrant Visuals will initially release on compatible Minecraft: Bedrock Edition devices, this is just the first step, and we plan to bring Vibrant Visuals to Minecraft: Java Edition in the future.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Minecraft Movie Updates: </strong>A Minecraft Movie cast member, Emma Myers, revealed an exclusive clip from the upcoming movie, as well as announced the A Minecraft Movie Live Event, an evolving multiplayer event where players will defend Midport Village in three mini games. Completing the five challenges for the event will give players the Yearn cape.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for that Minecraft film, it will be released on 4th April, with Jack Black as Steve and Jason Momoa as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison.</p>
<p>Last week, we learned that Black wasn't always going to play Steve, though. Believe it or not, he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-jack-black-was-initially-going-to-play-a-talking-pig">originally going to portray a talking pig</a> in the upcoming film.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Unfinished builds of multiple unreleased video games, including Riot Games' first fighting game <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/">2XKO</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-delayed-to-later-in-2025/">Killing Floor 3</a> and P<a href="https://wccftech.com/prologue-go-wayback-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-will-launch-in-early-access-this-summer-for-20/">LAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback</a> are leaking online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/several-builds-of-unreleased-games-are-leaking-including-riot-games-2xko/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, these unfinished builds are getting shared on an undisclosed datamining Discord server, whose members are using them for datamining purposes. As it is often in these cases, however, there's a very high chance some of these games will eventually get leaked in playable form at some point, which will definitely be unfortunate, as their early state could impact the reception the final releases will get once they are officially released. Besides 2XKO, Killing Floor 3 and PLAYERUKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback, Embark Studios' <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-pvpve-extraction-game-shown-in-debut-gameplay-trailer/">ARC Raiders</a> and an early build of <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-hands-on-preview-timi-studio-goes-next-gen/">Delta Force Hawk Ops</a> have also leaked.</p>
<p>While this is setting out to be a rather big leak, it definitely does not compare to the massive Insomniac Games leak from <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-we-are-angry-and-sad-about-the-recent-criminal-cyberattack/">late 2023</a> when all sorts of information got leaked, including information on the then-unannounced <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-wip-screenshots-were-leaked/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2 PC port</a>, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-ai-upscaling-wolverine/"> PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a> and a very early build of Marvel's Wolverine. The leak was so severe that a group of users managed to develop an unofficial port of the aforementioned Marvel's Spider-Man 2 before its official release <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/">earlier this year.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Take-Two Interactive Copyrights GTA 5 Mod That Put GTA 6 Map Into The Game]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-mod-adds-gta-6-removed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-interactive-copyrights-gta-5-mod-that-put-gta-6-map-into-the-game.1142958/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-mod-adds-gta-6-removed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following a YouTube copyright strike from Take-Two Interactive, a GTA 5 modder has decided to remove his mod that adds GTA 6 into GTA 5.</p>



<p>The video in question was a FiveM mod that added the GTA 6 map into GTA 5, which was based on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-leaks-online-with-90-gameplay-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive hack that Rockstar Games faced</a> a couple of years ago. </p>



<p>Despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/take-two-interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two Interactive</a> only copyright striking the YouTube video, the modder, Dark Space, said in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LmLfJAuR_U&amp;ab_channel=DarkSpace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video</a> that he’s also decided to remove the download links to prevent further legal action.</p>



<p>In a Twitter/X tweet, he said, “Take Two interactive has copyright claimed and removed my video on the GTA 6 map I made in GTA 5. I expected something like this could happen. I am surprised they didn’t bother emailing me. I would have taken it down if asked.”</p>



<p>Take-Two Interactive has been notorious in copyright striking and issuing legal action against modders in the past, so the news shouldn’t be too surprising for anyone familiar with their practices. Even more so when the mod in question is based on leaked material that wasn’t indented to see the light of day.</p>



<p>GTA 6 was officially revealed on December 4, 2025, and at the time of writing hasn’t seen a gameplay update since. According to Take-Two Interactive, the game is still due to release in 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of Take-Two Interactive removing the GTA 6 mod? Are you looking forward to seeing a GTA 6 gameplay update from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games</a>? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/on-bloodbornes-10th-birthday-and-with-neither-a-sequel-nor-a-next-gen-update-in-sight-fans-once-again-organize-a-return-to-yharnam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> turns 10 years old today, and fans are celebrating by organizing yet another return to Yharnam community event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware’s PlayStation 4 masterpiece launched on March 24, 2015, and helped cement the Japanese developer as one of the greatest of our time. Critical and commercial acclaim followed, and a follow-up in the vein of the Dark Souls sequels seemed inevitable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But since then… nothing. Why hasn’t Sony followed up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bloodborne"><u>Bloodborne</u></a> with either a current-gen remaster, a full-on sequel, or at the very least a next-gen update that would finally make it officially playable in 60fps? Fans have begged Sony for more Bloodborne ever since it came out. The deafening silence in response remains one of the most puzzling business decisions in all video games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, we got an explanation of sorts. Following his exit from Sony, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory">PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida revealed his Bloodborne no-show theory</a>. To be clear up front: this is Yoshida’s opinion, which in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an interview with Kinda Funny Games</u></a> he stressed was not inside information, or the reveal of the current deliberations within the bowels of Sony itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida said. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Miyazaki-san is of course Hidetaka Miyazaki, the boss of FromSoftware. And yes, he’s incredibly successful. Not only for the influential Dark Souls series, but, most recently, the mainstream hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring"><u>Elden Ring</u></a>, which propelled FromSoftware to new heights. So much so that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service"><u>it’s getting a multiplayer spin-off this year</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS4 Games (Summer 2020 Update)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And it seems obvious to say Miyazaki will be incredibly busy with multiple projects to direct and a company to run. After Bloodborne came out in 2015, Miyazaki directed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dark-souls-iii"><u>Dark Souls 3</u></a>, then 2019’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice"><u>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</u></a> for Activision, then the aforementioned Elden Ring for Bandai Namco. What's next? Miyazaki has yet to say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5"><u>Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the years since, modders have tried to fill the gaps with fan-made projects that improve upon the base PS4 Bloodborne experience. But Sony has taken a dim view. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-bloodborne-60fps-patch-says-sony-has-sent-him-a-dmca-takedown-but-why-now">Well-known Bloodborne 60fps mod creator Lance McDonald announced in January</a> that he’d received a takedown notification on behalf of Sony Interactive Entertainment “asking that I remove links to the patch I posted on the internet, so I've now done so.” The DMCA takedown arrived four years after the mod was released.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, just a week later, Lilith Walther<u>,</u> creator of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nightmare-kart-bloodborne-kart-release-date">Nightmare Kart</a>, which was previously known as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-ps1-demake-developer-announces-bloodborne-kart">Bloodborne Kart</a>, and the eye-catching Bloodborne PSX demake, tweeted to say an old YouTube video of the demake was hit with a copyright claim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recently, fans managed to get PS4 emulators to deliver something akin to a remaster on PC. The tech experts at <a href="https://youtu.be/-zjzBbdl7hk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry released a video</u></a> covering “a breakthrough in PS4 emulation” via ShadPS4, which means Bloodborne is now fully playable start to finish in 60fps. Could this breakthrough have triggered an aggressive response from Sony? IGN asked Sony for comment at the time, but it has yet to respond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s all we have to go on, really, which leaves Bloodborne fans to take it upon themselves to organize Return to Yharnam community events. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/1jil17v/return_to_yharnam_2025_march_24_april_7th/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another kicks off today</a>, on Bloodborne’s 10th anniversary, and calls on fans to create a new character, and summon as many random cooperators and invaders as possible, and leave in-game messages flagging they’re a part of this latest community drive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps this will be all that’s left for fans to do in the world of Bloodborne forever more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The changes, documented on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/history/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, include an opt-in for Hollow Knight: Silksong on GeForce Now, Nvidia’s video game streaming platform, changed assets, and, crucially, a change to the Steam store page’s legal lines so Hollow Knight is listed as copyright Team Cherry 2025, not 2019.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all points to something Hollow Knight: Silksong-related happening soon, a potential 2025 release, and with Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct set for April 2, fans may not have long to wait to find out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gameplay-trailer-news"><u>been six years since </u></a>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gameplay-trailer-news"><u>announcement</u></a>. In the years since there have been spots of new information, but long periods of radio silence from the developers at Team Cherry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">January, however, was a particularly busy month for deranged Hollow Knight fans, with cryptic X/Twitter activity from one developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake"><u>sparking rampant speculation </u></a>about a potential re-reveal during the Switch 2 direct — and potentially even release on Nintendo’s next-gen console as a timed launch exclusive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-sequel-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch"><u>when Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced</u></a>, Team Cherry confirmed the launch platforms as Windows, Mac, Linux, and Nintendo Switch.

At the time, Team Cherry’s marketing and publishing lead Matthew Griffin said: “We had planned to release in the first half of 2023, but development is still continuing. We're excited by how the game is shaping up, and it's gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the sequel to 2017’s critically acclaimed Hollow Knight, Silksong has huge expectation around it, and remains one of the most wishlisted games on Steam.

With such a high density of secrets to find and fun, challenging enemies to face, it’s worth spending every moment you can in Hollow Knight.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> director Nicolas Doucet has discussed how the game succeeded based on smart AA-sized ambition and that, in this year especially following industry layoffs, it's "OK to make a small game".</p>
<p>Doucet gave a "making of" talk on the celebrated PS5 exclusive at this year's Game Developer Conference (GDC), which also took home two prizes at the conference's awards: Best Audio and Best Technology.</p>
<p>During the talk he discussed the game's scope, why the team didn't name the cameo bots properly, and how originally the game had a different ending the developers found too upsetting.</p>

<p>"From the start, we were in the mindset that it's OK to make a compact game, and I think it's really important - especially going into this year - it's OK to make a small game," said Doucet.</p>
<p>"In order to exist in this very busy world, I think it's sometimes better to settle for a good spot in the second week rather than a bad spot in the first week," he continued later. "A lot of choices we made with Astro Bot could be labelled as AA... like the size of the team, the size of the game, there's no voice, it's not open world, but that doesn't really matter. We could still make something that gets people really happy."</p>
<p>For instance, the team cut more openly-designed levels as it was much more difficult for them to control the game's tempo. This was a key factor during development, which impacted elements like the lack of text (there are only 4292 words in the entire game!), the simplified controls, the movement in loading screens and lack of cutscenes to not interrupt play time, and of course the "catchy video game music" soundtrack that's "an integral part of game design".</p>
<p>Doucet even described the level design in musical terms, with the placement of enemies, platforms, and bots all aimed at creating a certain melodic rhythm for players to maintain that fast-paced tempo and keep them engaged throughout.</p>
<p>The smaller scope also allowed the team to focus on polish and detail. Around a third of development time was spent prototyping, with everyone from programmers to the audio team testing out small, focused ideas in two-week cycles. Afterwards, the team could then focus on adding finer details to give the game its personality as "a toy for players to experiment with".</p>
<p>This polish led to inanimate objects becoming characterful, wildlife stories as cute critters react to players and enemies, exaggerated reactions of vegetation, and the multiple photo chances strewn across levels. "These touches really made a big difference to the game," said Doucet. "When you have hundreds of them, suddenly your game is transformed."</p>

</figure>
<p>Speaking about the ending (<strong>spoiler warning</strong>!), Doucet stated: "So at the end of the game, Astro sacrificed himself for the team, and as the credits rolled we wanted to make a very grieving moment of rebuilding Astro.</p>
<p>"The first version of this prototype included a completely dismembered Astro, so you gain the torso without the head. That meant some people were really upset in the team - and for good reasons."</p>
<p>Doucet showed the prototype, which had players piecing Astro's limbs onto his body, finishing with his head. The final version ended up similar, but with Astro's head always fully attached.</p>
<p>After many "emotional conversations", the team "opted for a lighter approach with humour where the player will replace all the parts and it still conveys the right emotions - and the head is always on Astro's body."</p>
<p>As for not properly naming the cameo bots Astro rescues on his quest, Team Asobi explored the idea of adding detailed descriptions and real names but found the approach "too formal". Instead, it chose to maintain the "playful vibe" by letting players guess the characters. "It was almost like a little game we were playing with the fans," said Doucet, "and in doing so, we were able to keep a lighthearted tone, which also fit the younger audience."</p>
<p>Indeed, Astro Bot acts as a "generational breach" between players who grew up with PlayStation and their children discovering classic characters. Yet the team had to establish the correct ratio of cameo bots to collect. As such, around 50 percent of the bots are easy to see but challenging to rescue, 20 percent had no challenge but were funny to watch, and 30 percent were well hidden. The easier the bot was to rescue, the more popular the character, to ensure casual players recognised the bots and hardcore players were rewarded for their efforts.</p>
<p>We described the game as a "wildly generous delight" in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot review</a>. Team Asobi has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-free-update-adds-new-levels-bots-and-a-ps5-pro-boost">continued to update the game</a>, with a host of new speed-running levels and a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> boost.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-%E2%80%93-how-to-get-resources.1142919/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-get-resources/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Among the many mechanics featured in Assassin's Creed Shadows that give you the chance to engage in activities other than sneaking around and going after assassination targets are the Hideout building and management mechanics, which allow Naoe and Yasuke to improve the League's main base of operations with new facilities that can help their war against the Shinbakufu quite a bit. To do so, however, you will need a lot of resources other than money, which could be difficult to gather by just following the main story. Considering how many are required to level up the Hideout to the maximum, you will need a solid resource-gathering strategy to maximize your efforts and prevent this side activity from being extremely tedious.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250309141630_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While there isn't a proper farming method for resources, there are some side activities you can complete over and over each season to get a lot of resources in a relatively short amount of time. The first type of this side-activity is <strong>Contracts</strong>, randomly generated short missions that can be accepted for each region of the map every season that yield different types of resources. These missions don't take long to complete as well, so consider clearing as many of them as possible each season to maximize your resource income.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250324113233_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Another excellent method to get resources in Assassin's Creed Shadows quickly involves exploring <strong>enemy camps and strongholds</strong>. Every one of these locations is assigned a random <strong>Wealth level</strong> at the start of each season, and the higher the Wealth, the more resources you can scavenge inside the location. In addition, the vast majority of these locations feature some <strong>big resource caches</strong> hidden inside locked storerooms, which can be tagged for your scouts to collect at the end of the season. At the start of the game, you will need to use 2 scouts to get these resources, but if you level up your Stables to level 2, you will be able to reduce the number of scouts needed to get these resources to 1. As you will need to find a key to open these locked storerooms hiding all the goodies, which is done by using the Observe mechanic and checking the gold icons shown on the interface, completing smaller camps requires considerably less time than clearing the biggest castles, so if you're not also hunting for Legendary Gear, completing the smaller locations is preferred. With the Wealth level getting reset every season, you can also repeat the same camps over and over to farm resources quickly.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250324114628_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Given you will need to wait for the end of the season for your scouts to collect tagged resources, and Contracts renew each season, the <strong>Assassin's Creed Shadows' resource gathering loop involves completing both the activities</strong> highlighted above to maximize the time you invest gathering resources. Complete Contracts, secure wealth from enemy camps, <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-refill-scouts/">refill your scouts</a> as needed, continue until the season ends, rinse and repeat, and you will soon sit on a mountain of resources you can use to improve your Hideout and make your time in the game easier and more enjoyable!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill f has been deemed too freaky for Australians... for now]]></title>
            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-has-been-deemed-too-freaky-for-australians-for-now</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-has-been-deemed-too-freaky-for-australians-for-now.1142895/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-has-been-deemed-too-freaky-for-australians-for-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sorry Australians, you can't confront the horrifying psychological manifestations of your inner turmoil. It would be too much for you, according to the government. The country's classification board recently refused to grant upcoming horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> an age rating, essentially preventing it from being sold in the country unless certain elements of the game are toned down or altered by Konami. But it's possible the developer will do just that, as the classification board has retracted their ruling. At least for the time being.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Exactly which parts of the game the Australian government found sketchy wasn't mentioned in the rating board's summary of the decision, made on March 14th. The game was simply handed an "RC" which stands for "refused classification", as shown in a screenshot saved by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-f-ban-in-australia-retracted-age-rating-up-for-review-again/">Automaton</a>. But it's likely scenes involving drug use and specific acts of violence against minors are to blame. Silent Hill f's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/">Steam page</a> contains an extended warning about contents that would clash with Australia's typically tough ratings process. </p>
<p>"This game contains depictions of gender discrimination, child abuse, bullying, drug-induced hallucinations, torture, and graphic violence," it says. "This game is set in Japan in the 1960s and contains depictions based on the customs and culture of that time. These depictions do not reflect the opinions or values of the developers or any individuals involved."</p>
<p>It's possible Konami will now make changes and reapply for classification. The Australian governmental body has already retracted the official notification of the decision, and confirmed that move to Automaton. (The page where <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/silent-hill-f">the decision was detailed</a> now just reads "You are not authorized to access this page"). </p>
<p>All this suggests there's time for the developers to make a version that is more palatable to the government, a process that's not that unusual. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> did it back in the day, as noted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/silent-hill-f-is-not-messing-around-now-its-been-banned-in-australia/">PC Gamer</a>. Although sometimes developers stick to what they've got, as in the case of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number">Hotline Miami 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sludge-life">Sludge Life</a> - both of which remain technically banned in the country but in reality are still available to buy digitally on PC. </p>
<p>Silent Hill f was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/konamis-first-proper-new-silent-hill-in-an-age-is-a-welcome-change-of-scene-after-the-silent-hill-2-remake">announced less than two weeks ago</a>, and it is abandoning the usual setting of the misty US town for which the series is named. Instead, it'll be set in a fictional town in Japan called Ebisugaoka, where school girl Shimizu Hinako is plagued by crimson petals and unsettling roots, in contrast to James Sunderland's classic rust and grime from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>. It features writing from Ryukishi07, author of visual novel series When They Cry, and creature design by illustrator Kera, who <a href="https://kera03.wixsite.com/kera?lightbox=dataItem-lxfaahv45">has some form in this regard</a>. The game's release date hasn't been announced yet. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to a new leak, Pokémon Legends Z-A will feature 27 new Mega Evolutions.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Reliable Pokémon leaks source CentroLeak’s latest post on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1904096996190728268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> talks about the 27 Mega Evolutions arriving for Pokémon Legends Z-A. In the comments section, the leaker revealed that Gen 5 and Gen 6 Mega Evolutions will be included in the game, and they have heard that Gen 6’s Zygrade is one of the Megas that can be expected in the upcoming instalment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mega Evolutions were a significant part of the series for a long time. However, the developers decided to remove this mechanic along with Z-moves in their upcoming instalments. Mega Evolutions are finally set to return to the series with the upcoming title, and if the rumours are true, we might be getting a whole lot of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apart from the new mega evolutions, Pokémon Legends Z-A is about to introduce a bunch of new content and features for the players. For the first time in series history, the developers are swapping the iconic turn-based battle system for real-time battle. Trainers and Pokémon will enter the Arena together, and the Pokémon will move around in real time and use moves when the trainer commands them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new real-time battle system will introduce fresh gameplay mechanics, and players must build their tactics around them. Players need to consider several things now, such as when they need to swap their Pokémon, the size of the Arena, the duration of their moves, and other details.&nbsp;</p>

His videos and his mod hit the headlines in January as information-starved GTA fans flocked to experience a fan-made approximation of what they can expect to play officially when GTA 6 launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S this fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, last week, Dark Space received the dreaded strike notification from YouTube after Take-Two issued a copyright removal request. If a YouTube channel receives multiple copyright strikes, it runs the risk of being terminated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Dark Space removed all download links to his mod, despite the fact he has yet to be asked to do so by Take-Two, and published <a href="https://youtu.be/7LmLfJAuR_U?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a response video</a> on his channel calling out the company for its actions and suggesting it was the result of the mod's take on GTA 6's map being "probably a little too accurate."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Space was more philosophical in a follow-up interview with IGN. “I expected this would happen based on their past takedowns,” the modder said. “I went into this project knowing it was a possibility, and the fact that it happened does not surprise me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Space said he believes Take-Two went after his mod because it was based on an online GTA 6 community mapping project that uses leaked coordinate points to “perfectly” map out the upcoming virtual space, and as a result might have ruined the surprise for players and the internet at large.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's probably the biggest red flag, although most of the work in my map was based on the trailer shots,” Dark Space added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think my map could have ruined the surprise of their map, which I get. If you spent years building out this amazing game world just to have some YouTuber spoil the experience of the map's shape, size, and vibe... I'd want it removed too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is Dark Space’s GTA 6 mod project is no more. And that’s not just for YouTube videos of it, that’s for the entire thing. “Well they clearly do not want this project to exist,” Dark Space said. “So it's not just under threat, it's eliminated. There’s no point putting more time into something that goes directly against what they’re willing to allow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm just going to keep making videos that people hopefully like. I probably won't do anything else modding GTA 5 in relation to GTA 6, since it seems dangerous.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are now concerns that the GTA 6 community mapping project could be next in Take-Two’s sights.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-gets-esrb-rating-suggesting-launch-might-be-near/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 might be nearly at the end of its long and troublesome development cycle. It's been over 20 years since Troika Games released the original game, which, between its lack of polish and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gaming-greatest-month-20-year-later-remembering-november-2004/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simultaneous release of behemoths</a> like GTA: San Andreas, Counter-Strike: Source, Halo 2, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Half-Life 2, and MGS 3: Snake Eater, couldn't sell enough to keep the developer afloat. However, there was an excellent roleplaying game buried underneath those bugs, and it quickly became a cult classic.</p>
<p>Bloodlines 2 was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in March 2019. Developer Hardsuit Labs, previously known for Blacklight: Retribution, had successfully pitched a sequel to IP owner Paradox Interactive. The wait wasn't supposed to be long at all, with the game immediately pinned for an early 2020 launch window, and with the original writer Brian Mitsoda onboard, the anticipation was building quickly.</p>
<p>However, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-to-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to 2021, and that was really just the beginning of its troubles. A few months later, Mitsoda <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-loses-creative-director-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left the team</a>. The real shocking news came in February 2021, though, when Paradox announced it had lost faith in Hardsuit's capacity to deliver a solid product. As such, the developer was being <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely-as-its-developer-is-being-replaced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a>. Later that year, the Paradox CEO <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-almost-cancelled-after-hardsuit-labs-was-taken-off-the-project-paradox-ceo-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the game had come close to being canceled, but another studio had successfully delivered a new pitch that kept it alive and kicking.</p>
<p>We had to wait two years to <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn</a> that the studio was The Chinese Room. The new project's launch window was Fall 2024, which obviously didn't happen. However, there's light at the end of the tunnel. The ESRB has now <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40336/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> Bloodlines 2, which is a good guarantee it will launch within the next six months at the latest. The rating is Mature (17+), the same as the original; we've posted the regulator's overview below, though beware of slight spoilers.</p>
<p><em>This is an action role-playing game in which players help two vampires regain their memories and their powers to stop an uprising. From a first-person perspective, players explore city streets, investigate murders, interact with characters, and battle vampires in melee-style combat. Players use physical attacks (e.g., claw slashes, kicks, feed/bite attacks) and vampiric powers (e.g., telekinesis, possession) to kill enemy vampires. Players can also employ stealth attacks (e.g., neck snap, feed attack) to kill enemies discreetly. Battles are frenetic, accompanied by impact sounds, realistic gunfire, and large blood-splatter effects. Some attacks can result in close-up sequences of players' character decapitating and/or impaling enemies. A handful of areas depict decapitated corpses in pools of blood; large bloodstains also appear in several environments. The game contains suggestive/sexual material in the dialogue (e.g., "snacking on wh*res,"; “p*ssy musta...real sweet”; and “D*ldo of consequence don't come lubed, does it?”). The word “f**k” is heard in the game.</em></p>
<p>This will be The Chinese Room's first role-playing game, so fans are naturally apprehensive about the outcome. Still, the UK studio has been very forthcoming with details, publishing developer diaries on practically every aspect of the game.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/minecraft-to-get-vibrant-visuals-graphics-update-soon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-to-get-vibrant-visuals-graphics-update-soon.1142859/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/minecraft-to-get-vibrant-visuals-graphics-update-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the weekend's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zcZJcXRdw0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft Live stream</a>, Mojang announced the upcoming 'Vibrant Visuals' update that will land soon for the Bedrock Edition of the best-selling game ever.</p>
<p>The developers described it as the studio's vision for what the game should look like when injected with modern graphics features, such as directional lighting, volumetric fog, dynamic shadows, water reflections, and more.</p>
<p>Improvements such as volumetric lighting mean players will see the sun's rays cut across the overworld, with each block casting its own shadow. Light will shine through windows, and you'll be able to see reflections not only in water but also on the surface of metal blocks, while subsurface scattering adds a soft glow to leaves and grass.&nbsp;Mobs and items will also have more glow - spider eyes will be even more menacing in the dark, and torches will cast a glowing path back to your build. This will be particularly striking while in the deep dark.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Mojang clarified that Vibrant Visuals is merely a cosmetic update to Minecraft. As such, it won't affect the gameplay mechanics in any way. This means that existing lighting mechanics, such as when enemy mobs are allowed to burn, crop growth, daylight detectors, mob farms, and more will continue to work exactly as before. This is important because it makes it so players in the same realm can all play together, whether they are using Vibrant Visuals or not. During Minecraft Live, Art Director Jasper Boerstra said:</p>
<p><em>Vibrant Visuals is backward compatible with Old Worlds, and it runs locally - so you can play with friends who don't have it enabled.</em></p>
<p>The developers are currently testing Vibrant Visuals on various devices compatible with Bedrock Edition. Soon, this version will be available via beta or preview for users to test. Mojang also said they will eventually port this graphics update to the Java Edition, too.</p>
<p>Of course, if you have a powerful PC with GeForce RTX hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-rtx-beta-primer-info-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft With RTX</a> remains the best way to experience the game from a visual standpoint.</p>

<p>Atlanta FaZe is shaping up to be the most dominant team in Call of Duty esports after decimating all comers this weekend at Major II. The Call of Duty League was FaZe’s plaything these last few days, and a 4-0 sweep in the grand final against Vancouver Surge proved that without any doubt.</p>



<p>This is FaZe’s third LAN win back-to-back, counting the Esports World Cup in Riyadh. The team is in monumental form and has achieved a feat that hasn’t been seen since 2016, plus they’re on a 13 LAN map win streak to boot.</p>



<p>Incredible.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-faze-up">FaZe Up</h2>



<p>This Major II tournament was light work for Atlanta FaZe. I referred to it as ‘Sweep City Central’ because almost every match was a 3-0 result, except for a few, and only one match went to a game five. Atlanta FaZe enjoyed the lion’s share, walking all over Minnesota Rokkr, Cloud9, and Vancouver Surge <strong>twice</strong>.</p>



<p>Everyone thought an underdog win would happen, given that Toronto Ultra had gone on one of the most impressive lower bracket runs in COD esports history. Ultra produced a perfect record in the form of a 12-map streak before meeting Vancouver Surge and succumbing in the elimination finals.</p>



<p>FaZe’s sweep in the ultimate stage was nothing short of monumental. The flow state that we know the team is capable of was achieved and Vancouver Surge – even with the late addition of Neptune – just couldn’t respond. Except for the round of Control, every map was a wash, with FaZe barely giving Surge space to breathe.</p>



<p>Cellium secured the record for the highest finals KD in CDL history at 1.72, and Drazah earned himself another chip and yet another reason to stand above the haters with their classic chant.</p>



<p>This was a phenomenal Major, and now we look to Major III, which will take place in Florida between April 24 – 27.</p>
