No, that honor would go to the PlayStation 2, which is still the best selling console of all time. Stiff competition, y’know? But it was my favorite and it remains an oddity in the console landscape.

There’s a little something for everyone here, which feels true to the spirit of the Dreamcast too. Now, it’s time to pay homage to the GOAT by eating shit trying to kick flip on that skate deck.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The early access periods generally began a week before the full launch, offering fans the chance to play through the story so they can hit Multiplayer and Zombies right off the bat.</p><p>But for Black Ops 6, Activision has gone in a different direction. Here's the statement:</p><blockquote>“The team is fully focused on October 25th. We are excited about all the game has to offer across Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies. This year, we made the decision to ensure the community gets to dig in to any and all modes that they want at the same time, so we are back to one massive global launch moment October 25th.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/fragpunk-preview-the-most-stylish-shooter-in-ages/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fragpunk-preview-%E2%80%93-the-most-stylish-shooter-in-ages.976617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/fragpunk-preview-the-most-stylish-shooter-in-ages/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Everything is so damn stylish these days. FragPunk, an upcoming free-to-play 5v5 shooter, is almost unerringly so, with blisteringly cool, hyper-stylised art direction, a card-based system that changes how you play each round, and smart and snappy gunplay with an array of weapons to choose from. Interestingly, there’s not only depth beneath that beautiful façade, but there’s also a sense of fun and humour that’s been lacking in our shooters for a long time.</p>
<p><iframe title="FragPunk Gameplay Trailer - Closed Beta in Early October!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hGboaNaiirA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Remember when arena deathmatch games took chances, or even poked fun at themselves a little? Cheat codes in GoldenEye, being turned into a monkey in TimeSplitters, it wasn’t all about K/D ratios and headshot accuracy. Surprisingly, FragPunk rejuvenates the arena shooter by not always taking itself so seriously, and it’s all the better for it.</p>


<p>I should explain the cards. Before the start of each round, you can power up and play a selection of cards from your deck. You earn the currency needed to power them up through playing well across each round, with each card providing boons, modifiers or new abilities with which you can then go and shoot the enemy team in an even more efficient or occasionally, outlandish way.</p>


<p>So there’s cards that will grant you a heal every time you knock an opposing player out, or ones that give you an overpowered shotgun called the Devil’s Breath. Others add in a wonderfully floaty double jump, bringing some height to your headshots, but the ones that stand out the most are what we would term, ‘the silly ones’.</p>
<p>These include, but aren’t limited to, a card that enables Big Head Mode, making it much easier to plant a bullet in an enemies’ noggin, or one that puts a cute and cuddly turtle on your back, protecting you from all incoming rear fire with their shell.<br>
Because there’s new elements being introduced every round – each team can play up to three cards at a time – you have to alter how you’re going to approach the next encounter. Just because you feel empowered with your massive shotgun though doesn’t mean that the enemy hasn’t played something equally powerful, and it already feels like there’s an intriguing push and pull between each team.</p>
<p>There’s currently around 70 cards, but the team hope to add more, with ideas that would take them well past the 100 mark. They’re the true defining difference between FragPunk and the other hero shooters out there, and if they can get the balance right it feels as though this is one shooter that won’t get stale round after round.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s also the characters that you’re playing as, here known as Lancers. There’s ten available in the current build, and each of those we saw and played as in our hands-on were visually unique, heightening the stylish art direction, and boasted a healthy splash of neon-infused colour which fits into the overall punk aesthetic. This is definitely not a shooter that’s shy of standing out.</p>
<p>As a hero shooter each Lancer also has their own individual special abilities, from the fiery Corona whose lethal dash can chew through enemies to lead character Broker and their devestating missile launcher. It’s fair to say though that the leather-clad Axon was my favourite, his special granting him an electric guitar-shaped shotgun that also allows him to powerslide around the level. It doesn’t get much more punk than that. Just as with the cards, there are plans to add more Lancers as development continues, and as an ongoing live service game, it’ll be interesting to see just how far the team can go.</p>

<p>During our hands on playing alongside the game’s lead developer, one of the things that became apparent was the slightly more challenging gunplay than what you might find elsewhere. There’s still a relatively low TTK, but the team has deliberately made the gun handling a little tougher, which not only gives FragPunk it’s own feel, but makes every kill feel more hard won.</p>
<p>FragPunk was an outrageous highlight at Gamescom 2024, and as someone who’s become heavily invested in Overwatch over the past 8 years, this is one that I’m definitely going to be keeping an eye on. You should too, if you’re a PC or Xbox gamer, with an open beta due in October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-stuttering-fix/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Final Fantasy XVI PC demo received a new update introducing fixes for some important issues that will also be applied to the full version of the game.</p>
<p>The demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2515020/view/4617966511042426235?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.02 update</a> addresses the massive stuttering issues that made the demo almost unplayable on certain system configurations. While the experience still isn't entirely stutter-free, as there are still minor stutters here and there in the most demanding scenarios, the new version of the demo is a massive step up over the previous one.</p>
<p>Besides the stuttering issues fix, the new Final Fantasy XVI demo update addresses a variety of other issues, including certain characters not being displayed properly, Screen Space Reflections and Variable Rate Shading settings not applying properly, and screen mode settings not getting saved on certain hardware configurations. All these fixes will be applied to the game's final version, which is launching in just a week, on September 17th.</p>
<p>Now that the most glaring issues seem to have been fixed, the PC version of Final Fantasy XVI is set to be the best way to experience Clive Rosfield's engaging journey in Valisthea. You can learn more about it by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 release.</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XVI heralds in a new standard for Japanese role-playing games and while the RPG components themselves are limited by Square-Enix standards, it's the narrative and gameplay that exceed all expectations. What begins with kingdom-wide subterfuge and destruction ends with a world forever changed and the player, as Clive Rosfield and Ifrit together, are the driving force to see it all through until the end.</em></p>

    <div>
  

        <p>They also promise sweeping changes to make rewards better and the UI more approachable</p>

            <p>Following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-layoffs-couldnt-be-avoided-even-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-had-blockbuster-performance-says-report">major layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-3-may-yet-happen-but-destinys-unannounced-payback-spin-off-wont-according-to-reports">project cancellations</a> at Bungie, the company has since announced their plans for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, a game whose future was very much unclear. In their latest <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/new_frontiers">blog post</a>, they've announced that they're taking "Destiny to places it has never been before". This means it'll get two expansions per year, alongside four free major updates. As for what's in these updates, they want to make the game more approachable, give you better loot, and are even toying with the idea of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelikes</a> or survival shooters for future updates.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Destiny 2 game director Tyson Green says that the game's become "too rigid", with expansions that are "formulaic and are over too quickly with little replay value". And in many ways, yes, I agree with him. While I liked new areas or activities being added with say, Shadow Keep, The Witch Queen, and the rest, they were all pretty formulaic. New boss fights against a large moth and/or dribbly guy is it? New weapons is it? New activity to grind to up my power level by +1 every week is it? Everyone would tackle the new stuff in a similar order, then round things off with the inevitable Raid.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The game's last expansion, The Final Shape, was still structured similarly to the rest, but felt like a step forwards. It was a DLC that was a bit weird and spooky and harboured some moments that pushed Destiny into new territory: time attacks where you'd have to outrun dangerous gloop or destroy levitating tablets with laser blasts you'd reflected from enemies. Some scenarios, an absolute nightmare, but hey, I respected the twists.</p>
<p>Green says that they were proud of The Final Shape, but it "dominated all of our development effort". So by releasing two medium-sized expansions every six months, they want to "try new things that challenge your idea of what a Destiny experience can be". Interestingly, he goes on to say that they're actively "prototyping non-linear campaigns, exploration experiences similar to the Dreaming City or Metroidvanias", as well as "roguelikes or survival shooters".</p>
<p>Seasons are changing, too. Instead of three Episodes, Bungie will release four Major Updates per year, one every three months. "Each Expansion will launch alongside a Major Update at the start of a Season, and then a second Major Update will follow three months later to refresh the Core Game with new and reprised content". They'll include new activities, rewards, weekly events, and meta/balance updates - all free.</p>
<p>As evidenced in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxv-m5KVGy4">Liam and I's "Starting Destiny 2 from scratch" video</a>, the game's UI is an absolute trashfire and understanding the game literally requires you to create some dumb spreadsheet. Well, Bungie acknowledges that "you practically need a PhD to decide what to play and how to get the rewards you're looking for", at the very least. From a separate, more in-depth post on <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/theportal">the UI</a>, Bungie's exploring the possibility of replacing the Destination map with a new, cleaner Portal screen. And in other <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/coregame_rewards">rewards related</a> posts, they're looking into quality "tiers" for weapons and greater freedom to <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/coregame_activities">customise challenges</a> with modifiers that'll net you more specific stuff.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/destiny-2-portal-ui.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bungie</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for the next DLC, Bungie have named it "Codename: Apollo" for now and it's described as a nonlinear affair. So, rather than a straight shot campaign, you'll get to choose how you want progress from a number of options. Other than that, though, there isn't much more information.</p>
<p>I'm cautiously excited for these changes, but I'm truly glad that Bungie are going to take Destiny in some different directions. I think it's always been best in, for lack of a better term, funky little packages. Most notably when they introduced a horde mode - I miss it! Or when trace rifles were borked for a while, letting players kill each other in seconds with a quick zap, so they released a game mode that exclusively let people loose with their brokenness. So yeah, give us a strange roguelike mode, embrace the game-breaking stuff, make weird decisions (within reason, I suppose).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-sony-president-says-those-affected-by-layoffs-should-%E2%80%9Cgo-to-the-beach-for-a-year%E2%80%9D.976599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sony-ex-president-layoffs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ex-Sony President Chris Deering has said that those affected by the recent industry layoffs should “find a cheap place to live and go to the beach for a year.”</p>



<p>The comments come from the latest <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/chris-deering-former-president-of-sony-computer/id1665581266?i=1000668974022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">My Perfect Console podcast</a>, where host Simon Parkin and Chris Deering talked about the recent widespread industry layoffs.</p>



<p>Speaking on the layoffs, Deering said, “I don’t think its fair to say that the resulting layoffs have been greed. I always tried to minimize the speed in which we added staff because I always knew there would be a cycle, and I didn’t want to end up having the same problems that Sony did at Electronics.”</p>



<p>“Now, of course, there was just recently a big layoff of Sony Studios and in London, but what whole studio setup has been run out of Amsterdam now for a few years, and I don’t know… if the money isn’t coming in from consumers on the last game, it’s going to be hard to justify spending money for the next game. I think it’s probably very painful for the managers, but I don’t think that skill in this area [of game dev] will be a lifetime of poverty or limitation,” he continued.</p>



<p>Deering then went on to say, &nbsp;It’s still where the action is, and it’s like the pandemic but now you’re going to have to take a few…figure out how to get through it, drive an Uber or whatever, go off to find a cheap place to live and go to the beach for a year. But keep up with your news and keep up with it, because once you get off the train, it’s much harder. But I’m optimistic about the future for even people that have recently been laid off.”</p>



<p>So there you have it: If you’ve recently been laid off and don’t have a job, find a cheap place to live and go to the beach for a year. It’s so easy after losing your livelihood. Sigh.</p>



<p>Currently, there are an estimated 12,000 people who have lost their jobs in the gaming industry in 2024 alone, with the industry seeing around 10,500 people lose their jobs in 2023.</p>

<p>It’s no big secret that the esports industry has struggled with profitability for the longest time. For several years, this volatile market has ebbed and flowed, with organisations rising and falling as the weight of never really making much money pulls the wider business to and fro.</p>



<p>Recently, superstar streamer Felix ‘xQc’ Lengyel mentioned during a broadcast that he has the perfect formula to fix the esports industry, but in his own words, it’s a bit ‘degen’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-gambling-and-co-streaming">Gambling and Co-Streaming</h2>



<p>During a recent <a href="https://kick.com/xqc/videos/6f488746-2335-4a99-8c9d-a7fc9b7cb13b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q&amp;A stream on Kick</a>, xQc spoke about the esports industry. He was asked what he’d do to help repair the constant instability of the market, to which he immediately agreed that something needed to be done. He pointed out that even before he was a pro player several years ago, the industry was ‘struggling’.</p>



<p>However, his plan to right the ship would prove inflammatory for many millions of esports fans.</p>



<p>On stream, he said that the esports industry needs:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>… watch parties, co-streaming, and through possible live betting with live viewing… Some of these things are at the core, some of the most social things that we as humans do.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Admittedly, Lengyel then went on to admit that he’s not fully knowledgeable about the state of the esports industry these days:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That is the biggest blocker that would loosen up that tight financial hold there is in esports. I could revolutionize if I was at the helm, but then I’m sure there’s a bunch of stuff that I don’t understand as an outsider.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/esports/xqc-lays-out-plans-to-revolutionize-esports-it-involves-lots-of-betting-2893391/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> for the quotes</em></p>



<p>Esports betting makes up around half of the market’s overall revenue, and some of the most prolific partnerships and sponsorships are between esports organisations and esports betting sites. The likes of Counter-Strike, League of Legends, and Dota 2 are massive for the gambling industry, and competitive gaming and wagers go together like peanut butter and jelly.</p>



<p>Co-streaming is also huge. For instance, the Call of Duty League’s official broadcast is often beaten out by co-streams hosted by pro players (or former pro players) like Seth ‘Scump’ Abner. </p>



<p>They’re not the ultimate solution, though – the recent FNCS Global Championship managed to score record-high viewership <strong>without </strong>some of the biggest co-streamers stepping up to broadcast the action.</p>



<p>Over the years, xQc has landed himself in hot water for his incessant promotion of on-stream gambling. His partnership with Kick.com, which is backed by Stake, was as prolific as it was scandalous, going hand-in-hand with a $100 million contract. It’s no surprise that his solution involves gambling, but to be honest, he’s not too far off the mark.</p>

            <p>Activision has confirmed there will be no campaign early access available for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>In recent years, Activision has given those who pre-ordered a Call of Duty game, such as with 2023's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mw3-how-to-get-early-access-modern-warfare-3-9328">Modern Warfare 3</a>, early access to its campaign. However, it is bucking the trend this year.</p>

</figure>
<p>In a statement shared with <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1833272473158135915">CharlieIntel</a>, an Activision spokesperson stated the Black Ops 6 team is "fully focused on October 25th", and therefore everything will be released in one go.</p>
<p>"We are excited about all the game has to offer across Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies," Activision said. "This year, we made the decision to ensure the community gets to dig in to any and all modes that they want at the same time, so we are back to one massive global launch moment [on] October 25th.</p>
<p>"As such, there is no Early Access beat this year for Black Ops 6, just the countdown to launch."</p>
<p>This will perhaps mean that many players will eschew the campaign altogether, with many still choosing to play Call of Duty exclusively for its multiplayer. What do you think of this move by Activision? Were you looking forward to the chance to play the campaign early, or does this have no effect on you?</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is set to release across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC.

<p>One of the biggest talking points around every League of Legends World Championship is the anthem that’ll accompany said tournament. Every year, the reveal of the LoL Worlds anthem is a make-or-break moment, and historically, some of them have been dramatically popular, pulling in hundreds of millions of listens upon release.</p>



<p>This year, the rumour is that Linkin Park will be behind the League of Legends Worlds anthem, and several clues point to that potentially being true.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-heavy-is-the-crown">Heavy is the Crown</h2>



<p>It was a few days ago that Linkin Park revealed a grand effort to burst back into the music scene in earnest, unveiling a new lead singer in Emily Armstrong and debuting a new song – The Emptiness Machine. The band’s first new album will be titled From Zero, and there’s a song on the track list called ‘Heavy is the Crown’. </p>



<p>That’s where the possibility starts surfacing – that sounds like a song that would represent champions. It could also be a reference to Linkin Park’s previous track, ‘Heavy’, which was one of the last songs released by LP before the tragic passing of former frontman, Chester Bennington.</p>



<p>In a comment on the post that revealed the return of the group, the LoL Esports profile left a ‘crown emoji’ – that’s the second indicator.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was then pointed out that Linkin Park’s ongoing tour will land in London at the O2 Arena on September 24, which is where the League of Legends World Championship will take place between late October and early November.</p>



<p>Historically, the likes of Lil Nas X, NewJeans, Imagine Dragons, and Pvris have performed the LoL Worlds anthem, so Linkin Park has the right profile to bring a huge amount of attention to the tournament based on the track alone.</p>



<p>Do you think Linkin Park would do a good job with a LoL Worlds anthem? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>Ex-<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/scee">Sony Computer Entertainment Europe</a> president Chris Deering does not believe recent layoffs across the games industry have been a result of corporate greed. Instead, workers who have lost their jobs should "drive an Uber" or "go to the beach for a year" until employment settles.</p>
<p>Deering was a guest on games writer Simon Parkin's podcast My Perfect Console, where the pair discussed games industry layoffs.</p>
<p>"I don't think it's fair to say that the resulting layoffs have been greed," said Deering. "I always tried to minimise the speed with which we added staff because I always knew there would be a cycle and I didn't want to end up having the same problems that Sony did in Electronics."</p>

<p>Deering acknowledged recent layoffs at Sony, including the London Studio, but noted "if the money isn't coming in from the consumers on the last game, it's going to be hard to justify spending the money for the next game".</p>
<p>He continued: "I think it's probably very painful for the managers, but I don't think that having skill in this area [of game dev] is going to be a lifetime of poverty or limitation. It's still where the action is, and it's like the pandemic but now you're going to have to take a few…figure out how to get through it, drive an Uber or whatever, go off to find a cheap place to live and go to the beach for a year.

<p>That said, Deering is "optimistic" about the future for workers who have been laid off. "These things do recover sometimes a lot faster than you might think, when all is very precarious," he said. "I presume people were paid some kind of a decent severance package and by the time that runs out…Well, you know, that's life."</p>
<p>Deering entered the games industry as vice president of international marketing for Atari, before eventually moving to Sony by way of Columbia Pictures. He served as president of SCEE from 1995 to 2005, during which time the company launched the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 consoles.</p>

<p>Epic Games has revealed that the FNCS 2025 roadmap will feature a massive prize pool worth $8 million. It’s the most preliminary update possible, as at present, we don’t have any idea what the competitive structure for the year ahead will look like. Now that the FNCS 2024 Global Championship has wrapped, we can start looking forward to what comes next.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changes-galore">Changes Galore</h2>



<p>Epic took to social media following the closure of the FNCS 2024 season to reveal some major changes and confirmations for the 2025 season. First, the company confirmed that an $8 million prize pool will be on the line next year and that the format will accommodate Trios – <em>not </em>Duos.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Heard you want a 2025 FNCS announcement?<br>HERE IT IS!</p><p>🔺 Trios<br>🔺 $8,000,000 FNCS Prize Pool<br>🔺 Siphon Trials – a series of tournaments to test versions of Siphon for its return in Competitive</p><p>We’ll have more information on these trials soon, stay tuned and get ready for 2025! <a href="https://t.co/AjTpBElQ3i">pic.twitter.com/AjTpBElQ3i</a></p></div>— Fortnite Competitive (@FNCompetitive) <a href="https://twitter.com/FNCompetitive/status/1832891659383976265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It was also revealed that Siphon Trials are surfacing. This is the mechanic that allows users to secure more health and shields whenever they defeat an enemy. This mechanic will be deployed on a testing basis before it’s introduced to Fortnite’s competitive ecosystem.</p>



<p>Next season is expected to be a big hit for the Fortnite esports scene. The recent FNCS 2024 Global Championship went down as the game’s most popular event in more than five years, drawing in more than 800,000 peak concurrent viewers. It’s a solid representation of the growth of Fortnite’s esports landscape and hopefully, it’s an indication of what’s yet to come.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the next year’s Fortnite Championship Series? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-took-just-19-months-from-prototype-to-release-without-missing-deadlines-says-insider/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today is the day Sony will most likely unveil the new PS5 Pro console. After long months of leaks and rumors, not to mention the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">near-confirmation</a> of its imminent launch from various developers at Gamescom, Lead System Architect Mark Cerny (who already designed the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 4 Pro, and PlayStation 5) will <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-reveal-september-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take the stage</a> later today for a 9-minute video presentation scheduled for 8 AM Pacific Time (5 PM CET).</p>
<p>In case anyone had any lingering doubts about what the presentation would be about, some eagle-eyed users discovered an unlisted video on PlayStation's YouTube channel simply titled 'PS5 Pro'.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Arguably, Tom Henderson has been the most prolific and reliable insider when it comes to PlayStation 5 Pro updates. For example, he confirmed the leaked specifications from the Moore's Law Is Dead video and revealed that the console's codename was Trinity, keeping with the Matrix theme (the PlayStation 4 Pro was codenamed Neo).</p>
<p>A few hours ago, Henderson <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1833207918076039443" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on Twitter/X that Sony managed an impressive feat with the PS5 Pro, going from prototype to release in just nineteen months without ever missing a deadline. If confirmed, it would indeed be quite an accomplishment. With mere hours until the big announcement, let's recap one more time what we know from the most credible leaks:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>45% performance improvement in rasterized rendering thanks to a larger GPU and faster memory</em></li>
<li><em>Hugely improved ray tracing architecture delivering 2-3x speedup on average, with peaks of 4x</em></li>
<li><em>Custom machine learning architecture that supports 300 TOPS at 8-bit to power the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscaling technique, Sony's version of Multi Frame Super Resolution based on the PlayStation Machine Learning (PSML) algorithm.</em></li>
<li><em>PSSR is an ML-enhanced version of Temporal Anti-Aliasing Upscaling (TAAU) that requires inputs similar to NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR and fully supports High Dynamic Range (HDR) pipelines. It also does not require per-game training like the latest version of DLSS</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few more tidbits of info shared by the far lesser-known insider Brian Potter, who, however, successfully <a href="https://x.com/BrianTheInsider/status/1830007612613480610" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted</a> that the announcement would come on September 10. According to Potter, a digital version of the PS5 Pro will be available from November 14 at £499.99 in the United Kingdom, while a disc version will be released on December 5 at £589.99. The console also reportedly has an improved DualSense controller featuring better battery life and 'enhanced' triggers and supports HDR10+ and Dolby Vision on select streaming services and media. Last but not least, the next State of Play should be broadcast on September 19, although it will be dedicated to indie and third-party games rather than first-party titles from PlayStation Studios.</p>
<p>Please take these last few details with a grain of salt. We will soon have all the information from the official source, anyway.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/midnight-society-layoffs-dr-disrespect/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/midnight-society-lays-off-50-of-dev-team-following-dr-disrespect-drama.976545/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/midnight-society-layoffs-dr-disrespect/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been revealed that Midnight Society, the studio working on DEADROP, a ‘vertical’ extraction shooter, has been forced to lay off ‘roughly 50%’ of the development team. Midnight Society rocketed into a prolific position almost three years ago when it was revealed that Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm was a founding member of the studio.</p>



<p>In the years that followed, the controversial creator helped build Midnight Society’s brand and pull players into the world of DEADROP, which many doubted was ‘legit’ because it leant on NFTs as a foundation. Following the recent allegations levelled against Dr Disrespect, the studio has been forced to lay off 50% of its development team.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-knock-on-impact">Knock On Impact</h2>



<p>In a message pulled from <a href="https://x.com/JOK5RR/status/1833294762054455379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Midnight Society’s Discord server</a>, Robert ‘fourzerotwo’ Bowling, one of the studio’s founders, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As most of you know, we have faced multiple unexpected challenges in recent months. To adapt to these changes and secure the future of Midnight Society, DEADROP, and our commitment to providing innovative gaming experiences, we’ve made the tough decision to streamline our operations, which includes a significant workforce reduction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He went on to stress that DEADROP is still set to be released in 2025 and that the team will spend time compiling revised plans and a fresh roadmap. However, the vast majority of the comments posted in response to this message stood in solidarity with Dr Disrespect, the disgraced streamer who recently admitted to inappropriately messaging a minor on Twitch in 2017.</p>



<p>One user wrote, ‘Hopefully the entire company shuts down fully, jumping to conclusions on Doc.’</p>



<p>Another user called out Cody Conners, the former Twitch employee who kickstarted all this drama in June by posting publically about Dr Disrespect’s permanent Twitch ban.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nice job @evoli. A bunch of people are no longer able to provide for their children because you were so desperate to get involved in something that you were never involved in to begin with. Worst ’15 minutes of fame’ of all time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When the revelations about Dr Disrespect were aired, it was claimed that he was an influencer for Midnight Society and nothing more. The concern now is that his profile as an influencer was so impactful that DEADROP will fail miserably as the vast majority of people getting involved were only doing so <strong>because of </strong>Dr Disrespect.</p>



<p>What are your thoughts? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-a-seikret-ride-on-the-wild-side/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We’re big fans of the Monster Hunter franchise. Dyed-in-the-wool veteran hunters, I’ve personally played everything from the main series Monster Hunter 2 Freedom Unite (Japan has the best names) to the latest mobile release, Monster Hunter Now. Hundreds of thousands of hours have been poured into separating Rathalos from their tails.&nbsp;So, the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> obviously leaves us with huge excitement, and after going hands on for two hours we must say, we are absolutely stoked.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - 2nd Trailer: The Hunter's Journey" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_LtO6Mekjk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The preview session was split into two, with the first section taken from the game’s opening and featuring the first fully-voiced main character in the franchise. You’re a hunter, tasked with exploring the dubiously named Forbidden Lands — an area thought uninhabited for 1000 years, but from which a young boy named Nata has just escaped.</p>


<p>What’s more, The White Wraith, a monster long thought extinct, has been spotted in the Forbidden Lands. Nata and his clan clearly need help, and help in this franchise usually means a comically large sword.</p>


<p>Playing through this tutorial was great fun, with the cinematics being as beautiful and intense as you’d hope. Your expedition ship is sailing through the sands, conjuring immediate flashbacks of the Jhen Mohran battle from Monster Hunter 3. Along the way, you see a young girl, riding an animal through the sands, fleeing a pack of monsters that probably have Frank Herbert’s ears burning. It turns out that the girl is Nona, the beast is a Seikret and the monsters are Balaharas — all new to the franchise. The Balahara is a sand leviathan with a drill-like tail and a tripartite mouth with three tongues and several rows of nasty-looking teeth.</p>
<p>Naturally, you leap off the boat, land on a spare Seikret, do some badass stuff and beat the Balaharas.</p>
<p>After this pretty intense opening, we came across another new monster called a Chatacabra — an ape-like amphibian that licks as hard as it punches – which we have to defeat to rescue Nona. So far, that’s two brand-new monsters with unique attack patterns that are vaguely reminiscent of monsters from previous games.</p>

<p>Jumping ahead to a mission a little later in the game, we were tasked with taking down an Alpha Doshaguma — a hairy, fanged beast that reminded me of Arzuros on a bad day. These monsters travel in packs, and you have to use Dung Pods to separate them and focus on taking down the one you want.</p>
<p>The issue, of course, is that this is open-world and we like shiny things, so naturally, we went exploring.&nbsp;This is when we came across Rey Dau. Rey Dau is very cool.</p>
<p>This large, thunder wyvern is gorgeous, covered in bony golden scales on its back, with smaller black scales on its underbelly, joints and wings.&nbsp;Its horns generate an arc that it can fire at you and, naturally, it can summon lightning to try to one-shot you.</p>
<p>This is where things got really interesting. Though our gear was under-levelled, and though we were warned that Rey Dau had killed a lot of people and was yet to be defeated, we’re made of stronger stuff here at TSA (not literally, our armour was definitely underlevelled).</p>

<p>We spent the next 20 minutes relentlessly chasing it down, chugging Mega Potions and eventually separating Rey Dau from its tail —&nbsp;something we’re assured was a world first. Such was our success that the PR is now considering swapping weapons.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Monster Hunter Wilds has a cool new feature that allows you to swap weapons mid-hunt. While riding your Seikret, you can swap between a primary and secondary weapon, opening up huge flexibility in the way you hunt.</p>
<p>This has massive implications, as well as interesting drawbacks. Dom and I have already discussed the benefits of swapping between the Long Sword and a Hunting Horn, alternating between Slashing and Blunt Damage, while also being a Bard for your team. Similarly, dropping your Great Sword for a Heavy Bow Gun to hit massive Projectile Damage when a monster goes airborne can be a game-changer.</p>
<p>The drawback, of course, is that different weapons demand different skills —&nbsp;you absolutely want Horn Maestro or Quickload skills for the Hunting Horn or Bowguns, but these are useless when wielding anything sharper than your carving knife. How this affects builds in future will be very interesting to see.</p>

<p>There’s not much else to say at this point —&nbsp;the Seikret can auto-pilot, tracking your enemies while you focus on buffing, sharpening and healing. Likewise, it can glide short distances, helping close the gap between you and your quarry easier.</p>
<p>The only real concern was whether the difficulty was getting lower as accessibility increased. Let’s face it, Monster Hunter games are notoriously and deliberately difficult. This preview definitely felt challenging enough — even as a seasoned hunter, I took hits as I learned the attack patterns – and even though I didn’t die to the Rey Dau and I managed to carve its tail, it really did put up a fight.</p>
<p>Time will tell how Wilds eventually plays out, but I must say —&nbsp;I am more excited than ever to get my hands on the final game. Just like at the Meowscular Chef’s kitchen, this small taste of a gorgeous offering from Capcom has me desperately wanting more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frontiers-of-the-mind">Frontiers Of The Mind</a> is cursed, by which I mean that 7-Zip turned red while I was extracting the file. What unsightly encounter deep within the bowels of my download file caused this temporary anomaly? No time to think about that. After playing this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game, I’ve now got too many <em>other</em> questions.</p>

<p>Presented as an interactive CD-ROM experience (rad!) documenting the history of a fictional, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightmare_(TV_series)">Knightmare </a>inspired kids show, Frontiers Of The Mind instills each click with a mounting unease as you explore its archives.</p>
<blockquote><p>Between 1987 and 1994, the British channel Network7 broadcasted 112 episodes of the TV game show Maze Masters, an interactive adventure targeting younger audiences. Only some parts of the show were aired.</p>
<p>The different sections of this CD-ROM explore the format and the backstage of the show. The idea is to shed a new light on the strange events which have been revealed afterwards.</p></blockquote>
<p>It pulls a sort of Hitchcockian horror. Going in, you know that awful reveals await - the tension is in slowly unraveling the details by browsing the folders, and discovering more about the show’s history. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganzfeld_experiment">Ganzfeld tests</a>. Post-show paraphysic cleansing. A dungeon master with a migraine-inducing stare. "Bertram left his mark on a whole generation of viewers". I, uh. Yes. I bet he did.</p>
<p>This is all brought to life through extremely evocative but suitably detached documentary-style prose storytelling, and snapshots of ‘footage’ that are both circumstantially convincing and also deeply haunted if you stop to think about what you’re actually looking at. Both the sludgey, spacy soundtrack and the image editing work are especially brilliant - somewhere between an SCP and that dodgy VHS that came with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonStrike_(board_game)">DragonStrike</a> board game.</p>
<p>It’s masterfully done: nostalgic, creative, horrible, and delicious. You can find it on Itch.io <a href="https://minusonepublishing.itch.io/frontiers-of-the-mind">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-campaign-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-6-won%E2%80%99t-have-campaign-early-access-activision-confirms.976530/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-campaign-early-access/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For the last couple of years, Activision’s studios have published the annual Call of Duty campaign around a week earlier than the launch of the full game. This was always designed to encourage users to play the campaign in full before accessing multiplayer, which has traditionally been an issue with Call of Duty fans.</p>



<p>However, Activision’s representatives have confirmed that Black Ops 6 <strong>will not </strong>have an early access period for the campaign this time around.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-at-once">All At Once</h2>



<p>Modern Warfare 2 (2022) and Modern Warfare 3 (2023) benefitted from an early access window for their respective campaign offerings. It was made available by pre-ordering each game, and it served as a nice bonus that allowed users to get the campaign out of the way before diving into the games’ multiplayer platforms without suffering from FOMO.</p>



<p>That’s not happening this year.</p>



<p>In a statement handed to <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1833272473158135915?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Charlie Intel</a>, Activision confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The team is fully focused on October 25th. We are excited about all the game has to offer across Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies. This year, we made the decision to ensure the community gets to dig in to any and all modes that they want at the same time, so we are back to one massive global launch moment October 25th. </p>



<p>As such, <strong>there is no Early Access</strong> beat this year for Black Ops 6, just the countdown to launch.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That means users cannot access any portion of Black Ops 6 <strong>before </strong>October 25 rolls around. It’ll be a mad dash to get the campaign completed before accessing the multiplayer modes, and for many millions of players, multiplayer takes such a priority that the campaign will remain forever unexplored.</p>



<p>Were you looking forward to potentially accessing the Black Ops 6 campaign early? Let us know in the comments.</p>

Sony’s new platformer is filled with amazing levels and loads of fun moments. And <em>Astro Bot</em>’s only going to get bigger thanks to a free DLC update that might add some characters only mentioned in the game’s credits, too.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On September 6, <em>Astro Bot</em> was released exclusively for PS5 and the world became a better place. Sure, the game is filled with a ton of PlayStation-branded content that almost makes it feel like a commercial disguised as a platformer, but the thing is...the game’s really, really good, y’all. However, if you’ve already finished <em>Astro Bot</em>, you might have noticed a few cameos mentioned in the game’s credits that don’t actually appear anywhere. Well, perhaps <em>Astro Bot</em>’s free DLC will fix that. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-will-get-free-dlc-later-this-year-including-speedrun-modes/1100-6526347/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-will-get-free-dlc-later-this-year-including-speedrun-modes/1100-6526347/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>GameSpot </em>on September 9</a></span>, in an interview with <em>Quest Daily</em>, Team Asobi’s Studio Director Nicolas Doucet <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/TQIqH3c3Agw?t=393&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/TQIqH3c3Agw?t=393" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed that more content was coming</a></span>. </p><p>“So we have free DLC. So it’s going to be free. It’s going to come this year,” said Doucet. “It will be small. It’s not going to be like a, you know, huge, huge amount, but it [will] be focusing on one of the features that people enjoyed in <em>Astro’s Playroom.</em>..the speedruns.” </p><p>While the levels are quite short in <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> and<em> Astro Bot</em> compared to those in some other platformers, Doucet said people love to optimize and cut seconds as they play stages over and over. So this DLC will embrace that. And it will add “some characters we didn’t include yet” in <em>Astro Bot. </em></p><p>Who might those new cameo bots be? Well, we may already know, thanks to the game’s credits. Don’t keep reading if you want to avoid spoilers. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/astro-bot-credits-point-to-potential-dlc-cameo-bots/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/astro-bot-credits-point-to-potential-dlc-cameo-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>VGC</em></a></span>, the end credits in <em>Astro Bot</em> contain references to <em>Assassin’s Creed, Beyond Good &amp; Evil, Rayman, Croc, Worms, Stellar Blade, </em>and <em>Rise of the Ronin</em>. No bots from any of these games appear in <em>Astro Bot,</em> even if you’ve played <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> and picked up the bonus characters. So it seems likely that characters from these franchises will be added in the new DLC. </p><p>And for those worried that the new DLC will be too focused on challenging speedrun levels, don’t worry, Team Asobi wants to add some less difficult and more fun stuff to the platformer, too. Doucet described this extra, upcoming content as “toy-like” in the interview with<em> Quest Daily</em>.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He also voiced the popular villain in <em>Star Wars Rogue One</em>, <em>Rise of Skywalker</em>, and the animated series <em>Rebels. </em></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/james-earl-jones-dead-1236082801/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/james-earl-jones-dead-1236082801/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Deadline</em> confirmed the news with Jones’ agents on Monday</a></span>. </p><p>While Jones’ work as Darth Vader could be scary and powerful, he also brought humanity to the villain. Jones also famously voiced Mufasa in the original <em>Lion King</em> and its live-action/CG hybrid remake. Both are examples of his impressive voice and ability to bring life to characters. Jones could make you fear Darth Vader or make you cry when an animated talking lion passed away in front of his son. And when it was time to remake <em>The Lion King</em> or create a new <em>Star Wars</em> movie featuring Darth Vader, you had to get Jones. His voice and acting were just that impossible to replace. <br></p><p>Beyond those famous roles, Jones also appeared in Stanley Kubrick’s <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> in 1964. He also appeared in big hits like<em> Coming to America</em>, <em>The Hunt for Red October</em>, and <em>Field of Dreams.</em> He also provided <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/PpjMWN9CVm8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/PpjMWN9CVm8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the funniest moments in any <em>Simpsons </em>episode</a></span> when he briefly voiced a murderous version of Maggie. </p><p>Jones, who was born in 1931 in Mississippi, is also one of the few actors to have pulled off the fabled EGOT (winning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony). Jones has  won two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Grammy Award, and three Tony Awards. In 2011 he was presented with an Honorary Academy Award for his career, completing his EGOT and putting him in rare company. </p><p>Jones’ most recent film role was in <em>Coming 2 America</em> in 2021, in which he reprised his role as King Jaffe Joffer. His final voice acting credit was in <em>The Lion Guard,</em> a 2015 <em>Lion King </em>animated spin-off series. As mentioned before, you can’t replace James Earl Jones. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Special editions are often the best way to grab a game you might have missed at launch, particularly if that game saw expansions and downloadable content after release. More often than not, you can snag the game <em>and</em> all its goodies in one easy package. That's the case with Fanatical's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-special-editions-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-some-great-editions-of-some-awesome-games-with-fanaticals-special-editions-bundle%2F1100-6526376%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Special Editions bundle</a>, which includes post-release versions of some top-caliber games, including Dishonored, Fallout: New Vegas, Frostpunk, and many more.</p><p>As is usually the case with Fanatical bundles, the more games you buy, the lower the price for each game. You can get two games for $7, or $3.50 each; three games for $3.33 each, or $10 total; or five or more games for $3 apiece. Fanatical is offering 17 games in the bundle, and there's no upper limit--every game after the first five will only cost $3 each, so you can get everything the bundle has to offer for just $51.</p><p>The bundle has a mix of stellar AAA games, mostly from publisher Bethesda, and strong indie titles. The special edition Bethesda games in the bundle all include massive expansions--the Dishonored Definitive Edition includes its DLC episodes, The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches; Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition gets you Operation: Anchorage, The Pitt, Broken Steel, Point Lookout, and Mothership Zeta; and the Wolfenstein Two Pack comes with Wolfenstein: The New Order and its prequel chapter, The Old Blood.</p><p>On the indie side, Frostpunk: Game of the Year Edition includes the base game and its season pass, which adds three expansions, alongside the digital soundtrack and a digital art book. You can snag the Giana Sisters Trilogy Pack, which features all three games in the series, and get old-school boomer shooters Dusk, Dusk '82, and Amid Evil in a single pack.</p><p>Fanatical has had some other impressive bundles of late, as well. <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/the-elder-scrolls-bundle?aff_track=CJ&amp;CJEVENT=6a8e15c76efb11ef836201970a1eba24&amp;utm_source=CJ&amp;cj_pid=100770772&amp;cj_aid=13797872" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Elder Scroll Bundle</a> includes six games for just $16, the <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/build-your-own-summer-superstars-collection?aff_track=CJ&amp;CJEVENT=678c9c6c6efb11ef836e01690a1cb825&amp;utm_source=CJ&amp;cj_pid=100770772&amp;cj_aid=13797872" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Summer Superstars Collection</a> brings the Resident Evil 3 remake, Ghostwire Tokyo, and Devil May Cry HD Collection, and the <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/build-your-own-bundle-warhammer-40-000-battles?aff_track=CJ&amp;CJEVENT=9e7c5de76efb11ef817e60450a1eba22&amp;utm_source=CJ&amp;cj_pid=100770772&amp;cj_aid=13797872" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Bundle: Warhammer 40,000 Battles</a> offers a bunch of turn-based Warhammer strategy games.</p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><h2>Fanatical Build Your Own Special Editions Bundle</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Aces of the Luftwaffe - Squadron Extended Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Broken Sword Complete Pack</li><li dir="ltr">Concordia: Digital Edition - Imperial Bundle</li><li dir="ltr">Dishonored Definitive Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Dusk &amp; Amid Evil &amp; Dusk '82 Triple Pack</li><li dir="ltr">Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Fantasy General II: Complete</li><li dir="ltr">Field of Glory II Complete</li><li dir="ltr">Frostpunk: Game of the Year Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Gal*Gun Pack</li><li dir="ltr">Giana Sisters Trilogy Pack</li><li dir="ltr">Hasbro's Battleship Super Collection Complete</li><li dir="ltr">The Evil Within Bundle</li><li dir="ltr">The Falconeer: Warrior Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Townsmen - A Kingdom Rebuilt Complete Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Wolfenstein Pack</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-exclusive-lego-batman-bundle-comes-with-three-sets-for-only-50/1100-6526223/">Walmart-Exclusive Lego Batman Bundle Comes With Three Sets For Only $50</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-popular-pokemon-labyrinth-board-game-is-getting-a-glow-in-the-dark-edition/1100-6526286/">The Popular Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game Is Getting A Glow-In-The-Dark Edition</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-the-first-verse-graphic-novel-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526253/">Cult Of The Lamb: The First Verse Graphic Novel Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-manga-preorders-amazon/1100-6523338/">Save Big On Trigun Deluxe Edition Manga Ahead Of Next Week's Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nightmare-before-christmas-manga-is-returning-to-haunt-the-winter-holidays/1100-6526230/">The Nightmare Before Christmas Manga Is Returning To Haunt The Winter Holidays</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sixth-sense-and-signs-are-finally-releasing-on-4k-blu-ray/1100-6526328/">The Sixth Sense And Signs Are Finally Releasing On 4K Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-the-complete-1997-tv-series-is-only-37-at-amazon-best-price-yet/1100-6524954/">Berserk: The Complete 1997 TV Series Is Only $37 At Amazon, Best Price Yet</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <p>
Over 340,000 Team Fortress players have amassed as part of the ongoing #SaveTF2 campaign, lending their signatures to an anti-bot petition that has now been lovingly assembled into a hardback tome and hand-delivered to Valve's offices in Washington.
</p>
<p>
#SaveTF2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-fortress-2-community-bands-together-for-peaceful-protest-to-savetf2">born in 2022</a>, amid a bot situation so severe, it was threatening to make Valve's classic team-based shooter literally unplayable. The community faced daily battle bots using game-ruining hacks, racist usernames, disruptive noises in voice chat, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-fortress-2-bots-now-advertising-bot-immunity-and-links-to-child-abuse-images">worse</a> - and with Valve doing little to help, players even took to fighting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-team-fortress-2-community-is-fighting-bots-with-bots">bots with bots of their own</a>.
</p>
<p>
Happily, though, the community's first orchestrated #SaveTF2 campaign was a success, drawing Valve's attention and a pledge it was "working to improve things". That promise culminated in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-fortress-2s-bot-wars-continue-as-valve-cracks-down-again">mass bot ban</a>, but the nuisances eventually returned - leading to a second #SaveTF2 campaign in 2024, this time in the form of a <a href="https://save.tf/">petition</a> calling for the game's "persistent and continuous upkeep" to ensure those naughty bots remain in check.

<p>
And round two of the campaign has had a similarly positive effect, with Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-fortress-2-aimbots-are-being-quietly-banned-by-valve">initiating another wave of bot bans</a> earlier this year. But with the petition eventually attracting over 343,700 signatures, its creator - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheWhatShow/videos">YouTube TheWhat</a> - decided it might have more of an impact in physical form, serving as a permanent reminder of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> community's enduring love of the game, if it could be placed in Valve's hands.
</p>
<p>
And so those signatures (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/a-book-with-names-from-a-340-000-player-strong-tf2-petition-has-been-hardbound-and-sent-to-valve-as-part-of-the-savetf2-campaign/">PC Gamer</a>) were turned into a literal hardback tome spanning hundreds of pages - a "symbol of the astounding amount of people that love TF2 and want to see it flourish", as TheWhat put it on social media. The book then got its very own <a href="https://x.com/Thewhat89/status/1832533634068213999">flashily cinematic reveal video</a> before being whisked off to Washington, where - as seen in TheWhat's <a href="https://x.com/Thewhat89/status/1832492588085002333">more recent update</a> - it was deposited in a conspicuous place somewhere in Valve's lobby.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>340,000+ names all compiled into 1 book. This is a symbol of the astounding amount of people that love TF2 and want to see it flourish.</p><p>This book has now reached its destination at Valve HQ. The future is looking bright for TF2.

<p>
Whether the book has now made its way upstairs and into Valve's inner sanctum is unclear, but it's hard not to admire the mere existence of the thing, and the kind of ceaselessly passionate fandom it represents. As for the Team Fortress 2 community, there are mixed opinions on how the book will be received. "It will most likely be cherished by the people at Valve," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1fcckgd/whats_going_to_happen_to_that_book/">poster on the TF2 subreddit</a> wrote. "They'll use it as toilet paper," another less optimist soul added, "I hope my name touches Gabe's asshole."

<p>There are hundreds, if not <strong>thousands </strong>of esports teams out there in the industry. From grassroots-level organisations to multi-national corporations, the esports industry is a diverse place when it comes to the organisations that drive it forward. In this guide, we’re breaking down the most successful esports teams ever, breaking down the top esports teams by their total earnings in the time that they’ve been operational.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-best-esports-teams">What Are The Best Esports Teams?</h2>



<p>For this ranking, we’re simply looking at which esports teams have won the most money over the years. It’s often a subjective debate, and everyone has their idea of which organisation can be considered the best esports team in the world, but the numbers can’t be disputed.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the most successful esports teams ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-paris-saint-germain-esports">10. Paris Saint-Germain Esports</h3>



<p>This esports team that’s attached to one of the world’s most famous soccer clubs isn’t the likeliest candidate for the top ten most successful esports teams ever, but here we are. This team has beaten the likes of Gen.G, Astralis, Cloud9, OpTic Gaming, and Vitality to make this ranking, and since being live, PSG Esports has won <strong>$19,734,315.30</strong> from 178 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-virtus-pro">9. Virtus.pro</h3>



<p>Virtus is a legendary organisation with some huge wins in the Counter-Strike and Dota 2 spaces, but over the years, the team has dipped in and out of almost every esports game in the business. By the time of writing, Virtus.pro had earned a whopping <strong>$20,356,050.84</strong> from a staggering 687 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-faze-clan">8. FaZe Clan</h3>



<p>FaZe Clan is synonymous with the gaming and esports industry and is arguably the most prolific pro gaming brand in the world. It fields teams in a wide array of esports games and has one of the biggest followings in esports. It just edges out Virtus.pro with <strong>$20,438,038.58</strong> earned across 763 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-team-secret">7. Team Secret</h3>



<p>Like many others, Team Secret has made it big thanks to Dota 2. The vast majority of this esports team’s earnings have been secured in the popular MOBA game, despite the organisation dabbling in many other titles. By today, the team has earned <strong>$20,664,835.51</strong> across 424 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-fnatic">6. Fnatic</h3>



<p>Fnatic is one of the oldest esports teams in the world – and one of the wealthiest esports teams, too. From Call of Duty to Hearthstone, and from League of Legends to StarCraft II, Fnatic has competed across one of the most diverse ranges of titles <strong>ever</strong>, raking in a serious sum of cash over the years – <strong>$21,434,276.82 </strong>from 1167 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-natus-vincere">5. Natus Vincere</h3>



<p>Natus Vincere is one of the best Counter-Strike teams on the planet, but don’t call it a one-trick team. Over the lifecycle of this esports organisation, huge stacks of cash have been secured in games like PUBG, World of Tanks, and Fortnite, but CSGO is where the team shone the brightest. In more than a decade, Natus Vincere earned <strong>$22,687,824.99</strong> from 786 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-evil-geniuses">4. Evil Geniuses</h3>



<p>Evil Geniuses is a legendary and timeless esports organisation with a stunning bankroll. It’s one of the best esports teams simply because of what it has contributed to the growth of the industry over the years, and it has dominated games like Dota 2 and Valorant. In 1019 tournaments, Evil Geniuses has claimed <strong>$28,567,423.99</strong> in prize money.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-team-spirit">3. Team Spirit</h3>



<p>Team Spirit is a remarkable organisation with a solid foundation. It was founded in 2015, which makes it one of the newest esports teams to make it big, but in that time, vast piles of cash have been secured by the organisation’s many squads. It helps that Team Spirit has won some of the most valuable esports tournaments ever, pulling in <strong>$31,046,277.40</strong> in 253 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-og">2. OG</h3>



<p>If you hadn’t guessed already, many of the most successful esports teams made their money in Dota 2 because of the value of The International, the most valuable esports tournament in history (well, behind the Esports World Cup). That’s no different where OG is concerned.</p>



<p>In both 2018 and 2019, OG won The International, along with several other tournaments, establishing itself as one of the best Dota 2 teams in history and bringing home some serious cash. By today, this esports team has won <strong>$38,552,932.44</strong> in just 192 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-team-liquid">1. Team Liquid</h3>



<p>Team Liquid secures the number one spot on the list of the most successful esports teams by a staggering distance. This organisation was founded in 2000 and has since blossomed into one of the most powerful companies in the esports industry, working on a global scale to cover every major esports title. </p>



<p>It has been a driving force of success in Dota 2, Counter-Strike, Rainbow Six, and StarCraft, netting an eye-watering <strong>$51,670,605.53</strong> from an insane number of tournaments – 2846 at the time of writing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/spectre-divide-ranked-mode-released/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Mountaintop Studios has just revealed that Spectre Divide’s ranked mode is live <strong>now</strong>. It was penned as being a ‘surprise’ for the community, and it can be accessed by securing just five wins in the game’s casual queue. Spectre Divide entered early access on September 3, and by all accounts, it’s doing quite well.</p>



<p>It was confirmed by Mountaintop that Spectre Divide’s ranked mode will feature both solo and team play elements, with players having a separate rank for each category.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-be-challenged">Be Challenged</h2>



<p>In a press release published by Mountaintop Studios, it was revealed that Spectre Divide’s ranked mode will feature seasons that unravel over several months. There will be plenty of rewards up for grabs during these seasons, with players climbing the ladder to unlock rank sprays, gun charms, and skins.</p>



<p>If you think you’re an aspiring pro Spectre Divide player, you’ll want to try your luck in the ranked mode. This game isn’t likely to challenge more established competitive titles like Valorant, but it’s not doing too badly.</p>



<h3 id="h-spectre-divide-ranks">Spectre Divide Ranks</h3>



<p>For those playing Solo, the ranks are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Emerald, Ruby, Diamond, and Champion</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re looking to secure Team ranks in Spectre Divide, you’ll be going through:</p>



<ul>
<li>Undiscovered, Prospect, Talent, Professional, Elite, International, Superstar, World Class, and Champion</li>
</ul>



<p>To level up, you’ll earn SR (Santai Rating) – but you can lose SR if you’re not winning your matches. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-ranked-in-spectre-divide">How to Play Ranked in Spectre Divide</h2>



<p>To get access to Spectre Divide’s ranked mode, you’ll need to play and win five casual matches. Then, you’ll have to sit through five ‘placement’ matches. This is where you’ll earn your initial ranking, and from there, the only way forward is through gruelling combat and sweatier-than-normal competition.</p>



<p>Are you excited to start playing ranked mode in Spectre Divide? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<!-- cache hit 108:single/related:f5d54f3a2b88b90edcc4cf7dc33a85d0 --><!-- empty -->
<p>On Friday, Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/09/rdc-2024-robloxs-next-frontier">announced</a> plans to introduce an open source generative AI tool that will allow game creators to build 3D environments and objects using text prompts, reports <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/06/1103707/roblox-is-launching-a-generative-ai-that-builds-3d-environments-in-a-snap/">MIT Tech Review</a>. The feature, which is still under development, may streamline the process of creating game worlds on the popular online platform, potentially opening up more aspects of game creation to those without extensive 3D design skills.</p>

<p>Roblox has not announced a specific launch date for the new AI tool, which is based on what it calls a "3D foundational model." The company shared a demo video of the tool where a user types, "create a race track," then "make the scenery a desert," and the AI model creates a corresponding model in the proper environment.</p>
<p>The system will also reportedly let users make modifications, such as changing the time of day or swapping out entire landscapes, and Roblox says the multimodal AI model will ultimately accept video and 3D prompts, not just text.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tP8nKzMbzVE?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>A video showing Roblox's generative AI model in action.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 3D environment generator is part of Roblox's broader AI integration strategy. The company reportedly uses around 250 AI models across its platform, including one that monitors voice chat in <a href="https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Moderation_system">real time to enforce content moderation</a>, which is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROBLOXBans/comments/16us2oq/what_is_wrong_with_robloxs_moderation/">not always popular</a> with players.</p>
<h2>Next-token prediction in 3D</h2>
<p>Roblox's 3D foundational model approach involves a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">next-token prediction model</a>—a foundation not unlike the large language models (LLMs) that power <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>. Tokens are fragments of text data that LLMs use to process information. Roblox's system "tokenizes" 3D blocks by treating each block as a numerical unit, which allows the AI model to predict the most likely next structural 3D element in a sequence. In aggregate, the technique can build entire objects or scenery.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                

<p>Anupam Singh, vice president of AI and growth engineering at Roblox, told MIT Tech Review about the challenges in developing the technology. "Finding high-quality 3D information is difficult," Singh said. "Even if you get all the data sets that you would think of, being able to predict the next cube requires it to have literally three dimensions, X, Y, and Z."</p>
<p>According to Singh, lack of 3D training data can create glitches in the results, like a dog with too many legs. To get around this, Roblox is using a second AI model as a kind of visual moderator to catch the mistakes and reject them until the proper 3D element appears. Through iteration and trial and error, the first AI model can create the proper 3D structure.</p>
<p>Notably, Roblox plans to open-source its 3D foundation model, allowing developers and even competitors to use and modify it. But it's not just about giving back—open source can be a two-way street. Choosing an open source approach could also allow the company to utilize knowledge from AI developers if they contribute to the project and improve it over time.</p>
<h2>The ongoing quest to capture gaming revenue</h2>
<p>News of the new 3D foundational model arrived at the 10th annual Roblox Developers Conference in San Jose, California, where the company also announced an ambitious goal to capture 10 percent of global gaming content revenue through the Roblox ecosystem, and the introduction of "Party," a new feature designed to facilitate easier group play among friends.</p>

<p>In March 2023, we detailed Roblox's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/are-robloxs-new-ai-coding-and-art-tools-the-future-of-game-development/">early foray</a> into AI-powered game development tools, as revealed at the Game Developers Conference. The tools included a Code Assist beta for generating simple Lua functions from text descriptions, and a Material Generator for creating 2D surfaces with associated texture maps.</p>
<p>At the time, Roblox Studio head Stef Corazza described these as initial steps toward "democratizing" game creation with plans for AI systems that are now coming to fruition. The 2023 tools focused on discrete tasks like code snippets and 2D textures, laying the groundwork for the more comprehensive 3D foundational model announced at this year's Roblox Developer's Conference.</p>
<p>The upcoming AI tool could potentially streamline content creation on the platform, possibly accelerating Roblox's path toward its revenue goal. "We see a powerful future where Roblox experiences will have extensive generative AI capabilities to power real-time creation integrated with gameplay," Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/09/rdc-2024-robloxs-next-frontier">said</a>&nbsp; in a statement. "We’ll provide these capabilities in a resource-efficient way, so we can make them available to everyone on the platform."</p>

                <p>Did you know that there's a Devil May Cry 5 multiplayer game available right now? A tabletop multiplayer game, that is. Popular board game manufacturer Steamforged Games released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HW59Q8V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Devil May Cry: The Bloody Palace</a> a few years back. The board game originally carried a $115 list price, but it's now out of print and there's still some stock lingering at major retailers. Over at Amazon, you can grab the board game adaptation Capcom's demon-hunting series for $43. And if you prefer to go hunting for demons on your own, The Bloody Palace is playable solo, too.</p><p>Steamforged also has two board game core sets for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-World-Ancient-Forest/dp/B0CG9QTGD8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter World--Ancient Forest</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-World-Board-Wildspire/dp/B0CG9NQK7L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wildspire Waste</a>--as well as adaptations of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-The-Board-Game/dp/B0CHS43K99?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-2-Board-Game/dp/B07F3LJDCF?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-Steamforged-Players-Gameplay/dp/B09F5L49B2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 3</a>.

            <p>
Apple has unveiled the iPhone 16, claiming it'll be possible to play AAA games on all devices in the line-up - and not just on the pricier Pro models, as was the case last year.
</p>
<p>
Apple started <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-triple-a-games-are-coming-to-iphone-15-pro-and-the-implications-are-mouthwatering">bigging up the iPhone's AAA gaming credentials</a> with 2023's iPhone 15 range, announcing the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a> would all be playable exclusively on the ray tracing enabled iPhone 15 Pro.
</p>
<p>
12 months on and the iPhone 16 is here, offering what Apple claims to be a 30 percent CPU and 40 percent GPU boost over last year's model, courtesy of the new A18 chipset - designed to handle the company's computationally demanding on-device AI features, due later this year. And that extra oomph (which includes hardware-accelerated ray tracing on the iPhone 16) means AAA is no longer relegated to the iPhone Pro.

<p>
Apple says the base iPhone 16 is capable of playing the already released likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-directors-cut">Death Stranding: Director's Cut</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-assassins-creed-mirage-resident-evil-7-iphone">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-resident-evil-4-on-iphone-15-pro-targets-the-ps4-experience-but-doesnt-quite-hit-the-target">Resident Evil 4</a>, and Resident Evil: Village. Digital Foundry previously looked at all four games running on the iPhone 15 Pro, reporting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-full-fat-resident-evil-village-on-iphone-is-a-captivating-tech-demo-but-hard-to-recommend-playing">mixed results</a>, so it'll be interesting to see how this year's phones compare - even if claims of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">low AAA sales on iOS</a> mean we might not see an influx of new big-name titles anytime soon.
</p>
<p>
The iPhone 16 (which includes a new physical Camera Control button, and the previously Pro-only Action Button) starts at £799 for 128GB of storage and a 6.1-inch display. The 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus, meanwhile, costs £899 for the same storage, and it's only up from there. Over on the Pro side of things, pricing starts at £999 for the 6.3-inch/128GB model, or £1199 if you're after the 6.9-inch Pro Max. All models launch on 20th September, with pre-orders available from 13th September.
</p>
<p>
In related news, Apple has confirmed iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will both launch next Monday, 16th September. These new operating system upgrades introduce a new Game mode, designed to minimise background activity to improve frame rates - and there's promise of improved responsiveness for wireless game controllers and AirPods too.
