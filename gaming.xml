And WWE World Champion Gunther attempted to regain his confidence when he faced off against former champion Damien Priest.</p><p>Survivor Series has always been a fan favorite, and these 10 WWE superstars were the best parts of a stellar Premium Live Event (PLE).</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2447097e8481341c9ec5a1402d9b7e0a" data-recommend-id="image://2447097e8481341c9ec5a1402d9b7e0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shinsuke Nakamura" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shinsuke Nakamura" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2447097e8481341c9ec5a1402d9b7e0a" data-recommend-id="image://2447097e8481341c9ec5a1402d9b7e0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shinsuke Nakamura" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>Making his return to WWE television a few weeks ago, the former Royal Rumble winner targeted WWE United States Champion LA Knight after the popular superstar defeated fellow WWE SmackDown wrestler Berto. Following the attack, Nakamura reverted to his villainous strategy, having promo videos (spoken in his native Japanese tongue) played on the big screen during Knight’s matches in an attempt to distract him. A Survivor Series match was set for LA Knight’s U.S. title. Overall, it was a decent way to reintroduce the former IWGP Heavyweight Champion into storylines.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Nakamura hardly missed in his match with LA Knight, while Knight seemed a bit off, not getting in as much offense as we’ve become accustomed to seeing from the rising star. The story of this somewhat one-sided match was to reestablish Nakamura as a credible opponent and remind the audience of his abilities, which both performers successfully accomplished. The finish saw an incredible back suplex from Nakamura to Knight, leading to a brutal-looking reverse DDT on the champ. This set up Knight to take a nasty running knee (Nakamura’s finisher, the Kinshasa) to the back of his head. The former Intercontinental Champion has now regained the United States Championship in dominating fashion.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-recommend-id="image://7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-format="jpg" data-width="3936" data-height="2624" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gunther standing victoriously" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gunther standing victoriously" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-recommend-id="image://7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-format="jpg" data-width="3936" data-height="2624" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gunther standing victoriously" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> No. 2</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>After losing to WWE Undisputed World Champion Cody Rhodes at Crown Jewel last month, World Champion Gunther has struggled to maintain his confidence. In the build-up to Survivor Series, former World Champion Damian Priest often got the upper hand on Gunther during in-ring segments and even during a backstage altercation that Gunther initiated. The rivalry has been compelling, although it’s been challenging to convince fans that Priest would win the world title in Vancouver.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> In something of a clash of styles, Gunther looked to neutralize Priest’s mixed martial arts moves by attacking his left arm throughout the battle, even adding additional pressure with a devastating kimura lock that had Priest writhing in pain. The outcome of the match was determined by Priest’s former best friend and stablemate in The Judgment Day, Finn Balor. Balor interfered by hitting a double foot stomp on Priest, who was on the floor outside, while the referee was distracted (surprise, surprise) by Gunther. The WWE World Champion capitalized on this, power-bombing the New York native and putting him to sleep with a sleeper hold. Another great outing from both competitors.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-recommend-id="image://c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Candice LeRae entering competition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Candice LeRae entering competition" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-recommend-id="image://c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Candice LeRae entering competition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> In recent weeks, the 39-year-old California native has enjoyed well-deserved success. After winning the WWE Women’s Speed Championship in October, Candice LeRae continues to gain momentum. In the lead-up to the Women’s WarGames match, LeRae was aligned with WWE Women’s Champion Nia Jax on SmackDown, often assisting Jax during matches. LeRae played a supporting role during the build to Survivor Series, participating in post-match brawls with the good guys.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> LeRae, a talent who rarely gets the opportunity to fully showcase her abilities in a WWE ring, seized her moment at Survivor Series. Teaming up with current Women’s World Champion Liv Morgan, Nia Jax, current Money in the Bank briefcase holder Tiffany Stratton, and Morgan’s bodyguard Raquel Rodriguez, LeRae faced the challenge of standing out in a star-studded lineup—and she delivered spectacularly.</p><p>LeRae made an immediate impact by pushing Stratton out of harm’s way and executing an impressive double maneuver, performing a Code Breaker on Bayley while simultaneously nailing a Senton on Naomi. She utilized a chair as a launch pad for the move, making it one of the most impressive highlights of the night. LeRae epitomized the concept of making every moment in the ring count, solidifying herself as a standout performer in the chaotic Women’s WarGames match.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-recommend-id="image://d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The New Bloodline ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The New Bloodline ready to fight" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-recommend-id="image://d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The New Bloodline ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>No. 8</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> The new Tribal Chief, Solo Sikoa, showcased his natural charisma and in-ring presence, solidifying himself as a credible threat to Roman Reigns. Sikoa wasted no time making an impact in the Bloodline match. Early on, he unleashed brutal violence on Jimmy and Jey Uso, slamming a steel door into their heads in a shocking display of dominance.</p><p>Taking charge of his bad-guy team (Tonga, Loa, Reed, and Fatu), Sikoa orchestrated a devastating beatdown of the good guys (Zayn, Punk, Jimmy, and Jey) in the ring. In a dramatic moment, Sikoa attempted to exile his cousin Reigns from the match by unveiling a steel chain and padlock, setting the stage for high-stakes drama. He came close to incapacitating Reigns with two Samoan Spikes, leading to a thrilling false finish. However, the Uso brothers countered with a perfectly timed double superkick.</p><p>Sikoa was pivotal in the match’s climactic moments, enduring an all-out assault by the babyfaces, ultimately falling to Reigns in a decisive conclusion. Despite the loss, Sikoa demonstrated his star potential, proving that his success hinges on the caliber of opponents and storylines he’s paired with.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-recommend-id="image://9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-format="jpg" data-width="5518" data-height="3679" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob Fatu in the middle of action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jacob Fatu in the middle of action" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-recommend-id="image://9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-format="jpg" data-width="5518" data-height="3679" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob Fatu in the middle of action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> Since debuting in WWE earlier this year, the “Samoan Werewolf” Jacob Fatu has been a force to be reckoned with, striking fear in his opponents from the start. Already a former WWE Tag Team Champion, Fatu is just beginning to make his mark. </p><p>Following his standout performance at WWE Crown Jewel, Fatu would often be the last man standing after on-screen brawls with the OG Bloodline, demonstrating his dominance. His momentum continued as he secured a critical victory against WarGames opponent and older cousin Jey Uso, earning his bad-guy Bloodline team the all-important WarGames advantage.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> It’s clear that someone in WWE management sees immense potential in Jacob Fatu. Upon entering the cage, Fatu faced an immediate double-team from the Usos. While this would have been a major setback for most WWE superstars, the Samoan powerhouse quickly turned the tide. He neutralized Jimmy Uso by hurling the multi-time tag champion into the unforgiving steel frame of the cage and shrugged off a Samoan Drop from former Intercontinental Champion Jey Uso.</p><p>Fatu displayed incredible athleticism, hitting a breathtaking handstand springboard moonsault on Jey Uso, showcasing his unique blend of power and agility. However, the match took a scary turn when Fatu appeared to botch a top-rope move intended for CM Punk, resulting in legitimate pain to his leg. Despite this setback, the resilient Bloodline member pushed through to finish the match, proving his toughness and determination.</p><p>It’s safe to say that Jacob Fatu, the younger cousin of the Usos and older cousin of Solo Sikoa, has solidified his place as a rising star in WWE. His performance at Survivor Series confirmed he is here to stay.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-recommend-id="image://0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="8134" data-height="5425" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Boston Reed jumping off a steel cage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Boston Reed jumping off a steel cage" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-recommend-id="image://0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="8134" data-height="5425" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Boston Reed jumping off a steel cage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>No. 6</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> With Seth Rollins currently in his rearview, Bronson Reed turned his attention to his next challenge. Reed defeated former World Champion Rollins on <em>Monday Night Raw</em>, leading to Rollins’ removal from current storylines once again. The “Big” superstar made a significant impact on the November 15th edition of <em>WWE SmackDown</em>, aligning himself with the Bloodline in preparation for a massive 5-on-5 WarGames cage match at Survivor Series. </p><p>During a beatdown of the OG Bloodline, Reed hit a monstrous “Tsunami” on Roman Reigns, which the Original Tribal Chief sold as though his ribs were cracked—an incredible compliment from WWE’s top superstar. Reed fit right in with the Bloodline and carried serious momentum going into the premium live event.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Not only is Reed impressive at his size, but his instincts should be lauded. During the WarGames match, he took control of an unfortunate situation when his tag partner Jacob Fatu missed a moonsault attempt by quickly hitting a Senton on Fatu’s intended target, CM Punk. Another huge spot in the match was Bronson climbing to the top of the cage, aiming to crush Reigns, who was laid out on a table. </p><p>However, Punk pulled Reigns out of the way, causing Reed to crash through the table. Despite his team losing to Sami Zayn, The Usos, CM Punk, and Roman Reigns, Bronson undoubtedly established himself as a top performer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-recommend-id="image://25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iyo Sky getting ready to enter the ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iyo Sky getting ready to enter the ring" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-recommend-id="image://25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iyo Sky getting ready to enter the ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> The original Damage Control (stylized as Damage CTRL) member has gained momentum lately. After recently winning a battle royal to determine who would face World Champion Liv Morgan, the “Genius of the Sky” found herself involved in the 5-on-5 WarGames match at Survivor Series. Iyo Sky’s introduction to this storyline added significant value, as she brings experience and unmatched natural athleticism.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Sky never disappoints in high-pressure environments. From her introduction to the match, Sky commanded attention as she executed a breathtaking moonsault from the top of the cage, with a purple garbage can covering half her body, eliciting a roar of approval from the audience. The former NXT Champion more than earned her spot on this list with her bravery and consistently impressive moveset.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-recommend-id="image://5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriquez entering the match" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriquez entering the match" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-recommend-id="image://5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriquez entering the match" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> No. 7</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> Liv Morgan focused on maintaining her momentum following her historic win at this year’s WWE Crown Jewel event in Saudi Arabia. After weeks of tensions with Iyo Sky and WWE Tag Champions Jade Cargill and Bianca Belair, a match between them became inevitable. On a recent edition of Monday Night Raw, Iyo Sky earned the opportunity to challenge Morgan, further intensifying the rivalry with the “Genius of the Sky.”<br></p><p>The WWE Women’s World Champion, alongside her bodyguard Raquel Rodriguez, was unsuccessful in defeating Cargill and Belair for the tag titles, foreshadowing a potential rematch. Following an attack on Cargill during an episode of WWE SmackDown, former WWE Champion Bayley was added to the mix, setting the stage for the 5-on-5 Survivor Series WarGames match.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> One thing that stands out about Morgan is her unmatched ability to sell danger. When the World Champion entered the match, she locked eyes with Rhea Ripley, who glared at her with pure hatred. This prompted Morgan to grab a bat in an effort to defend herself. She attempted to cripple Ripley with bat swings reminiscent of Juan Soto’s World Series highlights.</p><p>More creativity came when Morgan executed her Oblivion finisher on Bayley while Bayley was holding a chair. Although the move didn’t look as impressive as likely intended, it was unique enough to be appreciated. Ripley ultimately defeated Team Liv, surprisingly pinning Morgan.</p><p>Despite some sloppy moments in the match (such as Nia Jax mistiming spots, including weak chair shots on Naomi and Bayley), the finish was strong, and the crowd appeared to thoroughly enjoy it. Morgan continues to be a shining light whenever she’s on television.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-recommend-id="image://6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rhea Ripley staring at the match to come" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rhea Ripley staring at the match to come" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-recommend-id="image://6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rhea Ripley staring at the match to come" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> N.A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> After returning to WWE television following an eye injury, former Women’s World Champion Rhea Ripley’s primary objective each week was to destroy the women who kept her out of action for weeks. Ripley versus Liv Morgan inside a steel structure felt like a natural progression. Now sporting a protective face mask, the former Judgment Day member was highly motivated, telling her tag partners for WarGames that she was solely focused on Morgan. Generally speaking, this was the less intriguing of the two advertised WarGames matches. However, the subplot of “who attacked Jade” added an adequate amount of interest.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> As soon as Ripley left the cage, all the bad guys (Nia Jax and Raquel Rodriguez) in the ring waited to confront her, showcasing her intimidation factor. Amid chants of “This is awesome” from the audience, Ripley displayed her brawling prowess by breaking a toilet seat over Rodriguez’s back.</p><p>The 28-year-old superstar also demonstrated her intelligence during the match, capitalizing on her tag partner Iyo Sky’s use of a fire extinguisher to handcuff Rodriguez. The match’s finish saw Ripley deliver a devastating Riptide finisher to Morgan off the ropes and through a table. It was a satisfying conclusion to a rough WarGames match and a strong reminder of why Ripley has remained near the top of WWE’s pecking order for years.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-recommend-id="image://7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Roman Reigns leading the way" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Roman Reigns leading the way" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-recommend-id="image://7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Roman Reigns leading the way" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> No. 5</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> The Original Tribal Chief has been trying to get his hands on his real-life cousin Solo Sikoa for months, eager to face him in a one-on-one match, though Sikoa has made it clear he’s not interested. The new Bloodline leader defeated the former World Champion at Crown Jewel in a tag team match, serving as a catalyst for the buildup to WarGames at Survivor Series.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to the event, Reigns and his cousins, Jimmy and Jey Uso, were searching for teammates for Survivor Series. After finally convincing OG Bloodline member Sami Zayn to rejoin their team, the good guys were still in need of a fifth member to complete the qualifications for the 5-on-5 match. In a shocking twist, the returning “Wise Man,” WWE Hall of Famer Paul Heyman, introduced the fifth member for the OG Bloodline team: none other than the original “Paul Heyman Guy,” CM Punk.</p><p>Reigns shares an extensive history with Punk, as the former World Champion served as a mercenary for Punk during his debut. This made for absolutely extraordinary television leading up to the 38th annual Survivor Series event.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Upon entering the ring, Reigns looked spectacular, scaling the WarGames cage (after Sikoa attempted to lock him out with his own chain) and hitting a diving crossbody on Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa, Jacob Fatu, Bronson Reed, and Solo Sikoa. Even while focused on his offense, Reigns ensured the story of the match remained intact. At one point, Reigns helped each of his teammates to their feet—except Punk—adding tension to their dynamic. This seemed to be a response to Punk pushing Reigns aside (similar to Candice LeRae in her match) to enter the match before him, upsetting the Original Tribal Chief.</p><p>Reigns continued to dominate, landing a low blow on Fatu and delivering a massive spear to Solo. The Head of the Table secured the win after all of his teammates (Sami Zayn, Jimmy and Jey Uso, and CM Punk) surrounded Sikoa, allowing each to land a shot on him. Punk hit the Go to Sleep on Solo, and Reigns finished the match with a bone-rattling spear, earning the elusive pinfall victory. It was an outstanding way to end Survivor Series.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The worlds of Call of Duty and Squid Game are set to collide in an epic Black Ops 6 event for the ages. The shock of the announcement was quickly replaced by hype and thoughts the event could be a banger. Let’s see what’s in store for us all when we become contestants in Activision’s newest game.</p>



<p>I’ve learned not to be surprised by Call of Duty events anymore. This sentiment went out the window when Operation Monarch had me gunning down Godzilla and King Kong in Warzone’s Caldera. I’ve also clashed with the Colossal Titan, and seen soccer GOAT Lionel Messi battle with bullets. Now is the turn of Squid Game in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squid-game-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Squid Game and Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Collab</a> was announced on Dec. 2, 2024, and it could be one of the most memorable in history.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-amp-squid-game-event-release-period">Black Ops 6 &amp; Squid Game Event Release Period</h2>

<p>The Black Ops 6 and Squid Game event doesn’t have a specific date yet, but we do know it’s currently penciled in to arrive in <strong>January 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty x Squid Game Teaser trailer—released on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty YouTube channel</a>—is only 29 seconds long, but it features some teasing imagery, along with the January 2025 statement.</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-reloaded-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</a> is expected to launch around this period, so stay tuned for lots of incoming content all at once.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-black-ops-6-amp-squid-games-event">What to Expect From Black Ops 6 &amp; Squid Games Event</h2>



<p>Activision has yet to pull the curtain back on any Black Ops 6 &amp; Squid Game event details for now—which is a shame as I’m eager to know what’s coming, but it’s fun to dream.</p>



<p>If you didn’t know Squid Game is one of the most successful TV series, ever—period. It’s critically acclaimed, won countless awards, and surpassed billions in terms of viewership. </p>



<p>Based on Squid Game’s content (and previous CoD events) I would expect to see a raft of <strong>Squid Game Operator Skins</strong>—with Squid Game uniforms likely to sell like hotcakes. I also think a <strong>special limited-time mode</strong> based on the show is a given, and it’s hard not to imagine it not being either Red Light, Green Light, or some sort of multi-stage Gauntlet Mode eliminating players. </p>



<p>Finally, expect a ton of objectives and tasks related to the event, offering an array of bonuses: <strong>Double XP Tokens, Emblems, Sprays</strong>, and the usual CoD goodie bag of cosmetics.</p>



<p>Please keep checking back as we will update this page the second we learn more about the exciting Black Ops 6 event.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike has been the most popular competitive shooter for well over a decade, spawning an esports scene that features several legendary tournaments each calendar year. Even after the switch to Counter-Strike 2, the scene remains as popular as ever thanks to its plethora of tournaments, including the illustrious Majors.</p>



<p>Here are the best Counter-Strike tournaments to look forward to in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-counter-strike-2-tournaments-in-2025">Best Counter-Strike 2 Tournaments in 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-iem-katowice">IEM Katowice</h3>



<p>The Intel Extreme Masters series of tournaments have been a staple of Counter-Strike esports for years. Katowice has been the setting for several excellent events for more than a decade, and 2025 will be no different. Winning Katowice also gets a team one step closer to winning the Intel Grand Slam and its separate $1 million prize.</p>



<ul>
<li>Dates: January 29, 2025 – February 9, 2025</li>



<li>Number of Teams Attending: 24</li>



<li>Prize Pool: $1,000,000 (estimated, based on previous iterations)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-blast-rivals-spring-2025">BLAST Rivals Spring 2025</h3>



<p>BLAST has been a regular feature in the Counter-Strike tournament schedule since 2017, and earned the honor of hosting the last CS:GO Major before the switch to CS2. In 2025, <a href="https://blast.tv/cs/news/BLAST-premier-updated-format" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLAST is switching its tournament format</a>, with seasons that culminate in a Rivals tournament that crowns the top team in the world.</p>



<ul>
<li>Dates: April 28, 2025 – May 4, 2025</li>



<li>Number of Teams Attending: 8</li>



<li>Prize Pool: TBD</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-the-blast-tv-austin-major">The BLAST.tv Austin Major</h3>

<p>The Majors are the most prestigious events in the Counter-Strike circuit, and in 2025 the Major returns to North America for the first time since 2018. BLAST will organize just its second Major ever in Austin, Texas, which will also be <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40062/sources-majors-to-expand-to-32-teams-from-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the last Major</a> to utilize the Regional Major Rankings events to determine qualification.</p>



<ul>
<li>Dates: June 9, 2025 – June 22, 2025</li>



<li>Number of Teams Attending: 24</li>



<li>Prize Pool: $1,250,000</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-the-cs2-winter-major">The CS2 Winter Major</h3>



<p>The second of the two Majors scheduled for 2025 is still a long ways away. StarLadder will <a href="https://www.sheepesports.com/articles/sources-cs2-the-second-2025-major-will-be-organized-by-starladder-in-budapest/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reportedly host the Major</a> for the first time since before the COVID-19 pandemic, in Budapest, Hungary, though that information has not yet been confirmed by Valve. This will be the biggest Major yet, with the format expected to grow to include 32 teams.</p>



<ul>
<li>Dates: December 1, 2025 – December 14, 2025 (reported)</li>



<li>Number of Teams Attending: 32</li>



<li>Prize Pool: $1,250,000</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just the biggest events of the year. The beauty of the Counter-Strike ecosystem lies in how large the scene is as a whole, with hundreds of events each year ranging from top-tier international tournaments to local LANs.</p>

                <p>It's been almost 10 years since The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt hit consoles. While the next installment in the series is still a ways away, CD Projekt can't wait to show fans what it has in store for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, which has officially entered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">into full-scale production</a>.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, CD Projekt higher-ups--including CEO Michał Nowakowski and vice president of technology Charles Tremblay--confirmed that The Witcher 4 will be "bigger" and "better" than The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p>"I think that we have some cool stuff going, and hopefully that will have some good showcase [of the technology]. The only thing I will say is that changing the tech for us does not change the fact that we always will be ambitious," said Trembley. "And the next game we do will not be smaller, and it will not be worse. So it will be better, bigger, greater than The Witcher 3, it will be better than Cyberpunk--because for us, it's unacceptable [to launch that way]. We don't want to go back."</p><p>Another thing the company doesn't want to go back to is how it markets the game. It wants to only begin the game's marketing campaign until it's truly ready, something it learned the hard way with Cyberpunk 2077. Nowakowski noted that they will still release teaser videos and other "crumbs" to stir reactions from fans to secure those preorders. However, it seems like the large-scale, big-budget trailers and assets will be reined in until the studio has a more solid release date in mind.</p><p>"I want to stress: it doesn’t mean we would not tease or drop some cool assets before [a full reveal]," said Nowakowski. "Because the marketing campaign, slightly earlier before the launch of the game, that's different than the actual, say, 'mass attack'. Mass attack is when you announce the date, you start collecting the pre-orders and it really is that race from that point, that moment, to the moment you launch the game."</p><p>No plot details of The Witcher 4 have been revealed, but at least CD Projekt management said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-2025-at-the-soonest/1100-6508062/">development on The Witcher 5 and The Witcher 6 should be smoother</a> because the foundation will already be in place. CD Projekt management also mentioned how The Witcher 5 and The Witcher 6 should take about three years each to develop, so fans can expect this newest Witcher trilogy to span into the 2030s.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> is reportedly  being targeted by a Russian disinformation campaign falsely claiming the post-apocalyptic shooter scans players' computers in order to help the Ukranian government "locate citizens suitable for mobilisation".
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.404media.co/stalker2-disinformation/">reported by 404 Media</a>, the claims have been made in a one-minute video - stamped with a fake Wired watermark, but in reality unconnected to the publication - that's being circulated on social media sites including Telegram and sent directly to journalists' inboxes.
</p>
<p>
The video falsely asserts "an embedded program was discovered in [Stalker 2]'s code that collects player data and transmits it to [developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a>]'s servers". It's claimed this data - said to include the device name, IP address, and the current location of the player - is "transmitted every second" without the user's knowledge and handed to the Ukranian government, because GSC "made a deal with the state" in order to secure funding for Stalker 2. "It's better to play using a VPN or boycott this game for your own safety", the video concludes.

<p>
404 Media says the video bears the hallmarks of an ongoing Russian disinformation campaign, previously dubbed Operation Matryoshka, intended to flood social media and journalists' inboxes with "false stories that usually paint NATO countries and Ukraine in a bad light, waste reporters' time, and make people distrust news outlets more broadly." Eurogamer has contacted GSC for comment on the video currently being circulated.
</p><p>
As to why Stalker 2 is now being targeted by a disinformation campaign, that's likely down to the game having become something a symbol of Ukranian resilience during Russian's invasion of the country (development has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-documentary-shares-personal-stories-from-development-against-the-backdrop-of-war">continued throughout the Russian bombardment</a>, with some developers remaining in Kyiv while others have relocated to Prague), coupled with its recent high-profile - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">enormously successful</a> - launch across Xbox Series X/S and PC.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2's website was previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ukrainian-developer-stalker-2s-website-blocked-by-russia">blocked by the Russian government</a> after GSC posted a message calling for an end to its brutal invasion of Ukraine, and the studio has also been targeted by Russian hackers who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-studio-defiant-in-response-to-claimed-russian-hack">stole Stalker 2 development material</a> and threatened it with blackmail. "We are a Ukrainian company," GSC wrote at the time, "and like most Ukrainians, we have experienced many things that are much more terrifying: destroyed houses, ruined lives, and the deaths of our loved ones. Attempts to blackmail or intimidate us are completely futile".
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2 received a solid critical reception when it launched last week, despite its significant technical issues - Eurogamer called it a "compelling and often busted survival shooter that frustrates and satisfies at alternating pitch" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">our three star review</a>. Since then, GSC has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">pledged to fix the game's "rough edges"</a>, starting with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyls-first-patch-is-here-featuring-over-650-fixes">patch addressing over 650 issues</a>.

You can now get up to 25 percent more Robux if you purchase the currency through gift cards, on your computer, or on the web, <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/users-can-enjoy-up-to-25-more-robux-on-computer-web-and-gift-cards/3275270">according to a developer forum post</a> from last week.</p><p>As for how that might look in practice, here’s some examples from the post:</p><div><blockquote><p>For example, users who purchase US $9.99 worth of Robux with a gift card, computer, or web would have originally received 800 Robux but will now receive 200 extra Robux or a total of 1000 Robux to spend on passes, in-experience items, and avatar items. Users who purchase a $10 gift card may now receive up to 1000 Robux when previously they would have received 800 Robux.</p></blockquote></div><div><figcaption><em>Roblox’s </em><a href="https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux"><em>Robux purchase page</em></a><em> also shows the additional Robux you’ll get by buying on your computer or the web.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Roblox</cite></p></div><p>Roblox says this isn’t a holiday promotion. “We plan to keep this new pricing in place globally beyond the holiday season,” according to an FAQ in the post. And if you redeem a gift card on a computer or on the web that purchased before the change was announced, you’ll get the higher amount of Robux, too.</p><p>The company gave a very vague answer its own FAQ about why the change only applies to Robux purchased via gift cards, computer, and web:</p><div><blockquote><p><strong>Why is the new pricing only available for gift cards and on computer and web?</strong></p><p>We’re always looking for opportunities to share more with our community, on all platforms and we’ll keep you updated on channels where the opportunity becomes available.</p></blockquote></div><p>But it seems likely that Roblox wants users to buy Robux through those channels to avoid losing money to fees taken by app stores and game console stores.

Up to six people can be in a Party, though they only support text chat to start — voice chat will arrive in “the coming months.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Path of Exile 2 is backed up by a silly amount of content to explore. It would make sense that PoE 2 can be played across different platforms and give you the option to transfer your progress from platform to platform. It’s never this easy though, so let’s dissect Path of Exile 2’s cross-platform features from possible crossplay to cross-progression.</p>



<p>People assume Path of Exile 2’s similarities to Diablo 4 means it surely has to share the same network features. But life is never that simple, and just because Diablo 4 has crossplay and cross-progression, doesn’t mean Grinding Gear Games’ long-awaited sequel does. It makes me wonder why these functionalities aren’t uniform, but I digress.</p>



<p>Path of Exile has the potential to wow gamers as 2024 draws to a close, and prioritizing cross-platform connectivity would be beneficial.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-path-of-exile-2-crossplay">Is Path of Exile 2 Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Tag team turmoil. Credit to Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Path of Exile 2 most definitely has crossplay across all release platforms.</strong></p>



<p>If you have any doubts, let me shut them down by telling you it’s developer Grinding Gear Games who confirmed the wonderful news. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUUXKN7Kh9Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Path of Exile 2 Console Announcement Trailer</a>, appearing in large letters halfway through the trailer, it simply says, “<strong>Cross-play.</strong>” </p>



<p>A one-word answer tells us everything we need to know.</p>



<p>In short, if you’re on PlayStation, you can head into battle with Xbox and PC players, and vice versa. This is possible too as Path of Exile 2 has already assured the community of full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-path-of-exile-2-have-co-op-multiplayer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer and co-op</a> integration during Early Access—and likely beyond.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-path-of-exile-2-have-cross-progression">Does Path of Exile 2 have cross-progression?</h2>



<p>We’re two for two as <strong>Path of Exile has also cross-progression</strong>—a detail once again confirmed by the game’s creator.</p>



<p>Tick all the boxes, give us your best grin, and choose your favorite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-classes-are-available-in-path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2 class</a> with the knowledge your saved data is transferable between platforms. The console trailer also flashes up “Cross-progression” a few seconds after the crossplay confirmation, ensuring flexibility for all. </p>



<p>So, if you’re enjoying the free-to-play adventure game on PS5, and want to continue your adventure on PC, cross-platform cross-progression allows this seamlessly. You save your data on one format, turn it off, load up PoE 2 on another piece of hardware, and you pick up where you left off.</p>

<p>Let us know if you intend to take full advantage of these handy qualities. Also, boost your PoE 2 knowledge by knowing the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-path-of-exile-2-pc-system-requirements-minimum-recommended-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC requirements</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to play Early Access</a>.</p>

Drew, who divulges new information about the midseason update for Zombies. The developer reveals Citadelle des Morts contains a big focus on magic, and the map's unique Wonder Weapons will be four elemental swords. Drew describes the map as being large, but it does feature a lot of claustrophobic spaces within the castle.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Citadelle des Morts, the Tesla Storm field upgrade and Vulture Aid perk returns from past Zombies modes. Players will also have a new ammo mod and 18 new augments to unlock.</p><p dir="ltr">Kevin Drew confirms some quality-of-life changes for the big Zombies update as well. This includes reduced Mangler spawns at mid-to-high rounds, as later rounds of Zombies are currently flooded with Manglers beyond round 25, making high-round attempts very frustrating for players. Treyarch is also including a cap on active Manglers up to Round 100.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, the Vermin and Parasite rounds of Zombies take a long time to complete due to slow-spawning enemies, but Drew revealed the special rounds will become shorter after the update.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch says more Zombies details will be revealed with the Season 1 Reloaded patch notes, which should arrive closer to the big update.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Zombies, Citadelle des Morts's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/">first trailer can be seen here</a>. The cinematics also set up a narrative that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/past-call-of-duty-zombies-storylines-will-collide-in-black-ops-6-dlc/1100-6528073/">merge storylines from Treyarch's previously unconnected Zombies storylines</a>.</p>

However, Downes said Microsoft decided to hire him and Taylor again <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/master-chief-actor-says-halo-4-almost-recast-his-role-and-cortanas-with-new-voice-actors/1100-6528030/" data-ref-id="1100-6528030">after test audiences didn't like what they heard</a> from the actors hired to replace them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDgR1FRJnF8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that 343 Industries had changed names to Halo Studios and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">multiple new Halo games were in the works</a> and are being made in Unreal Engine 5. None of the games have been announced, though. So far, Microsoft has only released footage from a demo called Project Foundry that aims to show off what is possible with Halo running on Epic's Unreal Engine.</p><p>The latest Halo game was 2021's Halo: Infinite, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-becomes-biggest-halo-launch-of-all-time/1100-6499962/" data-ref-id="1100-6499962">debuted to record-breaking numbers thanks to Game Pass but has since cooled off.</a></p><p>Microsoft's new Halo leadership is attempting to distance itself from Halo Infinite, saying the way that game was developed represented the "last remnant" of how Halo games were made.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> is reportedly  being targeted by a Russian disinformation campaign falsely claiming the post-apocalyptic shooter scans players' computers in order to help the Ukranian government "locate citizens suitable for mobilisation".
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.404media.co/stalker2-disinformation/">reported by 404 Media</a>, the claims have been made in a one-minute video - stamped with a fake Wired watermark, but in reality unconnected to the publication - that's being circulated on social media sites including Telegram and sent directly to journalists' inboxes.
</p>
<p>
The video falsely asserts "an embedded program was discovered in [Stalker 2]'s code that collects player data and transmits it to [developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a>]'s servers". It's claimed this data - said to include the device name, IP address, and the current location of the player - is "transmitted every second" without the user's knowledge and handed to the Ukranian government, because GSC "made a deal with the state" in order to secure funding for Stalker 2. "It's better to play using a VPN or boycott this game for your own safety", the video concludes.

<p>
404 Media says the video bears the hallmarks of an ongoing Russian disinformation campaign, previously dubbed Operation Matryoshka, intended to flood social media and journalists' inboxes with "false stories that usually paint NATO countries and Ukraine in a bad light, waste reporters' time, and make people distrust news outlets more broadly." Eurogamer has contacted GSC for comment on the video currently being circulated.
</p><p>
As to why Stalker 2 is now being targeted by a disinformation campaign, that's likely down to the game having become something a symbol of Ukranian resilience during Russian's invasion of the country (development has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-documentary-shares-personal-stories-from-development-against-the-backdrop-of-war">continued throughout the Russian bombardment</a>, with some developers remaining in Kyiv while others have relocated to Prague), coupled with its recent high-profile - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">enormously successful</a> - launch across Xbox Series X/S and PC.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2's website was previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ukrainian-developer-stalker-2s-website-blocked-by-russia">blocked by the Russian government</a> after GSC posted a message calling for an end to its brutal invasion of Ukraine, and the studio has also been targeted by Russian hackers who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-studio-defiant-in-response-to-claimed-russian-hack">stole Stalker 2 development material</a> and threatened it with blackmail. "We are a Ukrainian company," GSC wrote at the time, "and like most Ukrainians, we have experienced many things that are much more terrifying: destroyed houses, ruined lives, and the deaths of our loved ones. Attempts to blackmail or intimidate us are completely futile".
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2 received a solid critical reception when it launched last week, despite its significant technical issues - Eurogamer called it a "compelling and often busted survival shooter that frustrates and satisfies at alternating pitch" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">our three star review</a>. Since then, GSC has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">pledged to fix the game's "rough edges"</a>, starting with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyls-first-patch-is-here-featuring-over-650-fixes">patch addressing over 650 issues</a>.

Some do have the Heavy Finishes Chain, but can only follow up with a Heavy Crush combo.</p><p>The inputs for the initial Rush Chain depend on the character. Some might need only one pair of Rush Attack and Ki Blast inputs (X/Y and Square/Triangle for Xbox and PlayStation respectively), while others might need four of the former. Delta Heavy Finish is thankfully the same no matter the fighter: <strong>Once your opponent is stunned by the Rush Chain, quickly tilt the left stick up and press Ki Blast, followed by two Rush Attack inputs.</strong> Perform it quickly enough and you’ll see your character dish out a three-part Vanish combo that ends with a Ki Blast to send the target flying. Make sure to use the entire input chain. The opponent will recover very quickly if you end the chain early.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Rush Supers Can Be A Super-Rush Once Mastered</a></span></p><p>A notable difference from the original Tri-Attack in previous games is that this newer version ends with a launcher instead of slamming the target downward. This is reminiscent of the Delta Combination attacks from prior titles, which could be why it’s called Delta Heavy Finisher. This change lets you follow up on the final hit just like any other launcher. A Dragon Smash works just as well as more Vanishing Attacks or a Lightning Attack.

Helldivers 2 has the phrase "it's about freedom," for example. FInal Fantasy 7 has the phrase "it's about fantasy." And Bloodborne, as mentioned, has the phrase "it's about persistence."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gothic horror role-playing game also ends the special, two minute long trailer, which some fans think adds further weight to the significance of its involvement.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It could be a simple reference to Bloodborne being a challenging game which requires persistence to conquer, of course, but as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-announces-maintenance-scheduled-for-playstations-30th-anniversary-and-as-youd-expect-fans-are-struggling-to-cope">a bizarrely timed maintenance period is also scheduled for the exact 30th anniversary date</a> of December 3, fans are crossing their fingers and donning their leather hats in anticipation of a long-awaited remaster or sequel announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ending this video on Bloodborne truly is something," said @mathijnd on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkmonzpHVRg&amp;ab_channel=PlayStation" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>. "It's about persistence," said @davgil47. "That Bloodborne clip has a double meaning. They know we've been asking."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A screenshot of the Bloodborne clip is also at the top of the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/1h4x6cn/playstation_30th_anniversary_video_ended_with/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> page, and has more than 3,000 upvotes despite the trailer being just two hours old. "I know we’re joking," EdGeater said. "But this is actually the first time in my memory that Sony put Bloodborne in a sizzle reel."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They're doing this on purpose now," said another user. "It's a sign! The key to Bloodborne 2 is persistence," said someone else. "Saying 'it’s about persistence' on the Bloodborne part feels like a targeted attack on the community," another comment reads. "The light doesn't match the original game fight," pointed out someone else. "I'm wondering if this means something."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar sentiments can be seen all over social media, but fans will just have to wait until tomorrow, December 3, to see whether an announcement comes. Bloodborne launched on March 24, 2015 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review">is easily one of the most beloved PlayStation 4 games</a>, but developer FromSoftware has moved on to the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review">Dark Souls 3</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/21/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review">Elden Ring</a> in the years since, while leaving the Sony-published Bloodborne behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have persisted in asking for a sequel or remaster or remake, however, so will be keeping an eye out tomorrow for any hints at a potential return to Yharnam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is definitely celebrating the anniversary of PlayStation in other ways, at least, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-psone-style-playstation-5-and-ps5-pro-as-part-of-30th-anniversary-collection">a range of PSOne themed hardware has also been released</a>.

                <p>As usual, Call of Duty is getting a holiday update, and some of the first details for what's going down in Black Ops 6 have now arrived. As part of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q2r0XSMkcA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new COD POD from Activision</a>, the company showed off the first look at a holiday-themed makeover coming to Black Ops 6's Nuketown map.</p><p>As you can see, the map has been taken over with festive decorations and is covered in snow. Nothing has been confirmed yet, but there will likely be a number of holiday-themed store bundles to buy to help get in the festive spirit as well.</p><p>There is no word yet on when Black Ops 6's Nuketown holiday makeover will go live, or any other themed activities, but that should be relatively soon considering the holidays are fast approaching.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/lord-of-rings-battle-of-edoras-review-horses-and-pitchforks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The clash of swords, the thunderous pounding of horses’ hooves - these of the sounds of war in the world of <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. And now, Games Workshop’s releasing a brand new Starter Set for their miniature wargame set in Tolkien’s universe (the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/lord-of-rings-middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-review-spring-2022-releases" rel="nofollow"><i>Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game</i></a>). Following the story of the upcoming animated feature film, GW sent along a copy for me to review - so check out my thoughts on this epic, massive box in my <i>The Lord of The Rings: The War of the Rohirrim</i> – Battle of Edoras review.</p>

<h2><b>What’s Included in the Battle of Edoras Box?</b></h2>

<p>Battle of Edoras as a Starter Set truly does contain just about everything you need to begin your journey. The official contents are:</p>

<ul><li>Haleth, Prince of Rohan - mounted and on foot</li>
	<li>Háma, Prince&nbsp;of Rohan - mounted and on foot</li>
	<li>24 Rohan Warriors</li>
	<li>Wulf, High Lord of the Hill Tribes - mounted and on foot&nbsp;</li>
	<li>General Targg - mounted and on foot</li>
	<li>24&nbsp;Hill Tribesmen</li>
	<li>Two Rohan Houses</li>
	<li>The full hardcover 176-page rules manual</li>
	<li>48-page scenario and profiles booklet</li>
	<li>Double-sided 3’x3’ playmat, two reference guides, a range ruler, and 12 dice</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, this is a truly robust starter set, which you'd expect to see for its $220 USD MSRP. Now let's get into the box contents, the new rules of the game, and more!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-pitched-battle-2.jpeg?itok=G6ScBJtD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-pitched-battle-2.jpeg?itok=Uduml4Vd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The forces of Rohan square off against the Hill Tribesman in this epic showdown, featuring terrain from Battle Systems.</figcaption></figure><h2><b>How Does It Play/New Rules</b></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-us/articles/2ifuwrwc/middle-earthtm-strategy-battle-game-key-changes-in-the-new-edition/" rel="nofollow">official article breaking down many of the larger changes</a> to the new set should serve as a go-to resource for tracking everything this new edition brings, but to quickly run through the details:</p>

<h3>New Profiles Break Things Up, Simplify</h3>

<p>Each and every character and unit in the game has undergone a significant change to their profiles. Some of these changes include new and different abilities, special gear, etc., while other changes are foundational to the very construction of the profile itself.</p>

<p>For instance, Courage is now a target number to beat, vs. a static ability. And the Shoot Value and Fight Value have been broke up into their own categories, which all just serve to simplify the process. In my opinion, <i>Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game</i> has always been on the crunchier side of things - and there are still charts to consult based on the strength of weapons, etc. - but the changes here do hint at making the game more approachable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-pretty-image.jpeg?itok=o9z_MXci 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-pretty-image.jpeg?itok=Do4oxLLT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The forces of Rohan clash with General Targg and Wulf, High Lord of the Hill Tribes. Image: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure><h3>Intelligence Hints At Narrative Moments</h3>

<p>There’s a new stat on the profile of all units and characters: the Intelligence stat! This stat feels like a flexible stat that can be used in a variety of ways throughout the gameplay. For instance, the rulebook presents two opportunities: in one, a character is trying to free a relic from the ground and must pass an Intelligence check. In the other, Frodo’s been attacked by a special power from the Nazgul that forces him to make an Intelligence test to avoid being affected by it.</p>

<p>Here’s why I love this new addition, I think it truly does a lot of work to add the potential for narrative moments into the game. For a wargame based on some of the best storytelling of the twentieth century, it can sometimes feel like - aside from warriors squaring off 1v1 - it’s light on narrative touches. But now, with Intelligence, there’s so much open room in abilities, narrative play scenarios, and more to add even more storytelling moments and flourishes.</p>

<p>Beyond these two major changes, there are small tweaks and what I would call “quality of life improvements” to be found across the ruleset. Nothing here is earthshakingly different from the previous edition, but it feels very tightened up and tidy.</p>

<h3><b>The Models Included In The Battle for Edoras Box</b></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-good-heroes_0.jpg?itok=JNUICBNd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-good-heroes_0.jpg?itok=M530e8q9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The princes of Rohan are shown here, both mounted and unmounted, in front of Battle Systems scenic terrain.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point - fair warning - there might be some slight spoilers for <i>The War of the Rohirrim</i> - at least in the fact that character’s crucial to the film will be discussed here. Nothing major, but worth shouting out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The models included in the box feel very evenly balanced against one another, with all four good and evil heroes shining in their own light. To start, there’s Haleth, Prince of Rohan. He’s a strong fighter with three attacks, and comes mounted on an armored horse, and his special ability allows him to re-roll failed Wound rolls when he’s outnumbered.</p>

<p>Next up is Haleth’s brother, Háma, Prince of Rohan. He’s equipped with a bow, hand weapons, and is an expert rider on his mount. Though he only has two attacks, his special ability allows him to spend Will Points to allow nearby Rohan warriors to re-roll Wound Rolls of 1.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-evil-heroes.jpeg?itok=5QHVwPSQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-evil-heroes.jpeg?itok=qBAU-yP3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Evil Heroes, Wulf and General Targg, are seen here mounted and unmounted in front of Battle Systems terrain pieces.</figcaption></figure><p>On the evil side, there’s Wulf, High Lord of the Hill Tribes, who is also a strong fighter with three attacks, comes mounted, and can re-roll a single D6 during the duel roll (and <i>must</i> re-roll To Wound Rolls of natural 1 against an enemy Hero).</p>

<p>Alongside him is General Targg, a strong fighter with the Master of Battle ability (which lets him copy another friendly hero’s Heroic Action on a roll of 4+), and a more strategic ability that allows other friendly Dunland Warrior models near him to re-roll To Wound rolls of 1 if you’ve given priority to your opponent.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rohan-warriors.jpg?itok=LvmBks9O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rohan-warriors.jpg?itok=FJk_h4LJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Battle of Edoras Rohan Warriors on display</figcaption></figure><p>The additional Rohan Warriors and Hill Tribesman are also fun, if standard, additions to the kit - and make up the great bulk of the forces. Rohan has armor, and the Hill Tribesman can bring flaming brands (which are pretty potent weapons with the Terror (Cavalry) and Terror (Beast) abilities). Overall, as you might expect, the Rohan Warriors have slightly better defense, and they also have a better Intelligence Score.</p>

<h2><b>The Look of the Models of Battle of Edoras</b></h2>

<p>The models included in this set all look really nice. While the Rohan Warriors are fairly standard in terms of their design and sculpt, I like the look of them all on foot. When I get these painted up in their traditional Rohan colors, I think they’re really going to stand out with their uniform design and long, pointed spears.</p>

<p>Contrasting them nicely is the chaotic look of the Hill Tribesman. With burning brands, pitchforks, and other improvised weapons, and with all of their models sculpted to look like they’re mid-run, there’s a kind of wild energy to these models that I really like.</p>

That’s my biggest (and really only) complaint with this set - there’s so much gluing of tiny pieces - in a way that feels a little outdated. I shouldn’t have to glue the front of a models face to the back of their head in the year of our Ilúvatar 2024.</p>

<h2><b>Special Note: Easy Rohan Terrain Perfect for Battle of Edoras</b></h2>

<p>I also wanted to take a moment here before the end of the review to make a special callout for one of my all-time favorite terrain solutions, <a href="https://battlesystems.co.uk/product-category/terrain/fantasy/" rel="nofollow">Battle Systems Fantasy Terrain</a>, because it fits so perfectly with the look, feel, and theme of <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>War of the Rohirim. </i>This hard cardboard terrain, which comes pre-printed with lush imagery, snaps together easily, is highly modular, and takes a fraction of the time to set up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-battle-systems-terrain-showpiece.jpg?itok=DnL55YtR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-battle-systems-terrain-showpiece.jpg?itok=6vbo-jZc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This setpiece from the Fantasy Village Battle Systems terrain kit adds some verticality and vivid design to the game.</figcaption></figure><p>Whenever I’m playing a skirmish wargame like <i>MeSBG</i>, <i>Frostgrave</i>, and <i>Warcry</i>, etc. I’m almost always reaching for this terrain vs. heavier plastic options. And while the terrain you see in my photos is from the Fantasy Village and Ruined Settlement kits, the set that really would be a one-to-one match for Rohan is the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/battle-systems-northern-settlement-and-ruined-monastery-preview" rel="nofollow">Northern Settlement set, which TechRaptor’s own Adam Potts reviewed a few years back</a>.</p>

<p>These pieces are obviously not part of this Starter Set (which comes with sprues for two Rohan Houses - I’ve only built the one so far), but I thought they deserved a callout here for anyone interested in getting into <i>War of the Rohirrim</i>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-hill-tribesman.jpg?itok=f6PaWl7N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battle-of-edoras-starter-set-hill-tribesman.jpg?itok=OhPL3yiK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Hill Tribesmen bring a ferociousness to the battlefield.</figcaption></figure><h2><b><i>The Lord of The Rings: The War of the Rohirrim</i></b><b> – Battle of Edoras - Final Thoughts</b></h2>

<p>There’s no other way of putting it - this Starter Kit is a masterpiece and a must-have for newcomers hoping to get into Games Workshop’s <i>Lord of the Rings</i> miniature game. Battle of Edoras is such a hugely robust kit, with over fifty models, to large buildings, the entire core rulebook in hardcover, and more.</p>

<p>The gameplay has been nicely streamlined in ways, though this still isn’t even as simple as <i>Age of Sigmar</i> (which of course has its own moments of crunchiness). So while brand new newcomers to wargaming might feel a bit stumped by the ruleset here and the intricacy of constructing these models, anyone familiar with wargaming at all will fall right in with this Starter Set.</p>

And speaking of expansions, <em>The Storybook Vale</em> hasn’t shied away from adding a wide variety of new meals and new ingredients to make them. One of these ingredients—Salt Crystals— can seem a bit elusive at first, but it’s really not that hard to find.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That being said, obtaining a full stack of Salt Crystals can be a bit time-consuming, so we’ll tell you where to find this ingredient in <em>The Storybook Vale</em> and how to stock up on it faster.</p><h2 id="h17510"><a id="location"></a>Where To Find Salt Crystals In <em>The Storybook Vale</em></h2><p>If you’ve glanced at Salt Crystals in your collection menu, you’ve no doubt seen that it lists all four sections from the Everafter as locations to obtain the ingredient. However, clearing the way to all of these areas doesn’t reveal anything to harvest or purchase to grant you Salt Crystals. That’s because this ingredient is, strangely, only obtained via fishing.</p><p><strong>Salt Crystals are caught by fishing in the Everafter biome</strong>. But before you go casting your lure into the colorful pools scattered through this darkly magical section of <em>The Storybook Vale</em>, it’s important to remember that <strong>Salt Crystals can only be obtained by fishing outside of pools</strong>.</p><figure id="" data-id="457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-recommend-id="image://457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large Salt Crystal hovers on the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large Salt Crystal hovers on the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-recommend-id="image://457b0ed192e306e9c996812439678ab5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large Salt Crystal hovers on the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unfortunately, this ingredient shares a spawn with fish, so not every cast will earn you a Salt Crystal.

<p>The year isn’t over yet and there are plenty of great games still set to be released before it ends. In this article, we’re bringing you the 10 most promising games of December 2024. The last month of the year can hold some good surprises and, so you don’t have to pick through them one by one, I’ve put them all in this list.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-most-promising-games-of-december-2024">10 Most Promising Games Of December 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-infinity-nikki-december-5">Infinity Nikki – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PS5, PC, Android, iOS</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Infinity Nikki - Gameplay Overview Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zP7dLsL1b6M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Developed by Infold Games, Infinity Nikki is an open-world game that follows a gacha structure similar to Genshin Impact.</p>



<p>One of the game’s main differentiators is its dress mechanic, which profoundly alters the gameplay. Some dresses allow Nikki to float, others reduce her size, others allow her to slide and so on.</p>



<p>Unlike games such as Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves, Infinity Nikki focuses on platforming and relaxing activities such as fishing, looking after animals and collecting insects.</p>



<h3 id="h-ufl-december-5">UFL – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PS5, Xbox Series</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="UFL™ Insider #7" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4YFxD21q2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Popularly referred to as the “Fifa Killer”, UFL is a free soccer game that was conceived with a difficult mission: to stand up to EA Sports FC and eFootball.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-talking-ufl-with-strikerz-ceo-eugene-nashilov/">RELATED: Check our interview with Strikerz CEO, Eugene Nashilov</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s not easy being the “new kid on the block” in a genre dominated by two forces. Despite the obstacles, the team is motivated to make the game succeed, attracting the attention and investment of personalities such as CR7.</p>



<h3 id="h-fantasian-neo-dimension-december-5">Fantasian Neo Dimension – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series</em></p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Fantasian Neo Dimension is a JRPG led by Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu, two names that practically solidified the genre around the world.</p>



<p>For those who don’t know, Hironobu Sakaguchi is considered the father of the Final Fantasy franchise. In the story, we follow the protagonist Leo on an inter-dimensional adventure to save the Earth from Mechteria, a mechanical infection that steals the emotions and lives of humans.</p>



<h3 id="h-delta-force-december-5">Delta Force – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PC</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Delta Force | Technical Test | Official New Map &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16AXLgniZFU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>On December 5, Delta Force will receive what the studio considers to be a global open beta for everyone. However, as progress will be maintained, we can consider this to be a PC release.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-delta-force/">RELATED: Everything we know about Delta Force</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The console versions will arrive in early 2025. The game is being very well received by the community, featuring both PvE modes, such as the campaign that reimagines the same Black Hawk Down campaign from 2003, and PvP modes such as Havoc Warfare, where 32-player matches take place.</p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-rivals-december-6">Marvel Rivals – December 6</h3>



<p><em>PC, PS5, Xbox Series</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Marvel Rivals | Stars Aligned - Official Launch Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a49DJ2bj9Gs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Marvel Rivals is a multiplayer game along the lines of Overwatch. The big difference here is that the playable characters are part of the Marvel universe.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>At launch, there will be dozens of playable characters, ranging from well-known names such as Spider-Man, Hulk and Thor to heroes unknown to the general public, such as Luna Snow.</p>



<h3 id="h-path-of-exile-2-december-6">Path of Exile 2 – December 6</h3>



<p><em>PC, PS5, Xbox Series</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Path of Exile 2: Early Access Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0VZsq_vJjGk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Path of Exile 2 is coming to consoles and PC in early access format. The game has everything it takes to be the definitive aRPG, with hundreds of hours of content and thousands of options when it comes to customizing builds.</p>

<p><em>PC, Xbox Series</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle promises to be the best game ever created about one of the most iconic characters in the history of entertainment.</p>



<p>Developed by MachineGames, the game will put players in Indy’s shoes on an adventure full of dangers, puzzles and, of course, breathtaking scenery!</p>



<p>At first, the game will only be released on Xbox Series and PC. The PS5 version will arrive months later, in April.</p>



<h4 id="h-mighty-morphin-power-rangers-rita-s-rewind-december-10">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind – December 10 </h4>



<p><em>PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series e Nintendo Switch</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgm1RkQgp5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Time for nostalgia! There’s nothing more vintage than MMPR: Rita’s Rewind. The game tells the origin story that made the eyes of several generations light up.</p>



<p>The brawler was developed by Digital Eclipse, the team responsible for the excellent TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection.</p>



<p>In the game, you’ll be able to face various enemies and classic bosses from the franchise, such as General Goldar, and all with the possibility of playing in local co-op or online with friends. If you consider yourself a Power Rangers fan, it’s impossible not to be excited about this game!</p>



<h4 id="h-legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-amp-2-remastered-december-10">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered – December 10</h4>

</p></figure>



<p>After many years of requests from the community, Legacy of Kain is returning. The two Soul Reaver games will be remastered, bringing improvements in texture, resolution, audio and gameplay.</p>



<p>It’s the perfect opportunity to reminisce about these classics, or, if you’ve never played them, to have that first contact with two games that marked an entire generation and feature many brilliant mechanics.</p>



<h4 id="h-the-spirit-of-the-samurai-december-12">The Spirit of the Samurai – December 12</h4>



<p><em>PC</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Developed by Digital Mind Games, The Spirit of the Samurai is a 2D action game made in stop motion. Yes, you didn’t get it wrong.</p>



<p>The artistic style chosen by the studio gives the game a great air of originality. The story follows Takeshi, a samurai who must stop an Oni who commands an army of the undead.</p>



<p>The game is heavily inspired by Japanese folklore, featuring a rich lore of the country’s mythology. In addition to Takeshi, at certain points you control Kodama, a brave spirit and Chisai, a warrior cat.</p>
