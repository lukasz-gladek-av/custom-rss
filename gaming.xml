            <p>While <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> may have dominated any and all Nintendo news this month so far, we still have some Sega-related goodness for the here and now to break things up a bit.</p>
<p>Nintendo has today updated its Sega Genesis / Mega Drive catalogue for Switch Online members, and added three more classic games for us to enjoy. These games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streets of Rage</li>
<li>Super Thunder Blade</li>
<li>ESWAT: City Under Siege</li>
</ul>

<p>As a reminder, to access these Sega games, you will need to make sure that you have an active Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, which is the company's more expensive subscription tier. You can check out a little teaser trailer for April's Mega Drive update below.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news - and there has been a lot of it - last week the company announced that some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">classic GameCube games will be coming to Switch 2</a>, via Switch Online.</p>
<p>So far, the company has revealed that The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/soulcalibur-ii">Soulcalibur 2</a> and F-Zero GX will all be available for those who have Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack members, starting on 5th June. While those three are just the start, more titles will be added to the Switch Online GameCube library as time goes on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISTS/index.html">Snakists</a> is a game by Pippin Barr, author of many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/pippin-barr">small and wonderful ludic experiments</a>. The most pertinent of which, in this case, is <a href="https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISMS/">Snakisms</a>. That one takes the can-I-borrow-your-Nokia-for-a-minute-mate 'em up and explores a smattering of experimental design tunnels based on different schools of thoughts. 'Pessimism', for example, forces you to contend with a prized gobblin' dot placed permanently outside the confines of your snakely entrapment box, 'Asceticism' kills you as soon as you eat a dot, and so on.</p>
<p>Snakists takes this concept and applies it to concepts ending with 'ist'. Deist, purist, sadist, and so on, for a total of 20 different tail-wriggling tales. I enjoy them for how they both celebrate Snake and also employ its relative simplicity as a neutral palette on which to mix colourful synthesis of languages both human and game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For example, 'alarmist' is funny to play because it shouts at you whenever you get even mildly close to a wall. But it also stands as a sharply apt metaphor for the self-fulfilling prophecy that is constant anxiety. The closer you get to wall, the more the screen is obscured by the word 'CAREFUL!', until you can see so little you are all but guaranteed to die. The message is clear: get out of your own way. If you spend all your time worrying about tripping over, your legs will seize up and you will eat shit post haste.</p>
<p>Another favourite here is 'tourist', which is effectively just regular snake played over an image of a nice building. I appreciate its non judgemental attitude, leaving me to consider the implications of tourism on my own time, perhaps outside a nice cafe. Perhaps I'll scout around a bit and see where and what the locals are having, or perhaps I'll get really annoyed because this coastal Spanish town can't get my fried egg and chips the way I like it, as is the English way.</p>
<p>Much to think about. Many dots to consume.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>People often get snarky about Reddit but I consider the work of user _inferno_44 to be better games journalism than anything I've written in at least a month, probably longer. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jvezvr/i_followed_kyle_for_a_week_heres_his_daily">Three</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jvn6um/following_up_our_employee_of_the_year_heres_the">colour</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jw7rxo/by_popular_demand_i_followed_jessi_for_a_day_to">coded</a> spreadsheets blocking out three <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/schedule-1">Schedule I</a> NPC's daily routines, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-followed-this-ox-around-in-manor-lords-for-a-day-to-see-what-wisdom-it-could-teach-me">ox watchin</a>' style.

<p>They're surprisingly detailed for something that's mainly there to get you to hoof around a bit. Plus fixed routines are just good world building for a weed selling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> such as this. They raise pertinent questions. Does the forbidden spinach blur the ache of sharp routine like existential Alka Seltzer? Or does it encourage such contemplation as to appreciate the hidden rapture in the familiar?</p>

<p>Might we imagine Kyle pressing a soft taco shell against his cheek and feeling, for all the world, like he is being caressed by the glove of creation? His is one of the less varied routines, moving mainly between work and home save a half hour break the skatepark. Still, there's nobility in it, I think. Perhaps we've been misled. Perhaps this was the titular Schedule all this time.</p>
<p>Less industrious is Kyle's roommate, Austin, who splits his time between the community centre and the arcade. At 6:00pm each day, he leaves the arcade and furiously drinks for 45 minutes before returning. I get it, man. It's acutely embarrassing to boast to a stranger that you can "beat Time Crisis in one life" only to repeatedly get your bottom mailed to you by a cabinet tuned far harder than the PS1 version. I'd drink too. Heck, I'm drinking now just thinking about it, and also because it makes my breakfast taste better.</p>
<p>Most varied is fan fave product hound Jessi, who visits four separate locations to sit and smoke and consume canned beverages. Like all the NPCs, she walks in real time between destinations. I've been fascinated by this stuff since Oblivion blew my tiny mind when I spotted an NPC's marker move across the map to the destination I was told to meet him at. I can't say it still feels quite as magical as it did then, but it's still retained some wonder for me. Another reminder that there's more going on under the hood in Schedule I than its sudden explosion of memey popularity might suggests. And an extra reminder, for myself more than anything, that sometimes a lot of people like a thing because it's actually good, you shrivelling hipster.</p>
<p>I mean, rarely, but still.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Mafia: The Old Country - the next game in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a>'s Mafia series - will seemingly be arriving as soon as August.</p>
<p>Publisher 2K appears to have accidentally revealed the release date for Mafia: The Old Country via a post on Steam: 8th August 2025.</p>

<p>While the post itself no longer has that all-important date attached, many were able to grab a screenshot of the original with those release details included. "Mafia: The Old Country will be available on August 8, 2025. Pre-orders are available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via Steam," read the text.</p>
<p>This date was likely meant to be saved for Mafia: The Old Country's newly-announced PAX East developer panel, which is scheduled for 8th May at 7pm UK time.</p>
<p>"Watch as Hangar 13 developers debut a new gameplay trailer and offer a rare behind-the-scenes look at the past, present, and future of this storied franchise," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1941540/view/592894082264596999?l=latam">panel's announcement post</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">Mafia: The Old Country was first revealed</a> at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> last year. While the developer has kept many details about the upcoming title under wraps since, it has confirmed the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-developer-promises-sicilian-voice-acting-and-italian-subtitles">will include Sicilian voice acting and Italian subtitles on its release</a>.</p>
<p>"Authenticity is at the heart of the Mafia franchise," the team wrote in August. "Mafia: The Old Country will offer voice acting in Sicilian, inline with the game's setting in 1900s Sicily. Additionally, Italian language localisation will be available for both in-game UI and via subtitles."</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-early-ad-shows-gorgeous-visuals-summer-2025-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that Mafia: The Old Country would launch this Summer. Now, though, we have a semi-official release date: August 8.</p>
<p>The info briefly appeared in a Steam post that announced a developer panel due to take place at PAX East. On May 8 at 7 PM BST (2 PM ET), Hangar 13 developers will debut a new gameplay trailer and provide a behind-the-scenes look at the past, present, and future of the franchise. During the panel, the studio will provide an in-depth look back at the last 23 years of Mafia, insight into how Hangar 13 brought the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily to life in Unreal Engine 5 for Mafia: The Old Country, a Q&amp;A session and more development insights. Studio President Nick Baynes, Game Director Alex Cox, and Cinematics Director Tomas Hrebicek will be there to attend and reply to several questions, including some taken from the community.&nbsp; Any mention of the launch date was quickly amended, but nothing escapes fans these days.</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024, slightly less than a year before its planned release date. As hinted by the title, it will be set in Sicily. The goal is to dive into the criminal organization's origins, dating back to the early 1900s. Players will step into the role of Enzo Favara, who survived a childhood of forced labor and is now all too eager to prove himself to Cosa Nostra and, specifically, Don Torrisi's family.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-linear-narrative-driven-game-powered-by-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> by Hangar 13, the game will be a linear, narrative-driven action/adventure grounded in authentic realism. Combat will include melee fights with blades and ranged engagements with firearms. In certain segments, Enzo will use horses and even early motorcars. Mafia: The Old Country is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and certainly looks the part, although we don't have any info on the system requirements yet.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/sifu-xbox-steam-launch-march-2023-arenas-mode/">Sifu</a> developer Sloclap has announced that its new soccer game, Rematch, will launch on <strong>July 19, 2025</strong>, on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass when it launches.</p>
<p>Rematch was first shown during <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/">The Game Awards 2024</a>, and it definitely wasn't what players would have expected to be Sloclap's next game after Sifu. Sloclap has brought its brand of close-up action to the beautiful game, and the trailer that Sloclap showed off today during the Triple-I Initiative Showcase further shows how this will probably be unlike any other soccer game currently on the market.</p>
<p>Rematch features 4v4 and 5v5 matches for players to showcase their soccer skills. If you're especially keen to give Rematch a try, Sloclap also announced today that there will be an open beta test for the game in a little more than a week from the time of writing. The beta test will run from April 18-19 and will be available to PC players on Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rematch - Release Date Trailer | The Triple-i Initiative" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RsItvQSNjLI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can sign up for the beta test by visiting the game's <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/">official website here</a>. If you're already sure you'll be buying Rematch, you can also pre-order one of the game's three editions, ranging from $29.99 USD for just the base game to $49.99 for the 'Elite Edition.' Buying either of the two top-end editions of Rematch grants you 72 hours of early access to Rematch, battle pass rewards, and a few in-game cosmetics to show off in multiplayer matches.</p>

<p>It was announced just yesterday the the next Xbox Games Showcase is set for June 8, and there’s one game that I’m keeping an eager eye open for. I’ve been waiting to hear something about the State of Decay 3 release date for the longest time, and this could finally be when we find out what’s going on.</p>



<p>Presently, the game doesn’t even have a <strong>release year</strong>. The running rumour is that State of Decay 3 will be released in 2026, but Undead Labs and Xbox Game Studios haven’t confirmed a thing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-me-to-the-apocalypse">Take Me To The Apocalypse</h2>



<p>State of Decay 3 is long overdue, in my book. I’m a huge fan of the franchise and adore the sandbox elements of picking a home and building it up while fighting with a band of permadeath survivors to outlive a zombie apocalypse. It’s everything I want in an end-of-the-world, undead epic.</p>



<p>In September 2024, Undead Labs revealed it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-2-end-support-undead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ending support on State of Decay 2</a> to focus entirely on the sequel, which means the team will have had almost a year to get the game in shape by the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2025.</p>



<p><strong>Last year</strong>, the Xbox Games Showcase played host to a phenomenal new State of Decay 3 trailer, which I and many other fans lapped up.</p>



<p>We don’t know much at all about State of Decay 3, bar the fact that it’s coming. The new trailer that was released almost a year ago revealed a few tidbits, but it’s nothing that we didn’t already expect from the game, such as fearsome undead enemies, vehicular combat, and multiplayer mechanics.</p>



<p>I’d do malicious things to get my hands on the State of Decay 3 release date – hopefully, something is shown at the upcoming Xbox Games Showcase. It has been almost seven years since the last State of Decay game was released.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to a new State of Decay game? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
Right, anyone fancy a small look at the next update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enshrouded">Enshrouded</a>? Today's Triple-I showcase delivered exactly that, though I have to admit it's pretty brief, and doesn't show all that much. The game's sixth update, Thralls of Twilight, is due out sometime in May, and seems to come with some big additions. For one, there's new enemies that "creep, crawl, and stalk you further," which sounds… pleasant.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The update will give you a few more reasons to dive into the shroud too. There's more resources, the ability to unlock a new weapons customisation mechanic, and more besides that. Improvements have also apparently been made to the game's nighttime cycle, as there'll be enemy groups going around the world at night with some new rewards you can find too. Gems are also being added that'll let you can attach to your weapons that all have special effects.

Enshrouded's creative director Antony Christoulakis had a chat with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/enshroudeds-next-update-promises-a-rebirth-of-the-shroud-with-new-monsters-resources-and-a-whole-new-weapon-customization-system/">PCGamer</a> recently too, where he explained that this update is focused on the shroud so much because it's "not strong enough yet from our perspective. So, we introduced new enemies that are coming with the next update, as well as improving the topology and adding more points of interest to these [shrouded regions], and also some new mechanics that hopefully make combat also more interesting."
</p>
<p>
The game has been out in early access for a little over a year now, and the intention was originally that it would be out within a year, but obviously the game needs a bit more time. It's also 20% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/">Steam</a> at the moment, so now seems like a good time to pick it up if you're so inclined.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-editions-hands-on-impressions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will be home to plenty of original experiences, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, but a core part of the system’s early lineup will be “Nintendo Switch 2 Edition” versions of Switch titles. These will include upcoming games that will launch simultaneously on Switch 1 and 2, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, as well as a handful of upgrades to older Switch titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-party-jamboree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>.</p>
<p>I recently went hands-on with a number of these new editions at a Nintendo Switch 2 preview event (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can check out my general impressions of the hardware here</a>). I’ve already <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chimed in on the Switch 2 version of Metroid Prime 4</a>, but here’s a roundup of my thoughts on the various Switch 2 Editions of older titles. Are these editions a worthy upgrade or underwhelming? Scroll on for my early impressions…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions2.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom</strong></h2>
<p>Both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom were said to run at 4K and 60fps by Nintendo reps at the hands-on event, although I suspect some sort of uprezing was going on, as they didn’t look <em>quite </em>as crisp as some of the other Switch 2 Edition titles I played at the event. Some assets didn’t look as sharp as they could have and shadows had quite obvious jagged edges. Of course, that can naturally come from uprezing a game that, in the case of BotW, is over eight years old at this point.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Make no mistake, the games <em>did </em>look much better than on the OG Switch, and the bump in performance was very welcome given both BotW and TotK struggled fairly significantly to maintain even a solid 30fps on the older hardware. Being able to run through Kakariko Village at a solid 60fps after all these years was certainly a cathartic experience. The new versions of Zelda BotW and TotK also support Zelda Notes, a service available through the Nintendo Switch App that provides additional maps, hints, the ability to share items between the two games, and more. As a generally app-adverse person, I don’t know if this will be something I bother with all that much, but I could see it being useful for some.</p>
<p>Overall, the Switch 2 versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are nice to have, and will undoubtedly become my preferred way to play the games, but neither felt quite as transformative as I was hoping.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions4.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World</strong></h2>
<p>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition updates one of the most <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criminally-underappreciated games on the Switch</a>, and it actually delivers one of the most notable upgrades of the early bunch of Switch 2 Editions. To my eye, the visuals looked sharper than either Zelda game, perhaps indicating Kirby is closer to a native 4K than they are. While the original Forgotten Land was a mostly-solid 30fps, the 60fps boost is noticeable and welcome.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In another departure from the Zelda updates, Kirby and the Forgotten Land is also getting new content in the form of the Star-Crossed World expansion. This largely seems to be a remix of the original Forgotten World, with blue crystal stars raining down and changing up stages. Rather than Waddle Dees, Kirby is now rescuing strange new creatures called “Starries,” while also grabbing new star-like collectibles. Smashing larger crystals will make new crystalline platforms and structures appear, altering stage layouts and making enemies more challenging. There are also some completely new features, including added Mouthful Mode transformations (I got to try out the bouncy new Spring ability). While Star-Crossed World isn't a completely original creation, it felt just as fun as the original Forgotten Land and it seems like it may be quite a substantial add-on, remixing many, if not all, of the original game's stages.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions6.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV</strong></h2>
<p>The demos for Super Mario Party Jamboree Switch 2 Edition were less about the visual and technical upgrades, and more about gameplay additions that show off the Switch 2’s new control options and accessories. I had the chance to try out a number of new minigames built around mouse controls that had me doing things like guiding toads through an electrified maze and spray painting bob-ombs. Most of these games were pretty fun. The new Jamboree TV expansion mostly focuses on using the new Nintendo Switch 2 Camera to insert yourself into games, which felt more gimmicky and less appealing to me.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFnintendoswitch2editions7.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Current Thoughts on Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Games</strong></h2>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games demoed at the recent hands-on event weren’t just one thing, running the gamut from technically impressive but perhaps not essential (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom) to a quirky controller and accessory showcase (Super Mario Party Jamboree) to what seems to be a fairly significant content expansion (Kirby and the Forgotten Land).</p>
<p>We also have to take into account cost when we talk about these Switch 2 upgrades, which Nintendo is being slightly opaque about. They have revealed the Zelda updates will cost $10 apiece if you own the original Switch games, although you can get both for “free” if you’re a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscriber. If you don’t own the original games, you can buy Switch 2 Editions that will cost as much as the original game plus the upgrade pack (so, $70 for BotW and $80 for TotK). Pricing for the Kirby and Mario Party upgrades that actually add new content hasn’t been revealed, but <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Kirby-and-The-Forgotten-Land-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Star-Crossed-World-U-S-Version/15949615341?classType=REGULAR&amp;nrtv_cid=pvlmg302wxpjg&amp;clickid=32BXElxE9xycUPHyS11FHUJPUksy%3AMzkewu5Vk0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;sourceid=imp_32BXElxE9xycUPHyS11FHUJPUksy%3AMzkewu5Vk0&amp;veh=aff&amp;wmlspartner=imp_376373&amp;affiliates_ad_id=565706&amp;campaign_id=9383&amp;sharedid=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">store listings hint they’ll cost more</a> – up to $20 for the upgrade and $80 if you’re getting the original game + upgrade bundle.</p>
<p>Of course, I need to play more, but these Nintendo Switch 2 Editions seem like a solid deal if you already own the original Switch titles, but may be a bit rich for the blood of folks that also need to buy the base game. All the Switch 2 Edition titles I played seemed worthwhile to some degree, and some, particularly Kirby and the Forgotten Land, were quite intriguing, but you’ll have to pick and choose which ones are worth it for you (or get that NSO+ subscription, assuming all the updates will be available through the service). Your mileage with these makeovers may vary.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 Editions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom launch alongside the system on June 5. Meanwhile, Super Mario Party Jamboree arrives on July 24 and Kirby and the Forgotten Land is coming August 28. Look for more Wccftech coverage of these upgrades closer to launch.</p>

Yes, there are plenty of games that people are excited about their inevitable release, like Grand Theft Auto 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/10/vampire-survivors-announces-crossover-with-square-enixs-saga-series<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After making waves in late 2022, the wildly popular Vampire Survivors has continued adding a ton of new and crossover content to the overall package. Developer Poncle has already added content from the likes of Castlevania, Contra, and Among Us, and now, it has struck a deal with a new publisher to include content from one of its long-running franchises. As a result, starting today, players can brave the undead hordes as characters from Square Enix's SaGa franchise.</p>

<p>Vampire Survivors: Emerald Diorama joins the ever-growing Poncle package today, adding characters from Square Enix's SaGa franchise, in particular, SaGa Emerald Beyond. According to Poncle, the SaGa characters can stand alongside the Vampire Survivors. This free content drop adds more than 40 new attacks, 16 playable characters and skins, and a new stage with seven distinct biomes to explore.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jS_hntZD318" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>While this announcement is squarely focused on SaGa, the newly forged partnership with Square Enix (and the fact that its deal with Konami led to content from multiple franchises) hopefully leads to more collaborations with the iconic publisher, as its other franchises like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Kingdom Hearts would also make great additions to the Vampire Survivors roster. The Emerald Dioarama expansion is available now for free on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC, iOS (excluding the Apple Arcade version), and Android.

<p>While we don't have much in the way of details, during today's Triple-i Initiative stream, developer/publisher 91Act announced that a couch co-op and a free playable character from the Dead Cells universe will be arriving this summer. The Dead Cells character joins the 11 preexisting characters already in playable in the BlazBlue Entropy Effect roster.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/10/my-team-improvements-lead-the-pack<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it was introduced in 2020, the F1 series' My Team offered players a long-form way to manage a team over a career. While it became a popular option for players looking for more than just one-off races, it hasn't received many meaningful updates or upgrades since its introduction. This year brings an extensive redesign to the My Team experience while also expanding on Driver Career.</p>

<p>In what the development team at Codemasters refers to as "My Team 2.0," you control a team owner who manages two drivers simultaneously, opening up different interactions that come with that angle, like recruiting and managing your relationship day-over-day with each driver. Since you now have two drivers to manage, you must manage their perception of your team as you negotiate with them using the in-game contract system.&nbsp;Based on your performance, you earn experience for your owner, allowing you to upgrade your skills to specialize in specific areas of team management.</p>



<p>As you play through various races, you can improve your Fan Rating, the sentiment surrounding the team, based on how you perform in team versus team rivalries. In between races, you spend your time in Team HQ, which has also been upgraded for this entry. The updated facilities structure brings a more granular upgrade system and a workforce size management element where you have to balance the benefits of having a large support staff versus the cost of having so many folks on your team.</p>

<p>The team at Codemasters also split Research &amp; Development into separate systems, making it so your decisions interact with your perks and upgrades from the rest of the My Team HQ, including facility improvements and activities.&nbsp;Additionally, sponsors now operate on a loyalty and relationship-based system. As you build your relationship with a sponsor over time, you unlock benefits and new customization options. Based on your sponsors' core beliefs and backgrounds, you can experience new kinds of events within the mode.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5rWBgBjDsc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Both My Team and Driver Career are receiving increased implementation of the Driver Icons, including AI teams being able to recruit Icons for the first time and the ability to enable or disable the Icons individually. Finally, both modes integrate content from Konnersport, the fictional team from F1 25's Braking Point story mode, and the upcoming&nbsp;<em>F1&nbsp;</em>movie starring Brad Pitt. However, the&nbsp;<em>F1&nbsp;</em>movie content is largely exclusive to the Iconic Edition.</p>

<p>F1 25 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on May 30. Those who pick up the Iconic Edition will receive three days of early access beginning on May 27.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/5-triple-i-announcements-you-need-to-know-about</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-triple-i-announcements-you-need-to-know-about.1161399/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/5-triple-i-announcements-you-need-to-know-about<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While events like Nintendo Directs, PlayStation States of Play, and Xbox Showcases get all the headlines and coverage, often many of the best games are hiding just out of sight as indie games. These are innovative, clever, or otherwise different affairs than what we see from most of the big budget studios, but produce standout hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-prince-review-i-finished-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Blue Prince"><em>Blue Prince</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stardew Valley"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a>. Last year, some studios banded together for the Triple I Initiative, to create their own showcase event, and it was back today.</p>

<p>Fast paced, and without any of the clutter that you see from a lot of showcases (no Day-9 PC Gaming show shenanigans here), the Triple I Initiative shows off some of the most promising indie games coming. While I firmly believe you should watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnNhA7vLgZ0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Triple I Initative 2025 Showcase">the whole showcase</a>, I’ve picked out 5 announcements that I think you need to know about.</p>

<p><br><strong>Honorable Mention</strong>: I’m not a huge fan of it, but I know many people are, so here’s a brief shout out to Poncle’s <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vampire Survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, which had a delightfully weird trailer to announce their new free DLC available today that is a crossover with the <em>SaGa </em>series called Emerald Diorama. There’s also a general update with more goodies, so plenty of new content for Vampire Survivors fans.</p>

<h2>The Alters release date</h2>

<p>11 Bit Studios for the past decade has made their name with thought provoking and intriguing titles that push players to think while including deep game play mechanics in games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/this-war-of-mine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="This War of Mine"><em>This War of Mine </em></a>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/frostpunk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Frostpunk"><em>Frostpunk 1</em></a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/frostpunk-2-review-balance-resources-or-city-will-burn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Frostpunk 2 Review - Balance Resources Or The City Will Burn">and <em>2</em></a>. Their next major title, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/alters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Alters"><em>The Alters</em></a>, is one that I’ve been watching and really want to see as it seems to continue that lineage, with a new approach, as they seem to do each time.</p>


<p>Following a delay earlier this year, we now have a new <em>The Alters </em>release date, as we can expect to all become Jan on June 13th, and explore the differences between nurture and nature, as well as questions of identity.</p>

<h2>Duskfade Announced</h2>

<p>3D Action Adventure Platformers are a genre that came into being in the era of the PlayStation 1 and N64, and only a couple generations later it seemed to fade out for the grittier tones that the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 wanted. While we’ve seen the return of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spyro-reignited-trilogy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Spyro Reignited Trilogy"><em>Spyro</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/crash-bandicoot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Crash Bandicoot"><em>Crash Bandicoot </em></a>in recent years, as well as the emergence of titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hat-in-time-review-change-system" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" A Hat In Time Review - Change The System"><em>A Hat In Time</em></a>, there seems to be plenty of room for developers here in the larger indie space to fill, and that’s right where <em>Duskfade </em>fits in.</p>


<p><br>
A gorgeous looking game being published by Fireshine Games, it is described as an action platformer set in a clockpunk world. Hop on and off walls, go around, and slash things as Zirian in what was, in my opinion, a real coming out party for developer Weird Beluga, and has my eyes peeled to see more in 2026.</p>

<h2>Moonlighter 2 Release Date</h2>

<p>Digital Sun emerged onto the indie scene with the first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/moonlighter-review-buy-it-at-high-price" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Monlighter Review"><em>Moonlighter</em></a>, and only gained more attention with last year’s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cataclismo-sales-120k-two-weeks" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Manor Lords Publisher's Cataclismo Racks Up 120k Sales in Two Weeks"><em>Cataclismo</em></a>. Now, they’ve returned to their roots, with a sequel that promises to once again mix action and shop keeping in <em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em>.</p>


<p>While not quite my favorite of the odd genre of shopkeeping/action RPG (<em>Racettear </em>still holds number 1 in my heart), the first Moonlighter focus on combat led to a smooth, fast playing action roguelite that was a ton of fun, with great visuals in a relatively uncovered area of the gaming space. Now it’s sequel promises to take us to a new town, and be even bigger and better, including new features regarding shopkeeping the first game could have used.</p>

<p><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em> is coming this summer, so strap on your backpacks and get ready to&nbsp; roll, slash, and sell later this year.</p>

<h2>Endless Legend 2 Release Date</h2>

<p>The first game I ever did a game review for was the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/endless-legends-review-never-ends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Endless Legend Review - Neverending"><em>Endless Legend</em></a>, and so I admittedly have a soft spot for it. I also have a soft spot for 4x games in general, and <em>Endless Legend </em>was an innovative title in a genre that had been stagnant in the area for a while, often swallowed by the influence of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/civilization-vii" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Civilization 7"><em>Civilization</em></a>.</p>


<p>Now, more than a decade later, we get <em>Endless Legend 2</em>, in an era when the genre’s title bearer has been taking more challengers to the throne. None of them have managed to really reach it’s heights, so there’s space for the great people at Amplitude to do what everyone else has failed to quite hit, and give us a proper <em>Civilization </em>killer, in their first game after leaving Sega. <em>Engless Legend 2</em> is hitting early access this summer.</p>

<h2>Frostrail Announced</h2>

<p>I don’t know what it is about trains and snow that seems to have gotten to everyone, myself included. For some reason, the idea of a train in a world covered in a winter apocalypse seems to have become an image that we all are interested in exploring, perhaps ever since we first saw <em>Snowpiercer</em>. Whether it’s in the original french graphic novel form, the movie, the tv show, or just in works taking inspiration from it, for over a decade it has been an ongoing thing.</p>


<p>It was perhaps inevitable that it would come to video games as well, though <em>Frostrail </em>isn’t an official <em>Snowpiercer </em>game. Instead, it’s a co-op survival crafting style game from the creators of <em>Barotrauma</em>, and published by Shiro (<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wartales" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Wartales"><em>Wartales</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/evoland-2-review-celebrate-gaming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Evoland 2 Review – Celebrate Gaming"><em>Evoland 2</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/northgard-preview-viking-smoothie" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Northard Preview"><em>Northgard</em></a>, and more). Gather resources, fight off enemies in FPS battles, and try to survive a world that wants to kill you. Well, wants to kill you even more than our current world does.</p>

<p><em>Frostrail </em>looks like a lot of fun, and while I’m not a longterm player of these games, I can see myself plugging in a decent amount of time into this with friends when it releases in early access in 2026.</p>

<hr><p>Overall, the Triple I Initiative had a great event and I strongly encourage you to watch it all if you want to know about games coming out in the next 18 months that aren't from the biggest publishers. In fact, you can watch it right here:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/video-game-age-ratings<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to another instalment of<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> What I Do, a regular Aftermath feature</a> that takes a single person doing a single job in the video game industry and explains just what, <em>exactly</em>, that job involves.</p><p>Today we're speaking with Nic McConnell, whose official job title is "Manager - Game Production" at Riot Games, but whose <em>actual job</em>--working with folks on age ratings across the range of content created by Riot on a regular basis--is a lot more interesting than a one-line term on a business card can contain.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett: Nic, hello, welcome to Aftermath! Can you tell us a bit about yourself?</strong></p><p><strong>Nic McConnell</strong>: I'm someone who sort of backed into video games - I went to school for broadcasting but graduated right when the economy tanked in 2008, dashing those plans. To earn even a little money I wound up getting a job in firmware QA at SIE (SCEA at the time) and sort of floated around the QA space for a while before dipping out and working in market research and then adtech (sorry). The thing is, I <em>love</em> video games and am in awe of the people who make them. I always wanted to get closer to game dev, so I took opportunities when they arose - first at a place called Skillz, then Niantic (both in account and partner management) before finally getting an opportunity to completely shift gears and join Riot as a manager supporting our global age ratings efforts as well as some more general regional sensitivity considerations.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of work, my just-for-fun side thing is a weekly stream where I read video game instruction manuals;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hic5wyueimjeowjtpsxuv752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it's called Instruction Derby</a> and it's More Fun Than You Might Think Given The Concept (should this be my official slogan?).&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond that I'm so lucky to have a cool and supportive wife, amazing kids and a very cuddle-centric dog named Noodles all here with me in the Bay Area. I also have a Neo Geo cabinet, which I try not to make my whole personality but that's hard because have you played <em>Neo Turf Masters</em>? It's so good.</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <strong>I'm more of a </strong><a href="https://aftermath.site/super-baseball-2020-ruled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Super Baseball 2020</em></strong></a><strong> man myself. So in terms of working in video games, what's your actual, exact job title?</strong></p><div><p><strong>NMc</strong>: My actual, exact job title is Manager - Game Production.</p><p><strong>LP: So what does that job actually involve? Like, what's your average day/week/month look like?</strong></p></div><p><strong>NMc</strong>: So, it's fairly varied, but boiled down it's split into two kinds of buckets.</p><p>The first bucket is actually a pipeline - I'm responsible for the overall health and impact of a really cool tool that allows for new and in-development game stuff (art, skins, levels, etc) to be reviewed by our colleagues around the world for both age ratings concerns (e.g., will this skinline risk bumping us from a GRAC 12 to a GRAC 15 in Korea?) and cultural sensitivity (e.g., if a character makes a hand gesture in an emote, is it accidentally a rude gesture in Italy?).&nbsp;</p><p>This side of the job involves a lot of discussion of different art with the amazing Age Ratings team and brainstorming improvements with my amazing team who make the whole thing work. I'm not particularly technical so watching that process play out is so incredibly impressive to me.</p><p><strong>LP: And the second bucket?</strong></p><p><strong>NMc</strong>: The second bucket is focused around understanding how age ratings efforts vary around the world and designing strategies for keeping on top of things as the world changes rapidly all around us. This part of the job is particularly exciting for me because it involves loads of conversations with colleagues around the world, learning about what's happening in their countries and how geopolitical shifts may impact our work.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: Is there anything you'd like to see changed, or improved, about your job? Or its place in the wider industry?</strong></p><p><strong>NMc</strong>: I'm not sure I'd honestly change or improve much - I'm given an incredible opportunity to support people around the world, to learn from them and to build relationships with them, which for me is absolutely awesome. I suppose if I could change one thing about Age Ratings in the industry it would just be that I'd like for more people to have a chance to try it out! It's pretty cool stuff but I think gets a bad rap because so often it's just another task on a release manager's incredibly full plate.</p><p><strong>LP: And finally, what is it about your job that you love the most?</strong></p><p><strong>NMc</strong>: This sounds really corny but - the people. From the Age Ratings team to my friends in Brazil or India and everywhere else we support, it's just an incredibly thoughtful and kind group. Our conversations - by virtue of the topic - are often little mini cultural exchanges and I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to learn from everyone's experience, both in terms professional and lived. I've worked in some great spots, but never before have I come away from nearly every meeting feeling energized.</p><p>And this is gonna sound REALLY corny, but the opportunity to center the experiences and opinions of people outside the US feels particularly valuable right now.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em><a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can read more What I Do features, with everyone from composers to economy designers to lawyers to operations managers, here</a>.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism"><h3>Games Media Can’t Ignore BDS Xbox Boycott</h3></a><p>BDS' call to boycott Microsoft is a call to action for gamers, and an imperative for games media</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tweet-roundup-buzzfeed-kotaku-internet-culture"><h3>It Happened To Me: I Wrote Those Shitty Tweet Roundups</h3></a><p>I wasn’t writing blogs about what “the internet” was reacting to—I was writing to describe what I see as “the internet.”</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-interview-gamechat-discord-price"><h3>With The Switch 2, Even Nintendo Wants To Trap You In An Ecosystem</h3></a><p>Like Sony, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Valve, Epic, and everyone else before it</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Here's a small but notable detail that might have passed you by amid the chaos of information that's spiralled out of last week's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> reveal: the souped-up Switch 2 Edition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> won't include any of its paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
That perhaps isn't a huge surprise given Nintendo has never claimed otherwise, but it seems the company's Switch 2 Edition sales pitch - which has had an air of 'definitive edition' about it - might have led to some confusion. 
</p>
<p>
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is, to recap, one of six special Switch 2 Editions - basically, enhanced versions of existing Switch games - revealed during last week's Direct, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and Pokémon Legends Z-A also getting similar spruce-ups.

</div><figcaption>Eurogamer goes hands-on with Mario Kart World.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU8yIgC206g" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Each Switch 2 Edition includes frame rate and resolutions bumps, alongside a variety of game-specific features, and is available to purchase as a standalone digital or physical release. And that's in addition to the paid upgrade path Nintendo is offering to anyone who already owns the Switch 1 original. It's just convoluted enough to be a little confusing, and the fact Nintendo is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-edition-ports-of-og-switch-games-cost-65-in-uk">selling its Switch 2 Editions at a premium price</a> compared to the originals has muddied the waters further - but the company has now moved to clarify Breath of the Wild's Switch 2 Edition doesn't come with its previously released paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does not include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass DLC," the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc">wrote in a statement to IGN</a>. "That DLC is available as a separate purchase." As such, anyone looking for the full Breath of the Wild experience on Switch 2 will be needing to set aside just shy of £85 based on Nintendo's own pricing.
</p>
<p>
That sounds like a lot for an eight-year-old game and its DLC, but it's far from the only price point that's raised eyebrows following Switch 2's reveal. The cost of the console itself has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">received plenty of pushback from fans</a> - and that was before the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-tariffs-werent-factored-into-switch-2-price-but-its-something-were-going-to-have-to-address">potential impact of US tariffs</a> - and then there's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">£75 price tag for Mario Kart World</a>, or the news Nintendo is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-charging-for-switch-2s-tutorial-game-because-of-the-amount-of-care-and-work-put-into-it">charging $10 USD for Switch 2's Welcome Tour tutorial game</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">console looks promising</a> and its two flagship games have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-keeping-quiet-about-donkey-kong-bananzas-developer-but-it-feels-like-a-souped-up-super-mario-odyssey">received plenty of praise</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">some early hands-on time</a> - but it's clear Nintendo has work to do to shake off the lingering controversy around Switch 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/esports-world-cup-70-million-prize-pool/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Esports World Cup is shaping up to return to Riyadh this summer, and it has just been confirmed that it’ll feature a monumental prize pool worth <strong>$70 million</strong>. This is a new all-time high for the esports industry, topping the record set by the Esports World Cup Foundation with last year’s $60 million prize pool.</p>



<p>It was stated by the CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation, Ralf Reichert, that the team wanted to have ‘room for growth’, and the only way was well and truly <strong>up </strong>this year. This prize pool includes a staggering $7 million prize reserved for <strong>one organisation </strong>that tops the Club Championship.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-in">All In</h2>



<p>The Esports World Cup is, by sheer scope, the biggest competitive gaming event in human history. It features a full line-up of the most popular esports titles in the world, and it takes place over two-months in the heart of Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>It’s lavish, it’s opulent, and it’s designed to be the grandest spectacle the gaming world has ever seen.</p>



<p>Everything from the event’s opening ceremony to how trophies are awarded is bursting with pantomime and innovation. Last year’s event saw losing teams hand over their ‘piece’ of the trophy to the winning team to crush in a hydraulic press. That’s intense.</p>



<p>In a statement, the CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation explained what represents the pinnacle of the event:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you look at the Esports World Cup, the Club Championship is what holds it together.</p>



<p>On the one hand it’s fantastic that we have all of these games and can bring them together at one point in time, which is unique, then the Club Championship is what makes it a story and wraps it together. We don’t consider it as a side element but at the very heart and centre of the Esports World Cup. Naturally, this should have the highest prize money.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full list of games appearing at the Esports World Cup in 2025 is nothing short of incredible. From Tekken 8 to Call of Duty and from Rocket League to League of Legends, there’s a spot and a show for everyone. Even Chess is set to appear, as is Rainbow Six Siege X and Rennsport.</p>



<p>It’s a veritable feast of competitive gaming action, and you can follow it all here at Insider Gaming.</p>

Jumping from genre to genre with each major franchise it creates, the team’s now-iconic paw print logo has become synonymous with huge productions, heart-wrenching storytelling, and characters that transcend the medium.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naughty Dog’s rise from the home of colorful, light-hearted platforming to the go-to studio for gripping, mature storytelling has been lined with nearly two dozen games, ranging from fantasy RPGs to educational math games.

Developed for the Apple II under the studio name JAM, Math Jam was self-published by the duo while they were still in high school.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It taught basic arithmetic and was purely educational. However, both Rubin and Gavin decided their next game was going to move away from teaching and venture fully into the recreational side of video games…</p><h3 data-cy="title3">2. Ski Crazed - 1986</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/01/14/skicrazed-1673721466036.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Rubin and Gavin’s second game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ski-crazed"><u>Ski Crazed</u></a>, launched in 1986 when they were just 16 years old.

Titled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dream-zone"><u>Dream Zone</u></a>, it sees players travel to a satirical fantasy realm based inside the protagonist’s dreams, where they must deal with the land’s range of eccentric imaginary inhabitants en route to escape.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">4. Keef the Thief - 1989</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/01/14/keefthethief-1673722069348.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially donning the Naughty Dog moniker for the first time and partnering with EA, Rubin and Gavin’s fourth project was another comedic point-and-click adventure game, this time titled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/keef-the-thief"><u>Keef the Thief</u></a>. Much as the title suggests, the main premise was to steal items, with Keef exploring a large city and its surrounding wilderness while interacting with NPCs.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">5. Rings of Power - 1991</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/01/14/ringsofpower-1673722363417.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Two years after Keef the Thief, Naughty Dog partnered with EA once again to release <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/rings-of-power"><u>Rings of Power</u></a> on the SEGA Genesis. Putting players in the shoes of a sorcerer called Buc, the game was an isometric RPG set in the fantasy realm of Ushka Bau, where a magical staff shattered into eleven pieces that the player must seek out and collect. Along the way, they meet and recruit a party, leading to a final with a malevolent demon named Void.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">6. Way of the Warrior - 1994</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/01/14/wayofthewarrior-1673722543693.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking a swing at the fighting genre, Naughty Dog’s sixth project was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/way-of-the-warrior"><u>Way of the Warrior</u></a> for the 3DO. The game had players pick a fighter and battle their way through a hellacious tournament, defeating their rivals and spreading their legend throughout the annals of history.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">7. Crash Bandicoot - 1996</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/24/crash-bandicoot-title-screen-1698172018599.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Naughty Dog’s first breakout success,<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crash-bandicoot"> <u>Crash Bandicoot</u></a> was the company’s seventh game and their first on a PlayStation console. It stars the titular Crash Bandicoot, a mutated science experiment that escapes the laboratory of his creator, the villainous Doctor Neo Cortex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A colorful 3D mascot platformer that tasks players with conquering short but challenging stages and defeating Cortex’s band of mutated animal henchmen, the game sees Crash jump, slide, and spin his way through a zany world full of danger. It was a huge success for Naughty Dog and Sony, spawning a major franchise that’s still active to this day.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">8. Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back - 1997</h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2008/01/11/crash-bandicoot-2-cortex-strikes-back-psn-20080110081614741-2248888.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The second game in the Crash Bandicoot franchise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crash-bandicoot-2-cortex-strikes-back"><u>Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back</u></a> picks up a year after its predecessor, with Crash once again having to stop Neo Cortex’s villainous plans. This time around, Crash is searching for a series of magical crystals that Cortex needs to build his new outer-space Cortex Vortex vessel. Cortex Strikes Back is set over 25 stages, with each level featuring fresh mechanics, hazards, enemies, and bosses.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">9. Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped - 1998</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The third and final entry in Naughty Dog’s Crash Bandicoot trilogy, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crash-bandicoot-warped"><u>Crash Bandicoot: Warped</u></a> is set directly after the events of Cortex Strikes Back, with Neo Cortex’s space station crashing into the Earth and giving rise to a malevolent new threat: Aku Aku’s evil brother, Uka Uka. To combat this new foe, Crash and his younger sister, Coco, travel through time, finding crystals to prevent Cortex and Uka Uka from executing their evil plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Cortex Strikes Back, Warped includes 25 new levels as well as a host of additional hazards to overcome, enemies to conquer, and mechanics to learn. It also welcomes a brand new playable protagonist, with players able to step into the shoes of Coco.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">10. Crash Team Racing - 1999</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A spin-off of the mainline Crash Bandicoot series, Crash Team Racing transports the character to the world of arcade racing. You take the wheel as iconic Crash Bandicoot characters – Crash, Cortex, Coco, Doctor N.Gin, and others –<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crash-team-racing"> </a>and race across a selection of hazardous courses in an effort to win races in single- and multiplayer modes.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">11. Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy - 2001</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaving Crash Bandicoot behind, Naughty Dog moved on to a new 3D mascot platformer franchise in 2001 with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/jak-and-daxter-the-precursor-legacy"><u>Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy</u></a>. Following titular best friends Jak and Daxter, the game sees the pair embark on a journey to transform Daxter back into a human after he’s submerged in a mysterious substance known as dark eco and changed into an otter-weasel hybrid. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Along the way, the pair become embroiled in a plot to save the world, with the villainous Gol and Maia hatching a plan to use dark eco to alter the realm. Unlike Crash Bandicoot’s strictly linear levels, Jak and Daxter offers players large worlds to explore, with each map containing a variety of Precursor Orbs they can collect in any order to progress.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">12. Jak 2 - 2003</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Ditching both Daxter’s name from the title and the quirky, upbeat tone, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/jak-ii"><u>Jak 2</u></a> is a much darker reinvention of Jak and Daxter’s world. Taking place after the conclusion of the first game, it sees Jak and Daxter unwillingly flung into the far future, where they arrive in a dystopian metropolis known as Haven City. After their arrival, Jak is arrested and subjected to harrowing experiments for two years, awakening a sinister monster inside of him known as Dark Jak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Daxter eventually rescues Jak, setting the pair off on a new adventure across Haven City, where they join forces with a local rebel militia attempting to overthrow the futuristic metropolis’ corrupt leader, Baron Praxis. Alongside switching the fantasy setting out for a futuristic sci-fi aesthetic, Jak 2 made several gameplay changes, adding guns, flying cars, and the ability to transform into Dark Jak.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">13. Jak 3 - 2004</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Capping off the Jak and Daxter trilogy, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/jak-3"><u>Jak 3</u></a> opens with its lead duo being dumped in The Wasteland beyond the walls of Haven City. Banished from their home and left to die, they take refuge in the city of Spargus hidden deep within the desert. As the pair begin to earn their keep, they learn about sinister plans unfolding in Haven City, beginning an adventure to save their home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jak 3 layers several new features on top of Jak 2’s gameplay, including additional vehicles to traverse the desert, new light eco powers, and a range of fresh weapons.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">14. Jak X: Combat Racing - 2005</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Crash Team Racing, Naughty Dog decided to follow up its work on the Jak and Daxter trilogy by releasing an arcade racer tie-in. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/jak-x-combat-racing"><u>Jak X: Combat Racing</u></a> is exactly what it says on the tin: You play as Jak, or one of his closest allies or enemies, and race across a series of tracks in single- or multiplayer.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">15. Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune - 2007</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Naughty Dog’s first foray onto the PlayStation 3 and one of its most seminal releases, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/uncharted-drakes-fortune"><u>Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune</u></a> was a major shift in tone for the company. Moving away from cartoon mascot platformers, Naughty Dog began to focus on cinematic blockbusters, telling the story of an Indiana Jones-esque treasure hunter named Nathan Drake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hunting for the lost city of El Dorado in the depths of the Amazon rainforest, Drake battles against pirates and other enemies while following in the footsteps of his ancestor, Sir Francis Drake. A third-person, cover-based shooter with platforming elements, Uncharted not only paved the way for one of gaming’s biggest modern franchises but also influenced Naughty Dog’s transformation into a studio synonymous with highly produced video game storytelling.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">16. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves - 2009</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A sequel released two years later, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/uncharted-2-among-thieves"><u>Uncharted 2: Among Thieves</u></a> sees Nathan Drake return to hunt for the lost city of Shambhala in the Hymalian mountains. Betrayed by an old friend during a heist, Drake teams up with Sully and newcomer Chloe to track down the Cintamani Stone, hoping to prevent war criminal Zoran Lazarevic and his private militia from accessing Shambhala.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Along the way, players are met with a healthy dose of third-person cover-based combat and platforming, as well as the kind of bombastic set pieces that make Drake blurt out a litany of expletives in quick succession.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">17. Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception - 2011</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The third entry in the Uncharted series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/uncharted-3-drakes-deception"><u>Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception</u></a> follows Nathan Drake as he attempts to uncover The Atlantis of the Sands in the Rub' al Khali desert. Set two years after the previous game, Drake’s Deception picks up with Drake and Sully battling against the villainous Katherine Marlowe and her private army. Learning she intends to uncover the secrets of the Atlantis of the Sands, Drake begins a race to get there first, launching into an adventure that forces him to confront demons from his past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Drake’s Deception was the last Uncharted game of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-ps3-games-of-all-time">PlayStation 3 era</a>, offering players one more Nathan Drake adventure before Sony moved on to PlayStation 4 two years later.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">18. The Last of Us - 2013</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Arguably one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-100-video-games-of-all-time">most iconic video games of all time</a>, Naughty Dog took a break from Uncharted to bring fans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us"><u>The Last of Us</u></a> in 2013. Set in a harsh post-apocalyptic world where a parasitic fungus is transforming humans into bloodthirsty monsters, The Last of Us follows a hardened smuggler named Joel and an immune teenager named Ellie as they attempt to track down a group of survivors known as The Fireflies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What follows is an emotionally gripping story of grief, survival, and hope, as Ellie and Joel form an unbreakable bond while battling against the monsters that plague their world, both infected and human. A third-person shooter with heavy stealth elements, The Last of Us has gone on to become Naughty Dog’s flagship franchise, even receiving its own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-1-review"><u>HBO adaptation</u></a> in early 2023.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">19. The Last of Us: Left Behind - 2014</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Initially released as DLC before becoming a standalone experience, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-left-behind"><u>The Last of Us: Left Behind</u></a> acts as a prequel to The Last of Us. The story flits between two timelines: the first is set during the events of the main campaign, with Ellie protecting Joel while he recovers from the injuries he sustained in The University chapter. The second takes place three weeks before the events of the game, with Ellie exploring an abandoned mall with her best friend Riley. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the modern timeline features plenty of action sequences, the flashbacks take a decidedly different approach, focusing heavily on exploration and storytelling. The expansion fleshes out Ellie’s backstory, adding additional context to her character and the story she reveals to Joel during the final scene of the main game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">20. Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End - 2016</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The explosive finale to the Uncharted saga, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/uncharted-4"><u>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End</u></a> catches up with Nathan Drake years after the events of Drake’s Deception. Now retired from treasure hunting and living a regular life with his wife Elena, Drake is dragged back into the game after his brother, Sam, arrives on his doorstep with a tantalizing offer: He’s going after Henry Avery’s lost treasure and needs the expertise of Nathan Drake to find it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Thief’s End wraps up Nathan Drake’s story while using the power of the PlayStation 4 to add new strings to Uncharted’s bow, including a grappling hook, non-linear levels, and vastly upgraded visuals.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">21. Uncharted: The Lost Legacy - 2017</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A standalone expansion for Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/uncharted-the-lost-legacy"><u>Uncharted: The Lost Legacy</u></a> passes the reins of the franchise to two new leads: Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross. Following the unlikely partners as they travel to India in search of the Tusk of Ganesh, Lost Legacy expands upon Uncharted 4’s open-ended levels, setting the game within a large map and allowing players to complete main objectives in any order they like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can check out our guide to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-games-in-order">Uncharted games in order</a> for more details about the timeline.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">22 The Last of Us: Part II - 2020</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/06/13/tlou2-screen-ps4pro-e32018-00007-1528815166-1528915758862.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The long-anticipated follow-up to the first Last of Us, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-2"><u>The Last of Us: Part II</u></a> removes Joel from the main protagonist role and hands the reins to Ellie. After settling in the small town of Jackson, Ellie’s life is sent into a downward spiral when a group of mysterious survivors arrive on the settlement’s outskirts during a snowstorm and undertake a mission that changes her life forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Swearing revenge, Ellie pursues the group, tailing them back to Seattle where she begins searching for their leader: a ruthless survivor by the name of Abby. Expanding the stealth mechanics and including smarter enemy AI that can track Ellie’s every move, The Last of Us: Part II upgrades and enhances the series’ gameplay in every conceivable way.
