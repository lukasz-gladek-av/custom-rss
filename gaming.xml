<p>The end result, rather sadly, is that younger Pokémon fans are being denied the chance to grab cards for themselves.</p>
<p>British news outlet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/08/how-pokemon-cards-became-a-stock-market-for-millennials">The Guardian</a> has been speaking to retailers and fans to get their take on the current state of the Pokémon Trading Card Game in the UK, and it's not particularly pleasant reading.</p>
<p>Ben Thyer, the owner of the independent store BathTCG, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My staff have had customers threatening to come back and rip their heads off. It’s become quite unpleasant at times. I’ve heard of other stores where people have been attacked or there have been robberies. We’ve even seen people who buy our products and list them immediately on Facebook, while still in our carrier bags, or sell it right outside the shop. We’re even anxious to put stuff on the shelf for the public because we just don’t want to entice that sort of behaviour. We used to sell whole boxes of booster packs but now we’ve had to stop doing that, and even place limits on the individual packs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Demand has consistently outstripped supply in the world of Pokémon TCG for a few years now, but Thyer thinks a correction is perhaps on the way – although it may not last for very long:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are signs of the market cracking – prices of singles are coming down, sealed products are coming down. People aren’t as ferocious as they once were. There’s also a lot of people now thinking, ‘Christmas is soon and I need some money because I’ve not made what I was hoping for [from reselling cards]’. So we’ll see it dip, but then early 2026 brings Pokémon’s 30th anniversary, so I think we’ll see another crazy period."</p>
</blockquote>

            <guid>1376146</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Hideo Kojima is no stranger to creating unique experiences that challenge established gameplay formulas. With the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-pc-uniting-world/">Death Stranding series</a></strong>, the legendary creator of the Metal Gear Solid series has created open-world experiences that are markedly different from anything else on the market, transforming a desolate post-apocalyptic world into the perfect setting for players to form meaningful bonds through gameplay. With the horror game OD, however, it sounds like the legendary creator will push video game boundaries even further, as he isn't sure the experience will work out in the end.</p>



<p>As translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideo-kojima-says-od-is-something-completely-different-from-a-standard-horror-game-we-still-dont-know-if-it-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Automaton</strong></a>, Kojima-san recently talked about OD and the challenges the game will face in a new interview with <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/74735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>ananweb</strong></a>. <em>"I can’t say exactly what it is yet, nor do I know if it will work out. We’ve created stealth games and delivery games which were unlike anything before, but system-wise, they were similar to other games. This time, we’re trying to change the service model from the ground up, so it should be quite challenging,"</em> Kojima-san said.</p>



<p>While we still don't know exactly how OD will play, according to Hideo Kojima, there's already a way to understand the experience better. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"We’ve packed <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">the trailer</a></strong> full of hints, so if you keep thinking about it, you might figure it out."</em> </p>



<p>I, for one, am not ashamed to admit I haven't any clue about the game as much as anyone else. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/"><strong>OD being so different from anything else</strong></a> is making me quite excited about what it will offer over traditional horror games, which deserve a major shake-up since they haven't really moved past the experience established by the Resident Evil series in any significant way.</p>



<p>As for when we will be able to understand more about OD, no one can say. With Hideo Kojima having released Death Stranding 2: On the Beach this year (and with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pc-version-rated-esrb-published-by-sony/">a PC port</a></strong> likely getting announced during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"><strong>The Game Awards</strong></a>), it may be a while until the studio is ready to unveil a project that sounds more promising by the day.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-dell-laptop-used-to-cost-several-times-more-than-a-macbook-now-its-70-off-and-cheaper-than-one-2000651216</link>
            <guid>1376140</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell makes some of our favorite laptops out there, and if you’re a student or a work professional looking to grab a solid option without shelling out big bucks, Amazon is making that possible today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6277/">The 15-inch Dell Inspiron laptop, which typically sits at a not-so-friendly price of $2,400, is sitting at just $760 at the retailer, after a massive 68% discount – the lowest we have seen it drop to in 30 days.</a> You’re even getting a whole bunch of useful accessories, plus Windows 11 Pro pre-installed with your purchase, for absolutely nothing to sweeten the deal even more. We’re expecting it to be a popular pick this holiday season, so you might want to grab it before the stock starts thinning out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6277/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Memory, Spacious Storage</h2>
<p>For under $800, you’re getting a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS touchscreen that delivers vibrant, immersive, true-to-life visuals consistently, whether you’re catching up on the latest episode of your favorite show or creating a work presentation. The anti-glare panel helps you fight reflections in brighter settings, while the Dell ComfortView software actively reduces harmful blue light to minimize eye strain during those all-nighters. Touch support makes navigation a breeze by letting you use just your fingers to pinch, scroll, swipe, zoom, and more directly on the screen. It comes in handy when you’re working through longer documents and don’t want to rely on the trackpad or the mouse to scroll, or when sharing the laptop with a friend and both of you need to access the screen or work on something together. Note that the screen does not fold all the way back as it does in 2-in-1 laptops, so this doesn’t exactly give you that tablet-like functionality.</p>
<p>The screen is paired with a full-sized keyboard that features a lift hinge design to keep your wrists comfortable while typing. Video calls are made easy with the built-in HD webcam that offers noise reduction for a clearer picture, even in low-light settings.</p>



<p>For power, Dell offers an Intel 13th Gen Core i5-1334U processor with 10 cores, 12 threads, and intelligent boost speeds up to 4.6 GHz. It’s more than capable of handling all your everyday work and play tasks, plus some resource-intensive creative projects with ease. The massive <strong>32GB of DDR4 RAM</strong> keeps the system running fast and smoothly, even when you’re trying to do multiple jobs at the same time. It’s excellent for demanding tasks like 4K video editing, running virtual machines, and even gaming with some apps running in the background.</p>
<p>Creatives and work professionals will also appreciate the<strong> 1 TB PCIe NVMe SSD</strong> that not just offers sufficient space to house all your data, but also ensures better boot times, quick file access, and faster file transfers. Basically, the processor, memory, and SSD come together to ensure a lag-free, smooth experience during both regular and demanding days. Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with the ultra-fast WiFi 6, Bluetooth, plus a wide range of ports like USB-C, USB 3.2, HDMI, and an SD card reader.</p>
<p><strong>The freebies include Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, a mouse, a 7-in-1 cleaning kit, a 128GB UFD, and a docking station</strong>. That’s everything you need to get started with work or play right away. Just note that drops this massive are only around for a short period of time before the stock runs out or the deal expires. If you’ve been after a reliable laptop that doesn’t blow your budget, this is it.</p>

              <p>We knew Paramount Skydance wanted to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. We knew that they company was pretty pissed when Warner CEO <a href="https://kotaku.com/holy-monopoly-batman-warner-bros-reportedly-reject-a-buyout-bid-from-paramount-2000634581">David Zaslav turned down the offer for $20 a share for the entire company</a>. And we knew that this became a fury when <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">Netflix and Warner agreed to a deal at $27.5 per share last week</a>. Now Paramount has reacted, and reacted&nbsp;<em>big</em>. The company has launched a hostile takeover bid, swooping in with a $30 per share offer, which works out to over $108 billion, $25 billion more than Netflix is paying.</p> <p>It was rumored earlier this year, while Zaslav was making it clear how much he wanted to sell Warner Discovery, that he was looking for $30 per share—a <em>massive</em> over-valuation of the company, but one he was looking to justify <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies">by splitting the company</a>, severing off the “Discovery” parts and its loss-making cable networks, and loading that doomed company with all of Warner’s debts. Paramount’s opening bid at $20, however, was for the whole shebang. Netflix, however, outbid everyone by agreeing to $27.5 per share&nbsp;<em>after</em> the split, which is due to happen in the second half of 2026.</p>

 <p>Now, Paramount is going hard in its efforts to prevent this, increasing its previous offer by an enormous 50 percent, and again for the whole company and all its debt. The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj69xzpzrdyo"><em>BBC</em> reports that</a> the company, backed by the billionaire Ellison family, called this bid a “superior alternative,” and clearly one designed to make shareholders revolt if Warner sticks with Netflix’s lower offer.</p>

 <p>This was never likely to go smoothly. If the Netflix deal goes through, it would make the streamer one of the most powerful players in Hollywood, and with the absorption of HBO Max an even more dominant force in streaming. Regulators were absolutely going to be scrutinizing this, and in a time when such bodies are now fully under the control of president Donald Trump’s mercurial (and self-interested) whims, that could go in any direction. Things were looking positive for Netflix in this regard, after its CEO Ted Sarandos had recently been to the Oval Office, likely to play on the president’s infantile habit of agreeing with the last confident voice that spoke to him. However, Sunday night Trump gave hints that he was going to be a wrench in the works, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-netflix-warner-bros-merger-problem-f3e317b61899d34ce507ba38af4a2934">saying the deal “could be a problem.”</a></p>

 <p>It’s also worth noting that the recent Paramount and Skydance merger only took place after the company, er, “settled” a legal dispute with Trump <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/07/trump-paramount-settlement-skydance-1236465383/">by giving him $16 million</a>.</p> <p>Paramount’s offer would work out to $108.4 billion for the whole company, including its cable networks, dwarfing Netflix’s post-debt removal offer of $83 billion. Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t worth close to either figure—optimistically valued at around $10 a share six months ago, and Paramount itself is only worth $11 billion in its own right. Larry Ellison, who backs the company, is said to be worth nearly $270 billion, so could certainly afford it, but it’d still be the most extraordinary outlay were there to be no external investors involved.</p> <p>So, there we are, more excitement in the world of billionaires buying up everything to feed us their homogenized sludge.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Saros rating has appeared in Taiwan for the title’s standard and deluxe editions, suggesting pre-orders are imminent. </p>



<p>Housemarque’s Saros is one of the most anticipated titles of 2026 and also the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-is-the-next-game-from-housemarque/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next PlayStation exclusive</a> from the studio after Returnal. We have already seen some gameplay and have a release date for Saros as well; all players are waiting for now is for pre-orders to open. </p>







<h2 id="h-saros-rating-appears-in-taiwan">Saros Rating Appears in Taiwan</h2>



<p>Spotted by Gematsu on <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1997915897218961521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Saros’s standard and digital deluxe editions have been rated in Taiwan. Both versions have been rated ‘PG-15’ and contain violence and shooting according to the rating. Many players think that with the game’s rating surfacing now, a pre-order announcement could arrive soon; however, there is no official word from the developers. Interestingly, the rating has appeared very close to The Game Awards 2025, so could we expect an announcement there? Also, could Saros be the game behind the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-mystery-statue-new-mexico-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mysterious statue</a>?</p>



<p>For those unaware, Saros is an upcoming sci-fi adventure that has players taking on the role of Arjun Devraj, a Soltari enforcer who will stop at nothing to pursue answers on the shape-shifting world of Carcosa. The title features a constantly evolving world, and you will need to find permanent resources to ensure it yields for you. It also features a high-tech arsenal of weapons, which has players dodging, shielding, and parrying enemy attacks in a “fluid, flow-state-inducing dance.”</p>







<p>In other news, check out Saros’s latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a>, revealed during September’s State of Play event.

<p>Last week, Netflix revealed an $82.7 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery and carve out a monumental corner of the media streaming empire. Now, Paramount has clapped back with a hostile bid, slamming Netflix and claiming that it had offered an ‘inferior proposal’ for WBD.</p>



<p>Paramount’s representatives have promised a tender offer of $30 per share, compared to Netflix’s $27.75 offer. It’s also a bid to avoid splitting up Warner Bros. Discovery, which is what the Netflix acquisition would do. If Paramount is successful, it’ll acquire WBD in its entirety.</p>

<p>In a post from <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-launches-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-1236444601/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, it was confirmed that Paramount had filed a hostile proposal in the wake of Netflix’s revelation in the WBD arena. In a statement, David Ellison, the CEO of Paramount, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company.</p>



<p>Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion. We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process. </p>



<p>We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Hollywood Reporter anticipates a lengthy process to follow, with Paramount and Netflix lobbying and counter-lobbying for the acquisition rights of Warner Bros. Discovery. </p>



<p>In a strange twist, it was later revealed that Paramount published a website dubbed ‘StrongerHollywood’, aimed at rubbing Netflix the wrong way and proving that Paramount’s offer is much more worthwhile for the wider industry.</p>



<p>Whichever media titan is successful, they’ll gain ownership of Warner Bros.’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/">gaming studios</a>, including the likes of Avalanche, NetherRealm, Rocksteady, and TT Games, as well as the WB Games branches.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A fascinating interview with Assassin’s Creed game director Simon Lemay-Comtois has revealed that the team is eager to learn from past mistakes and oversights for future Assassin’s Creed games, such as a lack of parkour focus.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-x-attack-on-titan-crossover-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> was a financial and critical success. It may not go down as peak AC, but it’s a solid return to form. Shadows, in particular, and its post-launch content are looking to bring back a classic gameplay tradition, and have spoken about the use of dual-player mechanics in additional releases down the line.</p>







<h2 id="h-future-assassin-s-creed-games-will-learn-from-mistakes">Future Assassin’s Creed Games Will Learn From Mistakes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not the end of two-player narratives. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>An Insider Gaming exclusive revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-further-details-on-the-assassins-creed-roadmap-and-what-games-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">further details on the Assassin’s Creed Roadmap and what games to expect</a>. There is clearly a long road ahead for the franchise, and Shadows was the latest mainline release.</p>







<p>Shadows game director Simon Lemay-Comtois told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/we-are-hard-to-beat-9-months-since-assassins-creed-shadows-its-associate-director-looks-back-on-what-makes-this-rpg-the-best-in-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that the current release and future AC games should focus on one gameplay mechanic that’s been missing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Pay more attention to parkour in future games as its own pillar. We’re trying to rectify that in post-launch with Shadows and push that narrative internally to say, parkour matters. Let’s really push parkour forward.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Old-school AC fans will remember scaling towns and cities across Italy, whereas recent games have placed less emphasis on verticality in favor of grander open-world design and combat.</p>



<p>There’s still an inherent desire for the basics of Assassin’s Creed roots. Speaking of which, another newer addition (opposing convention) in the last few years has been the incorporation of dual-player stories.</p>



<p>Lemay-Comtois has indicated that the system won’t be going away if it makes sense for the project:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Dual protagonists can be divisive along very strange lines, right? It’s not just a ‘well, I prefer a war, therefore I prefer Yasuke.’ Some people just don’t like one character over the other, and they don’t like to spend time with one. It was true with Evie and Jacob, but with Naoe and Yasuke it’s more divisive. And we knew this. We knew going into it, but I think it can split our fan base a little too.</p>



<p>I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future –&nbsp;<em>if&nbsp;</em>we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We know that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a> won’t be using two-player mechanics, and parkour will be very much part of its DNA. What do you want to see from future Assassin’s Creed games?

                <p>If you saw the Shenmue 4 trailer that went viral recently and were hoping it was leading to an announcement, then you're going to be disappointed. Ys Net, the studio founded by Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki, has issued a statement condemning the trailer as a fake while also hinting that it may take legal action against the trailer's creator.</p><p>In a post on social media, Ys Net said the fake Shenmue 4 trailer "uses our company logo without permission, falsely giving the impression that is an official Shenmue 4 related video produced by us." The statement adds that there have been no official Shenmue 4 materials released, and that the studio is "currently working with relevant parties and preparing appropriate measures, including potential legal action" against the creator of the trailer.</p><p>The original Shenmue was released in 1999 on Sega Dreamcast, and it cast players as a young man, Ryo Hazuki, as he sought to avenge his father's death. The game had innovative takes on open-world gameplay and quicktime events that proved to be very influential in the video game industry. Shenmue 2 followed in 2001, but the franchise went on hiatus due to low sales.</p><p>Following Suzuki's departure from Sega, Shenmue 3 was successfully crowdfunded and released in 2019. Earlier this year, Inin Games and Suzuki announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shenmue-3-enhanced-announced-and-coming-to-xbox-and-nintendo-consoles-for-the-first-time/1100-6534028/" data-ref-id="1100-6534028">Shenmue 3 Enhanced</a> will be coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo consoles. That version of the game will feature numerous visual upgrades including 4K texture uplift for the environments and characters. It will also feature increased density of NPC characters in the streets to make the game world feel more alive.</p><p>Last year, a group of dedicated Shenmue fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-campaign-for-shenmue-4-with-times-square-ad-in-new-york/1100-6523961/" data-ref-id="1100-6523961">launched a campaign for Shenmue 4</a> by purchasing a Times Square ad in New York. It remains to be seen if that campaign will ultimately lead to the franchise getting a new sequel.</p>

<p>"We hoped it would find its audience, the players who would love the freedom and mystery we tried to create," Lyu said. "But [nine] million players in two weeks … that number has honestly blown all our internal expectations out of the water. The mood in the studio is hard to put into words. There's definitely pride and excitement--seeing years of hard work resonate with so many people is a feeling like no other. But what really hits us, more than anything, is the sense of responsibility."</p><p>Lyu continued, saying the nine million players exploring Everstone Studio's fictionalized 10th-century China aren't "just a metric" but "nine million individual journeys." Looking at the player count that way, he told FRVR that it's "incredibly motivating and incredibly humbling" for Where Winds Meet to be this popular.</p><p>"To put it simply, the overwhelming feeling is one of deep gratitude and a focused determination," Lyu said. "This incredible show of trust isn't the end goal; it's the fuel. It's what pushes us to keep improving and expanding this world for everyone. The journey has really just begun, and we're so grateful to have this amazing community with us."</p><p>Lyu also said that although Where Winds Meet's monetization may be somewhat ridiculous, the game will not become pay-to-win, and the team has no plans to pursue any other "aggressive" forms of monetization. The only things you can buy will forever be cosmetics, something Lyu believes gives Everstone Studio an advantage over other free-to-play games on the market.</p><p>“We must protect our greatest commercial advantage--which is offering an experience free from the constraints of pay-to-win mechanics," Lyu said."Therefore, with that as our guiding principle, we see no need to become aggressive or introduce statistical advantages in the future."</p><p>Where Winds Meet is still sitting comfortably on Steam's <a href="https://steamdb.info/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">most-played games list</a> as of this writing, trailing just behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>. With hundreds of thousands of players logging on at any time, Everstone Studio made it clear that if you cheat, you will get suspended; the developer <a href="https://x.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/1997271025432834108" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">already took action against 5,000 accounts </a>for using software such as macros and speed hacking. That said, players are finding ways to circumvent the game's myriad systems, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-winds-meet-players-figure-out-how-to-trick-npcs-into-giving-up-loot/1100-6536571/" data-ref-id="1100-6536571">tricking the plethora of AI chatbot NPCs to cough up loot and quest items</a>.</p><p>Where Winds Meet is available now on PC and PS5. The open-world Wuxia RPG will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-winds-meet-will-officially-launch-on-mobile-this-month/1100-6536627/" data-ref-id="1100-6536627">make its global Android and iOS debut on December 12</a>, with Everstone Studio <a href="https://x.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/1997337719257895205" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posting on X</a> that some five million people have already pre-registered their devices for its imminent release.</p>

            <p>Hollywood studio Paramount isn't going to let <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-warner-bros-in-827bn-deal-including-studios-behind-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy">Netflix's Warner Bros. acquisition</a> go ahead without a bidding war. The historic filmmaking company announced an offer of its own for Warner Bros. today, which is even bigger than Netflix's "inferior" proposal.</p>
<p>Paramount is offering $18bn more in cash than Netflix, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-launches-all-cash-tender-offer-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-for-30-per-share-302635412.html#:~:text=Paramount's%20strategically%20and%20financially%20compelling,process%20with%20an%20uncertain%20outcome">according to a press release</a>, and $30 a share rather than Netflix's $27.5, and it's bidding for the entire Warner Bros. company, including the Global Networks segment, which includes sports and news TV brands like CNN and TNT Sports. Netflix only wants the Streaming &amp; Studios part, which includes Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, and HBO, among others.</p>
<p>Paramount chairman and CEO David Ellison commented: "[Warner Bros.] shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company. Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion."</p>
<p>The press release revealed that Paramount had submitted six buyout proposals to Warner Bros. over the course of 12 weeks, but apparently Warner Bros. "never engaged meaningfully with these proposals". So Paramount has now taken its offer directly to shareholders and the board of directors "to pursue this clearly superior alternative".</p><p>Paramount said it was "highly confident" in achieving regulatory clearance for its offer, too, which it described as "pro-consumer".  Paramount believes Netflix's offer might stumble because of perceived video streaming monopoly. "The Netflix transaction creates a clear risk of higher prices for consumers, lower pay for content creators and talent and the destruction of American and international theatrical exhibitors," Paramount said.</p>
<p>"We believe our offer will create a stronger Hollywood," Paramount's Ellison concluded. "It is in the best interests of the creative community, consumers and the movie theatre industry. We believe they will benefit from the enhanced competition, higher content spend and theatrical release output, and a greater number of movies in theaters as a result of our proposed transaction. We look forward to working to expeditiously deliver this opportunity so that all stakeholders can begin to capitalise on the benefits of the combined company."</p>
<p>Netflix announced an $87.2bn deal to acquire Warner Bros. on Friday, which would see it also take charge of games studios such as Rocksteady, famed for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Batman Arkham series</a>; NetherRealm, which makes Mortal Kombat; and Avalanche, which most recently made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. Will the price tag now rise?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tp-link-deco-wifi-7-mesh-system-3-pack-falls-to-an-all-time-low-cheaper-than-budget-wifi-6-routers-2000651219</link>
            <guid>1376095</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re paying for high-speed internet but dealing with dead zones and slow performance in certain areas of your house, your router could be the culprit. An easy solution to actually enjoy the performance promised by your ISP is by investing in a solid mesh system. It works by using the interconnected devices to create a strong network that delivers consistent signals across your entire place.</p>
<p>Now is a great time to pick one up, as<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6276/"> Amazon is currently offering a sweet 29% discount on the TP-Link Deco BE23 dual-band WiFi 7 mesh system (3-pack), which brings its price down to $178.</a> You can also enjoy free shipping on your purchase if you grab it quick, but the deal is selling out fast. That means you don’t have a lot of time left to bag these savings. It’s better to act sooner rather than later if you want to score the discount before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6276/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better Coverage Throughout the House</h2>
<p>Deco BE23 uses Wi-Fi 7 technology, paired with Multi-Link Operation (MLO), Multi-RUs, and 4K-QAM to deliver full speeds of up to 2882 Mbps on the 5GHz band and 688 Mbps on the 2.4GHz band with 4 streams. The 3-pack bundle blankets up to 6,500 sq. ft, while the 4x high-gain antennas per node and 4x high-power FEMs push more reliable signals across your home. You can connect up to 150 devices at the same time without compromising on the speeds. Translation? The mesh system is more than capable of delivering the signals you’re paying for in every room and corner around the house – think under the stairs, in the closet, near the balcony, etc. Everyone in the house can connect all their devices, from laptops to smartphones, PC, consoles, tablets, TVs, and more, which is especially great for remote workers and creatives who rely on a bunch of different devices to get through their days. You also won’t have to sit right next to the router to catch signals; the mesh system offers the same performance all around.</p>



<p>Those who need even better performance when working on an important task or gaming with friends can make use of the two 2.5 Gbps WAN/LAN ports that come built right into each Deco unit. This lets you create a multi-gig pipeline from the internet to your devices. Best of all, the system uses AI-Roaming technology to deliver optimal speeds. It continuously adapts through advanced algorithms and learns your patterns over time as you move around. The system also plays nicely with a range of providers, but you might need to purchase a modem to get started. It’s backward compatible with all WiFi generations, so can fit into any existing system nicely.</p>
<p>TP-Link takes security seriously, as the Decos are designed, built, and maintained with advanced security as a core requirement. TP-Link HomeShield offers home network protection, plus access to handy parental controls for a safer internet experience. VPN clients and servers are supported, making it easy to access remote VPN servers without installing VPN software on each device. Setting everything up is quite straightforward, even if it’s your first time putting a mesh system up. It should be up and running in no time.</p>
<p>In short, if you’re done dealing with painfully slow speeds and terrible coverage of your router, now is a great time to upgrade the internet situation in your home. This deal lets you do it without shelling out big bucks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima recently spoke about his upcoming title, OD, stating that even he can’t say exactly what it is or whether it will work out. </p>



<p>The next Xbox Game Studios title by Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions, OD, is already in the works, and we received a glimpse of the title earlier this year through its ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/od-gameplay-reveal-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knock</a>‘ trailer. We have also heard Kojima say that he wants to scan ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wishes-to-scan-real-ghosts-for-od/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real ghosts</a>‘ for his upcoming title. Now, he has revealed more details on the challenges he is facing with OD. </p>







<h2 id="h-hideo-kojima-can-t-say-what-od-exactly-is-but-there-are-hints-in-the-trailer">Hideo Kojima Can’t Say What OD Exactly Is, But There Are Hints in the Trailer</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/74735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ananweb</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideo-kojima-says-od-is-something-completely-different-from-a-standard-horror-game-we-still-dont-know-if-it-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Hideo Kojima spoke about the challenges he is facing while developing OD. He stated, “I can’t say exactly what it is yet, nor do I know if it will&nbsp;work out.” Kojima added that they have created stealth and delivery games “which were unlike anything before”. However, even those games had systems similar to other titles, which made the process a bit easier. </p>



<p>In the case of OD, Kojima and team are “trying to change the service model from the ground up,” which has proven to be “quite challenging.” At the same time, the recently released trailer is “full of hints,” so the highly passionate players might be able to figure it out if they spend enough time on it. </p>







<p>In other news, Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-move-to-japan-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive report</a> reveals that Eidos Montreal’s employees were working on OD before being asked to move to Japan. Additionally, the popular game director <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-zootopia-2-cameo-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined Zootopia 2’s cast</a> just days before release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Longtime Tekken director and series producer Katsuhiro Harada has revealed he will leave Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Harada, whose credits include not only Tekken but the SoulCalibur series, Pokkén Tournament, and more, said he wanted to reach the Tekken series' 30th Anniversary, which happened last December, as a major career milestone and is ready to move on.&nbsp;</p><p>He says he will leave Bandai Namco at the end of the year, but has been asked by the publisher to appear at the Tekken World Tour Finals at the end of January, and he will be attending as a guest. Alongside this news, Harada has released <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix?si=a5c6ead3a5f64c4c9ac47330a8e3f4ed&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">"TEKKEN: A 30-Year Journey – Harada's Final Mix" on SoundCloud,</a> as he has always wanted to perform as a DJ at a tournament but never had the chance.&nbsp;</p><p>"So instead, I will be releasing – for the first and last time – a 60-minute Tekken DJ-style nonstop mix (DJ mix), personally edited by myself, together with this announcement," Harada writes in his announcement <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747?s=20">post</a> on X. "Listening to it brings back many memories. Thank you again, sincerely, for all these years."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-z3ClbC1zKo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-z3ClbC1zKo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In Harada's announcement post, he talks about his love of arcade fighting games, his journey with Tekken and game development, and how he sought the advice of longtime mentor Ken Kutaragi, former CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, commonly referred to as "The Father of PlayStation," and "received invaluable encouragement and guidance," noting that "his words quietely supported me in making this decision."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Alongside news of Harada's departure, the Tekken X account released a </strong><a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1997954347347620178?s=20"><strong>statement</strong></a><strong> that says the following regarding Harada's upcoming leave:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>"Katsuhiro Harada, who has long led numerous projects including the Tekken series, will be leaving Bandai Namco. This comes as the Tekken series finishes celebrating its 30th anniversary, a milestone he deeply contributed to as executive director and executive producer on the franchise. Harada-san is making an appearance and meeting with the Tekken community at the 'Tekken World Tour 2025 Global Finals' Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ) and Top 20 finals, held in Malmo, Sweden, on January 31 and February 1, 2026."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The statement also includes words regarding the future of the Tekken series, and they read as follows:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>"To our fans, rest assured that we are fully committed to future development and content plans for Tekken 8. We will continue to take community feedback on the game and its content to heart to ensure that we uphold the vision and spirit built by Harada-san, dedicating our utmost efforts to ensure the legacy of the Tekken series continues as a fighting game franchise beloved worldwide. We express our deepest gratitude for Harada-san for providing us with vision and continued success over the years."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0iCQ-vCJww"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0iCQ-vCJww" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>On that note, Harada mentions in his announcement that, "Over the past four to five years, I've gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day," so it sounds like the Tekken series is in good hands.&nbsp;</p><p>Harada's Tekken journey goes all the way back to the beginning, where he was a voice actor for Marshall Law, Yoshimitsu, and Kunimitsu in the first Tekken. In Tekken 2, he voiced Marshall Law and Yoshimitsu once more. With Tekken 3 in 1997, not only did Harada voice Yoshimitsu and newcomer Forest Law, but he also directed the game. Since then, he's been a creative lead on the series through 2024's Tekken 8.</p><p>You can <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/tekken-8/aggressively-absurd">read <em>Game Informer's </em>Tekken 8 review here</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Do you have any favorite Harada memories?

<header><section>
<p>But it's not who you think it is</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="1e3b54a528e26"><a title="Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e3b54a528e26/requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Although Capcom has remained tightlipped on the prospect of Leon Kennedy cropping up in the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, a good number of fans are adamant that the veteran character will indeed appear.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=I23MxTm2ku4&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpc-gaming%2Fpc-games%2Fproducts%2Fresident-evil-requiem-deluxe---pc%2F20023062-2a094304.html" rel="sponsored noopener">a new listing</a> over on GameStop drops some new information regarding the Deluxe Edition of the game which, if accurate, seems to hint at a completely different playable character: Rosemary Winters (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-gamestop-listing-leaves-fans-bewildered-by-mentioning-a-shock-second-character-and-its-not-leon">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Rose Winters is, if you remember, the protagonist in the <strong>Shadows of Rose</strong> DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a>, having previously appeared in the main game as, uh... a bunch of dismembered limbs. Look, it's a pretty wild story.</p>
<p>The listing from GameStop specifically mentioned some cosmetic items for Rose, including the 'Morphic Visor' and 'Shadow Walker' costume pack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Deluxe Edition includes the PC Steam Digital Code, a SteelBook Case, and the following digital content:</p>
<p><strong>"The Sanctuary" Expansion Pass:</strong> Includes 2 new story scenarios and a major Mercenaries mode update.<br>
<strong>"Morphic Visor" Cosmetic Filter:</strong> A unique cosmetic look for Rose's visor.<br>
<strong>"Shadow Walker" Costume Pack:</strong> 3 exclusive outfits for Rosemary Winters.<br>
<strong>Digital Artbook &amp; Official Soundtrack</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all very bizarre indeed, not least because of how old Rose would be in Requiem's story. The new game is said to take place in 2028, which would essentially make her seven or eight years old. The Shadows of Rose DLC shot the story forward to the year 2037 in which she was portrayed as a teenager.</p>
<p>So if Rose does indeed appear as a child, would she really wear a visor of some sort? Would she wear a 'Shadow Walker' costume set? We're not so sure. Either way, the listing from GameStop is still up at the time of writing, so there seems to be at least some modicum of accuracy to it.</p>
<p>The listing also seems to imply that the popular Mercenaries Mode will also make a return in Requiem, while two new story scenarios are also being planned for the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Lunar Software's long-awaited horror game ROUTINE is finally out and on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One devices, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/routine-comes-back-from-a-ten-year-slumber-with-a-new-trailer/">even for a game that was announced more than a decade ago</a>, it has the sensibilities of a game older than that. Needless to say, there are a few things you'll want to know when jumping into it yourself.</p>



<p>This guide will take you through a few essential tips and tricks to ensure you can see everything ROUTINE has to offer, without getting terribly lost.</p>



<h2 id="h-routine-tips-and-tricks-guide">ROUTINE Tips and Tricks Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-have-a-notebook-ready">Have a notebook ready</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wingdk-Screenshot-2025.11.27-23.07.22.86.png"></a><figcaption><em>Just like any good astronaut, you'll want to keep a record of what happens on the moon in ROUTINE.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>ROUTINE doesn't give you waypoints, map markers, or a compass to tell you which direction you're going in. It doesn't even give you a map to look at. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/">Hell is Us</a>, it's the second game in 2025 to make getting around its environment and figuring out where to go next is a constant puzzle, which is part of the game's draw, as you're constantly building a mental map of each area.</p>



<p>You can do that, or you can draw a map of the space in a notebook to help you get around. That could be reason enough to have a notebook ready, but the better reason to have a notebook and pen beside you - or something to take notes with at least - is all the code puzzles you'll need to solve.</p>



<p>Having a notebook to write down every code you uncover is probably the best thing you can do to make sure you have a smooth time with ROUTINE. Instead of risking a moment where you've successfully made it to where you need to enter the code you just solved, and you have to backtrack to where you solved it because you can't remember the code.</p>



<h3 id="h-your-c-a-t-is-everything-but-it-s-got-nothing-on-plain-old-hiding">Your C.A.T. is everything, but it's got nothing on plain-old hiding</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_005_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>Your C.A.T. is useful, but it can't do everything.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Your only tool and the one thing that lets you communicate with the abandoned lunar base, your C.A.T. (Cosmonaut Assistance Tool), is pretty much your everything in ROUTINE. It's how you save when you find a save point; it's how you scan your environment for otherwise invisible writings that reveal secrets and help you solve puzzles, and it's how you fight back against the robots trying to kill you.</p>



<p>But fighting back will only get you so far. Whoever made these robots made them to last, and while two electric shots from your C.A.T. directly into a robot's chest in short succession can stun them, no amount of shots will actually take them down. Stunning them can give you a window to run and hide, but running and hiding is always going to be what actually gets them off your back, and the chance to progress further in the story.</p>



<h3 id="h-not-every-robot-is-trying-to-kill-you-at-the-same-time">Not every robot is trying to kill you - at the same time</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_SS_004_August.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the many things not directly explained to you in ROUTINE is that while you'll see plenty of killer robots on the base, they aren't all trying to kill you - at the same time. No more than one robot is activated at any time, so as you start learning where the robots are in the rooms you're exploring, if you know which one is active, you can walk right by another with no fear.</p>



<p>Unless, of course, it activates right in front of you. In that case, you might be screwed if you can't run away in time.</p>



<h3 id="h-there-are-safe-rooms-but-no-safe-pausing">There are safe rooms, but no safe pausing</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wingdk-Screenshot-2025.12.02-02.47.05.85.png"></a><figcaption><em>Sometimes, these access points that allow you to save are in 'safe rooms,' but not all the time.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-finally-gets-first-combat-footage-but-leon-is-nowhere-to-be-seen/">Capcom's Resident Evil series</a> is known for its safe rooms, the areas you reach where any of the horrors you're shooting at can't get to you. They're accompanied by their own music and a few repeating hallmarks so that when you find one, you know you can breathe a sigh of relief.</p>



<p>ROUTINE doesn't have safe rooms in the same way Resident Evil has safe rooms, but they are there. You just have to look closely. What you can't do is pause the game and think you're safe.</p>



<p>All pressing the pause button does is bring up the game's menu; you can still die if you pause and leave yourself directly in the patrol path of a robot. So if you do need to adjust something in the menu, or step away for a moment, make sure you're actually safe before doing so.</p>



<h3 id="h-really-look-around-and-then-look-again">Really look around, and then look again</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Wingdk-Screenshot-2025.12.01-02.16.42.25.png"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE forces you to slow down and pay attention to your environment, so don't start to panic if you're having trouble finding your way.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As stated earlier, ROUTINE doesn't include any of the modern gaming comforts, like an in-game map. Figuring out where to go means you have to look around you and see what the environment is telling you.</p>



<p>That setup can, and probably will, make it easy for you to feel like you're lost. But Lunar Software's limitations on what kind of assistance you get means that you only have to look in a few places to figure out where to go next.</p>



<p>While some chapters include bouncing between different areas on different floors, most of ROUTINE will involve you navigating a large section of the base connected with hallways and, in some cases, through vents and backdoor entrances. If you really feel lost, keep looking around and zoom in on everything you see. Taking your time to do this will likely result in you figuring out where to go faster than if you tried to speed to the answer.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bose Extends Its Clearance Push From Headphones to Home Speakers, Leaving Zero Margin Behind]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-extends-its-clearance-push-from-headphones-to-home-speakers-leaving-zero-margin-behind-2000651213</link>
            <guid>1376065</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re planning to bring family and friends together this holiday season for hearty meals and some much-needed bonding, good music can lift the mood and make your gathering even more enjoyable. Imagine having soft tunes playing in the background as you catch up with your loved ones on Christmas Eve; wholesome.</p>
<p>You just need a good speaker to make this happen, and Amazon is making it easier than ever to pick one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6275/">The retailer just slashed the Bose SoundLink home speaker by 18%, dropping the price down to $179</a>. The deal applies to both silver and grey color options, so you can pick whichever would fit within the aesthetics of your place the best.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6275/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bold Sound In a Minimal Design</h2>
<p>Bose has paid attention to the looks with this one. The anodized aluminum paired with a high-quality fabric grille gives off a premium look, while the overall minimal design makes it easy for the speaker to blend into any setup without drawing too much attention to itself. You’ll find all the controls right at the top; no need to go on a scavenger hunt for your phone every time you need to tweak the volume.</p>
<p>The speaker punches well above its weight by delivering crisp, clear sound for all your tracks. It captures all the highs and lows within tunes, and pushes deep bass that can fill any room with good vibes. This makes it not just great for music, but also for your streaming sessions where you don’t want to rely on your laptop or TV’s audio. Dialogues sound clearer than ever, and your favorite songs can be enjoyed to their fullest. Catch up on your favorite podcast in the morning, play the latest Maroon 5 album in the evening, and end the night with an episode of Stranger Things; it takes care of all your audio needs like a pro.</p>



<p>Advanced Bluetooth 5.3 offers solid connection stability and reduced latency. For instance, when the speaker is paired with your phone, you’ll be able to roam around the house comfortably without worrying about audio dropouts, even when things get crowded. Reliability comes from its 9 hours of battery life, which keeps the good vibes going all night long. Best of all, it supports wired connection, too, so you can plug your device in using a USB-C cord when it’s running low; no need to pause the music. There’s also a microphone built right in, which makes it easy to take quick calls right from the speaker or access voice assistants like Alexa.</p>
<p>The sound this speaker delivers is solid on its own, but you can also pair two of these together for a bigger setup, which can be great for entertaining a larger crowd. Linking them together hardly takes a few seconds, and you don’t even need an app to do it.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this minimal, no-fuss, but efficient speaker. It’s now down to $179, which is still a bit of an investment, but definitely one that’s going to be worth it. To recap, this speaker offers clear sound, deep bass (even at higher volumes), an exceptional battery life, as well as plug-and-play functionality when needed. Place it anywhere you like, and get the part started. We highly recommend grabbing it quick, before the price goes back up to $219.</p>

<p>Of course, our very own Ollie Reynolds has already delivered his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">9/10 verdict in his Switch 2 review</a> saying that Beyond "manages to replicate that magical sense of discovery from the GameCube original while pushing the series in some incredible new directions".</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cejoqmku&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>The lovely Alex Olney served up a similarly positive summary of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Switch 1 version</a>, which manages to hold up well beyond (pun intended, of course) some loading time extensions and graphical downgrades, scoring it an 8/10. As Alex puts it: "if you’re not looking to upgrade anytime soon and you’re keen to jump into Samus’ latest adventure, it's well worth picking up, as there's a fantastic game to be had."</p>

<p>So, now that you know where we stand on both Switch console versions of this one, it's time to find out how you've been getting on with it all via the following poll. Have you been loving this graphically resplendent return to all things Metroid, or are you finding the new gameplay elements take the shine off?</p>
<p>Maybe you've already beaten the game, or maybe you're soaking <em>everything</em> in in this stunner; wherever you are, you can give us your score in the polls (for either version) below now, and if you change your mind later or when you beat the game, you can come back and amend it! That's pretty nice of us.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tekken-director-bandai-namco-katsuhiro-harada-leaves-2000651368</link>
            <guid>1376035</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Katushiro Harada, veteran poster and the director of the </span><i><span>Tekken</span></i><span> series, has announced he is leaving Bandai Namco after 31 years.</span></p> <p><span>In a lengthy post on his </span><a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747"><span>X account</span></a><span>, Harada said that the end of 2025 will see him leave the company, and that with </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>reaching its 30th anniversary last year, right now felt like the “most fitting moment” to bring this chapter of his life to a close. Harada reflected on his “roots,” which involved promoting </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>to players in Japanese arcades; he says that those days immersed in local fighting scenes both in Japan and in community centers overseas “became the core of who [he was] as a developer and game creator.” While reflecting on the past, Harada also said that recent </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tomonobu-itagaki-death-dead-or-alive-team-ninja-gaiden-2000636025"><span>personal tragedies</span></a><span> and professional movement helped him come to this decision.</span></p> <p><span>“In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life, I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect,” Harada wrote. “Those accumulated events made me reflect on the ‘time I have left as a creator.’ During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi—whom I respect as though he were another father—and received invaluable encouragement and guidance.</span></p>

 <p><span>His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</span></p> <p><span>Over the past four to five years, I’ve gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Harada signs off by saying he will still be attending the Tekken World Tour finals in January as a guest, and by dropping an hour-long </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>mix called “Tekken: A 30-Year Journey – Harada’s Final Mix” on </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix?si=a5c6ead3a5f64c4c9ac47330a8e3f4ed&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing"><span>Soundcloud</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Harada served as a voice actor in the first two </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>games before stepping up to the director role with </span><i><span>Tekken 3 </span></i><span>in 1997. He’s also worked on other fighting game series, such as </span><i><span>Soulcalibur</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pokken Tournament</span></i><span>, and contributed to various other Bandai Namco games as a producer and supervisor. In 2019, Harada became the lead of the company’s overall fighting game esports division, and was promoted to a general manager. </span><i><span>Tekken 8</span></i><span> launched last year </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-review-roundup-1851189539"><span>to high praise</span></a><span> and will be Harada’s final work on the series and at Bandai Namco. Though he doesn’t say what’s next for him, Harada will be remembered both in and out of the </span><i><span>Tekken </span></i><span>community for his candid posting on social media, both </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-waffle-house-stage-1851378866"><span>in joking with players</span></a><span> and in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-katsuhiro-harada-twitter-anna-new-characters-1851575150"><span>responding to criticism</span></a><span>. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-pushes-star-wars-millennium-falcon-to-a-record-low-to-offload-the-last-remaining-stock-before-christmas-2000651151</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kids will be cleaning up on LEGO sets for the holidays, as they have for decades. But how about LEGO’s adult fans who are just kids at heart, especially the ones who’ve been devout LEGO Star Wars fans for most or all of the years those sets have been sold? Yes, there are deals for them too, perhaps none better than <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">this Amazon sale on the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectible Model, which is 20% off right now.</a></p>
<p>This intricately detailed, displayable 921-piece commemorative model of the iconic Millennium Falcon is a $68 steal for LEGO Star Wars fans 18 and up. Years after the fun of building the LEGO Falcon, it will likely still be proudly displayed in your home, with its special LEGO Star Wars 25th Anniversary brick identifying it as a collector’s item.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All the Details</h2>
<p>The design of the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon includes all of the intricate little details that Star Wars obsessives would insist on, including the ship’s cockpit, satellite dish, and cannons. With 921 pieces creating a model that, when fully assembled, measures 5 by 9.5 by 7.5 inches, there’s a lot of material packed into a relatively small space for all those details.</p>
<p>The LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon comes with a display stand that lets you position the ship at dynamic angles for a more attractive look. It’s not a playable model, so keep it out of the hands of the littles, but when it’s standing on its base and angled to look like it’s zooming through space, it’s a true eye-catcher.</p>



<h2>Relaxing and Rewarding</h2>
<p>As much as you will enjoy seeing the Falcon displayed in your home for years to come and having it become a conversation piece with guests, the real enjoyment is, of course, the actual building. Assembling he LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon is finely detailed work, allowing you to immerse yourself in the process. Think of the old ship in a bottle models, or the very intricate models requiring glue and paint. The LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon requires the same focus, but provides a relaxing experience while being far, far more forgiving of error than those old-school hobbies. And if you really enjoy the building process, they’re LEGOs — you can always take it apart and build it all over again, as many times as you like.</p>
<p>The 25th anniversary of the LEGO Star Wars franchise has birthed a large collectible series of mid-scale buildable models from the Star Wars canon, but perhaps none quite so familiar and iconic to both hardcore fans and casual ones alike as the Millennium Falcon. This kit for builders 18 and up is an amazing present for the Star Wars enthusiast in your life, or for yourself. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">Jump on it now at Amazon while it’s still on sale for $68.</a></p>

GameStop said in a news release that it took in more than 80,000 trades across the US on December 6 alone, and people brought in lots of unexpected and usual items, including a taxidermied bobcat and goose, a speed limit sign, a Wii Netflix disc, a bowling ball, a tiny Jesus, and "a literal can of whoop-ass."</p><p>This was all done as a marketing campaign to raise awareness for GameStop's trade-in program. The retailer also noted that people brought in "a significant number" of canned food goods to support food banks and pet shelters.</p><p>One person attempted to trade in their dog (presumably as a joke, we hope!) but was <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997412308713402623" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rejected.</a> Another person <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997478744215466157" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tried to trade in their Social Security card but GameStop said no.</a> Someone else brought in a copy of the Declaration of Independence, and GameStop seemingly accepted it.</p><p>The fine print of the Trade Anything promotion mentioned that people would be limited to one trade and a value of $5. It's not immediately clear what GameStop is doing with all the items people brought.</p><p>The Deptford, New Jersey GameStop location took in the most trades, at more than 250.</p><p>Here are some of the notable traded items, as shared by GameStop.</p><ul><li>A bobcat</li><li>A goose</li><li>A tiny Jesus</li><li>A full creepy doll collection</li><li>Air Jordans</li><li>A speed limit sign</li><li>Complete Friends season VHS tapes</li><li>Bowling ball</li><li>A “happy heater”</li><li>A framed dog portrait</li><li>A literal can of whoop-ass</li><li>A Wii Netflix disc</li><li>Non-alcoholic cider donated to store employees</li></ul><p>In other news, GameStop is among the numerous retailers that are not raising Xbox Game Pass prices, so you can still buy one month of Game Pass Ultimate for $20 there.

              <p>Good music can make even the most boring tasks somewhat bearable. Listening to some Bruno Mars or Taylor Swift during long commutes or while doing the dishes is a good way to push through them with ease. The market is filled with headphones, and picking the right one can be overwhelming. If you’re after a pair that’s comfortable to wear for long hours, offers multiple listening modes, and doesn’t blow your budget, we have good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6274/">The highly rated Bose QuietComfort wireless headphones are going for just $179 at Amazon, after the retailer slashed a whopping 49% off their retail price.</a> You’re saving a massive $170 on a premium pair, and this deal applies to the stunning Standstone color option. Not your vibe? Several other options are discounted, too, including black, gray, lilac, and pink. Those who prefer their audio gear to be on the minimal side should grab the black version. If a pop of color is what you like, consider going for the blue pair. Both of these are sitting at $199, after dropping from $349. The discount is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, and there are no delivery charges to worry about. You also don’t need to add any long coupon codes or follow complicated processes to score the drop. Just click Add to cart, and proceed with checkout at the discounted rate.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6274/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Superior Sound</h2>
<p>These are made for extended use. That’s thanks to a comfortable padded band paired with plush over-ear cushions that hug your ears softly for a secure, snuggly fit. The band keeps them in place, even when you’re taking a walk, jogging around, or trying to get a workout in with some energetic music to keep you going.</p>
<p>There are two listening modes to choose from; Quiet and Aware. The quiet mode blocks all the external noise, offering an immersive listening experience with no distractions. It’s great for when you want to focus on a task and don’t want background chatter and noise impacting your flow (or chain of thoughts) negatively. Aware mode, on the other hand, keeps you..well, aware of your surroundings. It lets some sounds in, making it easy to stay in the loop on what’s happening around you. You’ll be able to have conversations with this on, hear when the barista calls your name, etc. This mode is great for when you’re in a public area and can’t afford zoning out completely. Adjustable EQ makes it easy to tweak audio settings based on what you like, so you’ll always enjoy a custom listening experience.</p>



<p>The headphones offer up to 24 hours of battery on a single charge, which is more than enough to go at least a couple of days without worrying about plugging them in. Plus, when running low, a quick 15-minute charge via USB-C gives you an additional 2.5 hours of jamming; perfect for when you’re on the go and don’t have the time to power them up completely. Even better, these support wired connectivity just as well, so you also have the option to use them with the included audio cable, too, which works even when you’re out of battery. It’s best to use the pair with the dedicated Bose app to enjoy the latest features and adjust settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6274/">Amazon is letting you grab these for just $179 now, making the upgrade quite affordable.</a> You’re saving 49% on a top-rated option, plus there are several color options to choose from, which makes it easy to choose the one that fits your aesthetics the best. But again, grab it quickly, as once the deal is gone, it likely won’t come back anytime soon.</p>

<p>It’s time to admit, before God and the good readers of Ars Technica, that I have a problem. I love roguelikes. Reader, I can’t get enough of them. If there’s even a whisper of a hot new roguelike on Steam, I’m <em>there</em>. You may call them arcane, repetitive, or maddeningly difficult; I call them heaven.</p>
<p>The second best part of video games is taking a puny little character and, over 100 hours, transforming that adventurer into a god of destruction. The best thing about video games is doing the same thing in under an hour. Beat a combat encounter, get an upgrade. Enter a new area, choose a new item. Put together a build and watch it sing.</p>
<p>If you die—immediately ending your ascent and returning you to the beginning of the game—you’ll often make a pit stop at a home base to unlock new goodies to help you on your next run. (Some people distiguish between roguelikes and “roguelites,” with the latter including permanent, between-run upgrades. For simplicity’s sake, I’ll use “roguelike” as an umbrella term).</p>
<p>2025 has been a truly horrific year for most things. But for roguelikes? It’s been an embarrassment of riches. Because I’m an editor and there’s no one here to stop me, I’d like to tell you about them. To keep things manageable, I’ll stick to games that hit 1.0 in 2025.</p>
<h2><em>Hades II</em></h2>

<p>Where else could we start? In a year of wall-to-wall video game showstoppers, <em>Hades II</em> sticks out. The first <em>Hades</em> got our nod for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/ars-technicas-best-games-of-2020/">best game of 2020</a>, and <em>Hades 2</em> certainly has my vote for 2025.</p>
<p>This time, you play as Melinoë, sister to <em>Hades</em> protagonist Zagreus and daughter of Hades himself, as she attempts to take back the house of Hades from Chronos, the titan of time. The cast of Olympian gods returns to bestow blessings (upgrades to your various attacks and defensive maneuvers) to help you on your way. If you played the first game, you’ll know what you’re getting into here; the sequel just vastly expands the content and mechanics.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>As you fight through the game’s two different paths, you’ll slowly uncover the game’s story via little snippets of dialogue (there’s a truly mind-boggling amount of dialogue in this game), and oodles of unlockables and endgame challenge runs ensure you’ll be playing for a long time.</p>
<p>You won’t find many roguelikes with higher production values. The game is $30. Madness! If you like roguelikes, you’ve probably already picked this up. I’ll go further, though. If you enjoy video games at all, you should buy <em>Hades II</em>. It’s that good.</p>

<h2><em>Ball x Pit</em></h2>



<p>You ever boot up a new game and immediately think, “Well, this thing is going to be a problem for me”? Yeah.</p>
<p>We’ve been blessed with several pachinko-style roguelites over the past couple of years (<em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/peglin-is-the-roguelike-peggle-rpg-we-didnt-know-we-needed/">Peglin</a></em>, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2667120/Ballionaire/">Ballionaire</a></em>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3191030/Nubbys_Number_Factory/"><em>Nubby’s Number Factory</em></a> are all worth your time); now comes a take on another ball-centric classic. I’m talking about last month’s <em>Ball x Pit</em>, a roguelite version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)"><em>Breakout</em></a>. Or at least that’s the simple way to describe it. In actuality, the game is that rarest of finds: something that feels unique.</p>
<p>Take one of your many and varied characters onto the battlefield, and you’ll lob a stream of balls toward the top of the screen, where slowly descending enemies periodically fire attacks back at you. When you level up, you’ll choose “special balls,” which have all manner of effects, like inflicting fire or poison on enemies or balls that explode into other balls. As the game progresses, you can “fuse” these balls together, combining the effects. Sometimes, you’ll be able to “evolve” two balls into an entirely new type of ball. Not enough for you? Slam two evolved balls together for even more wackiness.</p>
<p>The moment-to-moment gameplay is fantastic, with different characters and upgrades forcing you to play differently to succeed. The game doles out new mechanics and surprises along the way to keep things fresh, though this is a game you can “complete”; the between-run metaprogression eventually lets you become a bit of a god.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>A base-building system—and a minigame in which you bounce your characters around the map to activate buildings—is a nice, thematic diversion between runs, but it’s mostly just a flashy upgrade screen. I usually just wanted to get back into the game as soon as possible.</p>

<h2><em>Absolum</em></h2>



<p><em>Absolum</em>’s well-regarded <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3713610/Absolum_Demo/">demo</a> was released in June, but this thing came out of nowhere for me. The elevator pitch: a beat ‘em up, but make it roguelite.</p>
<p>Not really a beat ‘em up fan? Me neither. Doesn’t matter. The last side-scrolling brawler I played for more than an hour was probably 1991’s <em>The Simpsons</em> arcade game or that same year’s <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time</em> (though the original TMNT arcade game from 1989 was my first quarter-munching arcade love).</p>

<p>The game features gorgeous hand-drawn visuals and the year’s best soundtrack, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yShiPI-gPeA&amp;list=RDyShiPI-gPeA&amp;start_radio=1">this absolute banger</a> from <em>Doom</em>’s Mick Gordon (that’s from a particularly metal boss fight; most of the songs are more fantasy-forward).</p>
<p>Over your runs, you’ll traverse multiple paths, finding secrets and unlocking new features. The roguelike elements are a bit thin at first, but piecing together powerful builds becomes simple as you fill out your options. The combat is sublime—you can get away with button-mashing for a while, but you’ll want to learn at least some of its intricacies to make it to the end.</p>
<p>This thing’s the complete package, and it’s easily one of the best games of the year. Bring along a friend if you’re into co-op. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3713610/Absolum_Demo/">surprisingly beefy demo</a> is still available—there’s really no excuse not to check it out.</p>
<h2><em>Clover Pit</em></h2>



<p>I’ve never actually been to a casino, but judging by the electric dopamine surge I get when hitting a jackpot in the slot machine roguelike <em>Clover Pit</em>, I know I should maintain my chastity.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><em>Clover Pit</em> locks you in a disgusting, blood-soaked closet of a room, and the only way to earn your freedom is to deposit money into an ATM over a series of ever-increasing payments. In other words, it’s what’s come to be known in some circles as a <em>Balatro</em>-like, aka a numbers-go-up game (of course, <em>Balatro</em> was just the first such game to hit it big; the genre’s true progenitor came a year or so earlier in the form of another excellent slot machine roguelike, <em>Luck be a Landlord</em>).</p>
<p>Standing on a trap door that will drop you to your death if you fail to hit your deadlines, you’ll pull a lever on a slot machine over and over, hoping to hit it big. It’s not totally random, though, of course. Purchaseable trinkets allow you to manipulate your odds, trigger beneficial effects, and multiply your score. Getting a jackpot of all 7’s? It’s easier than you may think.</p>
<p>Don’t expect <em>Balatro</em>-like depth—most strategies here involve simply picking one symbol and buffing it to high heaven—but fun, game-breaking builds are easy to put together to make you feel like a winner. There’s something disconcertingly hypnotic and soothing about repeatedly pulling a slot machine lever—it’s best to do it here, where you won’t end up losing your home.</p>
<h2><em>Shape of Dreams</em></h2>



<p>I’ve been playing the hell out of this game, but if you stopped me on the street, I could not tell you what it’s called. Forgettable name aside, I love it.</p>
<p>I’ve heard the game’s combat and controls described as MOBA-like. That seems reasonable, at least from what I remember from my ill-advised and short-lived attempt to get into <em>Dota 2</em> a decade ago. Don’t let that scare you off, though; this is basically a top-down action RPG where you’ll be fighting through small rooms of enemies, <em>Hades</em>-style.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<p>What makes it special is its skill system. You start each run with a couple of attacks and a passive ability, and you’ll pick up (and replace) skills as you go. Each skill—here called “memories” (don’t ask me; I skipped the lore)—can fit up to three “essences,” modifications that affect how the skill functions. You can rearrange these modifications at any time, enabling a “make your own skill” system that’s endlessly fascinating.</p>
<p>Unique unlockable characters and robust metaprogression skill trees will keep you busy for embarrassing amounts of time. You can even play with friends. Before long, you’ll be creating game-breaking, room-nuking builds, the hallmark of my favorite games of the genre.</p>
<h2><em>Megabonk</em></h2>



<p>As its name might suggest, <em>Megabonk</em> is not a serious game. Unlike some other games on this list, there’s no chance of this one becoming an all-time great. But there’s a reason this buzzy little title has been on many gamers’ lips since its release in September. The concept is simple: it’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> meets <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>.</p>
<p>If you’ve played both games, mash them up in your mind and you’ll know exactly how this thing plays. And not just in the way that most “<em>Survivor</em>-likes” tread extremely similar ground to the original. <em>Megabonk</em>‘s treasure-chest-opening animation is ripped straight from <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and the game’s structure and items (down to the artwork style) are basically just <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>.</p>
<p>So no, it’s in no way original. And I was disappointed to learn that there are only two real “stages” to play; a <em>Risk of Rain-</em>style teleporter just takes you to a harder version of the stage you’ve picked. There are also balance issues; the damage scaling on anything but the first 10-minute stage is absurd. But there is some ridiculous fun to be had with it.</p>
<p>If you’re not into the whole auto-shooter/bullet heaven thing, there’s nothing here for you. But if you’re interested in seeing how chaotic a third-person <em>Vampire Survivors</em> can get, step right up.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>It’s also the one 2025 game where you can play as a sunglasses-wearing, skateboarding skeleton who throws bouncing bones at enemies. In these tough times, that’s not nothing.</p>
<h2><em>Deep Rock Galactic Survivor</em></h2>



<p>We’ve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-is-a-fine-entry-point-into-the-auto-shooting-depths/">talked about</a> this <em>Survivors</em>-like take on the beloved co-op shooter <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em> a couple of times over its Early Access period, but we were remiss in discussing it upon its 1.0 release last month. The game was already an Ars favorite, but its progression systems still needed a bit of work. It’s now ready for public consumption, and it’s one of the best auto-shooters on the market. It’s so good that you might want to take a look at it even if you want nothing to do with the oversaturated subgenre.</p>
<p>Its <em>Vampire Survivor</em>-like bones are obvious—you walk around a map while your weapons fire automatically at hordes of enemies closing in on you. Collect the XP gems defeated enemies drop to level up and choose an upgrade. The difference here is that you’re also able to mine through walls of rocks, letting you escape tricky situations and funnel bad guys to traps you’ve laid.</p>
<p>The progression system is heavy on the grind, but there’s plenty of fun to be had no matter how hardcore you want to be about it.</p>
<p>Rock and stone!</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em></h2>



<p>Five years after the original, it’s time for the sequel to the second-best roguelike deckbuilder of all time (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2868840/Slay_the_Spire_2/">the sequel to the first-best roguelike deckbuilder</a> has—thankfully, if I’m being honest—been delayed until the beginning of next year). As in the first game, and as the game’s title might suggest, you’ll be fighting monsters on a train, trying to stop them before they ascend three floors to reach your “pyre”—your health pool for the run.</p>
<p>In <em>Monster Train 2</em>, as in any deckbuilder, you start with a fairly crappy deck of cards and upgrade and expand it throughout your run to try to make it to the end. But in addition to the usual spells and attacks, <em>Monster Train 2</em> gives you units to assign to the different levels of your battlefield, infusing an interesting spatial element to the cartoonishly violent proceedings.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>The sequel is more of the first game, but with smart updates that make everything flow smoother. It’s one of my favorite games of the year, and I highly recommend it to any fan of tactical card games.</p>
<h2><em>Deadzone Rogue</em></h2>



<p><em>Deadzone Rogue</em> instantly joins the pantheon of roguelite first-person looter shooters, which includes perennial favorites <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1217060/Gunfire_Reborn/"><em>Gunfire Reborn</em></a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/692890/Roboquest/"><em>Roboquest</em></a> (I haven’t played them yet, but the brand-new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721110/Abyssus/"><em>Abyssus</em></a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2615540/VOIDBREAKER/"><em>Void/Breaker</em></a> are also generating a bunch of buzz).</p>
<p>Where <em>Roboquest</em> excels at fun, <em>Doom</em>-like movement and colorful environments, <em>Deadzone Rogue</em> is all about the shooting. The game has the best gunplay of any FPS roguelike I’ve played, and the random weapons, armor, and upgrades you get give each run a sense of personality.</p>
<p>The game’s music, voice acting, and lore are best ignored, but the sound design is nice and punchy. This won’t be a game you’ll play for 100 hours, but sometimes it’s just fun to shoot a gun in a video game, and <em>Deadzone Rogue</em> gets that simple formula right.</p>
<h2><em>9 Kings</em></h2>



<p>Look, I’m going to cheat here, and I’m not ashamed of it. It’s true—<em>9 Kings</em> is not fully released. But I can’t not talk about. I initially wrote the game off when it was released into Early Access in July, thinking it looked too simple. It <em>is</em> simple, but that’s to its credit.</p>
<p>The premise is easy to explain: Build a little kingdom on a 3-by-3 grid of squares. Play a card to construct or upgrade a building or unit in your kingdom. Afterward, a neighboring kingdom will attack, and your units will automatically fight to defend your home. After the battle, you draft a card from the defeated kingdom to add to your hand.</p>
<p>As you can see from the above screenshot, you can expand your kingdom beyond the initial nine squares, and unlockable perks change up the way you play each king. A handful of enemies are randomly chosen from the pool of nine, meaning that the cards you can draft each run will be different.</p>
<p>Making busted builds and fighting your way up the difficulty levels is extremely compelling; there was a week where the “one more run” curse descended on me, and I did little else than play this game.</p>

Vedal, along with fellow VTubers<a href="https://twitch.tv/crelly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Crelly </a>and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/filian" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filian</a>, has claimed that the Twitch stream will not end until the quartet complete the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcE_dHvaN2Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZcE_dHvaN2Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To complete Minecraft, the four need to get to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-to-the-end-in-minecraft/1100-6531635/" data-ref-id="1100-6531635">The End</a> to face off against the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-ender-dragon-boss-guide-where-to-find-and-how-to-beat/1100-6531625/" data-ref-id="1100-6531625"> Ender Dragon</a>--not an easy feat at the best of times, and certainly not when you're relying on a childlike AI to make the right decisions, follow instructions, and cheat death.</p><p>As if that didn't sound complex enough, Neuro has been making some interesting choices that have resulted in yet another world reset. Neuro often gets overwhelmed with bloodlust, seeking out mobs during the night and facing off against them with less than ideal strategies. She's not yet mastered the "hit and shield" approach of attacking mobs, so she'll repeatedly land weak attacks on them until they inevitably overcome her.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcQNHxSGrVo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UcQNHxSGrVo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Alongside the usual Minecraft deaths--such as being blown up by Creepers, attacked by an Enderman, or falling into a lava pit--Neuro has seemingly decided to troll her creator and his friends. Clad entirely in enchanted diamond armor, the four set off for the Nether to find Blaze Rods--an ingredient essential for finding the portal to The End--where Neuro immediately began to build a bridge over a large lava lake. After taking an extended look back at the portal to the overworld, she spammed crouch and then walked off the end of the bridge and burned to death.</p><p>On another attempt, after becoming overwhelmed by that aforementioned bloodlust, Neuro slayed an innocent Villager. In Minecraft, if you damage a Villager in a village protected by an Iron Golem, that Golem will not take kindly to your actions. Neuro found this out the hard way, and in just two hits she was dead, and the run was over.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xPyoaBEc5k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xPyoaBEc5k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As the attempts progress, Crelly--who has become Neuro's "stepmother" and often entrusted with babysitting the AI--is becoming increasingly frustrated with Neuro's frequent mistakes. "She wants to die!" yelled the cow YouTuber after attempt number 74. "Neuro, Neuro, Neuro!" she shouts during attempt 80, when Neuro-Sama insisted upon digging upwards out of a safe area Crelly had created for her. "Neuro, that's an Enderman; let's not look at him. Follow me!" she adds. It's safe to say the trust in Neuro's Minecraft capabilities is rapidly depleting.</p><p>At the time of writing, the streamers are taking a sleep break after attempt number 83, and the stream has been live since Friday, December 5, at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET / 7 PM GMT. According to YouTube editor <a href="https://youtu.be/4xPyoaBEc5k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">KeidenEdits</a>, Neuro has been responsible for 47 deaths, Filian for 14 deaths, Vedal for 13 deaths, and Crelly for 10 deaths. Of those statistics, 17 have been Zombies, 11 have been Creepers, and 11 have been Skeletons. Nine deaths have resulted from fall damage, eight from drowning, four from the Iron Golem, four from lava, Neuro has turned homicidal four times, the Drowned mob has committed two murders, two from Zombified Piglins, two from an Enderman, and one a piece for the Witch, Spider, Husk, and Guardian mobs. Neuro has starved to death once, Vedal has accidentally killed once, and Neuro has suffocated in sand once.</p><p>The four plan to resume their attempts today, December 8, at 8:30 AM PT / 11:30 AM ET / 4:30 PM GMT.</p>

<p>Welcome to my portable world, insect</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nightdive Studios is bringing its awesome <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake to the Switch and Switch 2, and we can now exclusively reveal that it'll be available to play from <strong>18th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Originally released in 2023, System Shock is a comprehensive yet faithful remake of the 1994 FPS from Looking Light Studios. Development was lengthy and somewhat troubled, with Nightdive striving to reboot the original with more modern design principles.</p>
<p>In the end, however, to deliver on the promises of its initial Kickstarter campaign, the team chose to lean more towards a remake, keeping the core elements of the original intact while introducing a plethora of quality-of-life updates.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Nightdive succeeded in its goal, and System Shock received mostly positive critical acclaim upon release. Taking place in the year 2072, you play as an unnamed hacker who awakens in a station under total control of SHODAN, an AI completely removed from its moral and ethical restraints. Grotesque mutations and cyborgs roam the station, and it's up to you to defeat SHODAN.</p>
<p>With visuals blending pixel art textures and modern lighting technology, the System Shock remake is, to put it lightly, a <em>vibe</em>. It's a significantly different experience compared to System Shock 2, which Nightdive also released on the Switch earlier this year. If you're curious, we definitely recommend giving it a shot. For those on Switch 2, the game will offer up both gyro aiming and optional mouse controls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Unravel the chilling story of SHODAN's rise and explore the mysteries of Citadel Station, piecing together the truth in this atmospheric sci-fi world</p>
<p>- Face perilous traps, puzzles, and a legion of hostile and mutated creatures — created and controlled by the villainous SHODAN herself</p>
<p>- Choose between a male or female-presenting Hacker protagonist</p>
<p>- Improved gyro aiming and Joy-Con 2 mouse support adds gameplay versatility for both controller and mouse and keyboard players</p>
</blockquote>
