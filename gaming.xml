            <p>
Amid of swirl of rumours suggesting Microsoft was prepping more Call of Duty for an imminent Xbox Game Pass release, the company has confirmed last year's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will join on its subscription service this Wednesday, 24th July.
</p>
<p>
As per Microsoft's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/23/modern-warfare-3-coming-to-game-pass-july-24/">announcement</a>, Game Pass subscribers will have access to all Modern Warfare 3 modes, meaning its single-player campaign, multiplayer, and open-world Zombies.
</p>
<p>
Modern Warfare 3 is only the second <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> title to hit Game Pass since Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$69bn acquisition of the company</a> last year, with Diablo 4 having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-will-make-a-hellish-addition-to-xbox-game-pass-this-march">launched for the subscription service</a> back in March. It's not the only announced Activision title for Game Pass, of course; this year's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-alert-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch">available to subscribers</a> when it arrives on 24th October.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Newscast: Does the loss of day one launches make Xbox Game Pass pointless?" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEc8ghseTIk?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Or rather, it'll be available to <em>some</em> Game Pass subscribers in October, given Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">recent overhaul</a> of the service. As of 12th September, Game Pass' lowest tier - now known as Xbox Game Pass Standard - will no longer provide access to first-party and other titles on launch day. That benefit will instead only be available to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers on console.
</p>
<p>
Modern Warfare 3's imminent Game Pass arrival is presumably timed to get as many new subscribers onboard ahead of September's price hike in the hope they'll stick around. Whether or not this particular Call of Duty will do the trick remains to be seen - Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell didn't think much of it last year, calling it an "exercise in extracting value from its players rather than providing it" and "what happens when this industry is at its worst", in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-review">two star review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-wrc-roadmap-officially-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA Sports WRC, also known as EA WRC, is a highly popular racing game and holds the license of the World Rally Championship, which allows them to make these games. Developed by Codemasters, EA Sports WRC is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-wrc-tech-q-no-plans-to-add-lumen-or-nanite/">the Codemasters first rally game</a> to have the official WRC license. Released in November 2023, EA has officially released the roadmap for EA Sports WRC, so that players and fans of the game can see what they should expect.</p>
<p>A new season expansion has officially been confirmed for October 2024, adding plenty more content to the game. The expansion is set to include "new locations, rally stages, high-performance vehicles, liveries, and more." Fascinatingly, those who purchase the season expansion for EA Sports WRC 2024 will also go on to receive two more additional DLC packs post-launch.</p>
<p>Along with the season expansion, players can purchase the EA Sports WRC 2024 Season Edition, a one-time purchase of both the base game and the three incoming DLCs for a fixed price.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc/news/2024-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the blog post</a> for the EA Sports WRC roadmap, EA expands on that and says that a further season expansion will be released in Winter 2024, with the other being released in Spring 2025. Those who purchase the season expansion will receive the other two DLCs at no extra cost. Alternatively, those who don't own the expansion can purchase the DLCs individually.</p>
<p>The blog post for the WRC road map also confirms the introduction of the Season 6 Rally Pass, which begins on July 30. Utilizing player feedback, the developers have made the Rally Pass more reasonable, allowing players to unlock liveries for cars outside the WRC. With the new Rally Pass, Moments are also returning to the game. The Rally Pass will be entirely free for players to utilize and try to unlock all of the rewards available.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting points of the blog post is the reveal of esports WRC. While it is still in development, the blog post says, "We're almost ready to share the official competition information and event calendar as we continue to work with our partners on the finer details of the series."</p>
<p>While the details haven't been released yet, they say to stay tuned to their social media accounts, where you will find out the latest information regarding the online qualifiers that are to be held via RaceNet, and a later in-person final race where players will compete for the title of esports WRC World Champion. The races will have a variety of challenges and locations for players to compete in, and they all have to use Rally1 cars to compete.</p>

I’m not sure, but I think this might be the first time I’ve ever seen a Lego set recreate a living creature’s intestines like this before and it’s making me a little sick.

<p>Play by Play Studios has announced its new basketball game, The Run: Got Next. The game comes from a studio featuring numerous former EA developers, including former general manager Scott Probst, Madden creative director Mike Young, and more.</p>



<p>The game is being touted as a spiritual success to the NBA Street franchise of the early-to-mid 2000s. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Run: Got Next - Official Announcement Teaser Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vmq1zu8u0OU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“There was a lot of us that worked on NBA Street that always wanted to bring it back. I think it is difficult for a company that has a game like a Madden or an NBA Live that is so big. If you’re putting all your resources to that, I think it was challenging to think about a secondary game,” Young told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-street-the-run-got-next-unreal-engine-5-ps5-xbox-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.</p>



<p>“Introducing&nbsp;The Run: Got Next&nbsp;– a character-driven, full court 3v3 hoops game that celebrates the attitude, style and skills of streetball culture,” the <a href="https://playbyplaystudios.com/news/introducing-the-run-got-next" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s description reads</a>. “Bring your squad to some of the most legendary street courts around the world and see how long you can go on a Run.”</p>



<p>In a welcome note <a href="https://playbyplaystudios.com/news/welcome-to-play-by-play-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the studio’s website</a>, Probst says that the goal of the studio is to bring fun back to sports games in a way that doesn’t exist anymore.</p>



<p>“As the years have gone by the gaming industry has grown exponentially, and in many cases the business has taken precedence over the fun of a particular experience – that sucks,” he said. </p>



<p>“I’ve found this myself in many sports games today where I feel like I have to grind hundreds of hours to be good, I have to pay hundreds of dollars (on top of the $70 I already spent for the game itself) to have an ok time, and I have to go out on random quests to do things that don’t really have anything to do with the fun of the game or the sport.”</p>



<p>The Run: Got Next launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

        <p><em>Modern Warfare III</em>‘s multiplayer offers crisp and responsive gameplay across a bevy of maps and modes. All the classic maps from the original <em><a title="Games > Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</a></em> (2009) make their return, but with new gameplay improvements that players have become accustomed to over the years. This, in addition to the large-scale Invasion and Ground War maps and four seasons’ worth of post-launch maps and updates, means that you’ll be getting an incredible amount of content right from the jump. There’s never been a better time to hop into the fray!</p><p>Player progression has evolved as well, with new and familiar Perks, Killstreaks and Equipment to unlock. Each level builds you into a stronger and more tactically diverse operator, giving you more options on the battlefield. In addition to your usual weapons and attachments, MWIII also introduces After-Market Parts, allowing you to further customize your weapons. And if you’ve played MWII multiplayer, MWIII allows you to transfer much of your content and weapon progression with its Carry Forward feature.</p><p><strong>Explore the Dark Aether</strong></p><p>Prepare to fight and survive against hordes of zombies in the largest Call of Duty Zombies map ever! In this co-op PvE extraction mode, you and your squad drop into the outskirts of an infested Urzikstan as a part of Operation: Deadbolt. As you complete contracts, raid strongholds and venture further into the map, the zombies you encounter will grow stronger and more relentless. The best loot and darkest secrets hide in these higher-tier areas, but you will still need to safely exfiltrate if you hope to keep your gear and fight another day. Luckily, you’ll have access to many classic Zombies upgrades including Perk-a-Colas, Ammo-Mods, the Pack-a-Punch machine and (if you’re lucky) the powerful and infamous Wonder Weapons.</p><p>However, there are more than just zombies roaming this infested area. The mercenaries of Terminus Outcomes have set up bases around Urzikstan along with their elite Warlords. Oh, and have we mentioned the special zombies and bosses? There’s much more to discover, but we’ll let you find out for yourself.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Xbox Game Pass Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Play Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III with Game Pass on July 24" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/azOmcIVpj6Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>EA Sports WRC players can now see what EA has in store for the next year, as it has revealed the content roadmap. The key highlight is the Season 6 Rally Pass, which launches July 30th, bringing rewards of helmets, suits, gloves, and vehicle liveries. And for the first time, there will be liveries for vehicle classes outside of WRC. The Season 6 Rally Pass will run from July to September.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS WRC - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JFy_cWefBtQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Accompanying the Season 6 Rally Pass will be the 2024 WRC Esports Championship, with online events being added for players to compete in. The most successful will face off against each other in an in-person final. Online qualifiers will take place <a href="https://racenet.com/ea_sports_wrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Racenet,</a> but further details are to be confirmed on what online events will take place, and when.</p>

<p>In October, the WRC 24 Season Expansion will be available to purchase, adding two new locations, rally stages, liveries and vehicles. The expansion will also grant access to two future DLC packs, the first of which will launch in the winter and the second will be made available in the spring. Both DLC packs will contain more cars and additional rally stages in already available locations.</p>

<p><em>“The 2024 WRC Expansion ensures our game content remains fresh, allowing players to advance their careers with the introduction of two thrilling locations, more vehicles, and expanded customisation options,”</em> said Matthew Battison, Creative Director at Codemasters.<em> “The free Season 6 Rally Pass gives players more reasons to jump back into the game ahead of our major plans for later in the year.”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/ea-sports-wrc-review/">EA Sports WRC Review</a></h2>
<p>In our EA Sports WRC review, Dom said, <em>“If you’re looking for a fully featured and great handling rally game, EA Sports WRC is the undisputed champion this year, though PC players need to be aware that some technical bugs still need to be ironed out.”</em></p>

The news comes as the game division’s former boss, Mike Verdu, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24177141/netflixs-gaming-boss-is-moving-to-another-role-at-netflix-in-gaming">moved into a different role at Netflix</a> focused on a new team “on the cutting edge of game innovation.”</p><p>In his previous role at Epic, which he held since 2018, Tascan was in charge of the company’s first-party output, which included not only <em>Fortnite</em> and its various modes like <em>Lego Fortnite </em>but also other live-service games like <em>Rocket League</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>. In a statement, Tascan explained that he took the role at the streamer because “I firmly believe that Netflix is uniquely positioned to redefine the future of gaming.”</p><p>Though it has yet to become a major part of Netflix’s business, the company has dabbled in games since 2021, with a growing library of titles available to subscribers via mobile. More recently, the company has shifted somewhat to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171526/netflix-games-too-hot-too-handle-interactive-fiction">focus on games that are connected to its most popular shows</a>; the next season of <em>Emily in Paris</em>, for instance, will premiere on August 15th, alongside the launch of a tie-in game.

All classes will offer a great experience whether you play solo or with others. While dungeons and boss battles are designed for groups of players, the game will automatically match you up with others via the Duty Finder system. <em>FF14</em> also lets you use NPC companions in almost all its leveling dungeons. These NPCs can cover defense, offense, and healing. In other words, you don’t have to worry about picking a class that can tough it out on its own; <strong>every class and job is solo-viable throughout the entire main story quest.</strong></p><p>For reference, I’m a mostly solo player and play the Astrologian Job. This Job primarily buffs and heals other players. I’ve never felt held back by my choice of class, even though it might seem like a class meant to support other players. In other words, <strong>new players should pick whichever class they find most appealing, regardless of whether they’ll play solo or with friends</strong>.</p><p><strong><em>FF14</em> also offers some optional challenges for solo players to chase. In these specific instances, some classes and jobs will give you an edge over others</strong>. If that sounds interesting to you, then consider playing some of the classes and Jobs listed below.</p><h2 id="h2229"><a id="best"></a>The best solo class in <em>Final Fantasy 14</em></h2><p><strong>Classes in <em>FF14 </em>strictly refer to roles you can pick at level 1</strong>. These will all turn into “Jobs” after completing their respective questlines.

These ax wielders are Tanks, which means they’re designed to grab the attention of enemies away from your party members and take hits in their stead. For solo players just starting out, this is a nice perk. Your naturally high defense and HP will cushion you if you accidentally get in over your head against high level monsters all by yourself.</p><p>After you level up Marauder enough to unlock the Warrior Job, you’ll find that you’re so bulky it’s almost like you don’t need other players. The cooldown skills Thrill of Battle and Equilibrium provide powerful self-healing, reducing your need to rely on other players to heal you. </p><p>At level 56, Warriors unlock Raw Intuition, a skill with a 25-second cooldown that heals you whenever you hit an enemy. So the next time you find yourself trapped in a mob of six enemies who are all attacking you, you can just use some area-of-effect attacks after using Raw Intuition and watch your health climb back to full in a matter of seconds.</p><p><strong>The Warrior’s incredible self-healing makes it a top choice when trying to solo bosses from past expansions</strong>. The Warrior’s high health also comes in handy in group content,since you won’t need to count on healers to keep you alive as often as other characters. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFcZCEny4x4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFcZCEny4x4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Job is even capable of soloing level-equivalent 8-player encounters</a></span> .</p><p>For those interested in Marauder/Warrior, Gunbreaker<strong> </strong>is another Tank job that has seen notable success in the Heaven on High deep dungeon (more on this later). What’s more, Tank jobs equip the same armor, so you can jump between them easily. Sadly, Gunbreaker is not currently available in the free trial.</p><h2 id="h2231"><a id="jobs"></a>The best Jobs in <em>Final Fantasy 14 for solo play</em></h2><p><em>FF14</em> also contains “Advanced jobs,” which you can unlock after either reaching a certain level threshold or crossing a specific milestone in the main story quest. These Jobs don’t have preceding classes, so you can play them as soon as you can unlock them. Aspiring solo players should check out the jobs below.</p><h3 id="h2232"><a id=""></a>Red Mage</h3><figure id="" data-id="c33b66b789c2dcde643a0bc3edb7fa5a" data-recommend-id="image://c33b66b789c2dcde643a0bc3edb7fa5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Red Mage holds a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Red Mage holds a sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c33b66b789c2dcde643a0bc3edb7fa5a" data-recommend-id="image://c33b66b789c2dcde643a0bc3edb7fa5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Red Mage holds a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Unlock requirement</strong>: Reach level 50 and complete the quest Taking the Red in Ul’Dah.</p><p>For longtime <em>Final Fantasy</em> fans, the Red Mage’s place here should come as no surprise. It’s traditionally a jack-of-all-trades job in the series’ canon, and that’s generally true here. The <em>FF14</em> incarnation of Red Mage is a magic DPS class, meaning its primary function is to cast long-range magic spells to inflict damage. However, there are two specific reasons why Red Mage appeals to solo players.</p><p>Red Mage’s first major perk is mobility. Spell casters in <em>FF14</em> typically need to stay in one spot to attack, relying on short windows between spells to dodge attacks without decreasing their DPS. Meanwhile, Red Mages have the Dualcast trait, letting them cast every other spell instantly. Red Mages can also build a gauge that lets them use powerful melee attacks that lack any sort of cast time. Combine these abilities with the Corps-a-corps<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>Displacement abilities, which lets Red Mages leap towards and away from enemies respectively, and you get a class that can easily counter enemy mechanics and dodge attacks.High mobility isn’t exclusive to Red Mage, but what <em>is</em> exclusive is the spell Vercure. In a vacuum, Vercure is a basic curing spell that’s inferior to anything a dedicated Healer can use. However,<strong> </strong>Vercure is the best on-demand healing spell learned by any DPS class in the game. Other DPS classes have defensive and healing options on a cooldown, but Red Mages can reliably heal themselves as long as they have enough Magic Points.</p><p>The Red Mage’s mix of offense and healing makes it a comfortable job for players who don’t want to rely on friends to help them out<strong>.</strong> As an added bonus, Red Mage is one of the best jobs to play if you plan to defeat <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goKGyO0ieU4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goKGyO0ieU4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the rare solo bosses in the Bozjan Southern Front</a></span>. </p><p>For new players interested in Red Mage, consider starting out as the Arcanist class. In the early game, Arcanist feels remarkably like the Red Mage, since it learns both ranged magic attacks and basic healing magic. Additionally, if you choose to promote yourself from the Arcanist class to the Summoner job, you can carry over almost all your gear to Red Mage upon unlocking it..</p><h3 id="h2233"><a id=""></a>Machinist</h3><figure id="" data-id="74da0add0d16ee68ca07afdd744b5761" data-recommend-id="image://74da0add0d16ee68ca07afdd744b5761" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Machinist stands next to a flying machine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Machinist stands next to a flying machine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="74da0add0d16ee68ca07afdd744b5761" data-recommend-id="image://74da0add0d16ee68ca07afdd744b5761" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Machinist stands next to a flying machine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Unlock requirement</strong>: Reach the <em>Heavensward </em>expansion and complete the quest So You Want To Be A Machinist in Foundation.</p><p>Compared to the picks above, Machinist might seem like an odd choice. This Physical RangedDPS Job doesn’t sport on-demand healing or high defense, and its damage output doesn’t compare to melee DPS jobs either. So what makes the Machinist so special?</p><p>First, let’s talk about mobility. Machinist is a Physical Ranged DPS<strong> </strong>Job, which means it can freely move and attack from a distance. <strong>Machinist has no cast times</strong>, and only its situational Flamethrower attack limits its movement. Not only can a Machinist dodge attacks like a champ, it’s one of the only jobs in the game that can kite normal enemies. Kiting (when you run from a mob of enemies pursuing you) is typically discouraged in group content, but it can become a massive boon when playing solo.</p><p>While Bard and Dancer are also Physical Ranged DPS jobs, they derive most of their power from supporting other players. Machinist is more of a “selfish” job as it focuses on dishing out lots of damage on its own. <strong>In a solo environment, the Machinist massively outperforms its Physical Ranged counterparts</strong>.</p><p>Dismantle cuts an enemy’s attack output by 10% for 10 seconds, bolstering the Machinist’s survivability against tough foes. Head Graze can stun targets (invaluable in canceling certain strong attacks), while Leg Graze and Foot Graze<strong> </strong>can control the mobility of common enemies you’ll face. And while it doesn’t affect battle performance, Peloton increases your movement speed while out of combat, which makes running around cities and dungeons a bit faster.</p><p>All of these traits make Machinist one of the best jobs to challenge <strong><em>FF14</em></strong>’s Deep Dungeons. Deep Dungeons are roguelike-style challenges that task players with clearing upwards of 200 randomized levels filled with traps and monsters. While these are primarily designed with parties of four in mind, players can earn some of the rarest achievements in the entire game by clearing a Deep Dungeon by themselves without dying. So if you want to prepare yourself for the most hardcore challenge available to solo players, Deep Dungeons are essential.</p><p>For new players interested in the Machinist, you’ll want to start as the Archer class. An Archer can eventually upgrade to the Bard Job, and while Bard’s personal DPS potential <em>is </em>low, that gap isn’t so pronounced at lower levels. More importantly, Archer/Bard most closely resembles the Machinist’s playstyle of all the starting classes. You can also unlock Machinist as soon as you progress into the <em>Heavensward </em>expansion. Machinist equips the same armor as Bard too!</p><h2 id="h2234"><a id="others"></a>Honorable Mentions: Other Jobs worth considering for solo play</h2><p>The Ninja Job–which is derived from the Rogue class–boasts high burst damage and uniquely has the Hide ability that predominantly benefits solo players. </p><p>The Samurai Job is another good pick as it can inflict among the most damage in the game without relying on others . It even has some mitigation built into its kit via the Third Eye<strong> </strong>ability.</p><p>Healers typically don’t thrive in solo environments, but solo players might feel more comfortable knowing they can heal themselves on demand. Conjurer–which up-classes into the White Mage Job–is one of the better healer roles for players that plan to undertake solo content. </p><p>Sage is also relatively solo friendly, though unlocking this job does require the <em>Endwalker </em>expansion (alongside a hefty prerequisite of hitting level 70 first).</p><hr><p>Solo players in <em>FF14</em> have a lot of great options when it comes to picking a class or Job. Ultimately, you should main the job you enjoy playing most in <em>FF14</em>, regardless of whether you’re a solo player or not. <em>FF14</em> also lets you easily switch between classes and Jobs as well, so feel free to experiment with different roles and see which ones stick with you. Whether you intend to challenge bosses and Deep Dungeons by yourself in <em>FF14 </em>or wind up getting distracted by fishing, enjoy your time in Eorzea!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m <em>this</em> close to absolutely adoring this assortment of timed challenges from NES games. In many ways, it feels like it’s designed precisely for NES sickos like me, folks who have an enduring fondness not just for well-regarded classics like <em>The Legend of Zelda </em>and <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>but also for the rougher, more frustrating first-party games on Nintendo’s first console, like <em>Ice Climber</em>. But one huge, glaring flaw holds it back, relegating it to an interesting curiosity rather than the conversation- and competition-driving release it could have been.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,196698,196766" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Let me start with some of the things I really like about this game. First of all (and least importantly), I think the Deluxe Set Nintendo is selling is quite nice. It comes with a set of pins, postcards featuring the box art of all of the games featured in <em>Championships</em>, and a (strictly ornamental) gold NES cartridge. It’s all Nintendo paying tribute to itself, of course, but it’s a well-made assortment of goodies for a lot less than typical “special edition” prices.</p><p>Now, onto the game itself. <em>Nintendo Championships </em>is essentially a slew of challenges that have you playing moments from classic NES games and trying to achieve a given goal as quickly as possible. These range from really short and simple (grab the sword at the start of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>) to much more challenging (beat <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>), and I think the structure of the game is wonderful. The way it starts out by having you do the simplest things gives you a feel for how important every little movement can be. You learn from experience that valuable milliseconds can be gained or lost in something as basic as the angle of a jump.<br></p><p>In this regard, it feels like a real gateway to the joys of speedrunning. By the time you’re tackling one of the game’s more elaborate challenges that see you completing an entire stage or even an entire game, you intrinsically understand that it’s a matter of putting all the pieces together, trying to pull off every movement as gracefully and effectively as you pulled off the movements in those much smaller challenges you started with. I have probably played World 1-1 of <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>hundreds of times over the course of my life, and yet <em>Nintendo World Championships</em> pushed me, for the first time ever, to really focus on completing it as quickly as possible, and it felt like a totally different stage. Simply beating 1-1 is easy as pie. Beating it really quickly and efficiently? That takes practice and determination. Repeatedly, <em>Nintendo World Championships </em>thrilled me by giving me exciting new ways to tackle games that I’ve been intimately familiar with for most of my life, and I suspect that I’ll continue having fun going back to it for some time and trying to improve my rating in some of the game’s many challenges.</p><p>But here’s where we get to the game’s colossal oversight. Do you know what would have made me (and, I suspect, thousands of other players) way more enamored with these challenges, and way more determined to come back to them again and again to improve our times? Leaderboards. Particularly friend leaderboards. Look, if I knew that a pal of mine had picked up the Screw Attack power-up in <em>Metroid </em>.03 seconds faster than I had, you’d better believe I’d be obsessed with doing it again and again until I’d surpassed her time. For me, this game could have been the hottest source of online competition since <em>Pac-Man Championship Edition </em>burst onto Xbox Live way back in 2007. And you know what <em>Pac-Man CE </em>offered on top of leaderboards that helped make it such a competitive sensation? The opportunity to watch replays of your friends’ games, to identify exactly how they’d edged past you to the tune of 125,000 points.</p><figure id="" data-id="ad06773fc40136c406b9c6ff70e12824" data-recommend-id="image://ad06773fc40136c406b9c6ff70e12824" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen showing the writer's online profile as well as a number of &quot;Ghost Competitors&quot; in the game's survival mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen showing the writer's online profile as well as a number of &quot;Ghost Competitors&quot; in the game's survival mode." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Nintendo World Championships clearly stores ghost data, as it’s needed for the game’s survival mode.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad06773fc40136c406b9c6ff70e12824" data-recommend-id="image://ad06773fc40136c406b9c6ff70e12824" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen showing the writer's online profile as well as a number of &quot;Ghost Competitors&quot; in the game's survival mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s absolutely no reason why <em>Nintendo World Championships </em>shouldn’t offer both leaderboards and replays for its challenges. We already know the game stores replay data! One of its modes is called Survival Mode, and it pits you against ghost replays from seven other players in races to complete three challenges. Okay, Nintendo. So you have the damn data. <em>Please</em>, let me watch my friends’ best attempts at completing a loop of <em>Donkey Kong</em>, or beating Mouser in <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em>. Speedrunning is as much about cooperation and sharing information as it is about competition, and even if you <em>see </em>how a friend shaved five seconds off their time in a given challenge, you still have to execute the technique. It’s absurd that I have to take to Twitter to share information like this with my friends and fellow players, instead of them just being able to watch my replay in-game.<br></p><p>Obviously, I’m speaking as a die-hard NES fan here, but god, this misstep by Nintendo is so crushing. I really think <em>NWC </em>could have and should have been a game that brought people together and had us enthusiastically competing at its myriad challenges for many weeks. It could have been one of the games of the summer. Instead, because Nintendo failed to implement sensible online features, it’s an experience we can only really enjoy in isolation. It’s an oversight that, to me, is so mind-boggling I can scarcely believe it. I keep expecting Nintendo to announce that they’re patching in support for challenge-specific leaderboards and the ability to watch friends’ replays. But I doubt it will actually happen. This is Nintendo we’re talking about, a company that, for all its brilliance, has frequently been well behind the curve when it comes to knowing what to do with online functionality.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="2bbc11593454a3be450307fee44007bc" data-recommend-id="image://2bbc11593454a3be450307fee44007bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen showing off the game's only actual leaderboard, for the weekly World Championships mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen showing off the game's only actual leaderboard, for the weekly World Championships mode." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Yay, I ranked in the top 58 percent!</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2bbc11593454a3be450307fee44007bc" data-recommend-id="image://2bbc11593454a3be450307fee44007bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen showing off the game's only actual leaderboard, for the weekly World Championships mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><br>To be fair, there is ONE online leaderboard in the game, in the appropriately titled World Championships mode. Here, each week, you and players all over the world can compete in a series of five challenges, and once the week is out, you’re shown how you ranked against everyone else. That’s all well and good, but it feels grossly insufficient. I don’t just want to compete against the masses once a week. I want to have a spirited back-and-forth with my closest friends as we each obsessively try to be the fastest to grab the first mushroom in <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>or to beat Ridley in <em>Metroid</em>. God, it’s just so disappointing. My only hope is that the title of this game—<em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>—hints that in the future, we may see other entries, a SNES Edition, perhaps an N64 Edition, and so on, and that, by the time those come around, Nintendo decides to add the features this game is so glaringly missing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After weeks of calls from both consumers and even game studios, Intel <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/July-2024-Update-on-Instability-Reports-on-Intel-Core-13th-and/m-p/1617113#M74792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has publicly addressed</a> the instability reports surrounding its 13th and 14th-generation desktop CPU.  </p>



<p>According to the company, elevated operator voltage is causing the problem in “some” desktop processors. Intel says that its analysis shows that the elevated operator voltage is coming from “a microcode algorithm resulting in incorrect voltage requests to the processor.”</p>



<p>As far as a fix for the issue, Intel is releasing a microcode patch that addresses the cause. The update is currently being targeting for mid-August after “full validation” of its success.</p>



<p>You can read Intel’s full statement below.</p>



<h2 id="h-intel-statement-on-cpu-instability">Intel Statement On CPU Instability</h2>



<p><em>“Based on extensive analysis of Intel Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors returned to us due to instability issues, we have determined that elevated operating voltage is causing instability issues in some 13th/14th Gen desktop processors. Our analysis of returned processors confirms that the elevated operating voltage is stemming from a microcode algorithm resulting in incorrect voltage requests to the processor.</em></p>



<p><em>“Intel is delivering a microcode patch which addresses the root cause of exposure to elevated voltages. We are continuing validation to ensure that scenarios of instability reported to Intel regarding its Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors are addressed. Intel is currently targeting mid-August for patch release to partners following full validation.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-monty-python-and-the-holy-grail-secret-lair-spoilers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A pair of swallows, a dismembered knight, and a very iconic Tim are getting their own cards.</h2></div><section><p>Every time I think I’ve seen Magic: The Gathering’s most unexpected crossover yet – be that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hatsune-miku-is-coming-to-magic-the-gathering"><u>Hatsune Miku</u></a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-ravnica-clue-edition-spoilers-standalone-board-game"><u>the board game Clue</u></a> – Wizards of the Coast figures out some way to surprise me yet again. This time it’s with a selection of cards set in the world of the Monty Python and the Holy Grail. </p><p>Split across two Secret Lair drops, the latest Universes Beyond tie-in will have eight reprints and one token reskinned with references and jokes from the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/top-25-comedies-of-all-time">classic 1975 film</a>. One drop will have five cards total, one of which is double-faced so you can choose if it’s either an African or European swallow, while the other will have three cards and a token.</p><p>You can <strong>flip through the gallery below to see all the cards in both Monty Python drops</strong>: </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>9 Cards in Secret Lair x Monty Python and the Holy Grail: Vol. 1 &amp; 2</h3></div></output><p>To find out how the heck a crossover like this even comes about, I spoke with Secret Lair Senior Product Designer Daniel Nguyen, who said the first step for many of their Universes Beyond projects is to simply reach out to the representatives for lots of different properties and see who might be interested in working together.</p><p>“This was a really fun one to get,” Nguyen says. ”It’s kind of a funny pairing. They seem like such different ideas, but I think the cards came together really nicely and it’s just very quaint to see on Magic cards.” He also explains that the business folk their outreach team initially gets in touch with don’t always know what Magic even is, but that it’s “fun if someone on the other side actually is a Magic fan, which does happen quite often.”</p><p>While this isn’t the first old movie to get a crossover drop, with The Evil Dead and The Princess Bride both getting Secret Lairs of their own, the jokes within it do feel tailored toward both Holy Grail and Magic in a particularly satisfying way. That’s both in seeing iconic scenes from the movie represented by notable cards that align perfectly (such as, the card Dismember depicting the Black Knight), but also in a few Magic jokes that use the language of Monty Python instead.</p><p>For example, John Cleese’s Tim the Enchanter is represented by the card Prodigal Sorcerer, which is lovingly referred to as “Tim” by much of the Magic community. “That’s just the top line on the document, right? You gotta have that one,” says Nguyen, who jokes “if we don’t do that we’re all fired, clearly.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While the designs and thought behind the cards in these drops is impressive, the fact that Vol. 1 has five cards (one of which is double-faced) while Vol 2. only has three cards and token did make me curious about how Wizards of the Coast decides on the contents of each Secret Lair. Nguyen tells me that these decisions are generally more art than science, taking into account a card’s desirability in the playerbase, the bandwidth they have for coordinating artists and other resources, what each individual drop might call for thematically, and more. </p><p>“I take it very seriously,” Nguyen assures me. “We think deeply about everything that goes into these drops. Every aspect you can consider, I’m thinking about that all day long and losing sleep over it sometimes.” He says one part of that is hitting staple cards people are using a lot already, but also balancing that with some tastemaking picks that go off the beaten path when it makes sense, even if the appeal of the latter may be narrower as a result. “Every drop should [have] <em>someone’s </em>favorite card.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“We think deeply about everything that goes into these drops.” -<em> Daniel Nguyen, WOTC</em></p></div><p>The Monty Python and the Holy Grail drops will be available in both foil and non-foil starting on July 29 as part of the next Superdrop.

            <p><strong>UPDATE 5.30pm UK:</strong> Roblox has responded further to Bloomberg's article, and has now said the report fails to properly contextualise the scale of the game's issues with player safety versus the size of its platform.</p>
<p>"A recent article contained glaring mischaracterisations about how we protect users of all ages on the platform and failed to reflect both the complexities of online child safety and the realities of the overwhelmingly positive experiences that tens of millions of people of all ages have on Roblox every single day," a Roblox spokesperson said in a statement to Eurogamer, providing a link to a lengthy <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/07/driving-civility-and-safety-for-all-users">blog post</a> by the company's chief safety officer Matt Kaufman.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 4.30pm UK:</strong>  
Roblox's record on child safety has come under fire yet again, this time in a damning new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">Bloomberg</a> report that details the scale of the issue faced by the game's developers, who are unable to keep all of its young players safe. 
</p>
<p>
Last year, Roblox itself reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation to US authorities, and responded to over 1300 requests from authorities for detail on predatory players. 
</p>
<p>
In the last six years, at least two dozen people have been arrested in the US for abusing victims met via Roblox.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg's report goes into detail on the case of DoctorRofatnik, real name Arnold Castillo, who ran a hugely-successful Sonic the Hedgehog rip-off and earned tens of thousands of dollars in revenue. 
</p>
<p>
The 22-year-old Castillo was admired by an army of children who played his Roblox game, some of whom he paid to work on the project with him. But despite reports by Roblox players of inappropriate contact between Castillo and players as young as 12, it wasn't until a 15-year-old girl he had preyed on went missing from her home that Castillo was caught by the FBI.
</p>
<p>
Castillo is now serving a 15-year sentence for grooming and sexually abusing the child.
</p>
<p>
The scale of the issue and the work needed to solve what Bloomberg calls a "pedophile problem" is enormous. Roblox filters 50,000 chat messages a second between its tens of millions of concurrent users, most of whom are under the age of 18. It employs 3000 human moderators, though relies on AI for much of the work. 
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg has spoken with Roblox moderation staff who say they feel overwhelmed, with hundreds of reports of child safety issues reportedly flooding in every day.
</p>
<p>
The report alleges that Roblox is putting growth over player safety, as the company pushes towards an eye-opening target of reaching a billion daily users (Roblox currently has around 100 million today).
</p>
<p>
Responding within the report, Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman declined to comment on specific cases, but said that safety and civility were "foundational". 
</p>
<p>
"Tens of millions of people of all ages have a safe and positive experience on Roblox every single day," Kaufman said.

It’s also extremely obviously responding to arguments made by the anti-DEI hordes, while presenting itself as a direct communication with Japanese players alone.</p><p> Ubisoft has previously effectively shot down such bad faith responses, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007">especially with regards to the comments made by Elon Musk</a></span>, so it is peculiar to see the publisher bringing these subjects up again.</p><p>However, the main controversy that’s been raised focuses on the use of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.siliconera.com/ubisoft-apologies-for-assassins-creed-shadows-flag-art-infringement/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.siliconera.com/ubisoft-apologies-for-assassins-creed-shadows-flag-art-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a modern-day reenactment group’s logo in marketing materials</a></span>. Concept art on Ubisoft’s site showed a flag used by Sekigahara Teppo-tai, an infantryman reenactment group, but the publisher had not sought permission to use it. </p><p>At the time of the issue, the group’s “cannon chief” contacted Ubisoft, which responded by removing the piece of art from its site and apologizing. Sekigahara Teppo-tai were still not happy, given their flag will also appear in the game’s collector’s edition’s art book and it’s too late for Ubisoft to stop that. At the time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1810238727064854807&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1810238727064854807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft tweeted</a></span> (in Japanese),</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> The art in question will not be used or distributed any further beyond this date, except for being included in the artbook in the Collector’s Edition.  We deeply apologize for this matter.</p></blockquote><p> However, so primed are those who believe they are saving gaming from the evil poison of progressive pleasantness, that any legitimate fault by <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is leapt upon and blown up to the most enormous scale. It’s this that Ubisoft’s statement seems to be addressing.</p><p>Today’s statement, released in both English and Japanese, feels fairly defensive. It’s  clear that Ubisoft’s development teams went into this game with a huge desire to recreate a period of Japanese history as accurately and respectfully as they could, much as they’ve approached other historical periods, but also wanted to do something off-piste and explore the (entirely real) person Yasuke, a black samurai. (His contested samurai status is, of course, fully dismissed by those acting as if they’ve just completed their post-doc in Japanese history, rather than read a Wikipedia entry).</p><p>Yet, it’s also a video game, not a documentary series on PBS. People can’t actually dive off tall, tall towers into a hay cart and not break all their bones, for instance. Nor can they, apparently, re-enter the past by using magic DNA machines. Despite this, the studio wants to make clear it’s not attempting reality. In the statement Ubisoft says,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>...our intention has never been to present any of our <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, including <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, as factual representations of history, or historical characters.</p></blockquote><p>It’s such a “well, duh” point, but it’s one that unfortunately seems to need making in plain text amidst the ludicrous brouhaha that surrounds the game. So many bad actors are determined to win some imagined battle because one of the main characters is Black (it’s important to note the other main character is a Japanese woman).</p><p>However, the statement goes on to imply that other—entirely unmentioned—issues have been raised by Japanese players, and that the company is going to “continue our efforts” to respond to “constructive criticism.” “All game footage presented so far,” they say, “is in development and the game will keep evolving until launch.” It’s frustrating that these issues aren’t identified.</p><p>The most telling aspect of the response that directly addresses those who continue in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428">the delusion that external companies are controlling the “woke” content of games</a></span>, reads,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We also want to clarify that while we have been consulting with many people throughout the development process, they are in no way responsible for the decisions that are taken by the creative teams in the interests of gameplay and entertainment.</p></blockquote><p>It goes on to add the publisher’s wish that everyone stop harassing such groups.</p><figure id="" data-id="a634fa84035c9892bada3165c662f028" data-recommend-id="image://a634fa84035c9892bada3165c662f028" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The assassin stares across snowy Feudal Japan as the sun sets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The assassin stares across snowy Feudal Japan as the sun sets." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a634fa84035c9892bada3165c662f028" data-recommend-id="image://a634fa84035c9892bada3165c662f028" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The assassin stares across snowy Feudal Japan as the sun sets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The final part of the statement reads:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The representation of Yasuke in our game is an illustration of [creative license]. His unique and mysterious life made him an ideal candidate to tell an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> story with the setting of Feudal Japan as a backdrop.</p><p>While Yasuke is depicted as a samurai in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, we acknowledge that this is a matter of debate and discussion. We have woven carefully into our narrative and with our other lead character, the Japanese shinobi Naoe, who is equally important in the game, our dual protagonists provide players with different gameplay styles.</p></blockquote><p>Lots of people want to see themselves represented as the main character of a video game. There are rather a lot of games that feature white men in this role, and indeed a fair few with Japanese men as the lead. This one, as it happens, features a Black dude and a Japanese woman. People can choose to buy the game or not based on this knowledge. It perhaps doesn’t help when publishers give oxygen to those who fail to grasp this simple concept by issuing forelock-tugging statements that attempt to address the bad-faith arguments such people raise.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Eventually, these releases slowed down, at least in part because they were causing numerous problems for the community.

That begins with the reintroduction of the Impaler, a Terminid enemy type that burrows in the ground and unleashes large, ferocious tentacles to fight players. According to <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s design director Miklas Malmborg, the Impalers are meant to “cut off your escape route” with their large tentacles, at which point you can reroute or stay and fight. Fans actually began theorizing that the Impalers were on their way to <em>Helldivers 2 </em>months ago, after a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cie618/a_real_what_now/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cie618/a_real_what_now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post mentioned tentacles a few times</a></span> and seemed to show off at least <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-warbond-battle-pass-weapon-bad-1851467213&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-warbond-battle-pass-weapon-bad-1851467213">one new weapon specifically meant to combat them</a></span>.</p><p>There are even more enemies, too. Terminids will also be getting a new variant of the Charger that rocks a bunch of noxious spores on its carapace and is followed by a fog effect. Expect to see these things pop out of nowhere every now and then, folks. Automatons, the brutal robot horde that <em>Helldivers 2 </em>players are also combatting in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing Second Galactic War</a></span>, are also getting some upgrades. Basic foot soldiers seem to be getting a jump pack upgrade, but the biggest incoming threat on that front are new rocket-launching tanks. From afar, you can see them unleashing volleys into the sky to come back down on your head; otherwise, they’ll be firing right at you.<br></p><p>These updates to the enemy forces are being accompanied by a whole new difficulty level. While Arrowhead didn’t go into too much detail about what to expect on difficulty 10, it’s probably safe to assume that it’ll be a nightmare, especially if these new units are a part of things.</p><p>Mission variety is also being spruced up in the Escalation of Freedom update. Arrowhead most heavily teased a new mission type about the retrieval of a Terminid larva, which goes into a case on a player’s back and then must be escorted back to extraction. To make things difficult, the larva will cry, which can be heard by the bigger Terminids, who will proceed to swarm squads. Additionally, and perhaps most exciting to me personally, there will now be bigger enemy outposts to take out. Arrowhead’s CEO Johan Pilestedt referred to these things as fortresses and goddamn, do they kind of look like it.</p><p>These encampments have always been randomly generated and placed around the map, but they were hardly an issue due to their small size. Throwing the right kind of stratagem (deployable weapons and abilities like orbital strikes) into one would wipe it off the map, and eventually we even got weapons that were really excellent about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-r-36-erupter-best-gun-premium-warbond-1851419855&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-r-36-erupter-best-gun-premium-warbond-1851419855">taking out even the biggest bug nests</a></span> in a matter of seconds. These much larger outposts seem like they’ll present far more of a challenge, whether due to their increased scope, the new enemies bound to populate them, or the sheer density of foes we should likely escape, especially on the new difficulty.</p><p>The additions simply don’t stop there, either. There will be a new version of the swamp environment because Arrowhead wanted to “spook it up.” It appears to tout a darker sky with the occasional crack of lightning, and the whole thing really does look a fuckton moodier than before. There will also be new environmental hazards and reworks of existing ones, like the Acid Storm, which now applies a debuff to both players and enemies instead of just limiting visibility.</p><p>There will even be some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quality-of-life fixes in the new update</a></span> that players will likely appreciate. Social menus are being improved to make it easier to join friends, and kicking is being retooled to stop griefing players as much. Kicked players will now become the host of their own session immediately after being given the boot, and they will be able to pick up any loot from the last match.</p><p>Elsewhere, the galactic war is still in full swing, and while the studio teases <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-black-hole-meridia-major-order-1851515722&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-black-hole-meridia-major-order-1851515722">developments for the story</a></span>, including mention of Terminid migration patterns and “irregular readings” of their spores in sectors of the galaxy, it stops short of giving away anything major. In fact, the trailer ends with various members of the studio doubling down on secrecy and outright declaring that they haven’t shared everything new that’s coming. Fine, keep your secrets.</p><p>As far as I’m concerned, this major update marks the beginning of a new kind of season for <em>Helldivers 2, </em>as well as a new cadence for releases. Seeing Arrowhead begin to take its time to properly stew on some ideas and mechanics is a relief after they released new content at an alarming clip in <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s early months, and it seems to be going over well with fans. Updates began to get consolidated into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-patch-buff-stratagems-1851540317&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-patch-buff-stratagems-1851540317">more impactful patches</a></span> that didn’t break the game as much, and after an especially turbulent period following the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071">PSN login debacle</a></span>, fans appreciated the stability, as well as the ability to just keep up with their new favorite game.</p><p>I wouldn’t mind if we moved to a model where we get one of these major updates every few months over the past haphazard schedule. As impressive as it was, <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s early content releases and surprises always seemed untenable, and this new update feels a hell of a lot more healthy for everyone involved. Moreover, slapping a date on a bunch of new content has me genuinely excited to jump back in when <em>Helldivers 2 </em>receives its first major update in just two weeks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new official <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc/news/2024-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, EA revealed a full 2024 roadmap for EA Sports WRC, confirming a new expansion is coming October 2024 and other key details.</p>



<p>October’s Season Expansion will include “new locations, rally stages, high-performance vehicles, liveries and more.” The devs add they will reveal the complete details about the expansion “in the coming months.”</p>



<p>It also announced that two additional DLC packs will follow. The first will release in Winter 2024, while the second is currently slated for Spring 2025. Among other things, the DLC packs will feature new cars, rally stages, and moments.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Today’s 2024 roadmap for WRC also confirms the Season 6 Rally Pass will launch on July 30 with new liveries, suits, and helmets. </p>



<p>The new Rally Pass will be free for all players, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wrc-moments-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the moments feature</a> will return. Fans can also unlock liveries outside the WRC Rally1 class. Further, it will overhaul the rewards system, allowing players to customize drivers with complete cosmetic sets rather than unlocking them piece by piece.</p>



<p>In addition to the roadmap, today’s blog gave fans an update about WRC eSports. EA confirmed it is “still in development” and coming soon. The devs are “almost ready” to share details about official competitions.</p>



<p>EA Sports WRC first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-wrc-releases-november-3-features-car-builder-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in November 2023</a>, and is available now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>

                <p>EA Sports College Football 25 just launched on July 19, but the long-awaited game is already getting a <strong>gigantic $30 discount</strong>. The deal is available at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%2F%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.qvc.com%2Fea-college-football-25---xbox-series-x%2528ships-719%2529.product.E321990.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-ea-sports-college-football-25-for-only-40-right-now-on-xbox%2F1100-6525224%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">QVC</a>--as new members can save $30 on their first purchase when using code HELLO30 at checkout. That lets you pick up the hit game for just $40.</p><p>Cashing in on the offer is simple. Add the game to your cart (only the Xbox version is eligible), enter your email address, fill out your shipping info, and then input the <strong>HELLO30</strong> promo code before finalizing your purchase. If this is your first time shopping with QVC, that will automatically discount your order by $30.</p><p>Keep in mind you'll still need to pay for shipping, though this remains one of the cheapest ways to add the game to your library.</p><p>There's a good chance the game will sell out before the promotion ends on July 31, so be sure to swing by QVC and cash in while you can. If you do miss out on the $30 discount, Sam's Club is offering both the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D38733%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fea-sports-college-football-25-playstation-5%2FP990348433&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-ea-sports-college-football-25-for-only-40-right-now-on-xbox%2F1100-6525224%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D38733%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fea-sports-college-football-25-xsx%2FP990348434&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-ea-sports-college-football-25-for-only-40-right-now-on-xbox%2F1100-6525224%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox</a> versions of College Football 25 for just $62.98 (down from $70).
