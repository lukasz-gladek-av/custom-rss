			<p><span>Despite burgeoning budgets and development teams growing to the dozens, if not hundreds, the AA gaming space is something where it’s rare to see a developer thrive. MercurySteam has been crafting up a variety of third-person adventure titles over the years, and we recently went hands-on with their latest adventure, slated to release in just two months. <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blades of Fire</a> is one of those titles that might sound average on paper but certainly holds its own with the right tempering.</span></p>
<p><span>After a brief backstory introducing the world of Blades of Fire, from the world once ruled by mighty giants known as The Forgers to an evil Queen whose magic can turn steel into stone, the lore of iron and blood runs deep through this adventure’s DNA. Players pick up the hammer of Aran de Lira, a commander’s son and subsequent blacksmith whose character designs can only be described as a down-on-his-luck Gabriel Belmont. After a brief introduction, Blades of Fire introduces the plucky sidekick Adso and an abbot whose screen time lasts a mere couple of sentences before his life is cut short, yet serves as the catalyst to send this duo on an adventure to slay the merciless Queen. It’s just enough to set the mood before Aran de Lira and his new travel buddy venture out, accompanied by a travel montage and a brief tutorial on weapon crafting.</span></p>
<p><span>Weapon crafting seems to be the main hook to Blades of Fire, setting it apart from other character action titles. By venturing back to The Forge between worlds, players can first pick out a learned recipe and put it together with the various ores and woods that have been wicked up during the journey; naturally, I only had access to the very bottom tier of materials given that I was playing from a fresh save file. Once all the materials are acquired and distributed, a separate mini-game plays out where the player has to hammer out any impurities and even out the thickness of metal to match the shape of the blade.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s a strange system where I had to select a portion of the blade on a sliding scale and then slide the intensity up and down to impact not just that particular section of the blade but also by raising and lowering the surrounding regions. It was not a system that led itself to being too intuitive to crafting a perfectly even blade and I spent too much time just trying to even out the peaks and trying to come as close as I could to the intended shape of the blade. Initially, this doesn’t seem to do much for the blade beyond raising its core stats like damage and durability, but there were other mechanics on offer, such as changing the type and material of the handle or additional flourishes and accessories to the weapon. The Forge itself feels like the main source of progression throughout Aran de Lira’s journey and the ability to customize every minute stat to a particular weapon might end to some interesting builds for crafting.</span></p>
<p><span>Blades of Fire also features an interesting combat system where attacks are done across all four face buttons and determine where Aran’s strikes will land. You don’t often see games that map body parts to a specific button, so it took some time to get used to aiming for an enemy’s left arm versus its right if it happened to be less armored in that location. Aran can wield two separate blades in combat and swap between the two. Each weapon can deal damage between slashing, blunt and piercing attacks, with some offering up multiple damage types. There’s an obvious effectiveness system at play where different body parts on an enemy will glow in colors from red to green that show how effectively a particular weapon or damage type works. </span></p>
<p><span>As much as players might want to forge an unstoppable sword and carry it through the adventure, the weapon's effectiveness coupled with a durability system for every weapon means that routine trips to The Forge will be required. As is typical of most action RPGs these days, combat is driven through a stamina system that dwindles down quickly through dodges and repeated attacks. It does recover on its own, but Aran de Lira can hold down L2 and go into a defensive position and recover at a faster rate.</span></p>

<p><span>MercurySteam’s strange AA blacksmithing adventure wasn’t on my radar before going to GDC after missing the initial preview event, but after going hands-on for an hour or so, I was pleasantly surprised with their latest unique IP. It’s just unique enough with the strong emphasis on forging and reforging that gives this action adventure a hook that I haven’t seen done before to this extent. The actual story itself could be a standard fantasy slop, and I’d still be on board for crafting a massive war hammer and just playing out my barbarian fantasies when Blades of Fire launches on May 22nd across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and the Epic Games Store.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-stats<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed some fun statistics for the recent&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>network test, in which those lucky enough to be invited got a glimpse of what can be expected from the game's final release later this year.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1905622167158432218" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, Bandai Namco shared what it called its "Numbers from the Night", and it turns out that across the network test as a whole, players slaughtered the Gladius, Beast of Night boss 58,615 times. That's a lot of dead Nightlords.</p>

<p>Spectral Hawks, the ghostly birds used to ferry players across&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s map, were summoned 427,533 times across the network test, while 23.6 million recovery attacks were used to help downed players get back on their feet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-stats-hawk.jpg?itok=7Iz2zJVv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-stats-hawk.jpg?itok=Iruk7NEt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hundreds of thousands of these little ghostly birbs were summoned during&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s network test.</figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s minibosses, players killed almost 200,000 Golden Hippopotamuses (Hippopotami?), almost 165,000 Flame Chariots, and just over 150,000 Fire Monks.</p>

<p>Almost 150,000 Flying Dragons of the Hills were killed, and almost 100,000 Royal Knights met their ends at the hands of enterprising warriors. If you think you're going to struggle in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, let these numbers give you some solace.</p>

<p>On the other hand, almost 38 billion (!) runes were lost by players cumulatively over the course of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s network test. I like to imagine that 37 billion of those were just one very, very unlucky player.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's an upcoming action RPG spinoff of FromSoftware and Bandai Namco's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a> open-world Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and it represents the developer's first major spinoff for one of its properties.</p>




<p><em>Nightreign</em>'s core gameplay loop sees you and two other players (or just you, but not you and one other) descending onto a map in order to loot it, kill its bosses for XP, and grow strong enough to battle the Nightlord at the end of a three-day period.</p>

<p>The game will feature not only enemies from&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, but also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed" rel="nofollow">foes featured in FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>series</a>, including the likes of the first game's Centipede Demon,&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2</em>'s The Duke's Dear Freja, and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>'s The Nameless King.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">on May 30th</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign/9PJ22QNVCZ3G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

It feels like the first genuinely adult-focused project within the MCU, and its shocking brutality is all the more surprising for being created by Disney. (While <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> had gore and naughty words, it’s hard to really credit the silly movie with being “adult.”) It’s not just <em>Born Again</em>’s visceral combat and ferocious language but also its thematic concerns as the inexorable pull of violence condemns its leads, all delivered with whip-smart writing and meticulous subtlety. But one thing it <em>isn’t</em> is an allegory for the re-rise of Donald Trump.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>(Note on spoilers: I’ve deliberately written this not to spoil any significant story beats in the show, including the widely discussed major events from the first episode, but I obviously have to cover generalities.)</p><p><em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> (<em>DBA</em>) is now six episodes into its run of nine, Disney+ adding two new episodes this week, and while it’s fair to say it’s suffering from that perennial Marvel TV issue of trying to stretch too little story across its run, it’s utterly compelling television.</p><p>As lawyer Matt Murdock aka Daredevil, Charlie Cox has developed his performance from the earlier Netflix seasons to something far subtler, exuding this extraordinarily purposeful quietness, the composure that allows his superheroic fighting abilities to be channeled into his speech. Whether convincing a jury in court or calmly establishing authority during a bank robbery, he neither performatively whispers nor shouts, but instead maintains a timbre that’s just quiet enough that people are forced to listen. It’s spellbinding.</p><p>Meanwhile, human chameleon Vincent D’Onofrio returns to the role of Wilson Fisk, aka Kingpin, with a similarly more moderate tone, without losing any of the power or fear that he commands. Fisk, who was seriously injured in sibling MCU TV show <em>Hawkeye</em>, returns to New York to attempt to pivot to politics, at the same time learning that his marriage is in serious trouble, and his control over the city’s crime is in tatters. Everything that stabilizes him, gives him the certainty of power he requires, is threatened, and yet D’Onofrio and the creative team behind the show have the wisdom to underplay this magnificently. We know he’s quiet-quiet-quiet before <em>exploding</em>, that’s his nature, but this time the rumbling feels so much more unnerving, and the contained explosions so much darker.</p><p>One of the core plots of the first season of <em>DBA</em> is Fisk becoming the mayor of New York, and the sometimes comic, sometimes abhorrent conflicts this raises for a man more used to performing his corruption and violence in the open. This known criminal, this man people know was Kingpin, takes a populist position in a politically fraught city to gain political power, but then realizes his victory brings with it a requirement to perform the expected role. And in this, many have reasonably leapt to draw the obvious similarity between this and Donald Trump’s being president. A known criminal who has been openly corrupt for decades gaining political power. It seems clear.</p><p>As a result, multiple reviews and opinion pieces have been written drawing out the common themes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2025/03/daredevil-born-again-review-1236309328/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/daredevil-born-again-review-1236309328/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many praising Disney’s boldness</a></span> in addressing this face on, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://fandomwire.com/an-absolute-trump-analogy-daredevil-born-again-isnt-breaking-any-new-ground-with-kingpin-and-the-schtick-is-now-getting-boring/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://fandomwire.com/an-absolute-trump-analogy-daredevil-born-again-isnt-breaking-any-new-ground-with-kingpin-and-the-schtick-is-now-getting-boring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">others condemning it for being too easy</a></span>. But, while it absolutely had to be on the minds of the writers and producers, I’m not at all convinced that there was any desire for this text to be a piece of commentary or satire on this matter. It falls down in such a significant way that, if it were intentional commentary, would suggest an ignorance on the part of the creators that isn’t evidenced anywhere else in the show: Fisk isn’t an idiot.</p><figure id="" data-id="5af5741b15cd278cd60256f98f69c163" data-recommend-id="image://5af5741b15cd278cd60256f98f69c163" data-format="jpg" data-width="1572" data-height="885" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fisk in his suit, sat in a chair, looking quizzically to the side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fisk in his suit, sat in a chair, looking quizzically to the side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney+ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5af5741b15cd278cd60256f98f69c163" data-recommend-id="image://5af5741b15cd278cd60256f98f69c163" data-format="jpg" data-width="1572" data-height="885" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fisk in his suit, sat in a chair, looking quizzically to the side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s worth noting immediately that <em>Daredevil: Born Again </em>showrunner Dario Scardapane has already denied the allegory, albeit for the somewhat tenuous reason that the script was already written and the show mostly filmed “long before” 2024. (Those with long memories will remember Trump was president once before.) In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kr85lr7270&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kr85lr7270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a video interview with <em>IGN</em></a></span> (that <em>is</em> packed with spoilers), Scardapane explains that Fisk’s ability to win an election despite his widely known criminal past is largely to do with New York’s turning on superheroes, and Fisk’s figurehead position as a person of power promising to stand against them. If anything, it was his legitimacy as a dangerous man of enormously cunning influence that gave him the edge. And those really aren’t words that sensibly apply to Trump.</p><p>While I am skeptical of Scardapane’s claims that he didn’t consider Trump’s original rise to power <em>at all</em>, instead saying it was simply the continuation of a plot written by others in 2016, I do genuinely believe that he’s smart enough  to know a person as intelligent and conniving as Fisk couldn’t be a meaningful allegory, <em>and</em> smart enough not to say that in an interview.</p><p>But without the words of the author, it’s plain to see. <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> is a series about two men desperately fighting not to put their masks back on. That’s the core of everything that happens, every strand of plot we see. It is a show about two addicts doing everything they can to overcome their urges, while the world around them is doing everything <em>it</em> can to force them back down. Both are desperately clever men, blessed with everything they need to succeed in their respective fields, and yet beholden to an alter-ego that not only affords them shortcuts to all their goals, but satisfies a dark, awful bloodlust that lies within them.</p><p>Trump is just an idiot. I don’t say that to be “controversial” or because I think I’m making some exciting and provocative claim. It’s just dully and demonstrably true. He’s a stupid man for whom the storms converged, driven by populism on an instinctive, lizard-brained level, able to use his ill-gotten wealth to let him ride a wave of (woefully ironic) anti-authority milieu at the same time as the international Overton window lurched violently to the right.</p><p>Trump is a man who thinks that Ukraine sits on a trove of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/28/trump-raw-earth-deal-ukraine-zelenskyy/80856299007/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/28/trump-raw-earth-deal-ukraine-zelenskyy/80856299007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raw earth</a></span>,” and believes that human bodies <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/05/08/how-trump-could-get-fired&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/05/08/how-trump-could-get-fired" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">begin life with a fixed reserve of energy</a></span>.

The difference is, one is being mendacious and manipulative, while the other just says stuff out loud and then latches on to the comments that get the loudest cheers. Fisk recognizes that following the atrocities that have visited New York since the advent of superheroes, he can exploit the anti-hero rhetoric to his own ends, given his own self-motivated reasons to have those who might stop his crime eliminated. Trump recognizes that his base cheers louder when he says he’s against abortion rather than for it, so switches to that view accordingly. One is directive, one is reactive. One is smart, one is dumb.</p><p>As such, reading <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> as a satirical reaction to Trump’s presidency relies on assuming the creative team behind the show are also stupid, too stupid to notice any of the above. And they’re clearly not! And that’s largely demonstrated in just how little of the program is occupied by exploring the means by which Fisk was able to become mayor. <em>DBA</em> is far more fixated on far more interesting things, most especially how Fisk can suppress his alter-ego in order to achieve his wider aims—something that makes the reveal at the end of episode five so much more interesting than simply, “Oh, what a scamp!” Instead, it demonstrates the externalizing of his basest needs, <em>literally</em> taking prisoner his all-consuming need for harm and vengeance. If a Trump allegory were desired, he’d instead just be using his spare time&nbsp;looking around going “Doy doy” and watching TV.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/gran-turismo-7-gets-an-npc-upgrade-with-improved-gt-sophy-ai/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>GT Sophy can now race at 19 tracks, up from the nine <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/almost-unbeatable-ai-is-now-a-permanent-feature-of-gran-turismo-7/">that were introduced</a> in November 2023. The AI agent is an alternative to the regular, dumber AI in the game's quick race mode, with easy, medium, and hard settings. But now, at those same tracks, you can also create custom races using GT Sophy, meaning you're no longer limited to just two or three laps. You can enable things like damage, fuel consumption and tire wear, and penalties, and you can have some control over the cars you race against.</p>


<p>Unlike the time-limited demo, the hardest setting is no longer alien-beating. As a <em>GT7</em> player, I'm slowing with age, and I find the hard setting to be that—hard, but beatable. (I suspect but need to confirm that the game tailors the hardest setting to your ability based on your results, as, when I create a custom race on hard, only seven of the nine progress bars are filled, and in the screenshot above, only five bars are filled.)</p>
<p>Having realistic competition has always been one of the tougher challenges for a racing game, and one that the <em>GT</em> franchise was never particularly great at during previous console generations. This latest version of GT Sophy does feel different to race against: The AI is opportunistic and aggressive but also provokable into mistakes. If only the developer would add it to more versions of the in-game Nürburgring.</p>

James does the silly pictures and the music and Will does all the work (on the computer). We write everything together and voice a couple of characters each, too.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/pentiment-director-explains-how-going-all-in-on-fonts-helped-elevate-the-medieval-detective-rpg-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Pentiment director explains how going all-in on fonts helped elevate the medieval Detective RPG.</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Will studied game design at Uni whereas James comes from an animation background. Really, neither of us have professional experience in the industry; we just got together one weekend and decided to make something fun. It has been the longest weekend of our lives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thank Goodness You're Here</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was more a case of slowly arriving at it. The original 'next game' idea we had after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Good Time Garden</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was very different and didn't have a central player character and or specific location, being more focused on a visual style and loose concepts we wanted to explore. When we sat down to 'design' it, the characters naturally had our tone of voice (and accents), so the whole thing shifted gradually towards being set in a Northern English town and having a focus on the quirks and colloquialisms of that place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We used Unity for the engine, Photoshop for the pictures, and Fmod for the noises.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The town of Barnsworth is filled with all sorts of wild, wacky people who have things for you to do (or at least promise some sort of silly interaction). What challenges did you face in creating an entire city crammed full of silly things to do and funny people to meet?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/why-your-next-game-needs-a-babygirl" target="_self" data-discover="true">Why your next game needs a babygirl</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To be honest, the most difficult part is deciding how you actually interact with the characters. Because the player character serves as a kind of straight man for the comedy, it was difficult to know when their interactions with the townsfolk felt too involved. Also, because of the fairly flat visual presentation, it was tough to signal to the player who and what is important in a scene at any given moment. I think we circumnavigated this issue by making the whole thing a sort of send up of fetch quests, which meant we could be fairly hamfisted with 'briefing' the player.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Also, it was hard (and dumb!) to draw that many characters without reusing any assets.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What was your process for creating a character and the funny things that would happen around them? Your process for cramming similar humor into the player's interactions with the world and the things they see in it?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our approach to development is comedy first, and then tease out 'gameplay' from those bits. So, it usually involves us both drinking 4 tins of Stella a piece and screaming obscenities in a room until one of us says something funny (usually Will). We write good stuff in the pub. But then sometimes there might be a particular visual composition we’d like to explore, or a particular setting, and things are built out from there.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/uc-santa-cruz-professor-roleplays-gig-economy-publisher-negotiation-and-layoffs-with-game-design-students" target="_self" data-discover="true">UC Santa Cruz professor roleplays gig economy, publisher negotiation, and layoffs with game design students</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into the game's art style? What drew you to this animated, playful style? How did you create an art style that seems designed to enhance the humor of the game? That also made some of the more unsettling or gross elements just feel light and fun?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The artwork is just James’ style so it didn’t go through a ton of development because it was already developed. In many ways, the game serves the art style rather than the other way around. It would be a very different, probably more restrictive, experience if everything was written up top and then an artist came in and brought it to life.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What drew you to have the slap/smack be the main way of interacting with things in the game's world?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was a hangover from our first exploration into games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Good Time Garden</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a short surreal interactive experience we made around our day jobs. We knew we wanted quite a ‘pure’ gameplay experience, (no UI, no dialogue boxes, no complicated control scheme), and, as we knew there wouldn’t be any gameplay in the traditional sense, it made sense to find a non-diegetic interactive button. Slap was the simplest and funniest.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into the music, sound effects, and voices that would further increase the fun and humor? How did you make this game sound fun and appealing with these elements?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the sound, we worked with some lovely folks from A Shell in the Pit, and together we decided that the visual style and tone of voice of the game spoke for themselves, so it was funnier to make the SFX more realistic rather than slapstick. Similarly, the ambience is quite true to life, which hopefully grounds the player a little among the chaos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The music was difficult, if it was too sentimental it undermined the comedy and left some of the scenes feeling a bit too tragic, but if it was too upbeat we were in danger of things feeling corny. Hopefully we found a nice balance. It’s a bit of a blend between old British Music Hall stuff, Brass Bands, and a little Rocksteady.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A great deal of effort must go into the animations and creating so many layered jokes throughout the world. How did you keep this game's scope from spiraling out of control as you created more and more layers to it? How did you keep things focused and keep your capabilities as a team in mind while creating the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This being our first proper project meant we were both dramatically under-qualified, but also stupid enough to think we could deliver, which I suppose we did, albeit 3 years over schedule. But that meant that we didn’t really have a clue what the game was going to look like until right near the end. It meant the game’s scope fluctuated massively throughout development, and it was a real struggle to nail down a coherent story or narrative.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Difficulties arose because the whole thing is functionally a sketch show you can play, but without the luxury of being able to cut to a completely new scene/time/location at a whim. Instead, we had to write a sketch show, and then figure out a way for the viewer to travel between sketches in a consistent, intuitive, but still entertaining, way. Also, the player is part of the sketch show, also the whole thing’s animated, also the player can walk away from the sketches and decide instead to slap a bin basically whenever they want. Nightmare.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Anyway, towards the end of the project we really started to get a handle on what was important and found the balance between bin slapping and bits.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-31-release-date" rel="nofollow">February's Version 3.1</a>,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2, also known as "Through the Petals in the Land of Repose", is set to launch across all platforms on April 9th. HoYoverse is promising "trials of survival and political intrigue" as part of the update's main story.</p>

<p>You'll be traveling to the "forgotten city-state of Styxia" in this update, and while you're there, you'll take on Pollux, a leviathan who slumbers in the River of Souls. Pollux has some pretty nasty HP manipulation attacks, so you'll have to be on your A-game.</p>

The first, Castorice, is a Remembrance-path character who can sync up with her Netherwing dragon for big damage, although the dragon sacrifices its own HP to use its ultimate attack.</p>

<p>Your second 5-star character in Version 3.2 is Anaxa, an Erudition character who can apply Weaknesses to enemies and boost his damage using his Qualitative Disclosure ability.</p>

<p>The first half of Version 3.2 will also see the return of Fugue, Jiaoqiu, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-acheron-raiden-shogun" rel="nofollow">Acheron</a> as rerun banners, while the second half will give you another chance to obtain the wonderfully-named <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-dr-ratio-trailer" rel="nofollow">Dr. Ratio</a> for your team.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.2 isn't all about gloomy city-states and frantic combat, though; you can also kick back and enjoy the new Seal Slammers minigame, which allows you to compete against your allies "in chaotic seal-based collisions". Finally.</p>




<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PS5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 3.2, also known as "Through the Petals in the Land of Repose", arrives on April 9th.</p>

Its new laptop GPUs, led by the flagship RTX 5090, may be on a similarly modest trajectory, but with one added benefit for laptop gamers: efficiency.</p><p>I’ve been testing the RTX 5090 laptop GPU in Razer’s new Blade 16 laptop, which Nvidia is using as a showcase for its top-tier mobile card. My time with it has been more limited than I’d hoped, since my first review unit exhibited some strange graphical anomalies and was prone to blue-screen crashes during basic productivity tasks. Nvidia sent me a replacement, but I’ve had less than two days with it as of press time. From what I’ve seen so far, it is indeed a little faster than the mobile 4090, but like the desktop 50-series cards, its biggest improvements are in DLSS and Multi Frame Generation, rather than raw performance.</p><p>The new mobile <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Flaptops%2F50-series%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DSpecs-%2CGEFORCE%2520RTX%25205090%2520LAPTOP%2520GPU%2C-GEFORCE%2520RTX%25205080" rel="sponsored">RTX 5090</a> has 24GB of GDDR7 VRAM instead of the 16GB of GDDR6 found on the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Flaptops%2Fcompare%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DGeForce%2520RTX%25204090%2520Laptop%2520GPU" rel="sponsored">4090</a>. It’s also got more powerful Tensor cores, slightly more CUDA cores, and an extra hardware video encoder for better livestreaming and video exports, but the same 175W TDP.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>We’ll have more to say about the laptop housing this new GPU soon.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The 5090’s specs translate to small gains over the 4090 in synthetic benchmarks, such as a 13 percent higher Geekbench GPU score and a 14 percent higher score in 3DMark’s standard Time Spy test at 2560 x 1440 resolution.</p><p>To test the 5090’s uplift in actual games, I ran an array of benchmarks using <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> — at the native 2560 x 1600 of both Blade 16s and at 4K on an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24034953/ces-2024-verge-awards-best-tv-laptop-monitor-gaming-car#:~:text=Best%20monitor-,Alienware%20AW3225QF,-Dell%E2%80%99s%20Alienware%20AW3225QF">Alienware AW3225QF</a> monitor. The biggest difference I saw was in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at 2.5K resolution and Ultra settings without DLSS, frame generation, or ray tracing enabled. There, the 5090 was 24 percent faster than the 4090. That sounds great, but once you enable ray tracing and DLSS 4 (something most people would likely do on either of these laptops), it narrows to a delta of just 5 percent. When you enable 2x frame generation, the 5090 is 14 percent faster than the 4090, and going all out with 4x Multi Frame Gen more than doubles what the 4090 can do at 2x frame gen. If you’re playing at 4K, the 5090 still wins, but the gap narrows to within single digits.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Benchmark</h3></th><th><h3>Blade 16 RTX 4090 average fps @ 4K</h3></th><th><h3>Blade 16 RTX 5090 average fps @ 4K</h3></th><th><h3>Blade 16 RTX 4090 average fps @ 2.5K</h3></th><th><h3>Blade 16 RTX 5090 average fps @ 2.5K</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong TSR</td><td>26</td><td>28</td><td>45</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong FSR</td><td>41</td><td>43</td><td>62</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong FSR Frame Gen</td><td>35</td><td>39</td><td>54</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong DLSS</td><td>46</td><td>48</td><td>68</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong DLSS Frame Gen</td><td>66</td><td>70</td><td>104</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra</td><td>41</td><td>48</td><td>74</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; FSR 3.1 Quality</td><td>40</td><td>40</td><td>63</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT FSR Frame Gen</td><td>61</td><td>70</td><td>118</td><td>124</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; DLSS quality</td><td>39</td><td>40</td><td>64</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; DLSS Frame Gen x2</td><td>67</td><td>70</td><td>103</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; DLSS Frame Gen x4</td><td>N/A</td><td>123</td><td>N/A</td><td>209</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra RT no DLSS</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>21</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra &amp; DLSS Quality</td><td>23</td><td>25</td><td>39</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra RT &amp; DLSS 4 Quality Frame Gen x2</td><td>43</td><td>45</td><td>67</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra RT &amp; DLSS 4 Quality Frame Gen x4</td><td>N/A</td><td>83</td><td>N/A</td><td>147</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, on the other hand, is a little less forgiving. In this graphically demanding Souls-adjacent RPG, the 5090 is only a few percent faster than the 4090. The highest average the 5090 could muster was 111fps at 2.5K with DLSS and standard frame generation, with the 4090 wasn’t far behind at 104. If <em>Wukong</em> supported Multi Frame Generation, the 5090 could no doubt separate itself further, but that would likely <a href="https://youtu.be/xpzufsxtZpA?si=09GBCKtpAafpCCRZ&amp;t=668">add a couple extra milliseconds of latency</a>. Most people will never notice or care about that, but some players may feel any latency added to their pinpoint dodge-roll timing is a nonstarter.</p><p>Like the 50-series desktop cards, the 5090 laptop GPU looks its best in games that support DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. Over 100 games now support Nvidia’s highlight feature, and you can also use override settings in the Nvidia app to force it in unsupported games. </p><p>Frame generation, which both Nvidia and AMD offer, uses AI models to generate extra frames and insert them between traditionally rendered frames. This gives the appearance of smoother gameplay but doesn’t improve input latency — and actually increases it slightly. AMD and previous Nvidia cards can do 2x frame generation; the 50 series can do up to 4x. There’s an ongoing debate in the world of PC gaming about these “fake frames” — some folks are perfectly content with AI upscaling and generated frames, and others view it as a band-aid solution with too many compromises to image quality and game feel. I think it depends on your personal experience, what kinds of games you like to play and what you’re used to playing them on, and even whether you have an eye (or even a care) for this stuff. It can be great for the right games, and it may even make more sense on a 16-inch laptop screen than a jumbo 4K monitor right in front of your face. </p><p>I forced Multi Frame Generation on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/631744/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>, and I was pleasantly surprised with its performance and buttery smoothness on ultra settings. <em>Shadows </em>is maybe a perfect example of a single-player game where frame generation is a nonissue. It’s got dodge rolling, but it’s not the kind of game that really requires frame-perfect timing. It felt A-okay to me, and boy did feudal Japan look lovely on a 2.5K OLED at an average of 167fps.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Many of those frames may be “fake,” but they sure are pretty.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The obvious games to avoid with frame generation are competitive shooters. While I felt fine playing <em>Marvel Rivals</em> on the 5090 with 4x frame generation reaching nearly 200fps, I was playing pretty casually with a hero that doesn’t require precision accuracy. For something like <em>Valorant </em>or <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, I’d advise against it. But to be fair, those ultra-competitive games typically have a low performance barrier for entry and practically run on a potato.</p><p>One area where the 5090 does seem significantly better so far is power efficiency. In our benchmarks, the new GPU had a lower average wattage, by 20 to 29 percent, than the 4090. That should help improve battery life when playing games away from a power cord.</p><div><h2>GPU power (watts) at 2.5K</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Benchmarks</h3></th><th><h3>Blade 16 RTX 4090 average GPU wattage</h3></th><th><h3>Blade 16 RTX 5090 average GPU wattage</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong TSR</td><td>174</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong FSR</td><td>171</td><td>137</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong FSR Frame Gen</td><td>145</td><td>134</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong DLSS</td><td>170</td><td>135</td></tr><tr><td>Black Myth: Wukong DLSS Frame Gen</td><td>163</td><td>131</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra</td><td>159</td><td>134</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; FSR 3.1 quality</td><td>153</td><td>127</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT FSR Frame Gen</td><td>154</td><td>133</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; DLSS Quality</td><td>154</td><td>126</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; DLSS Frame Gen x2</td><td>162</td><td>130</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra RT &amp; DLSS Frame Gen x4</td><td>N/A</td><td>133</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra RT no DLSS</td><td>169</td><td>131</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra &amp; DLSS quality</td><td>167</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full Ultra RT &amp; DLSS 4 Quality Frame Gen x2</td><td>167</td><td>137</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077 Full UltraA RT &amp; DLSS 4 Quality Frame Gen x4</td><td>N/A</td><td>133</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Lower wattages can also mean lower temperatures, as I was able to play games with the plugged-in laptop on my actual lap and not toast my legs. But this also hinges on an individual laptop’s thermal design and how well it cools — the Blade 16 so far seems to do it well, but it’s also a totally different design than the 2024 model with the 4090 in it. Of course, you’re not going to see the same level of performance when running graphically intensive games on battery power. I’ll have to test this more to see how much of a difference it makes in real-world usage.</p><p>The RTX 5090 is Nvidia’s most powerful and expensive laptop GPU, and you can expect to pay $4,000 or more for a laptop that runs it. The Blade 16 review configuration costs <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-16%2FRZ09-05289EN4-R3U1" rel="sponsored">$4,499.99</a>. It shows some promise for games that support DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation, and maybe for gaming that’s not always tethered to a wall. But if I were shopping right now, I wouldn’t ignore a heavy discount on a laptop with an RTX 4090. (The 4090 desktop supply, on the other hand, has dried up.)</p><p>We’ll continue to test the RTX 5090, as well as the rest of the 50-series mobile GPUs as they appear in new gaming laptop models over the next few weeks and months. I’m looking forward to testing the RTX 5080, in particular, and seeing if that’s the sweet spot for laptop gamers.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <p>Toby Fox's cult RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a> is getting a one-night-only live orchestral concert event to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>The Determination Symphony, as it is known, will take place at London's Eventim Apollo on 22nd June, and act as a celebration of all things Undertale.</p>
<p>Undertale originally made its way into our hearts and minds back in 2015. It tells the story of a child who tumbles into the Underground, a strange world beneath the Earth's surface.</p>

<p>During the concert, patrons will also be able to "fall into the Underground" (although, I assume metaphorically and emotionally here, rather than literally) all while being accompanied by a live orchestra, which will be performing arrangements of the game's soundtrack alongside on-screen gameplay.</p>

<p>For those interested, tickets to The Determination Symphony will be available on Friday 28th March, and can be purchased at <a href="http://www.eventimapollo.com/">www.eventimapollo.com</a>. I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-music-played-at-the-popes-latest-audience">wonder if The Pope will show up</a>?</p>
<p>As for the game, here is what Eurogamer's former editor in chief Martin Robinson said when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-review">he reviewed the PlayStation Vita version of Undertale</a> back in 2017:</p>
<p>"Undertale dances happily in the footsteps of Shigesato Itoi's Mother series, and like those games before it, it's a JRPG that's endlessly playful and inventive."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-desert-console-getting-native-ps5-xss-x-versions-on-june-26-dropping-ps4-xbox-one/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Pearl Abyss announced that Black Desert console will be updated with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-announces-black-desert-console-native-builds-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously confirmed</a> native versions for Sony's PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X consoles on June 26. The community had been waiting a long time; it has been well over four years since those consoles launched, after all. The caveat is that the game won't be playable on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One anymore after that date.</p>
<p>The General Manager <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YlGGwrWCBU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<p><em>Black Desert console was first introduced in 2019 with the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and this month <a href="https://wccftech.com/cross-play-between-playstation-4-and-xbox-one-now-live-in-black-desert-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marked the fifth anniversary of crossplay</a>. In our previous commentary video, we've mentioned that we are preparing for a native gen port with the goal of releasing an update in the first half of this year. We'd like to share that platform certification for both PlayStation 5 and Xbox series versions is progressing as planned. While there is a possibility of some schedule changes depending on the certification status, if all processes are completed smoothly, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series versions will be available on June 26.</em></p>
<p><em>As mentioned previously, the update will be provided at no additional cost while we are excited to bring this update to our community. Following the porting update, Black Desert console will be transitioning to a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series exclusive service. Consequently, gameplay on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One will no longer be available. Rest assured your game data will be safely stored your account information and all entitlements to Black Desert will be fully accessible when you're ready to transition to the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series version of your console.</em></p>
<p><em>We understand that this news may be disappointing to many of you. However, as we mentioned in </em><em>our previous video, despite the ongoing efforts to optimize and update content for older generation consoles, we have reached the point where hardware limitations make it increasingly </em><em>difficult to deliver the latest content smoothly. We kindly ask for your understanding and </em><em>offer our sincerest apologies for this decision that is made with the long-term growth of Black Desert console in mind. </em></p>
<p><em>We believe that the transition to a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series exclusive service will be an important first step in providing a better gaming environment from Black Desert console. </em><em>Performance improvements involve many different factors, so it might be difficult to notice immediate changes in old areas but we will continue working to address the limitations experienced on the older generation consoles. Furthermore, we are planning updates for</em><br>
<em>various content that you have all been waiting for.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/live-action-zelda-movie-gets-march-2027-release-date.1147827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the release date for the upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie, but don't get too excited; its release is a couple of years away yet.</p>

<p>Per an announcement on the new Nintendo Today! app, which was announced (and released) as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">yesterday's Nintendo Direct show</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie will launch around the world on March 26th, 2027.</p>

<p>That date puts the movie's release in the same month as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-4-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">Paramount's&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</em></a>; March is a pretty common month for blockbuster-style movies to be released in, so these two tentpole video game adaptations releasing then makes a lot of sense.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zelda-movie-release-date-link-horse.jpg?itok=2i6awzrx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zelda-movie-release-date-link-horse.jpg?itok=ETg0uIP1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie has an official release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, just because Nintendo has announced a date for the movie, that doesn't mean it won't be delayed or changed later down the line. Still, now you know when you should be clearing your schedule if you're eagerly awaiting the film.</p>

<p>While we don't have a cast or a story outline for the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie yet, we do know that it'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-announces-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-distributed-and-co-financed-by" rel="nofollow">co-produced by Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, alongside Hollywood blockbuster producer Avi Arad, whose name you'll find on movies like&nbsp;Sam Raimi's&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man&nbsp;</em>films.</p>

<p>Additionally, attached to direct the project is&nbsp;<em>The Maze Runner</em>'s Wes Ball, who also directed and produced 2024's&nbsp;<em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>.</p>

<p>It's likely that we'll hear more about what's coming for the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie in the months ahead, but Nintendo no doubt won't feel the need to rush; after all, it's got a major console launch to take care of in the next few months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-movie.jpg?itok=WxqjCGIm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-movie.jpg?itok=D0J14GfS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo will likely take care of the Switch 2's launch before more&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie details are revealed.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're unaware, Nintendo is gearing up to release the Switch 2, which will probably be launching sometime in summer. A Nintendo Direct dedicated to the console is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">due to air next week</a>.</p>

<p>It's likely the company will be looking to focus on that launch before more&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie details are revealed, but it looks like if more info is released soon, it'll probably be via the Nintendo Today! app. Stay tuned for more.</p>

			<p><span>The game that changed everything for me on PC.</span></p>
		</div>
	<div>
		<p>My mom loves to tell the story that one of the reasons they were able to start sleeping through the night when I was a few years old was because I would get up in the middle of the night, put a <em>Sesame Street</em> tape in the VHS player, and put myself to bed when it was over. When they were confused about how to use the VHS player, they would inevitably ask their kid for advice.</p><p>This dynamic only escalated over time.</p><p><a href="https://remapradio.com/articles/new-system-old-me/">Rob wrote a piece last week</a> about the ritual he undergoes when buying a new PC, but ritual requires repetition. I’ve owned PCs over the years, but my relationship with PCs is mostly defined by large gaps in-between when I last owned one. It wouldn’t occur to run an old game and see how it runs on the new PC, because that requires me knowing how it originally ran.</p><p>My dad loved to buy new tech, but it was always on <em>me</em> to figure out how it worked while he would stand over my shoulder. We were, for example, one of the first to have a computer in my neighborhood. I can’t tell you what brand the machine was, other than it was a 486 66 machine that ran DOS. (We later owned a Compaq, but I’m fairly sure it was the machine <em>after</em> this?)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Once we had the PC, my dad wanted to buy some software for it. There was a CompUSA near us at the time, but this was a different store. <a href="https://www.cepro.com/audio-video/10-failed-electronic-retailers/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Despite my best attempts to jog my memory</u></a>, I can’t remember it! But when we walked in, there was a massive standee for <em>Doom II: Hell on Earth</em>, and my dad could tell my eyes were drawn to it. For whatever reason, he decided to buy it, too.</p><p>That game was so fucking cool, and was unlike <em>anything</em> I’d played on a console. This was an era where whole genres of games didn’t even exist there. A shooter was like witnessing God for the first time, and I later had a similar revelation when <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> came out.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>At one point, when we upgraded to a new computer, my brother and I did our first "LAN party" and connected the two machines so that we could play </span><i><em>Red Alert </em></i><span>multiplayer.</span></figcaption></figure><p>This was the computer where I figured out how to do line-by-line memory management, so I could play games like <em>Dark Forces</em>. I’d write down the exact order of operations on a sticky note.</p><p>Some years later, Windows 3.1 was available and my dad eventually picked up a copy. I’m sure the installation process was <em>supposed</em> to be straightforward, but Windows 3.1 came out in the early 90s and I was not even 10 years old. The result of one of my first fights with my dad, as we tried to figure out the instruction manual. Bickering and tears later, we’d installed Windows.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">More than a decade has passed since Silent Hill's last mainline entry--not counting Bloober Team's superb remake of Silent Hill 2 in 2024--but at long last, a new chapter in the franchise is on the way in the form of Silent F. A brand-new mainline entry from a studio in Japan comprised of several survival-horror veterans, Silent Hill F will be the first game in the series to skip the nightmarish streets of Maine in the USA for a terrifying trip to Japan. Here's everything we know about Silent Hill F so far.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_Silent_Hill_F_be_released_">When will Silent Hill F be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Preorder_Silent_Hill_F">Preorder Silent Hill F</a></li><li><a href="#Silent_Hill_F_platforms">Silent Hill F platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Silent_Hill_F_dev_team">Silent Hill F dev team</a></li><li><a href="#Silent_Hill_F_trailer_information">Silent Hill F trailer information</a></li><li><a href="#Silent_Hill_F_screenshots">Silent Hill F screenshots</a></li><li><a href="#Silent_Hill_F_story__setting__and_characters">Silent Hill F story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#Silent_Hill_F_gameplay">Silent Hill F gameplay</a></li><li><a href="#Why_is_it_called_Silent_Hill_F_">Why is it called Silent Hill F?</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_Silent_Hill_F_be_released_">When will Silent Hill F be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">There's no solid release date yet for Silent Hill F, but the game is currently available to preorder in both digital and physical formats. Typically, that suggests a release date is near, and we wouldn't be surprised if the game arrives later in 2025.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Preorder_Silent_Hill_F">Preorder Silent Hill F</h2><p dir="ltr">Preorder bonuses or special editions for Silent Hill F have not been revealed yet, but the standard edition of the game is currently available to preorder for $70.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Silent_Hill_F_platforms">Silent Hill F platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">As for platforms, Konami has confirmed that Silent Hill F will launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Unlike the Silent Hill 2 remake, which launched as a timed PlayStation exclusive, no such stipulation has been mentioned yet for Silent Hill F. For now, we'd bet it's coming to all major platforms at once, perhaps with the exception of Switch, which is proving less capable of handling current-gen games as time goes on. We also don't know if it'll be available for Switch 2, but with the console coming out this year, we might be in for a spooky surprise.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Silent_Hill_F_dev_team">Silent Hill F dev team</h2><p dir="ltr">Silent Hill F comes from Neobards Entertainment, a team that has largely been a support studio in the past. The studio has worked on several Capcom games, including Resident Evil 2, 3, 7, and ReVerse, the multiplayer mode tied to Resident Evil Village, as well as titles like Marvel's Avengers and No Straight Roads.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the team has only lent a hand to horror games in its past portfolio, there's reason to believe it's ready to take the next step and lead the development of a major sequel. The game's story will be penned by famed Japanese writer Ryukishi07, the author of the acclaimed When They Cry visual novel series. Additionally, Motoi Okamoto, who previously worked at Nintendo from 1998 to 2007, has been named a producer on the project.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Silent_Hill_F_trailer_information">Silent Hill F

In the video below, which notably does not include imagery taken from the game itself, we see a Japanese village blanketed in fog. Following that, we see what looks like a student standing by a roadside memorial of some kind. As the trailer jumps around between different scenes, it morphs into what may be the Otherworld, a twisted reflection of the safer world the characters in Silent Hill games usually start in.</p><p dir="ltr">As piano music plays and the world rapidly decays, a young woman, seemingly a different one than that who was mourning, runs for her life from an unseen threat. The trailer then cuts to a girl--it's unclear if it's a third one or one of the others shown before--as she moves across still, foggy waters atop a float made of vibrant flowers. The flowers grow from her head and vaguely recall Midsommar's fateful final moments, though it arguably surpasses that grotesque final scene with one of its own: The girl's face peels off her head like a sticker that's no longer adhesive. Yuck.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a long wait for a new look at the game, but at long last, we got a fresh trailer in March 2025. This preview of the game showed off more of the game's Japanese setting, its protagonist, and hinted at some of the monsters that players will encounter along the way.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Silent_Hill_F_screenshots">Silent Hill F screenshots</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467200-silenthillf%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467200" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467200-silenthillf%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467200"></a><figcaption>Silent Hill F's protagonist, Hinako Shimizu</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467200-silenthillf%282%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467201-silenthillf%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467202-silenthillf%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467203-silenthillf%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467204-silenthillf%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467205-silenthillf%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467206-silenthillf%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467207-silenthillf%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467208-silenthillf%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467201,1300-4467202,1300-4467203,1300-4467204,1300-4467205,1300-4467206,1300-4467207,1300-4467208" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467201-silenthillf%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467202-silenthillf%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467203-silenthillf%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467204-silenthillf%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467205-silenthillf%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467206-silenthillf%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467207-silenthillf%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467208-silenthillf%289%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467201-silenthillf%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467202-silenthillf%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467203-silenthillf%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467204-silenthillf%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467205-silenthillf%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467206-silenthillf%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467207-silenthillf%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467208-silenthillf%289%29.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Silent_Hill_F_story__setting__and_characters">Silent Hill F story, setting, and characters</h2><p dir="ltr">So far, what we know about SIlent Hill F is that it takes place in the Japanese town of Ebisugaoka during the 1960s and stars high school student Hinako Shimizu as the protagonist. Everything is fine and dandy in Ebisugaoka--which happens to be based on a real-life town called<a href="https://x.com/sinonomeimori/status/1900378983189143867?" rel="nofollow"> Kanayama in Japan's Gifu Prefecture</a>--until it is covered in a strange mist that introduces monsters and body-warping horror to the streets. The March 2025 trailer showed off some of the terror that Hinako will encounter, as well as the shrines that appear to be safe spaces where you can catch your breath.</p><p dir="ltr">Silent Hill games also deal with psychological trauma, and the trailer hinted at this with a cryptic voiceover about friendship and betrayal. It's also worth noting that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-includes-disclaimer-about-gender-discrimination-and-child-abuse/1100-6530126/"> Silent Hill F will touch on sensitive and potentially upsetting topics</a>, something that Konami has cautioned people about ahead of the game's release. According to the publisher, depictions of gender discrimination, child abuse, bullying, drug-induced hallucinations, torture, and graphic violence will be present in Silent Hill F.</p><p dir="ltr">"This game is set in Japan in the 1960s and contains depictions based on the customs and culture of that time. These depictions do not reflect the opinions or values of the developers or any individuals involved," Konami said. "If you feel uncomfortable at any point while playing, please take a break from playing or speak to someone you trust."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Silent_Hill_F_gameplay">Silent Hill F gameplay</h2><p dir="ltr">We haven't seen any proper gameplay deep dives for Silent Hill F yet, but we do know that the game will feature elements that will be familiar to Silent Hill fans, like survival-horror, puzzles, and even combat--although we're imagining that this will be of the fight-or-flight variety with some of the monsters we've seen so far.</p><p dir="ltr">"Shimizu Hinako was living her life as an ordinary teenager,"<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-cinematic-trailer-brings-small-town-horror-to-japan/1100-6530124/"> the official description for Silent Hill F reads</a>. "That is, until her town is suddenly shrouded in fog and begins to change in a horrific way. Now, she must explore a town she no longer recognizes while solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and doing everything she can to survive--in order to face the ultimate decision that she must make. This is a tale about a beautiful yet terrifying choice."</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to<a href="https://za.ign.com/silent-hill-f/206915/news/silent-hill-transmission-march-2025-everything-announced-and-revealed-for-silent-hill-f" rel="nofollow"> IGN</a>, creature &amp; character designer<a href="https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Kera" rel="nofollow"> Kera</a> also teased monster and location designs that will emphasize a grotesque beauty in the game. "I love the Silent Hill series, and it's been a big influence on me," Kera said. "In particular, I am constantly remembering Silent Hill 2, and the messages on the walls, the music, and the monster designs. So, when it came to Silent Hill F, and bringing the setting to Japan, we had to come up with something that felt just a little different, and I had to really think about how to get that feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">The monster designs were the hardest. I had to consider everything that's come in Silent Hill before, and figure out how to take this game in a different direction, but still be Silent Hill. It might not be the exact same blood-smeared, rusting scenery, but I sincerely hope you'll enjoy our vision and the world we've created."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Why_is_it_called_Silent_Hill_F_">Why is it called Silent Hill F?</h2><p dir="ltr">The weird name given to this project does not appear to be a working title. Instead, it may be a reference to sheet music, as the F, or more accurately, "f," as it's styled in the game's logo, is the symbol for forte, which means loud. Musicians can use this symbol in their sheet music to denote that a section ought to be played loudly. Given the creeping piano music that builds in tempo and volume as the trailer goes on, it may be that the story involves music, or perhaps even stars a musician--maybe the girl mourning in the beginning of the trailer goes to a school for aspiring musicians.</p><p dir="ltr">There's seemingly something musical going on here, though it'll take some time before we can piece it together better.</p>

			<p>Nintendo has announced today that The Legend of Zelda live-action movie will be released in theaters on March 26, 2027, roughly two years from today. The news was posted on Nintendo Today, the brand new app that was unveiled yesterday during the Nintendo Direct. According to the Big N, this smart device app is a daily calendar featuring the latest news, videos, and comics of Nintendo games and characters from select franchises. Nintendo Today is available on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-today/id6736725704" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znsa&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>. Clearly, the delivery of such big news through the app is a way to emphasize its importance in Nintendo communications going forward.</p>
<p>The Zelda live action movie was <a href="https://wccftech.com/live-action-zelda-movie-officially-in-production-nintendo-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> on November 8, 2023. Back then, series creator Shigeru Miyamoto said in a brief message to fans:</p>
<p><em>This is Miyamoto. I have been working on the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda for many years now with Avi Arad-san, who has produced many mega-hit films. I have asked Avi-san to produce this film with me, and we have now officially started the development of the film with Nintendo itself heavily involved in the production. It will take time until its completion, but I hope you look forward to seeing it.</em></p>
<p>Wes Ball, known for directing the Maze Runner trilogy and the upcoming Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, will direct the film. Derek Connolly, who worked on the Jurassic World trilogy, Kong: Skull Island, Pokémon: Detective Pikachu, and Star Wars: Episode IX—The Return of the Jedi, will write the script. The next step will obviously be to find the actors forming the cast. Fans are already wondering who will be cast in the key roles of Link and Zelda herself. Who would you like to see playing these hugely beloved characters? Let us know in the comments!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-fastest-selling</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atelier-yumia-sales-top-300-000-making-it-the-series-fastest-selling-game.1147785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-fastest-selling<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo and Gust have revealed that JRPG&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land&nbsp;</em>has hit a new sales milestone, as well as setting a new record for the series.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/gustatelierpr/status/1905531185713086693" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X (which is in Japanese, so we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia&nbsp;</em>has sold over 300,000 copies worldwide, which makes it the fastest-selling game in the franchise.</p>

<p>That's not bad given that the game has only been on sale for a week, and since it was released in Japan and around the world simultaneously, that figure doesn't include any long-tail Japanese sales either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-combat.jpg?itok=hoCEiSGa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-yumia-sales-300k-combat.jpg?itok=TdqAE6aT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atelier Yumia&nbsp;</em>has hit 300,000 sales since launching last week.</figcaption></figure><p>By way of comparison, it took&nbsp;<em>Atelier Ryza 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-ryza-3-crosses-300k-sales-to-become-fastest-selling-secret-game" rel="nofollow">around a month</a> to achieve the same figure, and while that game is still the fastest-selling&nbsp;<em>Ryza&nbsp;</em>sub-series game, it can't lay claim to being the series' fastest-selling title.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia</em>, it's the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series of JRPGs, which also includes the likes of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Atelier Ryza&nbsp;</em>sub-series, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-global-release-date" rel="nofollow">free-to-play RPG</a>&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana&nbsp;</em>and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian" rel="nofollow">upcoming sequel</a>.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the games combine typical JRPG exploration and combat with a focus on item synthesis using ingredients gathered in the world, and&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia&nbsp;</em>is no different on that front.</p>

<p>Unlike previous games in the series, however,&nbsp;<em>Atelier Yumia&nbsp;</em>is fully open-world; rather than the open-zone environments of prior entries,&nbsp;<em>Yumia&nbsp;</em>allows you to fully and freely explore its map without any loading times to get in your way.</p>




<p><em>Yumia</em>'s success shows that there's still a significant audience out there eager for more&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>games, so you can expect to see more from this series in the future.</p>

<p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3123410/Atelier_Yumia_The_Alchemist_of_Memories__the_Envisioned_Land/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012240" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land/9mzzjj7kgl7q" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-and-the-envisioned-land-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

<p>The Legend of Zelda movie—in collaboration with Nintendo and Sony—has been given a 2027 release date. It’s been a couple of years since the movie’s announcement, and now we finally have a key detail to indicate it’s moving along.</p>



<p>Hooray for Hyrule as Zelda fans can rejoice! The Legend of Zelda is one of the most famous video-game franchises in history—and there’s simply no debate. If we backtrack to Nov. 7, 2023, we can fondly remember <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-is-finally-getting-a-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda movie being announced</a> and sending the gaming community into hysterics. </p>



<p>It’s been fairly quiet on this front for nearly two years. Doubts started to creep in that it wasn’t happening, but you can sheathe your Master Sword for now.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-nintendo-app-reveals-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-2027-release-date">New Nintendo App Reveals The Legend of Zelda Movie 2027 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can Hollywood capture the vibe and feel of Zelda? Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Legend of Zelda Movie is set for a <strong>March 26, 2027</strong>, release date. The news came from a surprising source—the newly launched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-new-mobile-companion-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Today app</a>.</p>



<p>We don’t have a shot from the app itself, but you can see this message from popular X user <a href="https://x.com/Wario64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a> showcasing the announcement. The official screenshot says: “The live-action film of The Legend of Zelda will be released worldwide on March 26, 2027.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>The Legend of Zelda live-action film releasing on March 26, 2027 (via Nintendo Today!)</span></p></article></div>



<p>Nothing else has been revealed for now. We have no indication of the actors or actresses involved, and we’re not sure if this is a brand-new story, or where (or <em>when</em>) it’s set.</p>



<p>But the shock announcement is the perfect way to sell the idea of the Nintendo Today app. It’s all happening on the Zelda front as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/store-listing-says-new-3d-mario-legend-of-zelda-remake-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new remake is rumored</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-the-first-berserker-khazan-have-denuvo-denuvo-status-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The First Berserker Khazan is a Soulslike requiring utmost precision. Any imperfections, frame drops, or performance-related issues can spell disaster. When the subject of Denuvo is brought up alongside The First Berserker Khazan, panic is bound to ensue.</p>



<p>Denuvo is anti-tamper software with the main purpose of preventing vide-game pirating. Developers and publishers use it to stop thieves from illegally downloading games for free. Its intentions are positive, but it can have disastrous consequences for the game in question. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-trophy-list-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is one of 2025’s biggest PC releases, and the Denuvo question has reared its head.</p>



<p>If The First Berserker Khazan uses the software measure, it might be a problem, so let’s find out.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-denuvo-used-in-the-first-berserker-khazan">Is Denuvo Used in The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Now’s not the time for framerate drops. Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The First Berserker Khazan does use Denuvo, as its Steam page clearly states: “Incorporates 3rd-party DRM: Denuvo Anti-tamper.”</strong></p>



<p>If you go to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2680010/The_First_Berserker_Khazan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan’s Steam page</a>, a tab on the right-hand side of the screen shows the Denuvo integration. It doesn’t look like anyone is going to backtrack on this decision either. </p>



<p>The First Berserker Khazan uses Denuvo, meaning players will do well to pirate the action title. On the other hand, it means your gameplay is in danger could be affected.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-denuvo-do-to-the-first-berserker-khazan">What Does Denuvo do to The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<p><strong>Denuvo can cause performance issues, frame-rate stuttering, and various other technological issues in The First Berserker Khazan.</strong></p>



<p>In short, Khazan is one of the worst games to be affected by Denuvo. All it takes is for one for interruption or mishap to throw you out of your rhythm and you watch as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-nerfs-hardest-bosses-in-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardest bosses</a> tear you to pieces.</p>



<p>Make sure your settings are set to enhance performance as best as you can!</p>



<hr>



<p>How do you feel about Denuvo being used in games? Again, DRM means well, but is it worth the impact it can have on gameplay?</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D Remake launches on Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC later this year. The new game features ground-up remakes of the first two Dragon Quest games in one package; and just like 2024's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, they will feature new "HD-2D" visuals, re-recorded soundtracks, updated gameplay, and even new content to flesh out both adventures. While Square Enix hasn't confirmed the release date (or even the final box art), preorders for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F2NZ8LKV,B0F2P6LNLM,B0F2NX9G77&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D Remake</a> are already live at Amazon.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D Remake Preorder Bonus</h2><p dir="ltr">No preorder bonuses have been announced for Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D Remake, but we'll update this section if that changes.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're wondering why Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D Remake is launching a year after the Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, it's because Dragon Quest III is a prequel story that takes place before the first two games, and all three make up what is known as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F2NZ8LKV,B0F2P6LNLM,B0F2NX9G77,B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Erdrick Trilogy."</a> These are some of the few Dragon Quest games with overt connections in their storylines, but while III is a prequel, each game takes place hundreds of years apart, so you don't necessarily have to play III first (the original version released after the first two, after all). Nevertheless, if you're itching to play some classic Dragon Quest and want to experience the trilogy's in-game saga chronologically, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a></strong> is worth picking up--and as luck would have it, you can pick up physical copies on PS5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X for just $50 (was $60).</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that the latest mainline entry in the series, Dragon Quest 11, also calls back to the original trilogy in multiple ways--though we won't spoil the specifics. If you're curious to see how everything connects or feel like playing a more modern take on the Dragon Quest RPG formula, you can grab <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age</a> on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC--and PC players can even grab it for <strong>50% off at Green Man Gaming. </strong></p><p dir="ltr">Several other <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgreenmangaming.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F1219987%2F15105%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3DDragon%2520Quest&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preorders-are-live-at-amazon%2F1100-6530455%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest games are on sale at Green Man Gaming</a>, including <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgreenmangaming.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F1219987%2F15105%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fgames%2Fdragon-quest-builders-pc%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preorders-are-live-at-amazon%2F1100-6530455%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest Builders</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgreenmangaming.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F1219987%2F15105%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fgames%2Fdragon-quest-builders-2-pc%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preorders-are-live-at-amazon%2F1100-6530455%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a>, which take place in alternate timelines that explore the "bad" endings of Dragon Quest 1 and 2, respectively.
