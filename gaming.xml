			<p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lfakfksucs2q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new posts</a> from Video Game Industry Analyst Mat Piscatella, he predicts that Nintendo's next hardware device (which is supposed to be the Nintendo Switch 2) will sell approximately 4.3 million units in the US in 2025, assuming that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be released in the first half of the year. Many were expecting more news to be released last year, but it felt that the audience was still kept in suspense, as we are no closer to knowing the release date of the upcoming console.&nbsp; Despite that, there are tons of leaks coming out about the upcoming console constantly, with some being believable and others being incredibly outlandish.</p>
<p>At the moment, the console doesn't have a set release date, but according to an Italian website, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-launch-on-march-28-says-italian-website/">the Nintendo Switch 2 could launch on March 28</a>. However, all of these rumors come after people <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed/">speculated that it would be announced before the New Year</a>, except that information never came. Whether it will be released in the first half of the year remains to be seen. However, if it does, it means that revenue will be on the rise for Nintendo.</p>
<p>Despite that, Nintendo isn't expected to rank 1st in overall hardware units sold, according to Mat Piscatella. Instead, he believes that the PlayStation 5 will continue to rank 1st in overall hardware units sold in the US during the year. This statistic could very well be possible, especially with the release of the PS5 Pro, with new games getting PS5 Pro enhancements regularly.</p>
<p>If the Switch 2 is released in the first half of the year, Piscatella says that he expects to see hardware constraints for several months after due to a significant early demand surge. This is something that has been seen for all recent console releases, with the PlayStation 5 in particular continuing to suffer from this. With there being hardware constraints have led to prices being raised and the console constantly being out of stock, especially with the consoles ending up in the hands of scalpers, where tons of consoles then resurface on online markets for an extortionate price.</p>
<p>Alongside this, Piscatella gave a sneak peek into the percentage growth in video game spending for the year, saying that he expects low to mid-single-digit percentage growth over the year, helped by Nintendo Next and Grand Theft Auto VI. Despite GTA VI reportedly being released this year, there are many who are now beginning to lose faith in that and feel that it will be delayed until later in the year or even next year.</p>

            <p>
After nine of public beta access, hugely influential colony sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>' roguelike Adventure Mode is getting its full Steam release on 23rd January.
</p>
<p>
Adventure Mode, if you're unfamiliar, offers an alternative way to explore Dwarf Fortress' ludicrously in-depth, procedurally generated worlds - trading the usual colony management for a roguelike RPG, complete with procedural quests, NPCs, and turn-based battles.
</p>
<p>
Dwarf Fortress' Adventure Mode isn't a new thing, of course. It's been available as part of the free (and nearly two decade old) ASCII version for years, but it wasn't included when the game made the jump to Steam as a notably slicker paid release - featuring the likes of sprite-based visuals, a mouse-driven UI, and Steam Workshop compatibility - in 2022.

<p>
That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dwarf-fortress-roguelike-adventure-mode-gets-beta-launch-on-steam">changed last May</a> when developer siblings Zach and Tarn Adams launched a public beta version of Adventure Mode for Dwarf Fortress on Steam. At the time, the duo noted the beta had "some missing bits" seen in the ASCII version - ranging from additional graphics and sounds to butchery, crafting, and trading - that would be implemented prior to its full release.
</p><p>
And now, following nine months of beta access, Adventure Mode's full release is officially set for 23d January. "Thank you to all the urists who participated in the beta and left their helpful feedback," the Adamses wrote in announcement on Steam. "The mode has come a long way since it first launched in beta and we couldn't have done it without your help!"
</p>
<p>
"We are excited to shift focus back to Fortress Mode very soon," the announcement continued, "but this is also not the end of Adventure Mode development. Many updates in the future will be applied to both modes and there's still more to add to Adventure Mode in the future. As with everything in Dwarf Fortress development, it will all come in due time."
</p>
<p>
Prior to Adventure Mode's full launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/">Steam</a> (and <a href="https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/dwarf-fortress">itch.io</a>, where the Premium version is also available), the Adamses have released what'll likely be one of the mode's last pre-launch beta updates, featuring a long list of improvements and additions - as detailed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/530961267633946651?l=english">latest patch notes</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a> promises to be a massive game-changer, introducing significant image quality and performance improvements, as highlighted by an early test conducted at CES 2025 with CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>The tech experts at Digital Foundry had the chance to go hands-on with NVIDIA DLSS 4 and the recently announced RTX 5080 GPU, highlighting in a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-dlss-4-on-nvidias-new-geforce-rtx-5080" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a> how, even in its early state running on an engineering sample without the final driver, the new version of the tech is a different AI-upscaler compared to the current version, introducing significant image quality and performance improvements. The new model using a vision transformer brings greater image stability, reduced ghosting, higher detail, and enhanced anti-aliasing, improvements that address a good portion of the image quality issues seen with the previous convolutional neural network used by DLSS 3.</p>
<p>Among the improvements NVIDIA DLSS 4 will bring is the RTX 50 series-exclusive Multi Frame Generation, which generates up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, working with the complete suit of DLSS technology to provide a frame rate boost of up to 8x over traditional rendering. In one of the game's most demanding areas, the black market in the Petrochem stadium, using NVIDIA DLSS 4 and current Frame Generation on an RTX 5080, Cyberpunk 2077 runs at 4K output resolution with path tracing with a 535% frame-rate boost compared to native 4K resolution. The boost gets bigger at 725% with two generated frames and a whopping 935% with three generated frames. In every scenario, this means that the framerate went well past the 120 FPS mark, which is extremely impressive, considering we are talking about the game running with demanding path tracing.</p>
<p>Frame pacing is also improved in the x4-enabled multi-frame generation compared to the regular x2 of the single-frame generation, as NVIDIA had promised in the announcement. The only downside is the additional latency. Digital Foundry measured latency at 55.50 ms average when using DLSS 4 x3 and 57.30 ms when using DLSS 4 x4, compared to 50.97 ms with single-frame generation (x2). There's an additional 6.4 milliseconds of latency when using x4 instead of x2, then, but you get a 71% frame rate boost, which is more than a fair trade.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is among the games that will get native in-game support later this month, together with Alan Wake 2, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and others. A few more titles, like Black Myth: Wukong and Marvel Rivals, will receive in-game support at a later time, while Alan Wake 2 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle are also <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting two new technologies</a> (RTX Hair and RTX Mega Geometry, respectively) that are part of the newly announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-kit-shows-how-neural-rendering-will-power-the-next-visual-leap-in-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA RTX Kit</a>.</p>

For generations, it’s been utterly impossible to guess what the company might create next, given the complete surprises of, say, a two-screen clamshell touch-screen portable gaming device, or a gesture-led under-TV console that shines best when the whole family is prancing around together. Even the failed Wii U that the Switch replaced was a ludicrous combination of console and a giant handheld screen as a controller. The Switch was just as imaginative, a handheld <em>and</em> dockable console, with detachable controllers, in wild defiance of the tech-first, ever-larger boxes sold by rivals.</p><p>Even when Nintendo was creating iterative updates for its most successful products, like the GBA SP follow-up to the Game Boy Advance, or the DSi XL evolution of the original Nintendo DS, it seemed to be doing something else at the same time. Between the DS and the DSi we also got the Wii! The GameCube came out the same year as the Game Boy Advance! But, given the extraordinary scrutiny being put on every patent and parts manufacturer Nintendo is attached to, it seems vanishingly unlikely that there’s some secret second project being hidden behind the noise of the as-yet unnamed second Switch.</p><p>And the Switch 2? It’s another Switch. The controllers look likely to slot in magnetically, rather than slide in on those tracks that only match up the third time you try, and the screen is very likely to be bigger, all running on far more powerful chips. But…given it’s backward compatible, given it’s an iteration of the same format with improved tech, I find it hard to think of it as anything more than the equivalent of a souped-up Switch XL.</p><p>As I say, I <em>want</em> a Switch XL. If that were announced, independent of anything else, I’d be first to pre-order. I bought the Switch OLED as soon as I could, and I was delighted to have it. A Switch 2, as it so distressingly seems likely to be called, is a thing I want. But, at the same time, it’s not what I want to want. I want to be on the timeline where Nintendo says, “Sure, here’s the Switch 2,” but then pulls back the curtain on what else it’s cooking up. The thing that’s so wild, so peculiar, that even my silliest suggestions feel feasible. It’s a wearable piece of tech that uses holograms, or a bizarre twist on AR where the flagship <em>Mario</em> game uses our house furniture for platforms.</p><p>Just making a better Switch is so safe, so ordinary, so utterly un-Nintendo. Can you imagine any other company in the universe having the phenomenal success of the Nintendo Wii, and responding to that not by making a more powerful version of the same, but a two-screen console so complicated to explain that no one understood what it was for? Sure, that was a <em>terrible</em> idea in hindsight, but it was also the sort of thing I expect from Nintendo, and it’s impossible to understate just how equally crazy the pitch for the Switch seemed at the time, following the Wii U.</p><p>I still hold out hope that the Switch 2 will have some surprises. That little lens spotted in the Joy-Cons is something Nintendo will likely use in some really innovative ways, even if other developers never notice it’s there. I often think about one of the most wonderful aspects of the Switch—the all-too underrated Labo. Those cardboard packs, in conjunction with the peculiar controllers, that had you build working pianos, fishing rods for fishing games, and even a remote-controlled bug creature. It used the Joy-Con’s haptics to move around, and the infrared sensor as a tiny camera! That was bloody incredible! That was astoundingly imaginative, and I have high hopes that Nintendo has similarly inventive plans for using the new Joy-Cons’ tech. I like to imagine they’ll have pushed it all a little harder to third-party developers this time, so we can see <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/a-dsloveletter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-dsloveletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some of the wonderful madness that appeared in the first few months of the Nintendo DS</a></span>.</p><p>But, you know, I’m still a bit sad. It could have been something bonkers! It could have been something capable of running Switch games like the 3DS could run DS games. But if all the rumors and leaks are true, there’s no entire new plane of gaming existence being added here, just a Switch that can run prettier games. I’m buying one, for sure. But I will still lament a little the brand new Nintendo console innovation it doesn’t look likely to be.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/scump-on-call-of-duty-state/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Seth ‘Scump’ Abner, one of the most electrifying and popular former pro players in Call of Duty, has taken to his stream to talk about the state of Call of Duty. In a transparent statement, he echoed what so many content creators have said, suggesting that Call of Duty is in a horrible state right now – for many reasons.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 was supposed to be Call of Duty’s ‘saviour’, and it was solid for a while, but things are starting to fall apart. Check out what Scump had to say about Call of Duty below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-such-a-bad-spot-right-now">‘Such a Bad Spot Right Now’</h2>



<p>Scump is a Call of Duty world champion and arguably the most prolific pro player in the scene. He has spent a decade honing his following and his talents, and now that he’s tired from actively competing, he has become one of the game’s most-watched streamers. He’s still flying the OpTic banner after all these years, too.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://x.com/SpawnUpgg/status/1877025389077225639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent stream</a>, Scump explained how he and so many people feel about Call of Duty:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Call of Duty is just in such a bad spot right now, dude. I don’t think Call of Duty has ever been in a worse spot than it is right now. It’s kind of depressing, to be honest.</p>



<p>I was already concerned them releasing ranked so early and the CDL started up, and then we had like a month break from the CDL, so I was already a little concerned about all of that.</p>



<p>They dropped it so early and then they dropped it and it was so bad because of all the hackers.</p>



<p>… I don’t know, they just f***ed up.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He followed up by explaining that he’s dropping away from Call of Duty a little to stream other games. That’s something that Nadeshot did just a few days ago, pivoting away from Black Ops 6 to play Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 has been riddled with hackers for several weeks, and it seems like every creator and pro player is running up against them in Ranked Play. It’s making the game borderline unplayable for the more skilled players, and other elements such as poor network performance and tricky SBMM mechanics are inflicting pain upon the more average gamers.</p>



<p>Do you think Call of Duty is in a hole right now? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>For the better part of two decades, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dwarf-fortress/">Dwarf Fortress</a> has been the passion project of brothers Tarn and Zach Adams. Although the acclaimed fantasy simulation game has technically remained in development since its debut in 2006, Dwarf Fortress' Adventure Mode will launch out of beta on January 23. The announcement was sent out with the following video, and an update about the latest changes in the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg99hUv4YEY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kg99hUv4YEY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Dwarf Fortress allows players to control a clan of dwarves as they stake out their place in a procedurally generated fantasy world. Adventure Mode shakes up the formula by allowing players to step into a roguelike-style RPG and explore the worlds that were created during their time in the standard game. Adventure Mode also allows players to accept quests and look for lost treasures, among other activities.</p><p>Tarn Adams and Kitfox's Alexandra Orlando have shared Dwarf Fortress' latest updates <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/530961267633946651" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on its Steam page</a>. Most of the changes were for Adventure Mode, including enhanced options for character creation, the addition of Adventure Mode's soundtrack to Fortress Mode, and even the option for child and baby portraits.</p><p>Dwarf Fortress has been around for nearly 19 years, but it didn't launch on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dwarf-fortress-arrives-on-steam-with-fancy-graphics-december-6/1100-6508880/">Steam until December 2023</a> with a paid version of the game that had new graphics, music, and more. The game's incredible success on Steam <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dwarf-fortress-game-devs-reveal-whats-next-for-them-after-the-games-sudden-success/1100-6522418/" data-ref-id="1100-6522418">allowed the Adams brothers to purchase a new home</a>. Now that Adventure Mode is on the horizon, Tarn Adams indicated on Steam that the focus will return to Fortress Mode "very soon." He also added that both Fortress Mode and Adventure Mode will continue to be supported by future updates.</p>

		<p>Transformers: Reactivate has been in production since 2019, when Certain Affinity developed the game under a different name, Transformers: Rise. Splash Damage re-announced the game at The Game Awards in 2022 but since then, there has been radio silence, with just a leaked video of an old build showing us what the game was like.</p>
<p>Splash Damage have now announced they are cancelling the game and there will be redundancies as they “refocus on other projects”.&nbsp; Why the game has been cancelled is unclear, although it’s obviously had a rocky development path.&nbsp; Hasbro have said they really want to move in to video games themselves so maybe they pulled the plug and have another game with their own studio waiting in the wings.</p>


<p>Transformers: Reactivate was set in the future where Earth has already fallen and the Autobots are our last hope, fighting a new enemy called The Legion, “the greatest threat the Autobots have ever faced.” This explained the generic robots enemies in the trailer and not a hint of a Decepticon. Apart from that leaked information suggested the game was a free-to-play multiplayer PvE game, perhaps similar to Destiny.</p>
<p>Transformers games should not be that hard to get right, you already have the classes, you have the combat, and most of all you have over a thousand characters to choose.&nbsp; The Cybertron games got it right, as did Devestation, but since then attempts at Transformers games have been fair at best.&nbsp;The most recent Transformers game, Galactic Trials, is downright awful and should be avoided like the plague.</p>
<p>Clearly I should never have championed the game on our<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/30/our-most-wanted-games-of-2024-15-to-11/"> Most Wanted of 2025 list!</a></p>

			<p>The new year has just begun, and unfortunately, there has already been some bad news. Splash Damage has <a href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on X</a> that they have made the decision to end development on Transformers: Reactivate. Along with this means that there will also be a number of staff being made redundant, as they are reshuffling their studio and refocusing on other projects within the studio. Transformers: Reactivate was <a href="https://wccftech.com/transformers-mmo-by-certain-affinity-moved-to-splash-damage-report/">first announced in December 2022</a>, with minimal news coming out about it after the initial announcement.</p>
<p>The title was set to be a 1-4 player online action game that would be on PC and consoles, where you would have to reassemble the Autobots that were left in pieces in the debris. It was created in collaboration with Hasbro, Inc. The cinematic trailer for this title seemed promising, and had a lot of Transformers fans excited. Splash Damage is the studio behind Dirty Bomb, Gears Tactics, and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.</p>
<p>The full announcement from Splash Damage reads as the following:</p>
<p><i>Today, we have some very difficult news to share, the decision has been made to end the development of Transformers: Reactivate.</i></p>
<p><em>This means we will be scaling down to refocus our efforts on other projects. Unfortunately, despite every effort, a number of roles across the studio are now potentially at risk of redundancy.</em></p>
<p><em>This decision did not come lightly, and it is a difficult time for the studio and our people. We want to take a moment to thank the team who worked on Transformers for their dedication and passion.</em></p>
<p><em>Hasbro was an incredible and supportive partner throughout, and we hope to work with them again. To the many fans, your excitement and support helped keep us going.</em></p>
<p><em>While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more. We're now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for your compassion and understanding.</em></p>
<p>While they will no longer be working on this title, they announced in March 2023 that they are creating a new project called "Project Astrid" alongside streamers Shroud and Sacriel. The game is set to be an open-world survival game. Hopefully, those who were working on Transformers: Reactivate will be given the option to stay at the company, working on Project Astrid.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media platform X, Splash Damage says that as well as canceling&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>, the studio will be "scaling down to refocus [its] efforts on other projects", which is why some staff may be laid off.</p>

<p>The studio doesn't specify which staff members or which departments are most at risk, but it does say that "having to say goodbye" to employees "hurts even more" than not being able to release&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/transformers-reactivate-canceled-shooting.jpg?itok=CfmFSIbA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/transformers-reactivate-canceled-shooting.jpg?itok=vLiSwSQW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Transformers: Reactivate&nbsp;</em>has been, well, deactivated.</figcaption></figure><p>The cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Reactivate&nbsp;</em>probably shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. The game was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everything-announced-at-game-awards-2022" rel="nofollow">during the Game Awards opening ceremony back in 2022</a>, but since then, Splash Damage has been pretty quiet about its development.</p>

<p>Outside of the (admittedly rather evocative) announcement trailer, Splash Damage didn't reveal much about&nbsp;<em>Reactivate</em>, save that it would be an online-focused action game for 1-4 players and that it would come to PC and consoles.</p>

<p>Following the initial reveal, however, Splash Damage did announce that it had purchased <i>Transformers: Reactivate&nbsp;</i>development partner Bulkhead. As far as we know, Bulkhead remains a Splash Damage subsidiary despite the cancellation.</p>

<p>At some point, Splash Damage planned to hold a closed beta for the game, but it looks like that test never materialized either, at least for public-facing signups.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like Splash Damage is shutting down entirely as a result of this cancellation, so we'll have to wait and see what the studio does next. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>As someone who believes in the <em>ideal</em> of the trim, tidy PC interior, I do applaud the intent behind MSI’s Project Zero X. Currently on show at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/ces-2025">CES 2025</a>, it’s a prototype desktop build that uses clever geometry and an unconventional motherboard I/O layout to hide practically every single wire in the joint, for a clean design that's housed for your viewing pleasure within a four-sided glass chamber. It’s the closest PCs have come to the simple Victorian pleasures of a nice terrarium, and honestly, good on it.</p>
<p>The problem is that if Project Zero X’s components ever actually go on sale, there becomes a non-zero percent chance that I will come into possession of that see-through case. And there is a <em>one hundred</em> percent chance I will ruin it.</p>

<p>I can’t remember if I’ve ever confessed this before, but I absolutely fucking suck at cable management. Just, abysmal. I can’t get them straight. I can’t get them bending where I want them. I can’t figure out what to do with the slack except stuff it under the PSU shroud like a bundle of old Christmas lights that just barely fit back in their box. I almost considered begging Liam (RPS in peace) not to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-tidy-cables-reassemble-pc-case">shoot that video</a> of me bumbling through the process because I knew it would out me as some kind of hardware fraud, a Frank Abagnale with zipties. Remember, it’s not imposter syndrome if you’re genuinely an imposter.</p>
<p>Point being, it doesn’t matter what MSI have done with the Project Zero X case, even if they have gone to such ginnard-concealing lengths that it’s somehow got the GPU outputs pointing out of the side. If I try to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-build-a-pc">build a PC</a> with this, it will be full of stray cables, and its entire purpose will be undermined. I don’t know how. But I’ll find a way.</p><p>Still, for less deficient PC builders, this could make for quite the statement piece. Provided, anyway, that the still-traditional blend of glass and metal remains within the boundaries of Your Kinda Thing. Opinions on chassis designs can of course vary, even in the relatively tiny sample size of the current RPS team: per a meeting this morning where I brought up the Project Zero X, it turns out Graham wants to see as little of his PC’s insides as possible, Edwin dislikes anything painted black or with lights, and Nic wishes his was made out of wood. Maybe not the case for us lot, then.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is a quiet month for video game releases, as January tends to be, but there’s at least one approaching asteroid in the shape of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-engineers-2">Space Engineers 2</a>. Announced over the winter, it’s a spruced-up reimagining of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-25-favourite-space-games-of-all-time">your scientifically determined 22nd favourite space game</a> - the hectic Second Coming of a simulation we’ve devoted 14 whole-ass features to since 2013, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-engineers-diary-part-one-wolves">a seven-part diary series</a> featuring many a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wastes-of-space-a-space-engineers-diary-part-two-the-vengabus-cometh">starfaring Vengabus</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wastes-of-space-a-space-engineers-diary-part-five-spidergeddon">Wild Wild Westerly giant robot spider</a>.</p>
<p>It really is high time we gave the new game some attention, then. The very first alpha launches into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133870/Space_Engineers_2/">Steam early access</a> on January 27th. Here’s what’s in store.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As you may have cunningly deduced using your advanced simian brain, the sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-engineers">Space Engineers</a> is once again about engineering in space. It’s a first-person sandbox crafting and exploration game set in the mysterious Almagest star system, many centuries and lightyears from now.</p>
<p>Some trivia: the original Amalgest was a 2nd-century astronomical treatise on the motions of the stars and planets, written by Claudius Ptolemy. I have not read the Amalgest, but I do not believe it makes mention of "a 25cm unified grid building system", or indeed "magboots with camera stabilisation". You will encounter both of these things in the first alpha build of Space Engineers 2, which introduces a Creative mode together with refined building tools, including an undo/redo function and a new blueprint system with grid-snapping and partial copy-paste.
</p>
<p>
The new VRAGE3 engine promises "a visual revolution thanks to ray tracing, global illumination, tessellated terrain, parallax mapping, sleek armor edges, and enhanced lighting". Here's the announcement trailer so you can watch it all sparking and spurting away.</p>

<p>As per <a href="https://2.spaceengineersgame.com/roadmap-2/#current">the Space Engineers 2 early access roadmap</a>, the first update after the alpha launch will add a user-generated content workshop. After that, they’re planning an update that makes unspecified improvements and refinements to play mechanics and the interface. Then comes an update with proper modding support, including a mod hub and editor. 
</p><p>
And then, the Good stuff: walkable planets with bodies of water, multiplayer, factions of non-player characters, survival mode, and a story campaign. The campaign is the tale of two brothers who’ve arrived in the Amalgest system after several thousand years in cryosleep. It’ll be broken into missions. They're also planning a sandbox campaign option with no story backbone, in which you progress simply by building ships and wrangling with the factions.
</p>
<p>
In the video below, Keen Software’s CEO Marek Rosa goes over the details of the roadmap, while fielding questions from the Space Engineers community. Amongst other things, he stresses the importance of making the simulation more intuitive – for example, by adding a little of creative mode’s simplicity to survival mode by means of new “backpack building” and “projection building” systems. He also talks up the swoleness of the engine, which supports grander feats such as instantly duplicating entire hand-assembled battlecruisers, but also lends itself to little flourishes such as blocks that fracture believably when you blast them.

As for the original Space Engineers, it’s not going anywhere. Keen Software plan to maintain it alongside development of the new game. No <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>-2-style rugpull here.
</p>
<p>
I confess, I’m writing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-engineers-2">Space Engineers 2</a> partly because some of you fine people mentioned it in the comments for my article on Shiro’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spacecraft-is-aiming-for-the-gap-between-starfield-satisfactory-and-eve-online">SpaceCraft</a>, which appears to place more emphasis on galactic exploration and relatively contained, automatable acts of resource extraction and production. I think I like the sound of Space Engineers 2 a shade more than SpaceCraft, in that going by trailers, you can physically walk around asteroids in three dimensions, using the aforesaid magboots. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yes-you-can-spacewalk-in-starfield-and-yes-i-am-trying-to-build-an-asteroid-outpost">I wish I could have done that in Starfield</a>. Ptolemy would have been ecstatic, I'm sure.

<p>Developer Splash Damage has announced that the online co-op game Transformers: Reactivate has been cancelled just over two years after it was first announced. Alongside the game’s cancellation, the studio is also set to lay off an unknown number of developers.</p>



<p>The studio made the announcement in a post on social media on Wednesday while saying they are going to “refocus” on other projects.</p>



<p>“Today, we have some very difficult news to share, the decision has been made to end development of Transformers: Reactivate,” the statement reads. “This means we will be scaling down to refocus our efforts on other projects. Unfortunately, despite every effort, a number of roles across the studio are now potentially at risk of redundancy.”</p>



<p>The statement continues to say that the “decision did not come lightly”, and that it’s a “difficult” time for everyone at the studio. They then went on to thank Hasbro for their support before talking about the short term future.</p>



<p>“While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more,” they said. “We’re now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Splash Damage for clarification on the number of roles that will be impacted by the layoffs. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>



<p>Last year saw <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 15,000 known jobs</a> lost in the games industry. In just the first eight days of 2025, there have been a least four known layoffs, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-suffers-more-layoffs-as-suicide-squad-support-winds-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocksteady</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-gaming-layoffs-of-2025-have-happened/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netmarble F&amp;C</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-down-answered/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cs2-server-status-is-counter-strike-2-down-answered.1077192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-down-answered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With more than a million people playing Counter-Strike 2 on any given day, server status is an important factor to monitor. While it doesn’t happen often, CS2 has been down in the past due to a variety of reasons.</p>



<p>There’s nothing more frustrating (other than a costly missed smoke) than not being able to play CS2 at all. Here’s all the tools you need to be able to check on CS2’s server status and see if it’s down.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-cs2-server-status">How to Check CS2 Server Status</h2>



<p>There are a number of third-party websites that can relay Steam and Counter-Strike 2 server information to you. <a href="https://www.csgodatabase.com/csgo-steam-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CSGO Database</a> appears to be the most complete by our judgment. It provides the status of CS2 services like the API, player inventories and the matchmaking scheduler, as well as the status of all the regional servers. Additionally, CSGO Database provides current metrics for online players, active servers, and the total number of players searching for a match.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: CSGO Database</figcaption></figure>



<p>If there are any issues affecting server availability, <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/counter-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DownDetector</a> might provide some more insight. This website tracks the number of problems reported with CS2’s servers, showing spikes in reports over the past 24 hours and a “live outage” report. There’s also an option to switch to one of dozens of other countries. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-cs2-down">Why is CS2 Down?</h2>



<p>CS2 is subject to regular maintenance like any other persistent online multiplayer game. Problems with Steam servers routinely happen on Tuesdays when servers are taken down for maintenance. CS2 itself will go down for a small amount of time when new updates go live, and many players attempt to sign in right away after these updates, so the number of reported outages will spike.</p>



<p>On rare occasions, a larger issue that needs to be addressed by the developers will force CS2 down for a long time. In that case, Valve will typically post directly to <a href="https://x.com/CounterStrike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@CounterStrike on X</a> informing players of what’s going on.</p>



<p>What’s the longest that Counter-Strike has ever been down for you? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It said not being able to launch the game is "painful" but saying goodbye to colleagues "hurts even more."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="816500662" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Splash Damage has announced it's cancelling the development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/transformers-reactivate">Transformers: Reactivate</a>, and that it'll be "scaling down" the studio as result, leaving roles "at risk of redundancy".
</p>
<p>
Transformers: Reactivate was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brink-developer-splash-damage-developing-transformers-reactivate">unveiled for PC and consoles</a> at The Game Awards back in 2022, promising online action for one to four players featuring some of the franchise's most iconic characters. However, little has been heard about the game since its reveal two years ago, and now Splash Damage has confirmed development has ceased.
</p>
<p>
"Today, we have some very difficult news to share," the company wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485">statement on social media</a>. "The decision has been made to end development of Transformers: Reactivate. This means we will be scaling down to refocus our efforts on other projects. Unfortunately, despite every effort, a number of roles across the studio are now potentially at risk of redundancy."

<p>
"This decision did not come lightly, and it is a difficult time for the studio and our people. We want to take a moment to thank the team who worked on Transformers for their dedication and passion." Splash Damage, which is based in the UK, did not specify the reason for the game's cancellation, nor did it reveal how many jobs are at risk following today's news.
</p>
<p>
"Hasbro was an incredible and supportive partner throughout," it continued, "and we hope to work with them again. To the many fans, your excitement and support helped keep us going."
</p>
<p>
"While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more. We're now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future."
</p>
<p>
"Thank you for your compassion and understanding."

			<p>Smite 2 has been in Alpha for a little while now, with new Gods being added pretty consistently to the game. At the moment, there are only two modes available, with players having the choice between playing Arena or Conquest. However, the MOBA is now set to enter Open Beta, allowing any who are interested to start playing it as of January 14. So, for those interested, you won't have long to wait.&nbsp; The game has been progressing at a steady rate, with most of the team at Hi-Rez swapping working on Smite to Smite 2. For those who haven't had access to Smite 2, there was a confirmed skeleton crew to be working on Smite just for small updates.</p>
<p>However, as they rearranged the team working on Smite, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-lays-off-employees-focusing-on-smite-2/">led to layoffs</a> at the company that was not disclosed in the statement that Stewart Chisam wrote, but that the changes were "difficult but necessary" to be able to ensure that Smite 2 has a "long and sustainable future." Smite was originally released in 2014, with its successor announced 12 months ago. This came after Hi-Rez celebrated 10 years of Smite, and now they are working on a new and improved that comes with multiple new Gods and plans to keep the game in action late into the 2030s.</p>
<p>At the moment, those who have wanted to play Smite 2 will have had to get a key for the Alpha via Smite 2 streams or purchase <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437170/SMITE_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Founder's Pack on Steam</a>, which would give them extra bonuses in addition to access to the game as it develops.</p>
<p>With the release of the Free to Play Open Beta, it means that all of the pre-existing players and those who are just joining will get access to a ton of new content that will become available during this period specifically.</p>
<p>This includes five new Gods that will be added to the game, including Aladdin. Along with the variety of Gods in the game, there will also be three new game modes to jump into. These are Joust, Duel, and Assault, offering plenty of options for players who don't get on with the Conquest and Arena game modes that were already in the game. You can check out the Aladdin gameplay in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="SMITE 2 - New God: Aladdin Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_WiHGQ_KAo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Will you be picking up Smite 2 in the Open Beta? If so, what Gods do you plan on playing?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/finspan-takes-the-wingspan-formula-to-new-depths-later-this-month.1077153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/finspan-wingspan-creators-january<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>studio Stonemaier Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>, the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>family. As you've probably already guessed, the game expands the card-based engine-building gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>into the world of marine life.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>, which follows on from&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/embrace-your-inner-dracologist-with-wyrmspan" rel="nofollow">dragon-based successor&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan</em></a>, has you playing as a marine researcher who must observe aquatic life over three zones: the Sunlight Zone, the Twilight Zone, and the Midnight Zone.</p>

<p>Each of&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>'s dive sites will help you with a key aspect of your research, from growing your fish collection to discovering new eggs and even hatching eggs to create schools of fish. If you've played&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>, you'll probably be familiar with the basic idea here, albeit with a marine twist.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stonemaier-games-finspan-play.jpg?itok=yFRfN_Xc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stonemaier-games-finspan-play.jpg?itok=n-viEVPW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>takes the&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>formula to new depths, as it were.</figcaption></figure><p>Players will compete with one another to assemble vast arrays of marine life, with the winner being the player that gains the most points. You can score points through "fish, eggs, young, schools, and achievements", according to Stonemaier.</p>

<p><em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>designer Elizabeth Hargrave says that while she knew fish were often requested by fans of her game, she "didn't feel like [she] had the bandwidth to do them justice", but that she's "absolutely delighted"&nbsp;<em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>will soon be out there in the world.</p>

<p>Hargrave goes on to say that she hopes&nbsp;<em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>"will inspire people to connect with the marine world and conservation in the same way that&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>has made people birders".</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Finspan</em>, which also shows off the game's beautiful board and fish card artwork, right here.</p>




<p><em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>will support up to five players of ages 10 and up, and a game should take you somewhere between 45 and 60 minutes to complete, which is roughly in keeping with&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>'s duration.</p>

<p>Notably, the game will also offer a solo play mode created by Automa Factory, the studio that also worked on solo play modes for Stonemaier titles like&nbsp;<em>Scythe&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tapestry</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Wingspan&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Finspan&nbsp;</em>when it launches on January 22nd to <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/games/finspan/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">buy direct from Stonemaier</a>, followed by a wider retail release in February.
