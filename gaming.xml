		<p>Ubisoft has unwrapped Rainbow Six Siege X, their big overhaul for the decade-old tactical shooter, aiming to prepare the game for the decade to come. As part of that there’s a whole host of technical improvements and updates to the core game, but perhaps the biggest announcement here is that the game is going free-to-play with free access to the bulk of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> experience – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-new-dual-front-mode-why-just-attack-or-defend-when-you-can-do-both/">including the new Dual Front mode</a> – while a paid tier (or a prior purchase) locks away certain modes and operators.</p>



<p>There’s a significant visual overhaul, with Ubisoft going back to rework all of the main materials within the game, upping the detail for things as fundamental as brick walls and wooden planks. Alongside that, there’s refreshed lighting and reflections that are best seen in the maps Clubhouse, Chalet, Bank, Russian Cafe, and Border. The change can feel very subtle without side-by-side comparisons, but the emphasis is basically on making lighting more realistic, so rooms will likely be a notch darker and light sources, like the sun streaming through windows in Bank, more important. Three more maps will be modernised in the same way with every season going forward, and a new map will be added each season from Year 11.</p>
<p>Maps will also feature new destructible ingredients that can be used tactically. Fire extinguishers can create a temporary smoke screen or even concuss anyone caught in their blast. Gas pipes will cut off an area with a flame that gradually concentrates before exploding to set an area on fire for a little while, and metal detectors are now interactive, and can be disabled temporarily or permanently.</p>
<p>Audio has been given the 2.0 treatment with better sound propagation and better reverb to make it easier to tell where things are coming from. Sound now passes through walls, instead of just bouncing around the environments, and sounds in a small room will have a different reverb to those in a large room or coming from the exterior.</p>
<p>Oh, and they returned to the motion capture studio to dramatically improve rappelling. You can now rappel round corners, and you can sprint along walls for faster repositioning – though obviously they’ll hear you stomping on the walls from the inside.</p>

<p>Along with all of this there’s to be an overhauled esports section in the menu UI, and Pick and Ban has been rejigged to make it quicker – both teams will choose at the same time, and then get a chance to amend picks and bans when swapping between attack and defence. For prospective newcomers there’s a redone onboarding progression and, most significantly, a shift to free access to the game – ranked, esports and access to the full character roster will require that you pay or have already paid. There’s new tutorials and a Clearance Levels onboarding system that aims to get new players up to speed, first against bots, then other players in Quick Match, before Unranked returns as the standard playlist and feeds into Ranked.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege X isn’t a full sequel, but it’s still an important step for the game. There’s the excitement and intrigue that a new game mode inevitably brings, sensible improvements throughout, and making the game free to play and with a new introduction to the game can bring this to a wider audience once more.</p>

This reimagination is now structured to fit the way people play on mobile, making it effortless to enjoy in short bursts. It’s what audiobooks wish they were.” Okay, <em>Disco Elysium </em>is apparently covering ground the entire audio storytelling industry can’t, according to ZA/UM. Havel also says:</p><p>“Mobile players deserve deep, story-rich experiences, like <em>Disco Elysium</em>.

Goku's new companions from the Daima anime, Glorio, Shin, and Panzy, join the little Saiyan on his adventure to master new techniques and track down the Dragon Balls of the Demon Realm so he can restore himself to his normal size and full power.</p><p>In case you missed it when launched in 2020, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot retells several storylines from the manga and anime source material, starting with the Saiyan Saga and ending with the Majin Buu Saga, while expanding the universe with new content. Several DLC expansions followed the base game that add five additional chapters to play through based on the Battle of the Gods and Resurrection 'F' arcs from Dragon Ball Super, and an all-new campaign starring Trunks. The game combines the action-packed brawling of the franchise with light RPG mechanics like leveling up Goku, taking on side quests, and exploring the game's large zones. "Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot's modern, semi-open approach to telling the saga of DBZ--despite some minor issues--is a good one," Heidi Kemps wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-review-mondo-cool/1900-6417393/">GameSpot's review</a>. Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot launched on PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC, followed by PS5 and Xbox Series X|S ports with enhanced visuals.</p><p>If you're interested in checking out Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot before the new Daima expansion launches, the best way is to grab the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fdragon-ball-z-kakarot-legendary-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-upcoming-dragon-ball-z-kakarot-daima-edition-is-getting-physical-ps5-and-switch-versions%2F1100-6530103%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot Legendary Edition</a>, which includes the base game, both Season Pass DLC expansions, and a few bonus in-game items.

			<p>Rainbow 6 Siege X will launch in June 2025, opening up a new era for the game with the biggest and most transformative evolution in its ten-year history.</p>
<p>The new trailer shared today, which can be watched below, provides a new look at what Siege X will bring on June 10th, such as a major visual overhaul, an enhanced player experience, and some gameplay changes that will improve the game's tactical core.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege X Reveal Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0Hw96M5bC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Some of the new features that will come with Rainbow 6 Siege X this June include a new play mode called Dual Front, a permanent 6v6 game mode that will be set in the game's biggest map to date. In this mode, players will be able to form squads by picking between 35 different operators and proceed to secure enemy sectors while defending their own. While this new play mode will only be available when Rainbow 6 Siege X launches, players will be able to test it out this week with a limited-time closed beta that will run from March 13th @ 12pm PT / 3pm ET/ 8pm CET to March 19th @ 12pm PT / 3pm ET/ 8pm CET. To get access to the beta, players will need to connect their Twitch and Ubisoft Connect accounts and watch either the Showcase on the<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Official Rainbow 6 Twitch channel</a> or other <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">livestreams</a>.</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege X showcase has kicked off and revealed a brand new 6v6 game mode, Dual Front. The new game mode can be tested today, with R6 Siege X closed beta beginning right after the stream.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-r6-siege-x-s-6v6-game-mode-dual-front">What is R6 Siege X’s 6v6 Game Mode, Dual Front?</h2>



<p>Revealed during the R6 Siege X Showcase, Dual Front is the new 6v6 game mode with an exclusive new map. Players can create teams that blend attackers and defenders as they complete dynamic objectives across the map. Moreover, R6 Siege X’s 6v6 game mode will consist of respawn, where players can return as their currently selected operator or change their operator for tactical adjustment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trailer also revealed some upgrades to the core Siege experience. Players will observe new environmental destruction, advanced rappelling, visual enhancements, an audio overhaul, and new animations like weapon inspection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>R6 Siege X’s 6v6 Dual Front mode will be a permanent game mode with “a brand new ever-evolving map” called District. District features two symmetrical fronts, each with three sectors. Each team has to capture one front while simultaneously defending their own as they progress through the sectors. The final sector will consist of a prototype that players need to destroy to win the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also a neutral sector with a timebound task that can change the tide of the battle. Each new season will bring a new assignment in Dual Front, introducing a new narrative, gameplay and neutral sector map updates.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Velan Studios has released Midnight Murder Club into early access, their dark room party game twist on a first person shooter now available for PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>The game comes in at $19.99 / £15.99, but also has a generous Guest Pass, allowing an owner of the game to bring in a full lobby of buddies using a free Guest Pass version of the game. As a multiplayer game being published by PlayStation, players will require a free PSN account on PC, and an active PS Plus subscription to play on PS5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Midnight Murder Club - Early Access Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IKc3OtSht98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Midnight Murder Club takes the first person shooter and drops it into the pitch-black rooms of Wormwood Manor. Up to six players enter this blacked-out arena with just a revolver and a flashlight, trying to figure out where the other players are from the sound of their movement, flickers of light and sparing use of the flashlight. This could find a niche within the social deduction genre, and could be a hit with Twitch streamer groups because of this.</p>
<p>There’s five game modes in the game as of its early access launch, as described by Velan Studios:</p>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Free-for-All</strong> – Six brave souls enter the mansion, and the player with the most kills when time runs out prevails among the rest.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Thief in the Night</strong> – Three fearless teams of two scour the mansion for valuable skulls to deposit into a vault. When the last vault closes, the team with the most value accumulated wins.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Team Deathmatch</strong> – Kill-or-be-killed with your team in a murderous stand-off.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Head Hunters</strong> – Two friends become foes as they hunt the remaining four players as they try to find and burn three hidden demonic totems in the haunting halls.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">New Game Mode: <strong>Wildcards</strong> – Valiant attendees will play cards from their collection that change the rules for everyone in-game in wild new ways! From hijacking the toys that appear in vendors, to giving everyone super speed, to exploding into flames when you die—use these cards to show your wild side! Then, when the dust settles and the match is over, you’ll be gifted brand new cards to add to your collection giving you even more ways to change the game.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">One of the best things about this release is how Velan is opening the door to as many players as possible. Only one person needs to buy and own the game in order to host a full lobby, thanks to the free Guest Pass version of the game. It’s a similar concept to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/09/split-fiction-review/">Split Fiction’s</a> Friends Pass, or games with DLC that allows DLC-havers to invite DLC-have-nots.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond that, Midnight Murder Club has full cross-play and cross-progression.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Velan has also laid out what can be expected through Early Access with a dev diary roadmap:</p>
<p><iframe title="Midnight Murder Club Dev Diary - Early Access Roadmap" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXZgyRQv16M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">A new PvE mode is planned to release this spring, for example, while the summer will see more Toys added, as well as custom game modes. All of this is subject to change, though, depending on how the game’s community grows and feeds back on what they like and want more of in the game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With this game Velan Studios is establishing a track record of cooking up new and inventive multiplayer games. A few years ago they launched <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/31/hands-on-the-knockout-city-cross-play-beta/">Knockout City</a>, a quirky riff on dodgeball that was rather fun and vibrant, but sadly didn’t quite find its audience under the EA Originals publishing arm, and couldn’t recover <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/25/knockout-city-is-going-free-to-play-and-leaving-ea-behind-velan-self-publishing/">after going independent and free-to-play</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/03/knockout-city-is-shutting-down-but-a-pc-private-servers-will-help-it-live-on/">shutting down in 2023</a>. Here’s hoping Midnight Murder Club strikes a cord with more people!</p>

The examples included an AI voice telling a player who to pick in <em>Overwatch 2 </em>and a chatbot explaining how to craft wood planks in <em>Minecraft</em>. The program also offered feedback on past in-game failures in <em>Age of Empires</em> and could be used to pull up strategy guides if the player remained stuck.</p><p>Perhaps the silliest use case presented in the podcast was telling the Copilot AI to install a game which, if communicating with Copilot via text at least, would seemingly require several more taps and clicks than just doing that manually (a process that already takes only seconds on mobile). The YouTube page is full of people asking why AI needs to be part of the experience at all.</p><figure id="" data-id="a60ea39d3f3684ef58fd764d74785999" data-recommend-id="image://a60ea39d3f3684ef58fd764d74785999" data-format="png" data-width="614" data-height="344" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a60ea39d3f3684ef58fd764d74785999" data-recommend-id="image://a60ea39d3f3684ef58fd764d74785999" data-format="png" data-width="614" data-height="344" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="9baed66410ae15c7de1abaf61412ec39" data-recommend-id="image://9baed66410ae15c7de1abaf61412ec39" data-format="png" data-width="642" data-height="331" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot displays a conversation with AI.

Instead of telling me how to do a thing in a game, maybe it could just do it for me, like a more experienced friend would if they were playing with me. Maybe the Copilot can show my kid how to grow food to keep his workers from starving during the winter in <em>Overthrown</em> instead of him asking me every five minutes. </p><p>The use cases quickly snowball from there, however, and probably not in a direction Microsoft wants. Why stop at helping me control my console more easily or bypass a frustrating part of a game? Why not have the Xbox Copilot do my dailies for me and grind random encounters in my favorite JRPG while I scroll TikTok? Let the AI grind the battle pass and pop achievements. One reason not to do that might be that I don’t want Copilot spying on me and my family. Or, if it eventually becomes a paid service like it will presumably have to be in order to be financially sustainable, even the cheevos it could earn for me wouldn’t be worth it.<br></p><p>We’ll see how useful, frightening, or silly the tool ends up being once it’s out. In the meantime, Microsoft also revealed that over 1,000 games like <em>Balatro </em>are now Play Anywhere between Xbox and PC, and the number is expected to keep rising.

Patch 1.2 is out now, and alongside fixes and improvements, there's both a barber shop and Steam Workshop modding support added to the massive RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The barber shop is the first of "several" planned free DLCs, per a press release from Warhorse, and will let protagonist Henry visit the barber to change up his hairstyle. There's also an option for either a clean-shaven or rugged appearance, as well as facial hair ranging from stubble to beard. A new haircut will, just like in real life, give Henry a temporary boost to charisma.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 1.2 (massive patch notes below!) addresses over 1,000 fixes and improvements, including equipment and NPC behavior, as well as gameplay balance. Specifically, developer Warhorse Studios tackled country-specific localization as well. The new patch for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 refines the Chinese translations, both Traditional and Simplified, improves the Korean font for clarity, and has a newly recorded French voiceover.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for modding, dedicated Steam modding support has arrived alongside the barber DLC and Patch 1.2. The toolkit allows players to tinker with over 300 elements in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, ranging from user interface and combat mechanics to AI behavior. "Whether making subtle tweaks or complete overhauls, the possibilites for customization are vast," Warhorse said. The studio plans on discussing these updates further during a developer stream, set for March 20, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additional content is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-sets-stage-for-3-expansions-in-2025">expected to roll out for the historical RPG throughout the year</a>, with its first paid content drop "Brushes with Death" set for this summer. The Legacy of the Forge expansion is expected in autumn, and then this winter, Warhorse aims to release Mysteria Ecclesia, which involves a covert mission in the Sedlec Monastery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest from Warhorse Studios doesn't show any sign of slowing down in sales, either. The sequel <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-shows-no-sign-of-slowing-down-sells-2-million-copies-in-less-than-2-weeks">sold 2 million copies in less than two weeks</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-does-the-business-for-embracer-as-it-nears-2-million-copies-sold">Embracer has hailed the game as a success</a>. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">our own review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 at IGN</a>, the RPG got high marks for its melee combat, story, and a "truly dynamic" open-world sandbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting started in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?

                <p>2019's beloved RPG Disco Elysium is headed to a new platform: mobile. Developer ZA/UM Studio has announced that the game is being "reimagined" for mobile, and specifically Android devices. This game was announced amid <a href="https://gamespot.com/articles/ousted-disco-elysium-devs-claim-fraud-studio-says-they-were-fired-over-misconduct/1100-6509090/" data-target="true">legal disagreements</a> between some of the developers of the original game.</p><p>The developer said it's making an "entirely fresh experience tailored for mobile gamers." In a press release, the studio said the game is a "total re-imagination" of the psychological RPG. What that means is the mobile edition has been created with short play sessions in mind. Check out a trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbN8Nf8s8mM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lbN8Nf8s8mM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"It's what audiobooks wish they were," narrative leader Chris Priestman said of the game's mobile edition. As you can see in the trailer, the mobile version of Disco Elysium has "360-degree scenes" that aim to immerse players more. There is also "brand-new audio" with full voiceover.</p><p>Studio head Denis Havel, who worked on the original game, said "mobile players deserve deep, story-rich experiences like Disco Elysium." Havel added that the team aimed for the mobile version to have "profound respect for the original's artistry and meaning."</p><p>The first two chapters of Disco Elysium on mobile are free, and players can then pay to unlock the rest of the game's chapters with a single purchase. There are no ads.</p><p>You can <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZAUM.M0_stable" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-register for Disco Elysium now from Google Play</a>. The game is expected to launch in Summer 2025. Anyone attending GDC 2025 next week can play Disco Elysium on mobile at Google's booth. There is no word yet on a potential release for iOS.</p><p>A proper Disco Elysium sequel was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-expansion-and-sequel-canceled-report/1100-6521118/" data-ref-id="1100-6521118">canceled</a>.

            <p>
It's only been six months since Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2's well-received arrival, but developer Saber Interactive would already like you to know it's working on a sequel. Yup, Space Marine 3 is officially announced, but that's pretty much all we know so far.
</p>
<p>
Mainly, that's because it's extremely early days for Space Marine 3, with Saber confirming the game is only "now starting" development. The studio does, however, promise the next instalment of its third-person sci-fi shooter series will be an "even more immersive experience" and introduce "large-scale battles that are even more spectacular". And it seems safe to assume it'll once again follow the adventures of Ultramarines Captain Demetrian Titus, seeing as he pops up in Space Marine 3's single bit of promotional art. 
</p>
<p>
"Players can look forward to an immersive campaign, a multiplayer mode, and innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games," it says. "We will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third instalment."

<p>
As for Space Marine 2, it looks there's still plenty of life left in it. Saber confirms it'll "continue to support the game with exciting content and regular updates in the coming years" while it works on its newly announced sequel. And next up for Space Marine 2 is update 7.0, which is set to include the likes of private PvP lobbies, a new Operation and PvE weapon, plus reworks for class weapon loadouts and weapon perks balancing.
</p>
<p>
Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 enjoyed a strong critical and commercial reception when it launched last September. Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane called it a "spectacular and mostly thrilling follow-up" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">his four star review</a>, and it would go on to enjoy the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2-most-successful-steam-launch-for-warhammer-40k-series">Warhammer 40K series' most successful Steam launch yet</a>. Which bodes well for a Space Marine 3.

		<p>Where do you go after ten years as a live service game? That’s the question that’s been hanging over <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> for the last few years. The game is fully formed with plenty of maps, more spec ops characters than it’s wise to shake a stick at, and a mature esports scene that still surrounds it. Rainbow Six Siege X is Ubisoft’s answer, a major update and overhaul to the game coming in June 2025.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege X is an attack on two fronts. On the one hand, this is a deep technical uplift that’s aiming to refine the core experience, add some new options for gameplay and make this game feel a bit more 2020s than 2010s, and on the other, there’s Dual Front, a new game mode that looks to make the most of having ‘Six’ in the game’s name.</p>
<p><iframe title="R6 Siege X: New Dual Front 6v6 Mode" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/li443iqd3Xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let’s start with the glitz and excitement that a new mode offers. Dual Front is a new permanent mode for the game, taking the core attack-and-defence gameplay and expanding it into something much more freeform and dynamic. This is a 6v6 mode, instead of the usual 5v5, and it tasks you with attacking and defending at the same time.</p>
<p>There’s just the tiniest hint of MOBA to this idea, in a concentrated form, as the map has two lanes – one dedicated that you can attack down and one that you need to defend –&nbsp;with the goal to capture each sector in turn and eventually neutralise the opposition base. Both teams have a practically identical experience, with the map a mirror image, though with one side having a run-down red brick look and the other a more renovated feel so that it’s possible to read where you are.</p>


<p>It’s a big map, with each sector feeling like a half or two-thirds sized version of a Siege map, still giving plenty of room for different attack options for the randomised objective placement. In the middle there’s then a neutral zone, an area where assignments can appear, such as a hostage rescue, giving you a bit of a boost.</p>
<p>The juggling act for your team is whether to prioritise attack or defence, trying to figure out and counter whatever it is that the opposition is doing at the same time. The mode is still very restricted and constrained in similar ways to the rest of Rainbow Six Siege, so you can only attack sectors one at a time, and only after the defenders have had some time to prepare. There’s also a bit of a catch up mechanic, so if one team pulls ahead, then the other team needs less time to plant and capture a zone.</p>

<p>It’s a really interesting concept, but it’s initially quite a messy one without an established team around you. It feels like there’s less room for freelancing here, as you do need to coordinate the balance between attack and defence, and to construct a sensible mix of operators. Each season will have a curated pool of operators to choose from, but there’s a mix of attacking and defending characters, giving a wider set of gadgets and abilities to use.</p>
<p>What will be important is how Ubisoft take this foundation and continue to push it forward over the coming seasons and years. Alongside Dual Front, Siege X is also bringing big changes to the underlying game engine and features. Stay tuned for those in around an hour…</p>

			<p>Focus Entertainment Publishing and Saber Interactive have just <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1900226944853004392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the surprise announcement that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3 is already in development.</p>
<p>Now, don't get us wrong—there was never any doubt that a sequel would be made, given the resounding commercial success of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, which, last we heard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold five million units in less than three months on the market</a>. However, the timing is definitely sooner than anticipated, especially as the development team is still updating and expanding Space Marine 2. Indeed, the press release makes it a point to stress that an ambitious content roadmap is still planned for Space Marine 2, including the upcoming release of the Horde mode.</p>
<p>Anyway, Saber is promising even more spectacular and more large scale battles in Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3. Here's what John Bert, Deputy CEO of Focus Entertainment Publishing, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We have been honored by the incredible response from fans following the launch of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. We will continue to support the game with exciting content and regular updates in the coming years. Today, we are thrilled to announce that the adventure will continue with Space Marine 3. Players can look forward to an immersive campaign, a multiplayer mode, and innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games. Developed in close collaboration with Games Workshop, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3 will take the genre to new heights by introducing large-scale battles that are even more spectacular.</em></p>
<p>Matthew Karch, CEO of Saber Interactive, added:</p>
<p><em>Space Marine 2 has proven to be a transformative game for Saber. ​ It is the culmination of everything we have learned about game development in our 25 years in the business. ​ We are now starting to develop Space Marine 3, a game that carries with it tremendous expectations from our rapidly expanding fanbase. ​ While we will continue to support and grow the Space Marine 2 universe over the coming years, we will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third installment. We view this as an opportunity to create a true love letter to the Warhammer 40.000 universe</em>.</p>
<p>What are you most looking for Saber to improve in Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive have confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 3&nbsp;</em>is officially in development, so get ready to suit up as Ultramarine Demetrian Titus once more.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/news/focus-entertainment-publishing-announces-the-development-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the two studios, as well as&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>IP holder Games Workshop, confirm that the game is coming, and that it'll offer "intense, brutal, and spectacular gameplay" while remaining "true to the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe".</p>

<p>Focus deputy CEO John Bert says you can look forward to an "immersive campaign" in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>, as well as multiplayer gameplay and "innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-marine-3-confirmed-space-marine-2.jpg?itok=4qHDQBSZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-marine-3-confirmed-space-marine-2.jpg?itok=ly2ZbcLK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 3&nbsp;</em>has officially been confirmed.</figcaption></figure><p>Bert also promises "large-scale battles that are even more spectacular", so if you thought the hordes of Tyranids that swarmed your squad in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>were impressive, it sounds like you ain't seen nothing yet.</p>

<p>Saber CEO Matthew Karch, meanwhile, says&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>was "transformative" for his company, and that while he acknowledges the "tremendous expectations" surrounding&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>, he's confident his team can create "a true love letter to the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe".</p>

<p>Further details about the game are scarce at the moment, but judging by the very short teaser, we'll be seeing the return of Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus. If the past two&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>games are anything to go by, you'll likely be fighting the forces of Chaos at some point as well.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>had sold <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1879948638245261796" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over six million copies</a> at last count, it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that the game is getting a followup, but it's nice nonetheless.</p>




<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>folks are also currently working on a game that will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip" rel="nofollow">utilize a "tentpole" Hasbro IP</a>, although that IP hasn't been revealed yet.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Focus and Saber are cooking up for&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>.

            <p>
Saber and Focus Entertainment Publishing have announced Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3, another bloody serving of Adeptus Astarting with a fresh single player campaign and multiplayer component, plus unspecified "innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games". Saber will work on the new action game alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, which they assure us will continue to receive updates for "years".
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The press release in question is crammed to the visor with talk of "new heights" and suchlike, but does not, alas, contain any real details about Space Marin3, or any images beyond some key art depicting Demetrian Titus, the hero of the first two games. Still, it seems safe to say that he'll be taking his chainsword to a different bunch of marauding aliens and heretics in the threequel. The first Space Marine was all about Orks and Chaos, the second one was Tyranids and Chaos. Maybe the Drukhari and Chaos next time? Possibly the T'au Empire? I've heard they're actually quite nice.
</p>
<p>
The line about "redefining the standards of third-person action" is from John Bert, Focus Entertainment Publishing's deputy CEO. There's also some chinwaggery in the release from Saber SEO Matthew Karch, who notes that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">well-wrought</a> and best-selling Space Marine 2 has been "transformative" for Saber, a company that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saber-interactive-splits-from-embracer-taking-3d-realms-slipgate-metro-devs-and-more-with-them">until recently languished in the claws of cheery job-loss merchants Embracer</a>. "While we will continue to support and grow the Space Marine 2 universe over the coming years, we will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third instalment," Karch writes. 
</p>
<p>
The release concludes with the note that parent company Pullup Entertainment (previously Focus Entertainment - I guess they've decided they need to hit the gym more often) have a revenue announcement on April 17th 2025. Perhaps we'll hear more about Space Marine 3 then. 

</p>
<p>Any hopes to share at this point? I would like a more knowing take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">the Imperium's fascism</a>. I would also like Titus to get himself all chopped up and converted into a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dreadnought">Dreadnought</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
