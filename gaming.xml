            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647451/blue-prince-review-architectural-roguelike-balatro<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I know, I know. It’s become a bit of a faux pas to describe one game using another and yet I am compelled. After a few hours with <em>Blue Prince</em>, I realized this game elicits the same feelings in me as <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">Balatro</a></em>. Not because it has anything to do with cards or passive-aggressive clowns named Jimbo, but because those hours I played passed as breezily by completely unnoticed as they did when I was knee deep in the poker roguelike. <em>Blue Prince</em> is a time-stealer and as with <em>Balatro</em>, you will be happy to be robbed.</p><p><em>Blue Prince</em> is an architectural puzzle mystery game from developer Dogubomb. In it you play as a young man who inherits his uncle’s magical mansion. On your first day at the house you receive a note laying out the rules by which you will earn your inheritance. This house has 45 rooms. Find the secret 46th room that’s not displayed on any of the mansion’s blueprints (get it, <em>Blue Prince</em> / blueprints) and the house is yours. </p><p>To find the 46th room you must create or “draft” rooms one after the other connecting them via their doors. You start each day with 50 steps and passing into a room takes one step (or more depending on the type of room). When you run out of steps you are exhausted and forced to retire for the day. At the end of every day, the layout you drafted is reset and you must start all over again with a blank mansion.</p><p>At its heart, <em>Blue Prince</em> is a roguelike puzzle game laid over an overarching narrative involving the secrets of your extended family. Its main mechanic is drafting rooms and laying them out over the mansion’s 5x9 grid. Each room comes with any number of doors that open in one of the four cardinal directions. You build your map each day by trying to connect as many rooms with as many doors while avoiding dead ends as much as possible. </p><p>There are so many different types of rooms to draft with their own strengths and weaknesses. Bedrooms, for example, reward you with additional steps extending your day. Closets yield goodies like keys to unlock doors but are dead ends. Drafting a puzzle room early, like the billiard room or the parlor, rewards you with gems to draft higher quality rooms like the library or the laboratory. The more rooms you draft, the more likely you are to encounter rooms you haven’t seen before revealing secrets and clues that will help you in your journey. </p><p>On top of trying to draft rooms that will yield you the most benefits, you’re also trying to draft rooms in the correct sequence. Tinkering with the breaker box in the circuit breaker room, will let you open the door in the garage, bringing you that much closer to finding the 46th room. It’s all an interconnected, incredibly dense puzzle game that makes use of every ounce of your brain power to solve and then some. You <em>will</em> need to take notes – the game tells you as much. And any time I need to write stuff down to play a game effectively, it is cooking with the highest quality gas.</p><p>Solving puzzles in <em>Blue Prince</em> brings all my powers of spatial, mathematical, narrative, and memory reasoning to bear. And the thing I love about it, something I don’t think I’ve ever said about a video game ever, is its pacing. <em>Blue Prince</em> unfolds almost infinitely — solving one puzzle leads to the next and on and on like a fractal of overlapping mysteries. Some of those mysteries are easy and satisfying to figure out. When I first encountered the darkroom, the lights went out. Not only could I not see what was in there, the darkness forced me to draft the next room without seeing what it was or if it was a dreaded dead end. But I remembered from the circuit room seeing a darkroom setting on the breaker box.</p><p>On my next run, I made sure to draft the circuit room and flip on the power before drafting the darkroom. When I went in, <em>voila</em>, the power stayed on and I collected a treasure trove of new clues. </p><p>But the game’s other mysteries are less intuitive and can lead to frustration that no amount of note taking can assuage. The dartboard in the billiard room is a mathematical puzzle with different colors on the board corresponding to different functions. At first it was easy enough to figure out: blue next to a number means addition, yellow is subtraction, pink is multiplication, and purple is division. Instead of recalling the elementary lesson of PEMDAS, order of operations is determined by working from the inside of the dartboard out.</p><p>After about 20 or so days, when I had everything down pat, the dartboard began throwing new symbols and colors that were far less intuitive. I just could not figure out what to do and it got so frustrating that I avoided drafting the billiard room altogether, locking me out of obtaining valuable keys.</p><p>(<strong>Author’s note</strong>: another extremely frustrating and frankly unacceptable thing about the billiard room is that solving the puzzle requires the ability to see in color and as of this writing there are no colorblind settings. From comments about this on social media, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/557876/blue-prince-colorblind-color-assist-mode-update">the developers are working on deploying colorblind options</a>, hopefully soon.)</p><p>There is a story in <em>Blue Prince </em>but from what I’ve seen so far, it has little bearing on the puzzles and isn’t all that interesting. There’s a mystery involving members of your family’s political leanings, a missing author, and a disgruntled employee, but I’m so hungry to figure out how to open the door to the basement that I don’t pay it much mind. I’m about 27 hours in, which feels pretty hefty for a puzzle game. And I feel with all that I’ve uncovered and all I think I have left to uncover, I could go 30 hours more and it would pass in the blink of an eye.</p><p><em>Blue Prince</em> is out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With the president putting a 90-day pause on the bulk of his announced tariffs and instead maintaining a 10-percent across-the-board tax, Nintendo is stockpiling consoles in the U.S. in advance of the planned June 5 launch date. In other news, new puzzle game <em>Blue Prince </em>has taken critics by storm, becoming the highest-rated game so far this year, and the developers of <em>No Mercy</em>, a visual-novel-style game with subject matter many find reprehensible, announced that they will be pulling the game from Steam, though they also defended the game in the same announcement.

		<p>Anyone buying <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will not be getting the fullest, most complete version of the game. Nintendo has now confirmed that the Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass DLC is not bundled in with the Switch 2 Edition release, whether phsyical, digital or upgrade, and will instead remain a separate purchase.</p>
<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc">IGN</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson said, “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does not include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass DLC. That DLC is available as a separate purchase.”</p>


<p>Pricing has been a major bone of contention around the Nintendo Switch 2 release, and this will be another sour note for the Switch 2 Editions of a small selection of games. These upgraded versions of games can bring technical improvements and added content, but are premium upgrades that start at $10 for Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">in contrast to free patches that will be made for other titles</a>. The two Zelda games included will, however, have their Switch 2 Edition upgrades made available through Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.</p>
<p>Breath of the Wild’s Switch 2 Edition brings improved resolution and performance, support for HDR, an a new Zelda Notes feature for Nintendo Switch smartphone app. Sticking with USD for simplicity, that brings a $10 price hike over the original release, whether both afresh as a $70 game, or with a $10 upgrade cost. The Expansion Pass is then a further $20 on top.</p>
<p>The Expansion Pass DLC for Breath of the Wild features two DLC packs: The Master Trials, which added some new game modes with the Trial of the Sword challenge, Master Mode difficulty, and the Hero’s Path feature, and The Champion’s Ballad, which added a new dungeon, story content, gear, additional challenges and the Master Cycle Zero motorbike.</p>

<p>Outside of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/zelda_breath_of_the_wild_and_splatoon_2_will_get_new_physical_releases_with_dlc_included_in_japan">a Japan-exclusive Expansion Pass edition of the game</a> which added the DLC onto the game card, there’s no Game of the Year edition, so it is most straightforward to keep the Switch 2 Edition purely for the new console upgrade. Nintendo has been very strict to maintain the price of their games over the Switch generation, and any newcomers are really seeing and feeling that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/nintendo-clarify-that-physical-switch-2-editions-will-not-feature-download-codes/">Nintendo has clarified</a> that physical Switch 2 Edition games will on Switch 2 cartridges and will not bundle a download code with an original Switch card.</p>

<p>In the latest saga of Battlefield leaks, the community has voiced its frustration of leaked code suggesting that SBMM is in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>The news first surfaced earlier this week, after internal code obtained by the Battlefield Labs playtests showed that Battlefield 6 will have matchmaking commands to match players of similar skill – AKA, Battlefield 6 will have Skillbased Matchmaking (SBMM).</p>



<p>Predictably, the community was up in arms about the leak, with most voicing their frustrations that they would much rather have a server browser as games such as Call of Duty, which notoriously has a harsh SBMM system, is no longer enjoyable. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-developers-weigh-in-on-sbmm">Battlefield Developers Weigh in on SBMM</h2>



<p>David Sirland, one of the Lead Producer’s on Battlefield 6 took to the closed Battlefield Labs Discord server to explain (uploaded by Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jwo1s3/psa_from_david_sirland_in_bf_labs_surrounding_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Old_Doubt5886</a>) the situation around Battlefield 6 and SBMM. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“PSA: 2042 has SBMM according to this definition – this is what I tried to detail above yesterday. It has a factor of skill, its used, but ping and time to game is the TOP priority, and in a 64 player game our want is to spawn a server that starts as soon as possible – thus the skill factor is negligable in terms of sorting into servers. Also with a party that is more or less ignored. Just for clarity – saying SBMM is bad is not really useful. What you really want to say is “Heavy SBMM where skill separation is a priority is bad”.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t make skill as a factor in matchmaking bad wholesale, on the contrary we need a skill value to make balanced teams – no matter the ranges of skills total on a server. It wouldn’t be fun if all high skill players ended up on the same team, would it?</p>



<p>Just to calm this thing down a tad – the fact a skill value is in the matchmaker (it’s been there since we started being able to matchmake BTW) – doesn’t mean we are going with a heavy handed SBMM solution. Quite the opposite, Battlefield is at its best when you play the all out war modes with friends and different types of players – we do not want to limit that.</p>



<p>All of this is also true (skill being important for team balancing) regardless of in which way you join the server For reference, did you feel like the BF labs playtests were heavy handed SBMM? No? then we good. It’s the same matchmaker and settings we’ll use (with tweaks if we find any issues of course).”</p>

<p>So, at face value at least, the current theories on Battlefield 6 and SBMM are unwarranted, at least where Sirland is concerned. Of course, things are subject to change during development, but <strong>that’s why</strong> Battlefield Labs was set up an NDA’s have been enforced. On this, Battlefield Community Manager <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jwo1s3/comment/mmkie21/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">T0TALfps</a> weighed in on the recent leaks.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Okay&nbsp;<strong>enough,</strong></p>



<p>Battlefield Labs is about building and collaborating on the future of Battlefield, and we want to do that in the correct way. I want to remind everyone things that are taking place in Battlefield Labs may or may not make their way to the final finish line. This is the greatest thing about this program, it allows us the ability to get creative, see what works with those involved, gain educated and informed feedback from those that are participating and potentially spot bugs around the features too. We’ve long wanted to implement this program, responding to your requests for greater involvement and a return to this type of reactivity around all things Battlefield.</p>



<p>There is a specific time and place for the wider community to learn about new features and functionalities, and this is not it. We will address various topics and expand participation in Battlefield Labs when appropriate, but the constant reposting of things is not that time or place. Individuals are and will continue to be removed if they continue to violate the NDA that they agreed to.</p>



<p>Information and content that gets shared&nbsp;<strong>is out of context</strong>&nbsp;and often with a narrative wrapped around it that is doing damage to the trust and transparency we want to establish. Things simply are not the same when it comes to hearing about something out of context versus actually experiencing it – or reading about it in detail with the correct descriptions around it.</p>



<p>While the allure of brief internet fame might be tempting, it undermines our efforts to remain open and communicative. And quite honestly, if that is your intention, then I question where this aligns with the interests of our, THIS, community.</p>



<p>We all can agree that we wanted to have an environment that allowed for testing and collaborating once again. We want to be as transparent as we can be, you have seen us return to the values you once recognized in us. We all want to make Battlefield play like Battlefield, but we cannot do it if the trust continues to be tampered with. We must be allowed the ability to do it right – alongside you all and in the correct way.</p>



<p>And to all those of you who do wish to see things grow, we commit to you that we are reading your comments and feedback in and out of the program, we are seeing and exploring your experiences with Battlefield, and we are paying attention just like what we stated in our&nbsp;first Community Update&nbsp;&lt;3</p>



<p>If you want to be a part of the moment and participate in Battlefield Labs you can sign up via&nbsp;<a href="http://go.ea.com/bflabs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://go.ea.com/bflabs</a>&nbsp;and rest assured that your moment will arrive.</p>



<p>One final reminder that when it comes to features, content, functionality, and more – it is only official when we share it and we are comfortable with the topic at hand.</p>



<p>To those who are here for community and wish to see a bright future for Battlefield, thank you – truly. I truly believe community has been closer to the development of Battlefield than ever before, and I have been around for quite some years now. What we’re doing is something different, I know that you feel that too. It is truly refreshing to see you experience pre-alpha content and share your thoughts but for us to then react and change in a short time frame – it’s something else.</p>



<p>Rules aren’t fun, but they exist to make it better for us all. Thank you to those that are abiding by them, but thank you for your trust and time too to make this great for you – our community.</p>



<p>Let’s keep doing this together, and do expect more Community Updates in the very near future!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/nintendo-clarify-that-physical-switch-2-editions-will-not-feature-download-codes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has clarified that physical versions of Nintendo <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Switch 2 Edition</a> games will feature <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> game cards, and will <em>not</em> be an original Switch card and a download code.</p>
<p>Various things have kicked up a storm in the wake of the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal, and one of the biggest bones of contention has been with regard to Switch 2 Editions upgrades of various games. Thanks to a mixture of ambiguous wording on Switch 2 Edition game packshots – see the gallery below – and erroneous statements by customer support, it was believed that Switch 2 Editions could be an original Nintendo Switch cartridge alongside an upgrade code to redeem at the Nintendo eShop.</p>


<p>We were caught up with this story as well, and apologise for the confusion.</p>

		
		

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/">Vooks</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>That physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card (i.e. they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code). Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, Nintendo’s Switch 2 Edition games – which includes upgrades for the likes of Breath of the Wild, Kirby and the Forgotten Lands and Super Mario Party Jamboree – will all be coming on the new red Switch 2 specific game cards. This means that they will not be usable with the original Switch consoles.</p>

<p>Third parties may make use of digital downloads in a box, or (while not explicitly stated) even the new Game Key cartridge, which acts as a digital license to download and play the game.</p>
<p>Of course, if you already have a game for Nintendo Switch, you will be able to purchase an upgrade via the eShop to get the added features and enhancements.</p>
<p>Switch 2 Editions are typically a mix of boosting game graphics and performance with a new build of the game for Switch 2 and added content. However, there are also a number of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">Nintendo first party games that will receive free updates</a> to support the Switch 2’s increased power, typically in instances where there’s just a bump to resolution and frame rate with minimal extra work.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Marathon Coming to Xbox and PS5? Console Version Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-marathon-coming-xbox-and-ps5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-marathon-coming-to-xbox-and-ps5-console-version-explained.1162545/</guid>

<p>Marathon is the next contender in the extraction shooter space, attempting to carve out a name for itself alongside games like Escape from Tarkov. It’s a sci-fi epic that prioritises teamwork and collaboration over milsim mechanics, and for that reason alone, it’s a refreshing title that promises to disrupt the genre.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’re answering a critical question that many have on their mind: ‘Is Marathon coming to Xbox and PS5?’</p>



<p>Read on to learn what we know about Marathon on console.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-marathon-be-on-console">Will Marathon be on Console?</h2>



<p>Most extraction shooters are only ever released on PC. The top dog is Escape from Tarkov, which is PC exclusive. Then you’ve got competing titles like Gray Zone Warfare, Marauders, and Dark &amp; Darker, all of which are locked to PC platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Marathon will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC</strong>, emerging as one of the few extraction shooter titles on console platforms.</p>



<p>It’s a revolutionary thing that’s sure to turn heads, given that it has been compiled by the creators of Halo and Destiny.</p>



<p>You can wishlist <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marathon on PS5</a>, and the Xbox link is coming soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marathon-crossplay">Is Marathon Crossplay?</h2>



<p>Marathon will be a fully crossplay and cross-save title, which means you can play with your friends on PC if you’re playing on Xbox. It also means that if you play on PC then want to pick up your progress on PlayStation 5, you’re more than welcome.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most seamless ways to play games, and it makes sense that Bungie would support it, given how progress works in other titles that the team has worked on.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Marathon? Let me know what you think about this upcoming extraction shooter in the comments, or check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/11/baldurs-gate-3s-final-update-goes-live-next-tuesday<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><span><span>Baldur's Gate 3, one of the best games of 2023, is just as popular as ever a year and a half after its full release. In the months since its launch, developer Larian Studios has put out seven major patches to fix bugs, correct errors, and add new content. </span></span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735"><span><span><span><span>Last November, it announced the eighth patch</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>, boasting more content than most of the previous patches, would be the final one. Today, the studio announced it goes live on April 17, next Tuesday. To celebrate, Larian will be hosting a live stream on April 16 at 1 PM UTC on its </span></span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/larianstudios"><span><span><span><span>Twitch</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> and </span></span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LarianCFH/videos"><span><span><span><span>YouTube channels</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h5ZC8Y_X78Y" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><span><span>Patch eight will add three major pieces of content. The first, and arguably the most anticipated, is full crossplay between consoles, Mac, and PC. The second addition is a photo mode, a common post-launch feature for modern big-budget games. Players can pose party members, select different lens and filter options, and add frames and stickers to their final photos.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The third addition is the most impactful: twelve new subclasses, one for each class in the game. As always, the classes are pulled from the wide pool of existing character classes in Dungeons &amp; Dragons fifth edition, slightly tweaked to better fit the Baldur's Gate style of play. The subclasses are as follows:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Bard - College of Glamour</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Barbarian - Path of Giants</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Cleric - Death Domain</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Druid - Circle of Stars</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Paladin - Oath of the Crown</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Fighter - Arcane Archer</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Monk - Drunken Master</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Ranger - Swarmkeeper</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Rogue - Swashbuckler</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Sorcerer - Shadow Magic</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Warlock - Hexblade</span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span>Wizard - Bladesinging</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>Personally, I'm most excited to try an Arcane Archer (a class I don't love in its tabletop iteration) and to see the new animations for the Swarmkeeper Ranger. Patch eight for Baldur's Gate 3 goes live on April 17 on all platforms.</span></span></p>

This time, you can finally snag a representation of your lead character from the story, as the two new figures are the male and female default appearances for Commander Shepard.</p>

<p>Each of the two polyvinyl figures stands nine inches in height and features sculpting and paint by Substance Model Works. Jane Shepard appears with the hard-to-beat Carnifex pistol, a favorite of many Mass Effect players. John Shepard carries an M-8 Avenger and his omni-blade. Both figures join a broader cast of character figures that have already been released in the line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I played through multiple runs at Mass Effect over the years with both the male and female versions of the lead, but I always customized my hero away from the default design. Thankfully, I can maintain the illusion of my personal Shepard, as each of the two new figures comes with swappable N7-helmeted heads; in my mind, it will be my version of the iconic character hiding behind the mask.</p>

<p>The new Commander Shepard figures join the line-up in February of 2026, but you can pre-order <a href="https://www.darkhorsedirect.com/products/mass-effect-commander-jane-shepard-figure">Jane</a> or <a href="https://www.darkhorsedirect.com/products/mass-effect-commander-john-shepard-figure">John</a> right now if you want to lock in your purchase. Each figure will run you $69.99.</p>

<p>Check out the gallery below for a close-up look at each of the two figures.&nbsp;</p>

The game is an all-new version of the original Trails in the Sky, remaking the PS3 and PS Vita game with full 3D high-res visuals, new voice acting, and overhauled gameplay. Whether you're a long-time fan of the series wanting to revisit the classic entry in a new way, or are looking to experience it for the first time, you can preorder physical copies now at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F2B89MSC,B0F2B8XZ17&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/y7q0lp7jm2a8y?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17444118258707?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Bonuses</h2><p dir="ltr">No preorder bonuses have been announced for Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter. We'll update this section if anything is revealed ahead of launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is a remake of Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. It will return players to where the long-running Trails series began. The game follows adoptive siblings Joshua and Estelle Bright, who join the Bracers peacekeeping organization. They're soon caught up in an international conspiracy and must join forces with various other characters to thwart a deadly coup. While it will maintain the same plot as the PS3 version, it uses the same engine as the latest entry in the series, Trails Through Daybreak, and will feature an all-new English voice acting class. There will also be a long list of gameplay changes, the most notable being the inclusion of two battle systems--one is a revised version of the original version's turn-based combat, and the other is a real-time system, and you'll be able to swap between on the fly.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering there are now 15 mainline games in the Trails series, giving new players a modernized way to experience the original as a jumping-on-point is a welcome decision.

<p>Clair Obscur Expedition 33 launches soon, so here is everything you need to know about the release date and times. </p>



<p>Sanfall Interactive’s debut project, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a>, turns the traditional turn-based format on its head by adding real-time combat mechanics. The game is set in a distorted version of late 19th-century France and follows an expedition group with a unique goal. </p>



<p>In this universe, there is a paintress, and when she paints a number on a monolith, every one of that age turns to smoke and fades away. Every year, an expedition group departs to stop the paintress before their age is painted, and Expedition group 33 is the latest to attempt to change their fate. </p>

            <p>
FragPunk - the chaotic, neon-splurged hero shooter from NetEease - has sorted out the "unexpected technical challenges" it ran into earlier this year while trying to get the console version out the door. As such, it's finally coming to Xbox Series X/S and PS5 on 29th April.
</p>
<p>
FragPunk's 5v5 (and free-to-play) shooting action ticks plenty of familiar genre boxes as its 12 distinct Lancer "heroes" hit the battlefield, but it's all made spicier thanks to its card-based modifier system - which sees teams pooling their earned chips at the start of a match to decide which of three possible options they want to inflict on everyone this turn.
</p>
<p>
Choices are pulled form a pool of over 150 Shard Cards, meaning rules can be twisted in sometimes dramatic ways. You might decide to give everyone massive heads, for instance, or remove all guns from play. Or you might choose a card that lets allies lay eggs to restore health or that teleports enemies back to their spawn point after taking damage.

<p>
It's got its fair share of issues, as<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunk-could-be-brilliant-if-it-wasnt-so-obsessed-with-being-a-hyper-rewarding-slot-machine"> Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell recently opined</a> after playing FragPunk for a while, but its match-weirdening gimmick is a good one. "For someone who's always found this genre just a little too self-serious," Chris wrote, "this stuff is perfection... all the less desirable stuff from this genre, the toxicity and the almost excessive levels of tension, are quite easily defused when the thing people are shrieking about is called 'Mass Crab Walk'. In playing a highly moreish few hours of it this week, I've had a blast."
</p>
<p>
FragPunk was originally supposed to launch for Xbox and PlayStation early last month, at the same time as PC version. However, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunk-console-launch-delayed-as-neteases-shooter-hits-pc-this-week">opted for a last-minute console delay</a>, blaming "unexpected technical challenges". Now, though, in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/netease-games_we-appreciate-your-patience-lancers-were-ugcPost-7316113990856695808-FrBu">short message shared on social media</a>, the company has confirmed a 29th April release for FragPunk on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, thanking players for their "continuing patience and unwavering support."
</p>
<p>
It's also promising non-specific "gifts" to console players "as a token of our gratitude and to make up for the delay". These will be sent to all newly registered console game accounts and include time-limited event rewards from the start of Season 1 up to 29th April. "A detailed list of all above mentioned rewards and their distribution methods," it adds, "will be shared in a separate announcement before launch."

A voice in my head rambles about death, civilization, and the violent heist I’ve been tasked to help with. After every grisly death, my synthetic body is reborn. A sprawling, AI-controlled city stretches out in front of me, like an ultra-advanced, grimly efficient panopticon situated galaxies away at the end of history. The first hour of <em>Metal Eden</em> feels like a mashup of <em>RoboCop</em> and <em>The Matrix</em> and I dig it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195259" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Phantom Liberty Is Undoing One Key Thing That Cyberpunk Got Right" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="229" data-playlist="195259,195386,195734" data-current="195259"><div><p>Phantom Liberty Is Undoing One Key Thing That Cyberpunk Got Right</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20720.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Anyone who watched The Game Awards 2024 showcase might recall a dizzyingly frenetic and neon-fueled trailer midway through the show that definitely looked like it might be for Bungie’s distinctly stylized sci-fi shooter <em>Marathon</em>. But it was actually for<em> Metal Eden</em>, the upcoming cyberpunk boomer shooter from Reikon Games, best known for the bloody 2017 twin-stick shooter <em>Ruiner</em>. It arrives May 6 on console and PC and I recently played the free demo on PlayStation 5.</p><p>Like the prior indie-sized release, <em>Metal Eden</em> is unequivocally metal and not afraid of embracing slick aesthetics and evocative jargon simply because they look and sound really cool. But in some ways it’s a much more ambitious game, not least of all because it’s a first-person shooter in a 3D world with the unmistakable sheen of an Unreal Engine 5 project. The mission design and gameplay feel are <em>fine</em>, and aptly described as <em>Doom</em> crossed with <em>Ghostrunner</em>. But what had me pressing on was the neat worldbuilding and confident style. </p><figure id="" data-id="0318d3c08381c8abea0e1734ae2166ec" data-recommend-id="image://0318d3c08381c8abea0e1734ae2166ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a city at daylight.

<p>Before Dragon Breath shotguns had an opportunity to take over Warzone’s meta, Raven Software temporarily removed the attachment in the April 11 update, and Treyarch also rolled out a change to the Shattered Veil boss in Black Ops 6 Zombies. </p>



<p>The return of Verdansk in Warzone in Season 3 caused a massive uptick in interest. <span>As a result, some players who previously dropped the game are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/author/ryanlemay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">re-installing Warzone on PS5</a> and other platforms.  </span></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-player-count-off-charts-as-verdansk-exceeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision</a>&nbsp;is reportedly pleased with the results, and the devs have already previewed new content for the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-warzone-season-3-reloaded-release-date-expected-start-time-verdansk-ranked-play-new-multiplayer-maps-smg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mid-season update</a>. In addition, the Warzone and Black Ops 6 teams are constantly releasing new minor patches to improve the overall experience. </p>

<figure><figcaption>Black Ops 6 players universally praised the new Zombies map. Image via Activision </figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-12-gauge-dragon-s-breath-ammunition-removed">12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath Ammunition Removed</h3>



<p>Warzone players discovered that using 12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath ammunition and the Kimura RYL33 Laser Light together on the MX Guardian transformed the shotgun into the best close-range weapon in the game. </p>



<p>With both attachments equipped, the MX Guardian had an unbelievable 280-millisecond time-to-kill speed in gunfights up to five meters, and that only dropped off to 560 ms from 10 meters. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision</a> explained, “12 Gauge Dragon’s Breath ammo was only meant to be available on specific trigger types for the MX Guardian Shotgun. As such, we’ve disabled this attachment until we can address the issue.” </p>



<h3 id="h-shattered-veil-boss-changes">Shattered Veil Boss Changes </h3>



<p>The Shattered Veil boss was designed to be challenging in BO6 Zombies, but players used an exploit with the Void Sheat that allowed it to do more damage than intended. This update addresses that issue and makes a few changes, to provide other options to use against the boss. </p>

<p>Larian Studios announced an impending final update for Baldur’s Gate 3 in <strong>November 2024, </strong>but it’s only now that it’s shaping up to be released. It’s simply known as ‘Patch 8’, and it’s set to introduce some major changes and additions to Baldur’s Gate 3, which Larian has already moved on from.</p>



<p>Amongst these additions are crossplay mechanics, photo mode, and an array of subclasses.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-is-patch-8-being-released-in-baldur-s-gate-3">When is Patch 8 Being Released in Baldur’s Gate 3?</h2>



<p><strong>Larian has confirmed that Patch 8 will be released globally across all platforms on April 15.</strong> This marks the final major update for the award-winning epic that launched to an overwhelmingly positive reception when it was released in August 2023.</p>



<p>The team has been reluctant to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-comes-next-year-and-includes-cross-play-photo-mode-and-more/">release Patch 8</a> in Baldur’s Gate 3 until it was as close to perfect as possible, it seems. It has been in testing for months and that only came after strenuous efforts to polish the new features.</p>



<p>It has also been reported that Baldur’s Gate 3 will go on sale when Patch 8 is released on April 15, which is sure to bring about a spike in sales as newcomers jump on board to find out what all the fuss has been about over the last year and a half.</p>



<p>In January, Larian Studios confirmed that it had shifted priorities and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-have-moved-their-full-attention-to-the-next-game/">sighted the ‘next game’</a> for the team as the core focus. Baldur’s Gate 3 will get Patch 8, and then no more major updates are set to follow – but the game remains popular regardless.</p>



<p>Will the Patch 8 update in Baldur’s Gate 3 bring you back to the game? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/talisman-the-magical-quest-5th-edition-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Questing through dangerous dungeons in search of loot and magical artifacts goes together with board games like peanut butter and chocolate, and the Talisman: The Magical Quest Game series was one of the first to make that combination so compelling. The first edition of Talisman was released back in 1983 by Games Workshop – now best known for their Warhammer and Lord of the Rings tabletop war games – introducing players to its various regions and the Crown of Command. Now, more than 40 years later, Avalon Hill has released the fifth edition of Talisman, and once more, you will be able to test your mettle against the dragon and see if you can claim the crown for yourself.</p><div catalogid="7058f2f2-e805-4c66-bfe7-40102c74cecc" id="217979"><div id="217979" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Talisman: The Magical Quest Board Game (5th Edition)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Talisman, you and up to five friends select from 12 possible characters in this contest for the Crown of Command. These include a nimble thief, an arcane wizard, and a mighty warrior, among others. This latest edition of Talisman maintains a similar flow to previous iterations – roll dice, move to a space where you may draw an adventure card that could spawn a monster, grant you a magic item, or send you to a tavern where a dice roll determines your fate. Then it's the next player's turn, and this cycle repeats until a character who has managed to claim one of the titular Talisman relics passes through the Valley of Fire and defeats the powerful Elder Dragon, claiming the Crown of Command and winning the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This rather simplistic – or perhaps <em>aged</em> – approach to adventure board games is not a detriment but rather a point in Talisman’s favor. Right now, there is no shortage of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign-style board games</a> that feature grand adventures, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-the-board-game-review">Elden Ring</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-review">Divinity: Original Sin</a>, and even Avalon Hill’s other Games Workshop revival, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heroquest-buying-guide">HeroQuest</a>, feeling like evolved extensions of Talisman. However, many modern examples can be intimidating and expensive for younger players or those new to the hobby. While it may not be a game I reach for with my seasoned group of gaming friends, I can see it being a great choice when hanging out with my nephews or a group of friends who are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">less experienced with board games</a> but open to trying something new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the actions you take on your turn may seem mundane compared to more modern adventure games, much of Talisman’s appeal lies in the balancing act of <em>Do I try to get stronger, or do I move ahead?</em> This tug-of-war – needing to grow powerful enough to defeat the final dragon without falling too far behind – adds a layer of second-guessing to every turn. How much of a risk do you take by <em>not</em> going after that next enemy for its rewards in favor of getting a jump on the others by heading to the next area?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For all your planning, Talisman is highly luck-dependent, with nearly every aspect determined by a die roll. Calling it "Adventure Monopoly" wouldn’t be entirely off base, though fortunately, Talisman is far more fun (and much quicker to play). You roll a die to determine movement, with your only decision being whether to move clockwise or counterclockwise. The outcomes of different spaces are dictated by another die roll or a random draw from a deck of cards, and combat is yet another roll of the dice. This heavy reliance on chance won’t be for everyone, and the fifth edition includes a Fate resource which allows you to reroll dice or move up to six spaces on your turn, it doesn’t quite go for enough and I would have loved new mechanics that further mitigate the luck element and reward strategy more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This latest edition makes some changes that help speed up the game and make it less punishing for players. One example is the iconic <em>Toad</em> transformation, which turns a player into a toad, reducing their strength, craft (magic), and movement. Previously, this effect lasted three turns, but now it only lasts one. Character death has also been significantly adjusted. In past editions, when a character died, all items, followers, gold, and other trinkets they had accumulated were dropped on the space where they fell, and the player had to start fresh with a brand-new character. In the fifth edition, you retain all your items and simply move to the Village space, where you can pay for additional lives at the start of your next turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this change makes the experience "nicer" and more forgiving, I feel it also removes some of the tension and sense of danger in confrontations. As a smart inclusion, the rulebook features many of the old rules in the back as "Alternate Rules," with all new fifth-edition changes marked for easy reference by returning Talisman fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the gorgeous redone artwork featured all over the game, much of the rest of Talisman Fifth Edition’s design and aesthetic feels dated and could use some updates to help with accessibility. Text on the board and cards is very small, and the fact that all text is always facing outwards means that no one, regardless of where they are seated, will ever be able to read all of the spaces on the board. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Inside the rule book, there are descriptions of all of the spaces, but a player aid – a fairly common component in modern games – that has them listed instead would have been a great help, and is honestly something I plan to print out and keep in my game box. Even the stat tracking cones – a hallmark of the Talisman series – feel like they could have benefitted from a bit of a refresh too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides from a colorblind standpoint, being able to tell the difference between the ever so slightly large cones and the smaller ones was troublesome even up close on your own board, let alone across the table to gauge the other player’s stats. I get that it’s part of the game’s identity, but perhaps having each stat be a different shape, add some sort of stylized texture, or even just making the difference in size more easily distinguishable, would have gone a long way. Maybe a premium component add-on will come out one day that tweaks this and gives us some good coins too; worst case, there’s always 3D printing and the fan community.</p></div><div catalogid="6829f5e1-68bd-4ab1-800a-648a28062f38" id="218533"><div id="218533" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Talisman Alliances: Fate Beckons Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of add-ons, the Talisman games are known for their plethora of expansions (see our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/talisman-board-game-buying-guide">Talisman buying guide</a>), and while it's still early in this edition’s lifecycle, its first expansion does something no other Talisman expansion has done – introduce a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">co-op mode</a>. Talisman Alliances (<a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXKMv?object_uuid=358aae6e-83d9-49c7-9358-a1f1f6c97f98&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see at Amazon</a>) transforms the base game into a campaign/legacy-light experience, featuring five Trials that players work together to overcome, earning rewards they can carry forward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With envelopes and small boxes to open, my friends and I enjoyed this tweak to the formula, as it nudges the game slightly toward <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a>. We could plan how to tackle objectives, trade amongst ourselves to optimize our chances, and watch as the Doom Track made the game progressively more challenging. I wasn’t as fond of swapping out cards from the main Talisman deck before playing, but it's a small inconvenience, and Alliances’ rulebook provides clear instructions on how to reset your game to stock Talisman when you’re done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite releasing in 2024, Talisman Fifth Edition feels very much rooted in the past – for better and for worse. Some may find its mechanics outdated, while others may view them as faithful adaptations of what has kept Talisman alive for over 40 years. I land somewhere in the middle, wishing the game relied less on dumb luck and rewarded strategic play more, while also appreciating the new fifth-edition rules that make it a kinder, faster experience. The Alliances expansion also makes Talisman a fine gateway game into the adventure board game genre – made even more appealing by its reasonable retail price.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 11, 2025 6:00 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Talisman: The Magical Quest Game continues to weave its spell on players, challenging them to seize the Crown of Command and rule. While it may not find its way into my regular game-night rotation, it’s a game I’d be happy to introduce to friends, and I’m eager to see what future expansions bring. Until then, the Talismans and the Crown of Command will rest safely on my shelf – waiting for the next ruler to be crowned.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/647361/doom-limited-run-games-collector-edition-cacodemon-handheld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Will it run <em>Doom</em>? The question that has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/3/24286842/nintendo-alarmo-doom-hack-usb-custom-firmware-instructions">challenged tinkerers</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/12/15/13971784/doom-2-optimus-maximus-keyboard-working-hack">hardware hackers</a> for years has now come full circle. <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/doom-doom-ii-will-it-run-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">Limited Run Games has announced a new collector’s edition</a> of the iconic first-person shooter that ships in a box that itself can play <em>Doom</em> on a built-in screen.</p></div><p>The <em>Doom</em> plus<em> Doom II</em> Will It Run Edition, available in Switch, Xbox, PS5, and PC versions, will be available for preorder starting on Friday, April 18th, 2025 at 10:00AM ET. It’s being limited to just 666 units, naturally, at a price of $666.66. When asked if the steep but fitting price tag would be affected by tariffs, Alex Verrey, an LRG spokesperson, told <em>The Verge</em> in an email that “I do not believe there are any plans at this time to change the pricing due to tariffs.”</p><p>Although a $29.99 Standard Edition and a $99.99 Big Box Edition will also be available, the Will It Run Edition includes an assortment of extra games, levels, gameplay upgrades, and add-ons that could justify the expensive collection for <em>Doom</em>’s biggest fans. But it’s the other accessories that will be its biggest selling point.</p><p>In addition to the <em>Doom</em>-playing box, the Will It Run Edition includes four hours of the game’s soundtrack on four cassette tapes (despite audio CDs existing long before the original <em>Doom</em> launched), a three-inch Cacodemon figurine that floats atop a magnetic base, and a pack of random trading cards. But the pièce de résistance is a <em>Doom</em>-playing handheld shaped like a Cacodemon with several of its teeth doubling as controller buttons. Let’s hope LRG decides to sell that on its own one day.</p><p>On the games side of things, the Will It Run Edition includes <em>Doom</em>, <em>Doom II</em>, <em>TNT: Evilution</em>, <em>The Plutonia Experiment</em>, <em>Master Levels for Doom II</em>, <em>No Rest for the Living</em>, <em>Sigil</em> and <em>Sigil II</em>, a new Deathmatch pack with 25 maps, and <em>Legacy of Rust</em> which was released just last year. The games also feature enhancements such as alternate soundtracks, upgraded visuals, modern controller support with gyroscopic aiming, new accessibility options, and eight new translations including Korean, simplified and traditional Chinese, Portuguese, and Polish.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
