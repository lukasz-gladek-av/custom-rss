                <p>The tough times at Xbox are continuing, as Microsoft is cutting more Xbox staff. This comes at a time when Microsoft's stock price is soaring and profits are up.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA&amp;leadSource=reddit_wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Microsoft's Barcelona-based mobile game developer King is cutting 10% of its staff, which works out to around 200 people at the Candy Crush studio.

Microsoft had around 228,000 people by the latest count, so the cuts would be around 9,000 people. "We continue to implement organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace," a Microsoft spokesperson said.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer sent a memo to staff today addressing the cuts, saying the job losses were necessary to allow for the "enduring success" of Xbox.</p><p>"We will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness," he said.</p><p>Spencer also addressed the fact that the cutbacks are coming at a time when business is booming for Xbox. "I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger," he said.</p><p>The success of Xbox today is the result of "tough decision" Microsoft made previously, Spencer said.</p><p>"We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities," he added. "We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come."</p><p>Xbox has been shedding staff on a semi-regular basis for the past few years. After Microsoft closed its deal to buy Activision Blizzard, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">laid off around 1,900 people</a>.

            <p>Xbox has been hit by yet another wave of layoffs, as Microsoft has begun the process of a substantial layoff process today. At the time of writing, Zenimax and King are reportedly affected.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">According to a report by Bloomberg</a>, Microsoft's barcelona-based King Division is losing 10 percent of its staff, which comes to roughly 200 people.
</p>
<p>Staff at Zenimax have also been informed of layoffs across its European offices, though the formal number of impacted employees remains unclear. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-july-2025">According to a report by Windows Central</a>, Zenimax's London-based marketing team as well as staff in Rockville, Maryland are included in these cuts.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">A memo seen by IGN has been sent around the Xbox gaming division by Phil Spencer</a>, confirming the layoffs. You can read it in full below:
</p>
<p>"Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organisation. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today's notifications and any organisational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.
</p>
<p>"I recognise that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritise the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</p>
<p>"Prioritising our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental - it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.
</p>
<p>"HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.
</p>
<p>"Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey."
</p>
<p>News of these layoffs began circulating last month, when a report stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reportedly-set-for-major-job-cuts-from-next-week">Xbox was set to restructure much of its central-European distribution</a>. These were described by Bloomberg as a "major restructuring", and the fourth case of layoffs to hit Xbox in the last 18 months.</p>
<p>In May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-laying-off-3-of-workforce-in-biggest-round-of-cuts-since-2023-report">Xbox cut three percent of its total workforce</a>, which at the time was the biggest loss of staff since 2023. Previously in September 2024, Xbox laid off 650 employees, which it said was to "organise our business for long term success".</p>
<p>This story is developing, and will be updated with as more information is available.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio Unknown Worlds has seen key members of its leadership team - including Charlie Cleveland, who was game director on the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> - 'replaced' by owner Krafton, just months before the underwater survival sequel's long-awaited early access release.
</p>
<p>
Krafton, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-company-krafton-buys-subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds">acquired Unknown Worlds in 2021</a>, announced the leadership changes in a <a href="https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/">press release</a>. Cleveland - who founded the studio in 2001 and has variously served as designer, programmer, team lead, chief executive office, and franchise creative director since then - is out, alongside chief executive officer Ted Gill, and special projects director Max McGuire.
</p>
<p>
Krafton did not specify a reason for the departures in its announcement, but claimed it had "sought to keep the Unknown Worlds' co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game's development". All three have been replaced by Steve Papoutsis, who'll oversee the Subnautica developer while maintaining his current role as CEO at Krafton's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance. "The company wishes [Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire] well on their next endeavours," Krafton added.

<p>
There are, however, hints throughout Krafton's statement that it wasn't happy with Unknown Worlds' planned timeline for the development of Subnautica 2. There are references to owing "our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible", as well as talk of "delivering the right game at the right time" using "clearly defined metrics and targets". New Unknown Worlds boss Papoutsis is said to "fully [support] this process". Unknown Worlds had previously announced Subnautica 2 was - much like its highly acclaimed proginator - anticipated to remain in early access for two to three years.
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2 (actually the third game in the acclaimed series, following 2021's standalone Subnautica expansion Below Zero), was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">confirmed to be in the works back in 2022</a>. A first cinematic trailer finally arrived last October, tipping a nod to the sequel's new co-op mode, and additional details have slowly emerged since then in the run-up to Subnautica 2's planned early access release later this year.
</p>
<p>
So far, Unknown Worlds has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">aired small snippets of gameplay</a>, and confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-talks-silent-protagonist-a-big-ol-ocean-map-and-more-in-latest-qa">some of the things players can expect to see in Subnautica 2</a>. The sequel will, for instance, ditch Below Zero's controversially chatty lead and return to the silent protagonist approach of the first game. That's alongside the introduction of a brand-new ocean planet promising "all-new mysteries, creatures, and experiences", customisable characters, new vehicles, and more.
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2 doesn't have an early access release date yet, but when we last heard from Unknown Worlds the aim was still to launch it sometime this year.

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1383b682c207b/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's ability to essentially 'brick' Switch 2 consoles has landed it a legal challenge from Brazil's consumer rights watchdog (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-nintendos-ability-to-ban-switch-2-consoles-from-online-services-sparks-headlines-brazils-consumer-rights-watchdog-issues-legal-challenge">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Reports began to emerge recently which indicated that Switch 2 consoles in use with the MiG carts could be outright banned by Nintendo, restricting access to all online services. This became even more prevalent when it was discovered that said banned consoles were <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendos-strict-policy-on-mig-carts-is-creating-a-problem-for-secondhand-switch-2-buyers">being sold in the second-hand market</a>.</p>
<p>As such, Brazil's consumer rights watchdog has now argued that this policy violates users' rights to access the services that they've paid for. Procon-SP, Sao Paulo's office of Brazil's public Consumer Protection and Defence Program, now has a <a href="https://www.procon.sp.gov.br/nintendo-procon-sp-cobra-mudancas-contratuais-e-alerta-para-riscos-de-empresas-sem-representacao-no-brasil/">complaint filed with Nintendo</a> and has requested that this policy be removed entirely.</p>
<p>Consoles affected by the ban would display “Error Code: 2124-4508”. A few folks who have bought the console at a second-hand, discounted rate have stated that the console simply doesn't work and displays the same error message. Thankfully, in one instance, a user was able to return the device after it was bought from Walmart, but when it comes to online marketplaces, purchasing a second-hand Switch 2 might not even seem feasible given the possibility that it might not work at all.</p>
<p>Nintendo has reportedly stated that it will respond to Procon-SP's complaint within 20 days, so we'll be sure to provide an update on the case as soon as we're able.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modding site Nexus Mods has announced it's going to be making some changes in the near future thanks to UK and EU laws, and those changes will include age verification for users in those areas, plus more.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15319" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Nexus Mods content team lead SlugGirl says that the updates in question are part of Nexus Mods' "legal obligation to comply" with the UK's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Online Safety Act</a> and the EU's <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Services Act</a>, plus new guidance issued by UK regulator Ofcom.</p>

<p>This legislation means Nexus Mods must, in SlugGirl's words, "ensure [it continues] to remove illegal content and add additional restrictions to children's access to certain adult content".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nexus-mods-age-verification-uk-eu-homepage.jpg?itok=jnBAiHOB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nexus-mods-age-verification-uk-eu-homepage.jpg?itok=Gh5m68w4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nexus Mods is introducing a number of changes thanks to UK and EU law, including age verification.</figcaption></figure><p>In the UK and the EU, users will be required to verify their age "in the future". Nexus Mods says "the specifics of this are being carefully considered", as the site "want[s] to get this right" and ensure that adult content is still available for those of appropriate age. Those outside of these regions won't be subject to age verification.</p>

<p>Other upcoming changes include "a clearer, more detailed definition of what counts as illegal content" in Nexus Mods' terms and conditions, as well as new automated detection for child sexual abuse material (CSAM).</p>

<p>Adult content guidelines and categorization will also be overhauled, with new revised tags being introduced for mods that feature adult subjects like pornography, extreme violence, or suicide and self-harm.</p>

<p>Nexus Mods' block and mute systems will be rebuilt "to make them clearer and more effective", and the site's automated spam detection tools will be expanded to other site areas, including comments, which will now be "manually reviewed by staff/moderators", according to SlugGirl.</p>

            <p>Look, EA and Maxis, did you really have to do this? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s virtual humans, who've long been able to take solace in the fact that random virtual people in the street couldn't see absolutely everything their despotic overlords force them to do indoors, no longer have that privilege. The game's latest update has made glass walls for houses a thing.</p>
<p>You can also stick plants on roofs, to give your prisoners something nice to stare at through their transparent cells when you inevitably delete all of the doors and watch them die. Yep, I know the myriad crimes that've been perpetrated with pool stairs over the years, and this looks like it'll start a terrifying new chapter for sim cruelty.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-7-1-2025?utm_campaign=sims4_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_ts4-ep19bgu-tw&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=84574&amp;ts=1751455982007">the notes</a> for the update - which lays some groundwork for a paid expansion pack that's set to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-4s-next-expansion-enchanted-by-nature-looks-perfect-for-cottagecore-lovers-on-tiktok-circa-2020">make fairy sims a thing</a> on July 10th - EA show these new glass walls being used to build a cosy greehouse. You can find them under the misc heading of the wall patterns section in build mode. How nice.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's only taken a look at Reddit less than 24 hours after the update went live for me to find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1lpfl1c/took_advantage_of_the_new_update/">a glass prison cell</a> someone's stuck a sim in. It's ok, they were just doing a one-off build inspired by the glass box <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a43215821/you-season-4-joe-goldberg-glass-cage/">from that Netflix serial killer series</a>. I'm sure no sims are about to be trapped in doorless see-through cages en-masse.</p>
<p>To be fair, Sims players have been pulling tricks with windows to create walls that are pretty much transparent for a while now, but you didn't have to cut out the middlemessing, EA. Our species invented opaque walls for a reason. I know, natural light and all that.</p>
<p>Anyway, the update also introduces the ability to stick certain plants on the roofs of houses, because when you pop down the garden centre and buy some hydrangeas, you definitely want to stick them somewhere that means watering'll require some chimney climbing or a big ladder. Other changes it brings include the introduction of a special inventory section where food'll be moved once it goes off, so you can definitely not make a point of feeding your sim it anyway and maniacally cackling at the consequences.</p>
<p>Alongside a wider inventory overhaul are updates to the game's notebook and household collections designed to make those menus easier to navigate, plus a bunch of bug fixes.</p>
<p>Now go, and close the glass door to the glass office I definitely don't regret installing in my real life house on the way out.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-sims-4-update-adds-glass-walls-and-i-hope-your-virtual-humans-throw-stones-at-you-from-their-see-through-prisons]]></content:encoded>

It will also likely be the cornerstone of a long-threatened push to launch its own app store on smartphones following anti-trust losses by Apple and Google. </p><p>The current wave of mass layoffs hitting Xbox follows multiple other rounds that Microsoft has implemented in the wake of its gaming acquisition spree. Nearly 2,000 staff across the gaming division were cut in January 2024, followed by the closures of critically acclaimed studios like Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin in May. Around 600 more layoffs followed in September, with Microsoft saying at the time that no games were canceled as a result of that round of cuts. </p><p>That’s unlikely to be the case this time around, with the full extent of the culling rumored to potentially include entire studios. Microsoft’s expansive portfolio of game development teams includes ones like Obsidian Entertainment which have prodigiously shipped almost half a dozen games since being bought, as well as others like Undead Labs which have spent years working on sequels that have yet to materialize. Xbox has also been retreating from its console hardware business amidst reported pressure to improve its bottom line, leading to major first-party exclusives like <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and <em>Gears of War </em>going multiplatform on PlayStation 5.</p><p> “We’re accountable to Microsoft for running a good business, a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line,” Spencer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said at Summer Game Fest in June</a></span>, hinting at the current upheaval. “That’s kind of a foundation for us. And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we’re doing it. It does mean we have to make trade-offs through the year on things that we’re going to invest more in, things that we’re not going to invest as much in because...we are the business that we are.” </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492]]></content:encoded>

The biggest obstacles for this are the same ones you’ve been fighting against since you started playing <em>Wilds</em>: a lack of information and a cumbersome UI experience. That’s why we’re going to explain what you need to do to start your charm collection.</p><h2 id="h445145"><a id=""></a>How to Upgrade Talismans</h2><p>Forging new Talismans is simple enough. All you need to do is visit the Smithy and select the Forge/Upgrade Talismans option to see what can be crafted. Keep an eye out for any that have a red chest symbol, since you will only see their first tier on the Forge List. Unlike weapons with their upgrade tree or armor that can be strengthened all in one menu, upgrading is handled separately.</p><figure id="" data-id="5b2167e945933e900a58c03635d00c9c" data-recommend-id="image://5b2167e945933e900a58c03635d00c9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Upgrade List screen for Talismans, highlighting the Recovery Charm III." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Upgrade List screen for Talismans, highlighting the Recovery Charm III." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5b2167e945933e900a58c03635d00c9c" data-recommend-id="image://5b2167e945933e900a58c03635d00c9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Upgrade List screen for Talismans, highlighting the Recovery Charm III." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>While you’re on the Forge List, press R1/RB to switch over to the upgrade list to see which Talismans can be powered up.</strong> From here, you can select the ones you have the required materials for to upgrade them to their next tier. Each enhancement will raise their equipment skill level by one. A Blessing Charm I will grant a level 1 Divine Blessing skill, while a Blessing Charm II will grant the level 2 skill.</p><p>Upgrading a Talisman will typically replace the option with the following tier when there is one. For example, upgrading to Blessing Charm II should take it off the Upgrade List and replace it with Blessing Charm III. I say “should” because sometimes there can be a hurdle to displaying new talismans. Don’t worry, we’re going to cover that too!</p><h2 id="h445146"><a id=""></a>How to Unlock More Talismans</h2><p>Unlocking these charms is similar to how it works for armor in that you need to discover the required materials first. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> has plenty of big and small creatures for you to get parts from. The big ones can require repeated hunts to finally get a specific part, while some of the smaller life forms may require you to explore every nook and cranny of a map. <strong>If you want additional Talismans to forge or upgrade, you’ll need to hunt more monsters and capture Endemic Life as well.</strong></p><p>It’s also worth mentioning that the required materials will vary across upgrade levels. Some of them will need a mix of monster parts each time, and a few even require <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-hunter-symbols-farm-1851779176&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-hunter-symbols-farm-1851779176">Hunter Symbols</a></span>. Just like with any other equipment, I recommend using the Wishlist mechanic to help you farm all the materials you need.</p><p>That leads to another issue you might come across. <strong>If you can’t switch over to the Talismans Upgrade List tab or if it’s greyed out, that just means you don’t have anything to currently upgrade.</strong> It could be that you’ve reached the maximum level for everything or that you haven’t found all the materials to unlock an enhanced version’s recipe. The menu will be available again as soon as you have something to upgrade.</p><p>On a related note, it’s a good practice to fight any new monsters or stronger variants that are added in updates. Both <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466">Mizutsune</a></span> and Arch-Tempered Rey Dau provide materials needed for higher-level charms. Remember that you’ll need to hunt these and gather the right materials before the upgrades are made available to forge. Considering that Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is only available with limited-time events, you may need to prioritize farming particular hunts when you have the chance.</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.   </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-talisman-upgrade-forge-1851785415]]></content:encoded>

The news followed hot on the heels of the game’s Chinese beta, and the hype hasn’t stopped building since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To keep the momentum going — and true to its community-driven development ethos — Bokura extended a rare opportunity to the game’s largest English-speaking fan hub, <a href="https://x.com/StarResonanceDB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Star Resonance Database</u></a>. Through a series of curated questions sourced from the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/srdb" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Discord server</u></a>, players got the chance to directly engage with the team behind the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roy, Bokura’s founder and seasoned game producer — who’s been a driving force behind MMO titles like Dragon Nest Mobile and Ragnarok Origin: Love at First Sight — answered the community’s most burning questions, and didn’t hold back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q1: MMOs nowadays try to cater to every type of player (PvE, PvP, roleplayers, casuals, hardcore, etc.), but this often leads to a lack of proper direction and focus, resulting in none of the content reaching its full potential. In the case of Star Resonance, who is the main target audience, and which content areas will you primarily focus on?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Many members of our team, including myself, are anime enthusiasts. Combined with my years of experience as an MMO producer, I’ve always dreamed of creating an MMO with a distinct anime aesthetic. We know this is an ambitious vision because today’s market lacks games that truly cater to both anime enthusiasts and traditional MMO players. That’s exactly who we’re building this game for: players who, like us, love deep MMO experiences and vibrant anime-style worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game’s core gameplay will focus on a PvE battle and casual gameplay hybrid model. That said, as we continue updating the game and gathering player feedback, we may expand into other areas in the future.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q2: Monetization is one of the biggest concerns for Western players compared to the Eastern player base. Generally, players don’t want others to gain an unreasonable progression advantage by spending money. Specifically, the Chinese beta test revealed that the game has a premium to in-game currency conversion system without any daily or weekly restrictions, similar to many recently criticized MMOs in the West. Are you planning to adjust this for the Western community? If so, what is your current approach?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> As mentioned earlier, our game focuses on a PvE battle and casual gameplay hybrid model, so we certainly don't want a P2W environment here. While we do offer pay-for-convenience options (like currency conversion), none of these provide exclusive advantages. All progression items can be earned through gameplay, and the Trading Center ensures that even paid boosts indirectly benefit the broader community by circulating resources.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These systems are designed to help players with limited playtime or those joining later to catch up, rather than creating an imbalanced situation. We believe this approach will create a relatively balanced gameplay experience, fostering a fair ecosystem and a healthier in-game economy. We also recognize that players may want to support the development team through these optional purchases, allowing us to continue creating more high-quality content for everyone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q3: Content is another critical factor in MMOs. What kind of vertical progression-related content can casual and hardcore players currently expect to engage in Blue Protocol: Star Resonance?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We believe combat and progression are the heart of the MMO experience, so we’ve designed these systems to cater to all types of players. Through extensive iteration, we’ve created a battle system that’s easy to pick up for newcomers but deep enough to challenge veterans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For hardcore players, we’ve built a robust PvE ecosystem — from class customization to dungeons and open-world encounters. As players grow stronger, they’ll test their skills in high-stakes battles, including five-player dungeons and 20-player raids, all while earning exciting rewards. Each season will introduce fresh content like new classes, dungeons, and PvE modes to keep the experience dynamic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For casual players, we’re crafting a relaxed, social playground with features like house-building, life skills, fishing, etc. And we are also planning seasonal events for social play. Over time, we’ll add more social mini-games, aiming to create a vibrant world that feels like a shared amusement park for everyone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our goal is to create a playground where every player, whether competitive or casual, can find their own adventure.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance Exclusive Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q4: Many MMOs tend to introduce more and more systems over time. This often leads to a high barrier of entry to the game and overwhelms the active player base. To avoid this, it is much simpler to expand the currently existing systems (e.g., adding skills, expanding talent trees, etc.) instead of adding new ones. What is your design philosophy when considering the future development of the game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We’re intentional about keeping progression systems streamlined. Our philosophy is simple: Whether you’re a new player just starting out or a veteran returning after a break, we want you to jump back in effortlessly, without cramming a ton of new mechanics. That’s why we focus on expanding existing systems — adding depth, new goals, and fresh twists — rather than piling on entirely new mechanics.  Long-term, this keeps the experience fresh but familiar, ensuring that players always have meaningful ways to grow without feeling overwhelmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q5: MMOs often face the issue of mandatory progression-related content being too grindy, difficult, or time-consuming for the majority of the player base. Easing the difficulty for progression-related content, adding social-focused content for after progression, and including optional but challenging content for those seeking a challenge seem to be effective solutions. What is your current stance on this, and how do you plan to address it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Making core progression both enjoyable and accessible has always been one of our top priorities. We’re adopting a seasonal approach. Not only to introduce fresh content but also to revitalize existing activities with thematic updates, ensuring even veteran players find new excitement in familiar gameplay. We’re also deeply committed to enhancing social experiences. Social interaction is the heart of our game, and every piece of content is designed to bring players together. After all, the most memorable moments often emerge from player-driven interactions. To foster this, we’re building a more diverse game ecosystem that caters to different playstyles — whether it’s PvE, casual gameplay, or relaxed social activities. For example, we’ve invested significant effort into developing the housing system. While it was not available in the test server yet, we’ll continue expanding it through seasonal updates, enriching its depth, variety, and overall appeal to strengthen player connections. By consistently refining and expanding content this way, we aim to create a vibrant, inclusive world where every player finds their place.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/2-1751455146584.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q6: The community would love to see the game include content that enriches exploration, similar to timed or dynamic events present in other MMOs. These are unscheduled events that randomly appear throughout the world while bringing the community together. Are there any plans for such content?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> As fellow MMO players, we absolutely love dynamic events like these. They’re a fantastic way to encourage exploration and spontaneous player interaction. However, with our current development resources, we’re prioritizing refining the game’s core experience first. That said, we’re actively evaluating the potential for unscheduled world events and similar content in future updates. Stay tuned for more details as we expand the game’s horizons!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q7: Undoubtedly, the game’s player base will include many anime enthusiasts. Can we expect collaborations with anime franchises in the future?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely! As an anime-inspired MMO, our game naturally aligns with anime and manga IPs. We are also excited about future collaborations and are confident about the BPSR’s potential in this aspect. The real question is: Which IP should we team up with first? Our community team will soon launch surveys to gather your voices and preferences because we want these partnerships to reflect what you truly love. Stay tuned, your dream crossover might be closer than you think!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q8: Currently, direct player-to-player trading is not possible, and gear cannot be traded in the auction house. However, the shared warehouse system allows players to have a shared space with a limited number of friends for trading, which is especially beneficial for the life skill profession aspect of the game. Unfortunately, only a limited number of life skill materials can be placed in the shared warehouse. Do you plan to address this limitation?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> At the current stage, we’re not planning to lift these restrictions. Past experience showed that allowing ability-enhancing items in shared storage led to players feeling forced to create multiple alternate accounts. That's why we've limited such items while still maintaining a system where friends can share resources. We want to encourage cooperation without creating pressure to grind on alts.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/3-1751455171075.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q9: The current life skill system heavily favors players who have the time to create and play alternate characters, as life skill energy is character-specific. Most casual players don’t have the time or interest in creating alternate characters. How do you plan to address this and similar issues related to this in the future?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We actually do not encourage multi-character gameplay — our shared storage system is intentionally designed this way to avoid grinding on alts. We hope the players create alternate characters to experience different character body types and genders, not optimization for the main character. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've reworked the Life Skill system to optimize the experience for casual players and players who are dedicated to Life Skills. Here’s what we’ve done so far: </p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Make energy only affect trade</li><li>Allow free gathering/crafting without energy cost</li><li>Add more recipes so dedicated Life Skill players won't hit progression walls</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q10: The auto-combo system currently allows players to stand in place and attack nearby monsters with skills in random order. This does not include auto-pathing or full auto-combat, which is great. However, the MMO audience in the West strongly dislikes automated combat systems and is concerned about this feature being expanded, potentially trivializing combat and breaking immersion if many players are seen AFK-farming simple monsters. Do you plan to adjust this system for the Western audience to avoid these issues?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Our vision is to create a fun world for players to explore, so we've implemented auto-combat and auto-pathfinding in a very careful way. We want the auto function to solely reduce meaningless grind time in low-difficulty areas without compromising core gameplay. For a long-term MMO, some convenience features are necessary for players to handle relatively repetitive and low-difficulty features. Additionally, we've strictly controlled the rewards from monster grinding, which will minimize the impact of players' AFK farming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q11: Regarding the Western server structure, will it be split into regions, or can we expect a single mega-server where everyone can play together?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We’ve heard much feedback on this matter, and we completely agree that players should play together. While physical distance creates technical challenges, we're actively working toward a mega-server solution and hope to deliver satisfying results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q12: Which languages will be supported at the game’s release, and do you intend to support more languages in the future?</strong></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/4-1751455193790.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> At launch, we'll support English localization with Japanese VO. We're currently working hard on localization QA to ensure Western players get the best first impression. Additional languages may come based on player feedback — we welcome your suggestions!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q13: Will a housing system be available at the game’s release? If so, what features can players expect?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We have good news for those who love to decorate their places: the housing system will be available at launch! Players can claim their own homestead at no additional cost, which consists of two parts: an island and a house, both exclusively for the player's use. Players can invite up to four friends to cohabitate (five people total) and manage the house together. The system offers high freedom of customization. Things like building partition walls, arranging furnishings, and more will be possible. The house also includes farming features where grown crops can be sold to merchants for housing currency to be exchanged for furniture and other items. Additionally, some furniture can be crafted through life skills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q14: The website already shows the silhouette of a class using a guitar, which might be available at release. Do you plan to add more classes to the game? If so, at what intervals?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Correct! The Guitarist class will also be available at launch. They also come with two styles: One has more DPS abilities that make it easier to play solo in the open world. The other one specializes in support with strong healing and buffing abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for future classes, we surely have plans to add more classes post-launch. Stay tuned for updates!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q15: You recently revealed that the game will have controller support. Does this mean there are plans to release the game on consoles in the future? Will it be playable on the Steam Deck?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We're implementing controller support starting with mainstream models, with plans to expand compatibility. Regarding consoles and Steam Deck, while we have nothing certain to announce yet, I’ll say we are open to all possibilities!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q16: Based on the Chinese beta test, it seemed that character customization options, as well as the variety of costumes and accessories in the game, were very limited. Can we expect more options in these areas for the Western release? If so, what additional options can players look forward to?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We'll continuously add more outfits and cosmetics, including mix-and-match pieces, to allow players to express themselves as they want. While the core customization categories will remain the same, we will add more options for players to choose from: more eye shapes, hairstyles, etc.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/5-1751455216046.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q17: Are there any plans to make a character creator available before the game’s release, allowing players to take their time creating a character in advance?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We also believe this is a good idea, and a character creation code system on the client side has been developed. The function needs to be tested, but I’ll say it is very possible that players can see it at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q18: The community is eager to test and play the game in the West as soon as possible. Can you provide any hints/teasers about future tests or the release date?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We're preparing the beta for global now. Having seen CN players enjoy two tests, we know fans all over the world are excited to try BPSR. While I can't share exact dates yet, the wait won't be much longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q19: Can we expect more regular opportunities like this, both before and after the game’s release, for the community to provide feedback and ask questions? Additionally, will there be future developer live streams for the Western audience in English or with subtitles?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Yes. We have developer talks for English fans planned. Other programs, like developer live streams, are also possible. Stay tuned for more!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance launches in 2025 for iOS, Android, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Some of these rely on specific knowledge of cultural phenomena. If you have taken Dollman for a relaxing soak with Sam in the hotsprings already, you may have stumbled across a Japanese comedy tribute that has delivered a nostalgia hit to many players in Japan, but may be unfamiliar to overseas audiences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lugging cargo across Death Stranding 2’s vast Mexican and Australian open worlds is back-breaking work for everyone’s favorite porter Sam. Waiting to be discovered in hidden locations, Ghost of Tsushima-style, are hotsprings. These not only give you a chance to make Norman Reedus take off his kit again, but also reward the player with various buffs. If it wasn't amusing enough that putting a bucket on Sam’s head while in the hotspring allows him to fast travel, the hotsprings also hold other secrets. If you take Dollman for a dip and ask him to sing, <a href="https://youtu.be/sMJiCcZ4AZY?si=bKW_2IbuAZ0iHknv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he will turn into Japanese comedian Cha Kato</a>. He will then start belting out a catchy tune, with a bemused Sam doing a dance along with him. This song and dance is from the long-running Japanese comedy show “8ji da yo! Zennin shuugou! (It's 8 o'clock! Everyone gather round!)." Naturally, Dollman starts serenading you at 8pm in-game time, adding an extra detail to this tribute.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/screenshot-2025-07-02-112925-1751452231167.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Cha Kato’s hotspring cameo in Death Stranding 2.

(As a side note, the late Ken Shimura is probably the best known member of The Drifters outside Japan, with some of his sketches, like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fpbU7oxLB8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>English teacher one</u></a>, later finding fame on the internet.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Drifters’ humor, often leaning into slapstick spiced with the occasional crude joke, became popular with children too. As a family-oriented show, the version of the theme song played at the end often encouraged children to start getting ready for bed. Not content with just one version of the iconic theme, Death Stranding 2 also varies the lyrics depending on which hotspring Sam is in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This may seem like a rather random Easter egg at first glance, but the name of the theme song is “Ii yu da na” (literally, “It’s good hot water, isn’t it?”) and is about enjoying hotsprings.

In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/06/26/154443.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game*Spark</a>, Kojima was asked about Easter eggs and cameos, saying “I put all these things in.

"It's largely just evidence and nudity that's altered, and the texture changes don't affect the PC version."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, some PC players are letting VOID know how they feel about it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Do not buy this game.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Witcher 4 - Unreal Engine 5 Tech Walkthrough | State Of Unreal 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>"A quest has to be something interesting," said Weber. "I have to feel, as a player, that if I played that quest, my time was well spent and not just spent. I was busy doing stuff, and didn't think about work or taxes. I experienced a story, or something else that was worth it. That basic rule is still there 100%."</p><p>Weber went on to explain that CDPR's core philosophy is "to let people care about what they're doing," and that edict remains in place for The Witcher 4. He also stressed that the lessons learned from The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 will be reflected in the way The Witcher 4 unfolds its narrative through quests and side missions.</p><p>An early look at The Witcher 4 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-the-witcher-4-footage-looks-ridiculously-good-on-ps5-but-theres-a-caveat/1100-6532024/" data-ref-id="1100-6532024">shared during State of Unreal</a> in June. But as impressive as that was, CDPR later explained that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">a tech demo set in The Witcher 4</a> rather than the actual game. The dev team has also noted that the upcoming game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-why-the-witcher-4-is-being-developed-with-a-console-first-approach/1100-6532445/" data-ref-id="1100-6532445">being developed with a console-first approach</a>.</p><p>CD Projekt Red hasn't set a date for The Witcher 4 yet, and it's possible that it may not be ready for release until the next console generation.</p>

<p>Prime Gaming is available for Amazon Prime subscribers, offering free PC games each month and more. More details can be found on the <a href="https://primegaming.blog/prime-gaming-july-content-update-boxes-lost-fragments-paquerette-down-the-bunburrows-and-more-8d359820a1b9">Prime Gaming blog</a>.</p>
<p>As for the games themselves, a personal favourite of mine, Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered arrived back in February of last year. On its release, we awarded the game four stars while acknowledging some of its dated qualities.</p>
<p>"I still love this collection, because it's carefully made and lovingly updated, but also awkward, elbowy, frustrating and prone to leaving me stuck. It's a collection that understands that Tomb Raider was absolutely a game about its controls, and it still should be - even if it doesn't quite know how to deliver on that," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-review">Eurogamer's Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered review</a>.</p>
<p>Donlan was similarly taken with Toem on its release. "Playful challenges and a warm sense of place and character converge in this cheerful modern classic," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toem-review-a-photography-puzzler-and-a-journey-filled-with-lovely-moments">Eurogamer's glowing Toem review</a>.</p>
<p>Another highlight from this batch of games is Venba. "Food and family converge in this beautiful slice-of-life tale," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/venba-review-tasty-puzzles-and-a-recipe-book">Eurogamer's Venba review</a>, which also boasts four stars.</p>

<p>Nintendo's new hybrid lands some exclusive tweaks this time around, with the ver. 1.4.0 patch adjusting some visual blurriness that would crop up in Docked mode, and the vibration intensity in the Pro Controller 2.</p>
<p>That's not to say that the Switch 1 edition has been left out, mind you, with both versions of the game landing new area challenges, materials, recipes and more.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared on the <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/patchnote/ver_1_4_0/">Fantasy Life i website</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below. As we mentioned, some of the adjustments are for Switch 2 only (and some are unique to Steam), but we have highlighted these where appropriate in the following rundown:</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-fsr-4-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-ps5-pro-in-2026-big-chunks-of-rdna-5-are-being-designed-through-engineering-partnership-with-sony.1233759/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It has been confirmed that AMD FSR 4, in its complete implementation, will be available to PS5 Pro developers starting next year. This isn't surprising, considering that Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-confirmed-to-have-been-co-developed-with-sony/">helped</a> AMD develop the algorithm as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/">Project Amethyst.</a></p>



<p>AMD FSR 4 will be available as an upgrade to the existing PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), which debuted with the PS5 Pro launch in late 2024. In an interview <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-mark-cerny-explains-why-your-ps5-pro-is-getting-an-upgrade-in-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Tom's Guide</a>, Sony Lead System Architect Mark Cerny explained:</p>



<p><em>The algorithm they came up with could be implemented on current-generation hardware. So, the co-developed algorithm has already been released by AMD as part of FSR 4 on PC. And we're in the process of implementing it on PS5, and it will release next year on PS5 Pro. It's not a cut-down version of the algorithm. It's the full-fat version of the co-developed super resolution that we'll be releasing on PS5 Pro.</em></p>



<p>Commenting on the ongoing Project Amethyst partnership with AMD, Cerny added:</p>



<p><em>This is not for proprietary technology. This is really trying to move the industry forward. Obviously, we want to use these technologies on our consoles, but these technologies are available to any of AMD's customers freely. Big chunks of RDNA 5, or whatever AMD ends up calling it, are coming out of the engineering I am doing on the project. And again, this is coming out of trying to move things forward. There are no restrictions on the way any of it can be used. AMD is moving extremely quickly. What I'm trying to do is prepare for the next generation of consoles, so my time frame is multi-year here.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, the article shares a comment where both companies hint at an even tighter partnership than during the design of the PlayStation 5 or the PlayStation 5 Pro consoles. </p>



<p>This comes just days after AMD <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-multi-year-deal-with-amd-to-power-next-gen-devices/">announced</a> a multi-year partnership with Microsoft. However, that one seems focused on making various types of Xbox devices, including the upcoming ASUS ROG Xbox Ally handheld. In contrast, the Sony partnership is centered on machine learning powered upscaling advancements.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-use-this-dhv-magellan-trick-to-restore-roads-and-monorails-more-quickly/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Besides completing deliveries and knitting back together a world that a cataclysmic event has torn apart, a big part of the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach experience is to collaborate with other players to build back the infrastructures that have been destroyed by the Death Stranding, and make it easier to complete deliveries and bring the world back together again under the Chiral Network. Doing so, however, can be a very time-consuming endeavor: to bring back roads and monorails, you will have to donate a lot of materials such as Chiral Crystals, Metals, and Ceramics, which can be sometimes hard to get, especially in the quantities required to bring these fundamental infrastructures back. Raiding enemy camps is a good way to collect some resources, but alas, it will still take some time to get everything you need.</p>



<p>There is a way, however, to restore roads and monorails in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach more quickly. To take advantage of this trick, however, you will have to play through the story until you complete <strong>Order 12 and unlock fast travel</strong> via the DHV Magellan. This will allow you to travel quickly to any zone deemed safe, including the cities and shelters you have connected to the Chiral Network in Mexico.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As you likely have noticed at this point in the game, in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, <strong>you can take as much materials as you can carry from any city or shelter</strong>. As you are unlikely to return to Mexico after you are done with the beinning of the game, unless you want to max out the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-what-do-you-get-for-maxing-connection-level/">Connection Level</a>, you can <strong>take the materials at your disposal in each city and shelter in Mexico, load them up on the DHV Magellan and bring them to Australia to put them to good use restoring roads and monorails</strong> without having to deal with a material shortage when crafting weapons and tools, as most of your in-game time is spent in Australia.</p>



<p>The process to put this trick into action is simple. Head into any city or shelter in Mexico, access the main terminal, enter the Fabrication and Management menu, and then pick the Claim Materials option. Select any material you want, load them up on your Floating Carrier or any vehicles you have in the vicinity, then head back into the DHV Magellan and add the Materials to its storage. Fast travel to the location nearest to the road or monorail you want to restore, claim the Materials back, load them up and then head to the infrastucture to donate them.</p>



<p>While this trick somewhat defeats the purpose of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, it's still an excellent way to make one of the most tedious mechanics of the game more bearable. All the Materials you can get from Mexico won't be enough to restore every infrastrure in Australia, but they will provide you with a strong start that will make gathering the remaining materials needed far less time-consuming.</p>

        <p>Out now for testing on Bedrock, with Java to follow</p>

            <p>Copper golems and new types of copper equipment are coming in the next big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a> update, which is available to test now in Minecraft Bedrock and available shortly as a Snapshot for the Java edition. The golems actually date back to Minecraft's 2021 Mob Vote - players cruelly snubbed them in favour of the musical, item-fetching Allay. Classic case of robophobia, if you ask me. What can some fairy jukebox junkie do that a golem can't. Luckily for you nay-sayers, Mojang have seen fit to add the oxidisable automatons to Minecraft anyway, in keeping with the idea that Mob Vote outcomes are more of a guide for development than a rigid prescription.</p><!--more-->
<p>As and when you get access to the update, you'll build golems by planting a jack-o-lantern or carved pumpkin atop a block of copper. This, to my understanding, is how the good Lord created Adam in the Garden of Eden, except that Adam did not immediately start going through the Good Lord's treasure chests within a set range and organising them by item.</p>
<p>A copper golem is, in other words, a housekeeper. It'll ensure that each goodie you craft is stored in the same place. I look forward to the complaints from players who've had to start over because all of their diamond equipment has been industriously shuffled into some random cellar. I also like the idea of these worlds outlasting their creators and becoming a ceaseless hive of Mary Poppinbots. As with other copper items in Mojang's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a>, the golems will corrode over time and develop a charming green patina, though this doesn't affect their operation.</p>
<p>Copper in general will be more useful as of this updating. It's now an equipment tier, whose "durability sits somewhere between stone and iron", according to <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/a-new-friend-with-a-familiar-patina">the official Minecraft website</a>. Apparently, "a copper pickaxe will help you mine a bit faster and for a bit longer than a stone pickaxe but won't allow you to mine any additional materials - you'll still need to upgrade to iron for that." Being already abundant in Minecraft's generated worlds, it's "the perfect early-game material".</p>
<p>In case you have been skulking in a Creeper hole these past 10 years and missed the acquisition, Mojang and Minecraft are currently owned by Microsoft. Microsoft are about to announce another round of mass layoffs, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lstr3pbp3k2x">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>. If this does come to pass, the irony of it accompanying the addition of a new robot workforce to Minecraft will be <em>just</em> pressing enough to retrospectively justify me mentioning it here. Fingers crossed that Schreier is wrong.</p><hr>
<p><em>Before joining RPS, our news editor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell wrote a book about Minecraft's history in collaboration with Mojang and Microsoft. He's not receiving any royalties or similar on-going payments.</em>

                <p>Barely a month after the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/" data-ref-id="1100-6532411">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo is set to release the console's next big game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-preorder-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530595/" data-ref-id="1100-6530595">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, in just a few weeks. It's also the first new game in the franchise since 2014's Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze. Regardless, there's a little too much pent-up excitement for DK's comeback in the new live-action trailer for Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q7ZqqN_KHQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4q7ZqqN_KHQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>YouTube user MikeyOrlando6665 summed it up pretty well in the top comment on the video: "Thank you for telling me this trailer wasn't representative of the gameplay experience. I totally thought I'd have to play DK in front of a large crowd of people chanting DK instead of my usual gameplay experience of sitting alone in my basement in my underwear crying."</p><p>Most of the footage features the game's 3D platforming experience, but it also showcases a side-scrolling sequence that serves as a callback to the original Donkey Kong Country from 1994. Donkey Kong creator Shigeru Miyamoto recently explained <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-explains-donkey-kongs-new-look/1100-6531714/" data-ref-id="1100-6531714">why Bananza ditched DK's long-standing Donkey Kong Country design</a> in favor of a more contemporary look.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-looks-like-the-mario-odyssey-successor-no-one-expected/1100-6532824/" data-ref-id="1100-6532824">hands-on impression of Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, it was called "the next evolution of [Super Mario Odyssey's] ideas," while noting that it is "full of playful new mechanics and ideas."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>'s director has acknowledged the game's controversial nomination for best indie game at The Game Awards 2023, admitting Mintrocket is not an indie studio.</p>
<p>Mintrocket is a subsidiary of South Korean developer and publisher Nexon, but its game was nominated for the Best Independent Game award, ultimately missing out to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with Japanese site <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/">4gamer</a>, director Hwang Jae-ho stated "there's nothing indie about [Dave the Diver]" considering it was made at Nexon.</p>

<p>"I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we're developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique," he said (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dave-the-diver-director-addresses-controversial-best-indie-game-nomination-from-2023-theres-nothing-indie-about-us-we-didnt-apply-for-it/">Automaton</a>). "For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, 'Hey, isn't that a Nexon game?', but it's not like we applied for the award ourselves (laughs)."</p>
<p>Nominees for The Game Awards are chosen by an international jury of global game media outlets. As Hwang noted, Nexon therefore had nothing to do with the nomination.</p>
<p>Essentially, the media got it wrong, perhaps due to Mintrocket being considered a small team, or due to the pixel art style.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, ahead of the game's release, Nexon vice president <a href="https://www.gametoc.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=69776">Dae-Hwon Kim stated in an interview</a> Dave the Diver isn't an indie game, despite appearances.</p>
<p>Later, The Game Awards producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> confused matters. "Independent can mean different things to different people, and it's sort of a broad term," he said (as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/keighley-weighs-in-on-debate-over-dave-the-diver-qualifying-for-best-indie-game/">VGC</a>). "You can argue, does independent mean the budget of the game, does independent mean where the source of financing was, does it mean the team size? Is it the kind of independent spirit of the game, meaning a smaller game that's sort of different?"</p>
<p>He then deferred to the 120 global media outlets that voted to determine the interpretation. Now, Hwang is finally ending the debate.</p>
<p>Dave the Diver received widespread critical acclaim and is still receiving updates two years after its release. Its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-delays-in-the-jungle-dlc-but-sure-knows-how-to-soften-the-blow-with-these-other-announcements">In The Jungle DLC has been delayed into next year</a>, however, after first being revealed in 2024.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-director-finally-ends-indie-debate-after-controversial-the-game-awards-2023-nomination]]></content:encoded>
