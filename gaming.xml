<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Ending" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9824329e3a075/donkey-kong-bananza-ending.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>From the moment Nintendo revealed Pauline's presence in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, I knew one thing for certain: I was going to be writing a feature on the DK timeline in the next two months.</p>
<p>Look, you know I love Bananza. DK and Pauline have such a wholesome little relationship, I adored hearing the same senile rant from Cranky on each and every layer, and the little nods to the great ape's previous endeavours were perfectly balanced. It felt like a wall-to-wall celebration of all things DK while also serving as an introduction to the modern age of 3D platforming for one of Nintendo's oldest characters.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4mnvpru&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>And then the ending happened. It's a wonderful set piece that I played with the biggest, cheesiest smile on my face, but it, along with the mere presence of a 13-year-old Pauline, throws up a lot of questions about where Bananza sits in the wider canon, and let's be honest here, DK doesn't need that.</p>
<p>If you've stayed with me this far and you think there's a chance I'll make it through the next 800 words without spoiling the end of Donkey Kong Bananza, you are very much mistaken. I'll be talking about the final sequence of Donkey Kong Bananza in depth. Heck, there might even be some screenshots thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>If you don't want that spoiling (and I'd really recommend seeing it fresh for yourself — it's awesome), then wrap up your reading here and only scroll past the following image when you've seen everything for yourself, <strong>as there are major spoilers below</strong>.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Ending" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ece8c9c5bafeb/donkey-kong-bananza-ending.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>3, 2, 1... right, that's it, I'm unpeeling things — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where was I? Ah yes, the ending!</p>
<p>The final stage of Donkey Kong Bananza finally sees DK and Pauline get back to the latter's home turf on the surface, which is... New Donk City! Yep, the very one seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. There's some more platforming and a boss fight (I've broken it all down in an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-ending-explained-is-it-a-prequel-to-mario-odyssey">Ending Explained guide</a>, if you need reminding of the deets), but the tl;dr of it is that NDC returns to its rot-free glory, DK returns to the mines — <a href="https://youtu.be/wJO_vIDZn-I?si=_2rCxvy25prEHc_s&amp;t=4">like Steve, he yearns for them</a> — and Pauline gets to live out her dreams of singing in front of the whole city. Hmm.</p>
<p>That last note got under my skin when I first played through the grand finale, and I haven't been able to shake it in the weeks since. This is <em>Pauline</em>. This is <em>New Donk City</em>. This is <em>singing</em>. Nintendo could have played the riff from 'Jump Up, Superstar!' over the entire sequence, and it wouldn't have made it any more obvious that the game is going, "Look, it's just like that 2017 3D Mario game!! See??"</p>
<p>All these threads come together in a great big Odyssey-shaped signpost, actively encouraging us all to think about the prized plumber's previous platforming exploits and start to question where Bananza fits in around it.</p>
<p>And think about it I did. I was so ready for Bananza to end with Pauline saying something like, "You know what my <em>real</em> dream is, DK? To be mayor of this great city!," but it doesn't. Instead, it ends with an image of a very-much-still-13-years-old Pauline singing on the roof of City Hall (after the post-credits missions, that is), and all of those references to her grandma — which she's been banging on about throughout the game, let's not forget — ringing in your ears.</p>

<p>This isn't the Odyssey prequel that I thought it would be, but instead a <em>sequel</em>. Another child in the Pauline family tree (also called 'Pauline', confusingly), learning to love the giant ape that had caused so much drama for her ancestors. <em>Aw</em>.</p>
<p>No! Not "<em>Aw</em>"! This is exactly why I started this piece in the first place. I have put too much thought and energy into a timeline that, let's admit it, is a load of rubbish.</p>
<p>Don't even get me started on Cranky Kong. We all know that this elderly ape is <em>the</em> DK from the original arcade machine (it's even referenced in one of his Bananza speeches), so what's he doing <em>still</em> up and about all these years later? And what about his son, Donkey Kong Jr? Are we just going to assume that vest-wearing chimp faded away as he headed back to his home planet?</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I can get behind a BS timeline. I know the <strong>Zelda</strong> one more than most and actually enjoy slotting things into it. But at least <strong>Hyrule Historia</strong> is based loosely (and I mean <em>loosely</em>) on the games' narrative events and not solely on "how old is this kid now, do you reckon?"</p>
<p>A Donkey Kong timeline — or, casting the net even wider in this instance, a <em>Mario</em> timeline — is a fool's errand right from the jump because there's almost no narrative to hang things on. Nobody is saying "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a> <em>has</em> to come after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/dk_king_of_swing">DK: King of Swing</a> because you can see DK still riding the high of the Jungle Jam Festival".</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Ending" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c11871822b222/donkey-kong-bananza-ending.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And I really want to hammer this home, I <em>love</em> Donkey Kong Bananza, I just don't think that good things necessarily need to be strung up to other good things. I should be relishing in the glow of post-Bananza joy, but instead I'm getting myself wound up over lore that didn't exist until a month ago.</p>
<p>If we're going to keep pretending that the narrative events of DK or Mario matter to the wider pantheon of Nintendo games, at least give us a nicely bound lore book to add to the coffee table. The DK Dictionary? Kong Kompilation? Gorilla Glossary?... I'll work on it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA is kicking off its first public beta for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> tomorrow, and even though the first two days of this weekend's beta is only open to players who were able to grab a code through Twitch or sent out to players that previously signed up to participate in Battlefield Labs, servers for the beta are already starting to fill up, as tens of thousands of players are queued up for the beta ahead of launch.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tens-of-thousands-of-players-are-queuing-for-the-battlefield-6-beta-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/">VGC</a>, players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mj6s2e/the_hype_is_real/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> are sharing that the servers have already been maxed out, and there are thousands more waiting in the queue to get in, which means there are thousands who are keeping their devices on and ready, waiting in the game's lobby for the beta to go live tomorrow.</p>



<p>At least for these coming beta weekends, it seems like EA won't need to use <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-include-bots-servers-arent-full-classic-maps-fan-feedback/">bots to fill the game's servers</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">SteamDB</a> is showing thousands of users currently in-game with a peak of 24,879 players earlier today. </p>



<p>Pre-loading the beta has been available to players since <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-preload-now-available-matchmaking-skill/">yesterday</a>, and with thousands already chomping at the bit to try out the next entry in the Battlefield series, it's clear that the caption on the above Reddit post is right. The hype is indeed real, for Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Will it live up to the hype is another question all together. <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">Last week's reveal</a> was a very promising show of the new shooter, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto had plenty of positive things to say in his hands-on impressions,</a> saying "<em>this is exactly what I've wanted out of Battlefield multiplayer since the days of Operation Metro and Strike at Karkand. Massive maps with the flow of infantry, tanks, and jets all coordinating in tandem, and the constant chatter of squadmates calling for revives or ammo packs. While I know what I've experience during the multiplayer reveal event is only a small slice of the complete Battlefield 6 package, October 10th can't come soon enough.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-you-need-to-know-about-getting-three-star-gold-trophies-in-mario-kart-world.1263819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>What does it take to “beat” the single player Grand Prix and Knockout Tour modes in <i>Mario Kart World</i>? For some, simply finishing Rainbow Road and rolling the credits is enough to call it a day. For others, maybe you want to get gold trophies in every cup on 150cc, or even <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-mirror-mode-unlock-free-roam-1851784857">Mirror Mode</a> if you know how to unlock it. But what if that’s not enough? What if you want bragging rights that well and truly signaled to the world “I’ve <i>conquered</i> this?” That’s what your Star Rank is for.</p> <p>In short, your Star Rank is the extra stars you might see next to your gold trophies in both the single-player Grand Prix and Knockout Tour. The better you did during that particular challenge, the more stars you’ll earn (up to a maximum of three). If it sounds straightforward, that’s because… it kind of is. Still, critical details about this system are never explained in-game, so if you’re looking to earn a three-star rank on every cup in single-player mode, here’s what you need to know.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614605" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614605"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614605">© Nintendo / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>How do you get three stars in Grand Prix in <i>Mario Kart World</i>?</h2> <p>Similar to past <i>Mario Kart </i>games, your star rank in Grand Prix mode depends on your final point tally at the end of the final race. 54 points gets you one star, 57 points gets you two stars, and 60 points gets you the full three stars. To put that in straightforward terms, <b>getting three stars requires finishing first in all four races of a single cup</b>.</p>

 <h2>How do you get a three-star rank in Knockout Tour in <i>Mario Kart World</i>?</h2> <p>Since Knockout Tour is new to <i>Mario Kart World</i>, the rules here are a little different than the series’ standard Grand Prix mode. In lieu of a proper point system, your Star Rank is instead determined by your position when you pass through each of the checkpoints that kicks out the bottom four players from the race. <b>To get three stars in Knockout Tour, you have to be in first when you pass through each of these checkpoints</b>.</p> <p>Yes, that includes the first one, so you’ll have to dash from 24th to 1st fast!</p> <h2>Your Star Rank in a higher difficulty will count as completion for all previous difficulties as well</h2> <p>If you want to get three stars in every cup in Grand Prix and Knockout Tour modes, your first instinct may be to start from 50cc and work your way up from there. After all, you might as well save the hardest stuff for last, right? Well, if you’re confident enough in your skills to pump up the difficulty ASAP, all Star Ranks are retroactive across all previous difficulties. That is to say, if you get three stars in a cup in 150cc, you’ll see your 50cc and 100cc completion appear as three stars as well. Conversely, if you get three stars in 50cc and only one star in 150cc, your previous record won’t be overwritten.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-mirror-mode-unlock-free-roam-1851784857"><b>Mirror Mode</b></a><b> also grants retroactive star rankings</b>. This hasn’t been the case in past <i>Mario Kart </i>games, but a Mirror Mode max Star Rank in <i>Mario Kart World </i>will also carry over to 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc if you haven’t already done so. In other words, if you’re trying to get your bragging rights as fast as possible and you think you’re ready for it, you can immediately start in Mirror Mode.</p> <h2>What do you get for getting three stars in every cup in <i>Mario Kart World</i>?</h2> <p>Nothing! Absolutely nothing!</p> <p>I’ve been calling this a bragging right for a reason. Much like <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658">most tasks in Free Roam mode</a>, earning a max Star Rank is a challenge that exists for its own sake. This might be disappointing for longtime <i>Kart</i> fans, as previous games would often signify your accomplishment with some kind of reward. But here, you won’t even see a congratulations message for pulling off this feat.</p>

 <h2>Tips for getting three stars in <i>Mario Kart World</i></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614608"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614608">© Nintendo / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>If you’d like to press on to get a suite of maxed out Star Ranks despite knowing there is no reward attached, here are a few quick tips to propel yourself into first place (usually).</p> <p><b>1: Practice</b>. It sounds obvious, but the more you know which twists and turns are ahead of you on a track, the better equipped you’ll be to blow past the competition without slamming headfirst into a wall. The Time Trial mode comes equipped with ghosts for each track that you can study, and if you’re feeling adventurous <b>you can load the ghost data of whoever holds the world record in a track too.</b></p>

 <p><b>2: Focus on getting coins at the start. </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coins-vehicles-speed-power-up-unlock-1851785020">The more coins you have, the faster you’ll go</a>. And the faster you’ll go, you’ll… I don’t need to explain why going fast matters in a racing game, right? You can stop going out of your way for coins once you have 10-15, and by the final lap you should focus on cutting tight corners as you approach the finish line.</p> <p><b>3: Prioritize shortcuts</b>. This is especially important for Knockout Tour, as you’ll need to make up a lot of ground to go from 24th to 1st before hitting the first checkpoint. Fortunately, players in a lower place will get better items from item boxes, and the first item you’ll usually get in Knockout Tour is a Mushroom (or something else that boosts your speed). Look for any turns that you can speed right across, and don’t be afraid to hold your item if it means waiting for that right moment.</p>

 <p><b>4: Manage your items</b>. As mentioned above, racers further back will get better items. And if you’re on a tear blazing past the competition with three red shells around you, you might want to use them strategically to specifically target opponents you can’t catch. Alternatively, you might want to hold at second so you don’t get targeted by a Blue Shell. Conversely, once you’re in 1st, the name of the game is defense. Shells and feathers can prevent you from taking a hit from red shells, and the Superhorn can break Blue Shells before they hit you. Try to have at least one defensive item ready at all times.</p> <p><b>5: Be patient. </b>No matter how good you are or how well you race, you can and <i>will </i>fail to get a three-star rank simply because you got hit with the wrong items at the wrong time. After all, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mario-karted">there’s a reason the term “Mario Karted” is common internet slang</a>. It can be incredibly frustrating and defeating when it happens, so just accept that a few bouts of impossibly bad luck are just going to happen and give it a try another time.</p> <p>Remember, this challenge only exists for fun, and you should probably take a break if you’re not enjoying it. Take some time to <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coin-farming-tips-vehicles-unlock-1851784093">grind coins</a> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-clips-stunts-rewind-wall-1851783907">pull off some super cool stunts</a>, and come back to it when you feel ready. Getting three stars wouldn’t be a bragging right if there was nothing to brag about!</p>

However, with some performative buy-in and a deductive attitude, Dying Message will hit its mark and result in a tabletop game that is wholly unique. </p></div><p id="high-tide"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="High Tide">High Tide</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226509"><div id="226509" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>High Tide</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Cozy games are all the rage right now. These are designs that present a relaxed experience which is more focused on meditative play and chill vibes over brutish competition. High Tide is the latest to break out in this category, selling out at Gen Con due to its stellar aesthetic and intriguing play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a small game, easily portable and completely unassuming. But it boasts a surprising amount of depth. Tiles are arranged randomly in a grid and players take turns stacking pieces upon ones that are higher. You may only move your own or neutral tiles, however. It teases out just the right level of strategic thought without tipping over into a cerebral grind. High Tide is a neat, novel work that stood out among the swathe of new games.</p></div><p id="lightning-train"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lightning Train">Lightning Train</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226510"><div id="226510" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lightning Train</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of the buzz surrounding Lightning Train is the pedigree of designer Paul Dennen. His previous work, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review"><u>Dune Imperium</u></a>, is a modern classic that has caught on like wildfire in the gaming community. This new release uses a similar concept of bag building as players add various resources to their bag in a strategic bid for developing their company. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The goal is to open train stations and railroad lines across North America, facilitating the delivery of goods to cities in need. The interesting detail is that players can share each other's infrastructure, sending cargo along another participant’s route. Both receive benefits from this cooperation, birthing a more nuanced and fuzzy strategic space. Unlike most games in the train category, Lightning Train is a more approachable design that slots in as a step up from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions">Ticket to Ride</a>.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-fate-of-the-f"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the F">The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226511"><div id="226511" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pandemic-board-game-buying-guide"><u>Pandemic</u></a> has dozens of spinoff games at this point, and The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship appears to be just another iteration on Matt Leacock’s modern classic. That is not the case. This new design does contain some faint indicators of that previous game’s DNA, but it’s so much more than that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a rich adventure game where players cooperate to take the One Ring to Mount Doom while evading the attention of Sauron. It’s part tower defense, with players recruiting Free World troops to battle invading Orcs and Southrons, and it’s part stealth thriller as Frodo must constantly sneak past armies and Nazgul. This is a tense affair, and it’s far more detailed and thematic than expected. In fact, it barely feels like a Pandemic property at all, which may take some people by surprise. Regardless, this is perhaps the most exciting game I played at Gen Con this year, and I’m enraptured by it.</p></div><p id="nature"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Nature">Nature</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226512"><div id="226512" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nature</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/91jYRn?object_uuid=fb854556-6e2a-4fc7-b3cb-9e9864335368&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0725LRH1W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Evolution</u></a>, the board game that captures the pressures of a dynamic ecosystem and how this influences species, has been wildly successful over the past 10 years of its life. It’s spawned numerous expansions and spinoffs, and may have just found its final state with Nature. This latest version of the system is pared down to a straightforward and approachable core game that retains the interesting card play of its predecessor. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the elements have been simplified, and it’s easier than ever to introduce this game to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">beginners</a> and non-hobbyist of any age. The magic resides in the game’s module system. Multiple add-ons exist that can be inserted to layer on sub-systems for flight, dinosaurs, and environments. This slightly increases the complexity, while boosting the strategic potential. A huge boon is that it changes up the feel of each session, and allows North Star Games to expand this properly infinitely. Nature is poised to have the longest legs of any game in the Evolution line.</p></div><p id="star-wars-battle-of-hoth"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Star Wars: Battle of Hoth">Star Wars: Battle of Hoth</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226513"><div id="226513" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars: Battle of Hoth</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle of Hoth was the most talked about game heading into Gen Con.

Players take on the role of either the contingent of Imperial AT-ATs and snowtroopers, or the Rebel soldiers holding the line in order to protect the planet’s shield generator. Each takes turns playing cards from their hand to activate one portion of the battlefield, choosing from a selection of units occupying that flank. This restriction of the card system is a hallmark of the Memoir series, forcing tough decisions with only a modicum of rules overhead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">wargame</a> of sorts, it’s also a very streamlined and rules-light design. It’s a dramatic game, full of dice rolling and big moments where units are scattered and lines are broken. The Star Wars backdrop only helps.</p></div><p id="spooktacular"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Spooktacular">Spooktacular</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226514"><div id="226514" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Spooktacular</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">During the 1986 Spooktacular horror film festival, a freak accident occurs involving a lightning strike and a little bit of mystery.

Players take on the roles of movie monsters animated from the screen, competing to scare and devour guests. Each of the 20 included monsters is unique, featuring its own suite of abilities and cards. Yet, this is not an overstuffed game and the core processes are direct and sensible. The concoction here is magnificent, and this monster mash is full of delight and terror.</p></div><p id="vantage"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Vantage">Vantage</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226515"><div id="226515" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vantage</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vantage-board-game-review"><u>review of Vantage</u></a>, I declared it as possibly being the top game of 2025. It seems the crowds of Gen Con agreed, as this game was everywhere. This is a fully cooperative adventure where players crash land on an uncharted planet and must navigate its many mysteries in order to fulfill a collective mission. While this was clearly designed in the tradition of modern narrative adventure games, it goes about things its own way, massively improving on the pre-existing approach. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, it’s not a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign game</a>. Each individual session has a complete arc, which makes it far more approachable for most groups. It also does away with narrow objectives requiring players head to specific locations. Instead, many of the missions may be fulfilled in numerous ways. This highlights the game’s focus on creativity and freedom, allowing you to wander and explore whatever catches your eye. Finally, the mysteries of the world are special and worthy of the effort required. This is a fantastic game, and it was the closest thing to a singular standout title of the convention. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Charlie Theel is a tabletop games freelancer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>InXile Entertainment’s next game is the first-person steampunk RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-xboxs-big-summer-2025-showcase-1851784007"><i>Clockwork Revolution</i></a>. Studio founder Brian Fargo, who’s leading the project, recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjeRn2eA3y4">sat down with YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a> for a deep-dive interview about his long career and his take on current hot topics in the video game industry like generative AI and LLM technology, which the Xbox studio’s parent company is currently investing $80 billion in. Has InXile embraced it in a similar fashion? “For certain things, but but I’m very keen to what are the ethical uses of it?” he said. “I am worried about job loss.”</p> <p>Fargo, whose career in games dates back to the 1980s when he worked on influential role-playing games like&nbsp;<em>The Bard’s Tale&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wasteland</em>, laid out <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-baldurs-gate-3-nier-automata-ai-chatgpt-1851778257">a couple of different use cases</a> he foresees for tools like ChatGPT, but distinguished them from things like using generative AI to plagiarize the creative output of other artists. “These games…we’re close to about the same word count as the Bible, basically, and so that’s a lot of data no human can get in in its head,” he said. “So would I like an LLM to be able to query: ‘How many times did [inaudible] talk?’ ‘How many times have we used this skill?’ Like there’s some things that I would want to query the information to make sure so I see that.”</p> <p>The veteran studio head said he also uses generative AI for inspiration they way he might visit a museum or scroll through people’s Deviant Art pages, but that only commissioned work is used in the actual production process. Other uses Fargo pointed to were cleaning up motion capture footage and potentially voicing quick pickup lines added to a game at the last minute if the actor agrees to it and is paid extra but is otherwise unable to make it into the studio. That part sounds in line <a href="https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-game-darth-vader-1851784189">with what SAG-AFTRA members settled on</a> in a new contract after months on strike.</p> <p>“Can we use it for, like, mundane tasks that nobody wants to do so the human creativity can soar?” Fargo said. “Well, I think that’s kind of cool. I don’t think anybody wants to do some of these things. Do we really want humans going through checking for punctuation? You know, I mean, I don’t have it doing it right now, but that would seem like I’d rather have those same people going, ‘I have a great idea to to make this scene far better.’ Like that, I’d rather have the minds thinking about the good stuff.”</p>  <p>While the <em>Clockwork Revolution</em> director wasn’t as hypercritical of AI and the hype around it as some game developers have been, he also came off as more cautious than others within Microsoft, including CEO Satya Nadella. Nadella recently boasted that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/satya-nadella-says-as-much-as-30percent-of-microsoft-code-is-written-by-ai.html">30 percent</a> of Microsoft code is written by AI, and revealed earlier this year that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-15/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-his-ai-efforts-and-openai-partnership">he uses multiple AI assistants</a> to get him through his day. The company is pushing its use in gaming as well, rolling out models that can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/">hallucinate gameplay</a> or watch you play games and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/719668/microsoft-xbox-gaming-copilot-windows-game-bar-beta-test">Google tips for them</a>.

<p>The Black Ops 6 Season 5 update introduces three new multiplayer maps, three new weapons, and adds the final Zombies map for this game. </p>



<p>The star of the show in BO6 Season 5 is the sixth and final Zombies map, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-come-out-everything-we-know-about-reckoning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reckoning</a>. Set in the project Janus headquarters, the towers’ systems are on the verge of total failure, and it’s up to the team to stabilize the Aethor Reactors before the Aetherium leak gets out of hand. </p>



<p>Reckoning features a new Wonder Weapon that alters gravity, a new elite enemy, and adds several other surprises. Let’s jump right into what fans can expect. <br></p>

<h3 id="h-new-multiplayer-maps">New Multiplayer Maps</h3>



<p><strong>Runway (6v6)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>A Pantheon mole attempts their escape via the Arzak Provincial Airport. All hell breaks loose as the Rogue Black Ops team pursues one of their final targets. Wreckage and luggage litter the tarmac, flames licking the sides of the terminal and black smoke rising from the fire in the airport control tower.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Exchange (6v6, 2v2)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Rogue Black Ops pursues a mole attempting to strike a deal in a vibrant Avalon marketplace. Crash the party and unleash havoc on this small-sized three-lane map centered around the Deli, its roof adorned with a marble statue of a mythic sea god.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>World Motor Dynasty (W.M.D.) (6v6)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>From its inception as a Nova 6 processing laboratory first introduced in the original Call of Duty: Black Ops, W.M.D. returns in a reimagined form as an Italian luxury car manufacturer in Avalon. Trade the snow of the original map for an overcast day around the Autofiorno plant, using your memories of the prior map to help navigate the larger area of operations.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-multiplayer-mode">New Multiplayer Mode</h3>



<p><strong>Aim High</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Aim high to survive across a variety of game modes — including Team Deathmatch, Domination, Hardpoint, and Kill Confirmed — where headshots land instant eliminations while full body armor minimizes damage dealt anywhere below the neck. As a bonus, this headshot training is likely to hone your talents when unlocking Weapon Camos.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-weapons">New Weapons</h3>



<p><strong>PML 5.5 – LMG (Battle Pass)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Full-auto light machine gun. Fast rate of fire and high lethality offset by low mobility and hefty recoil.</li>



<li>When a rival Operator is holding the trigger down on the PML 5.56, you’ll know, mainly due to the damage and huge ammunition reserves, mitigated somewhat by a lengthy reload.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>ABR A1 – Assault Rifle (Battle Pass)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Three-round burst assault rifle. Good handling and power. Moderate recoil and range. Configurable to full auto.</li>



<li>The iconic Assault Rifle returns! With a similar weapon being a fan-favorite staple of the Black Ops series, the ABR A1 combines a high damage output that can drop enemies in tight three-round bursts with a brief pause in-between, almost fast enough to be called automatic.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Boxing Gloves – Melee (In-Season, Event Reward)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Moderate damage. Fast attack speed. Long range.</li>



<li>Slip on the Boxing Gloves and knock out foes with a swift barrage of jabs and uppercuts.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-attachments">New Attachments</h3>



<p><strong>9mm PM Skull Splitter (Two Attachments, Battle Pass)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Bring the power and precision of a marksman rifle to your favorite pistol with the 9mm PM Skull Splitter Barrel. The Barrel greatly increases damage, especially to the head, reducing rate of fire. Pair with an extended magazine that gives the Operator additional ammo for this weapon at the expense of handling.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>PPSh-41 Helical Magazine (In-Season, Event Reward)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fire to the beat of your own drum with this SMG attachment that puts other magazines to shame. Manage heat on this high-ammo count magazine that excels at spraying bullets in close and medium ranges.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-5-zombies-update-patch-notes">Black Ops 6 Season 5 Zombies Update Patch Notes</h2>



<h3 id="h-new-map-reckoning">New Map: Reckoning</h3>



<p>Looming over the once-sleepy settlement of Liberty Falls, the Project Janus Headquarters—three edifices known locally as Janus Towers— now teeters on the verge of collapse.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-enemies">New Enemies</h3>



<p><strong>Uber Klaus + Uber Klaus Core</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The secret Research and Development program of Project Janus appears to have been more evolved than originally thought, developing many more robots in the Klaus Assembly Lab than first anticipated. The greatest of these threats is the Uber Klaus – a murderous automaton encased in a toughened, bulky exoskeleton – that maintains a cocky attitude, lethal efficiency, and super strength, all directed at newly-programmed threats.</li>



<li>Enemy takedown tactics are unknown at this point, though combat is likely to be focused on disrupting the Uber Klaus form’s heavy shielding and avoiding its melee attacks. Once the exoskeleton is broken, the Uber Klaus Core will eject, revealing its second deadly form.</li>



<li>The Uber Klaus Core increases in agility, sacrificing defenses for less lumbering locomotion and flying capabilities thanks to rocket-powered hover boots. It continues to employ energy-based, arm-mounted launchers, while its defensive shield can prevent your incoming attacks.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Kommando Klaus</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Preceded by a strange red mist, these automated enemies have had their higher functions disconnected and self-destruct sequences activated.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-wonder-weapon-gorgofex">New Wonder Weapon: Gorgofex</h3>



<p>Latest intel all but confirms Janus Towers may be hiding a new and grotesquely potent Wonder Weapon known as the Gorgofex. Partly charred experimentation notes discovered on microfiche indicate the existence of a “bio-aetheric” armament.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combining fungal, floral, and insectile traits to deliver precise impact damage and gravity-defying disruption in close quarters, glowing membranes on the weapon show hints of motion and circulation under the surface. The weapon seems to pulse and breathe, with a beating central heart-like organ that “pumps” energy through the weapon. Due to the saturation of Dark Aether and other unknown energies, the weapon is said to emit faint psychic vibrations.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-field-upgrade-mister-peeks">New Field Upgrade: Mister Peeks </h3>



<p>Summon Mister Peeks to our reality to create chaos, as the deadly and distracting bunny busts out the moves and bashes undead brains to a raving disco beat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once Mister Peeks arrives in your hands, throw this hairy helper into the fray, and he gleefully attracts normal and Special enemies and attacks any undead within his wandering radius, savaging foes until they explode in a shower of bright confetti.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Mister Peeks: Major Augments</strong>
<ul>
<li>Dance Party
<ul>
<li>Mister Peeks becomes the life of the party, attracting nearby zombies to him, before he detonates an Aether Pulse to thin out the crowd considerably.</li>
</ul>
</li>

Starting August 11, experiences that get the "Sensitive Issues" label will receive the descriptor on their details page and will be unavailable by default for users under the age of 13, although parents of older teens can choose to enable access if they wish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The issues, according to the company, involve "current sensitive social, political, and religious" themes. As per the announcement, the descriptor is "not meant to take a stance on any specific issue," and Roblox anticipates "very few experiences will receive this label."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Said experiences must also meet both the "polarized viewpoints" and "strong emotional response" criteria.

"Please note that this is not a comprehensive or finite list - any issue that meets the above criteria qualifies as a 'sensitive issue.' These issues are topics that are frequently in the news and inspire strong opinions and emotional debate."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a more specific example, the company said that an experience with a core gameplay loop focusing on immigration or border security would qualify, but one that simply includes references to countries and borders would not. Both experiences in this example would still be covered by Roblox's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/8862768451604-Content-Maturity-Labels">content maturity guidelines</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Roblox said that experiences that fall under the descriptor will not be suspended or removed from the platform, and instances where consequences would apply are for creators who repeatedly provide inaccurate information in the questionnaire.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'This change is not a response to any specific regulatory requirement or governmental request'">'This change is not a response to any specific regulatory requirement or governmental request'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company added that it understands that identifying sensitive issues can be complex and varies greatly by region.

            <title><![CDATA[You can still get into this weekend's Battlefield 6 beta but you'll have to watch 30 minutes of those awful Twitch people]]></title>
            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-still-get-into-this-weekends-battlefield-6-beta-but-youll-have-to-watch-30-minutes-of-those-awful-twitch-people</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can-still-get-into-this-weekends-battlefield-6-beta-but-youll-have-to-watch-30-minutes-of-those-awful-twitch-people.1263762/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If you failed to swipe a key for this week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> beta, because you <em>neither</em> signed up via the Battlefield Labs programme before 31st July <em>nor</em> watched Your Favourite Creators play the game during the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">recent multiplayer reveal</a>, then Don't Sweat It, Soldier, because Drill Sergeant EA Have Your Back in the shape of a last-gasp code giveaway. </p>
<p>All you have to do is sign into the EA and Twitch apps, then watch 30 minutes of Your Favourite Creators streaming the game. Unfortunately for me, the suggestion that I watch 30 minutes of anything on Twitch is a grievous insult akin to filling my wineglass with Vimto or farting on my outstretched hand. I hate game streaming and so do you, which is why neither of us will be playing Battlefield 6 this weekend. I will share further details of the giveaway only out of a sense of absolute perversity.
</p>
<p>Here's the specific wording from Drill Sergeant EA.</p>
<blockquote>The first step in participating is logging into your EA and Twitch accounts and linking them HERE. Then, during Battlefield 6 Open Beta Early Access, August 7th &amp; 8th, tune into your favorite creators streaming Battlefield 6 to unlock your own early access code after watching just 30 minutes.* Once you have your Twitch Drops code, visit Battlefield's Code Redemption page and enter the code to get Early Access added to your account. </blockquote>
<p>The little asterisk there is for "while supplies last". Perhaps it's too late, and you'll have to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/boomtown-rats-transformice">Transformice</a> instead.</p>
<p>These giveaways are business as usual for videogame publishers, but I've found EA's attempts to drive up Twitch engagement with Your Favourite Creators kind of eerie. It's an open effort to cook the numbers and fox Twitch's visibility algorithm. I imagine they don't care whether you actually watch Your Favourite Creators, only that you leave your fingerprints on the client, so why not turn on Twitch, lower the volume and spend 30 minutes ensuring that all of your socks are correctly paired.</p>
<p>If you're a real sucker for punishment, EA are also handing out cosmetics for people who carry on Twitching their Favourite Creators. Here's what you get for time served, with some observations of my own about how your state of mind might escalate in the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch for 1 Hour and, once you have conquered your nausea, you will earn the Mimic Weapons Package</li>
<li>Watch for 2 Hours and, once you have stopped feverishly washing your face, you will earn the Landslide Soldier Skin</li>
<li>Watch for 3 Hours and, once you have stopped cursing the day you were born, you will earn the Shattered Vehicle Skin </li>
<li>Watch for 4 Hours and, once the police have persuaded you to come down from the tree, you will earn the Imperial Soldier Skin</li>
</ul>
<p>Have I mentioned that I really hate game streaming? I'm sorry if you don't, and I'm harshing your buzz. I probably just haven't found the right streamer. Recommendations pls. People who prefer the comforting silence of text might want to read James Archer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">Battlefield 6 hands-on thoughts</a> instead. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-still-get-into-this-weekends-battlefield-6-beta-but-youll-have-to-watch-30-minutes-of-those-awful-twitch-people]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Activision announced that PC users will have to enable Secure Boot to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </p>



<p>Secure Boot is a Windows 10 and Windows 11 security feature that ensures a PC only loads safe software during startup. Secure Boot enables Activision to detect and remove users of banned third-party devices or other cheating software. </p>



<p>EA also uses the security measure for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-secureboot-not-enabled-error/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, and players experienced difficulties because they couldn’t play the game without enabling it. Enabling Secure Boot varies depending on the manufacturer of your PC, which can make it a confusing process. Black Ops 6 players are about to experience the same confusion. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-introduces-secure-boot-ahead-of-black-ops-7">Black Ops 6 Introduces Secure Boot Ahead of Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Black Ops 7 players on PC must enable Secure Boot. Image via Activision </figcaption></figure>



<p>Starting in Black Ops 6 Season 5, which begins on August 7, PC users must have Secure Boot enabled. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision</a> explained, “Secure Boot makes cheating at a hardware level much more difficult, ensuring cleaner PCs at start and allowing for more trusted environments for RICOCHET Anti-Cheat to operate in.” </p>



<p>If you need more information on how to enable Secure Boot, Activision provided a <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/trusted-platform-module-and-secure-boot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">manual</a> on how to do so. You won’t be able to play BO6 without having the security measure enabled, and that also applies to Black Ops 7, when the upcoming game releases later this year. </p>



<p>In addition, the devs encouraged you to secure your account with email verification and two-factor authentication. Activision also introduced new detection tools targeted at rooting out boosting and teaming in BO6 multiplayer and Warzone Ranked Play, and confirmed that 22 additional individuals responsible for developing and selling cheats were cut off.  </p>



<p>Is Secure Boot enough to cut down on cheating? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/black-ops-7-will-require-secure-boot-to-play.3211/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>. </p>

<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Activision leadership has been taking note of Battlefield 6’s recent hype, but is not worried that the franchise will surpass Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorised to talk about Activision’s internal conversations, it’s been said that although Activision is keeping a close eye on Battlefield, they are not worried about the game outcompeting its flagship franchise.</p>



<p>It’s said that Activision leadership believes that Call of Duty is “too big to fail” and will remain a profitable, annually released franchise for many years to come. At the time of writing, an annual Call of Duty title is penciled in for the next four years at least.</p>



<p>This year’s Call of Duty title, dubbed ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-revealed-during-xbox-games-showcase-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>‘, is said to be a “strong” title according to those familiar with the game’s plans, despite initial problems in development. </p>



<p>Interestingly enough, this year’s Call of Duty will take place in a slightly futuristic setting similar to Battlefield 6, with both games targeting a similar audience. Whether or not that direct competition will impact Call of Duty is unclear, but at the time of writing, Activision doesn’t think it will.</p>



<p>There’s also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s Battle Royale</a> to consider, which is believed to be a free-to-play component to the premium game. If EA can take a considerable chunk out of Call of Duty: Warzone’s playerbase, which has been depleting for the last couple of years, it could have a detrimental impact on Call of Duty’s long-term playerbase.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-black-ops-7-reveal-event-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 is set to get a full reveal</a> at this year’s Opening Night Live on August 19th.</p>



<p>What do you think of Activision not being worried about Battlefield outcompeting Call of Duty? Should they be? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-will-shut-down-anthem-in-january">announced it would shut down BioWare's Anthem</a> on January 12, 2026. And now, after a rocky six years for the game, its executive producer Mark Darrah has come forward to share details on exactly how Anthem came to be, and what went wrong in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_QY8F8z_4c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">part one of a planned multi-part video series</a>, Darrah spends an hour walking viewers through Anthem's development as he understands it from 2011 through the moment he took over as executive producer in 2017. Admittedly, his perspective isn't 100% complete, as Darrah was not working directly on the game throughout much of this time. But as a higher-up at BioWare and eventual executive producer, he was nonetheless positioned to see a lot more than most.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah was only executive producer for the final 16 months of the game's development. Even so, he opens the video by taking ownership of Anthem's failings and struggles:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Some of this video is going to look like I'm trying to shift blame around, but ultimately the responsibility for this game does mostly rest on me," he says. "I have a list of people that I won't share that I also feel share blame on this project. Almost everyone on that list is more senior than me. The team worked really hard on this game, the team put a lot of excellent work on this game, and there are things that are amazing in this game even now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah goes on to walk through the first six years of development, outlining a number of pitfalls Anthem ran into along the way. He talks about Anthem's original conception at a time within EA where its executives believed single-player games were no longer desirable, leaving BioWare in a challenging position as an historically single-player-focused studio. BioWare lead Casey Hudson's early vision of Anthem, he says, was to do BioWare storytelling in a live service, always online format, and he proposed they come up with a new, never-before-seen business model to do it. That's how Anthem initially got momentum internally among EA's executive leadership. As Darrah puts it, "What if BioWare game, but it could do FIFA numbers?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, early on, Anthem ran into trouble because it struggled to get personnel to actually work on it. At one point, BioWare workers were shown a presentation intended for executives that outlined the game's more live service-y vision, and this put many developers off the idea. Additionally, as BioWare shipped Dragon Age: Inquisition, staff kept being moved to Mass Effect: Andromeda, leaving Anthem without the staff Hudson wanted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another trouble with Anthem highlighted by Darrah was the repeated shifting of what the game actually was. While the original pitch was to make something wholly unique, Darrah talks about how difficult that actually is when you can't offer reference points to developers or explain it to executives via familiar touchstones. So over time, Anthem did actually become more like familiar games such as Destiny and Borderlands.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In an early design document, Anthem was going to have six javelins. Where did this number come from? It got pulled out of someone's ass.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet another issue, says Darrah, was the level of secrecy involved. While he acknowledges it's important to keep things locked up to avoid leaks, there's a certain level to which he believes it's good to share details more widely. In the early days, he recalls Hudson would strategically share certain elements of Anthem within the wider organization, which allowed him to create excitement and gather feedback. But when Hudson left, no one stepped into that role, and Anthem became aggressively secretive. As a result, Darrah says, it was easier to hand-wave issues, tailor messaging to a very small group of people who were more susceptible to groupthink.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah also tells a pretty pointed story about how being too specific about expectations too early on can lead to disaster. Here's his full recounting of why Anthem didn't have six javelins when it launched:</p><blockquote>In a pretty early design document, Anthem stated that it was going to have six javelins. Where did this number come from? It basically got pulled out of someone's ass. I guess to be more fair, it was effectively broken down like this: We're going to have light, medium, and heavy javelins, so we're going to have two of each kind...and unfortunately this number, six, got presented in early 2017 to EA executives, that Anthem was going to have six javelins.</blockquote><blockquote>Pretty close to that presentation, the team realized that it couldn't do six javelins, for two primary reasons. One, because it couldn't completely figure out how to differentiate six different kinds of javelins, but also because it realized that it didn't have time to make six entirely different archetypes of gameplay. So now, the team is forced to present that no, in fact they're going to have four javelins at launch, and even though that six was based on nothing, was based on a number we said because it kind of seemed pretty logical at the time, but there's nothing behind that, became a source of immense pressure and anxiety from the executives.</blockquote><blockquote>I wouldn't be surprised to find out that one of the reasons that everything came to a head in 2017, with the massive changes that occurred on the project in 2017, culminating in me taking over the project, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that this was triggered by this change from six javelins to four. Again, that number six was based on nothing, but it was seen as the team falling apart.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah goes on to say that he remembers one of the cut javelins was a tanky paladin javelin that was more of a support class, while the other was a medium-class that he cannot remember at all — highlighting how nebulous the idea was to begin with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Toward the end of his video, Darrah talks about a push at EA in 2016 for all its AAA franchises to be "billion-dollar franchises", which would have involved Dragon Age releasing a game every two years. This push is also what sealed Anthem's fate as a live service game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah also cites three different occasions where he told leadership he thought they should push Anthem's release date out further, let Anthem define itself more, ship Andromeda first, and then bring Andromeda people over to finish Anthem. All three times, he says, he was turned down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_QY8F8z_4c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can watch Darrah's full video here.</a> He says he has at least a part two, and perhaps also a part three planned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anthem eventually launched in February of 2019 to middling reviews, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/anthem-review">with our own reviewer giving it a 6.5/10</a> and criticizing the grindiness, lack of polish and variety, and mismatched story. It fell short of EA's sales expectations, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anthem-development-ceases-bioware-to-focus-on-dragon-age-mass-effect">EA ceased active development in 2021.</a> EA will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-will-shut-down-anthem-in-january">shut the game down entirely</a> on January 12, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">RTA in Japan, a well-established charity speedrunning contest, has removed Nintendo games from its upcoming Summer 2025 event, despite showcasing them for the past nine years. This is because they suddenly received a warning from Nintendo about using games without permission. The non-profit hopes to feature Nintendo titles again in future events, likely having to lodge individual applications on a per-game, per-event basis. But why has Nintendo suddenly done this now?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First held in 2016, RTA in Japan is a charity speedrunning event. Contestants apply to play through all or part of their chosen game, aiming to break records or just smash their personal best in front of an audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, a huge number of games have been featured in previous events, ranging from NES classics to recent titles. Their upcoming event, RTA in Japan Summer 2025, takes place in Tokyo from August 9-15, with proceeds going to Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières). The line-up includes Cuphead, Castlevania Dracula X, Final Fantasy IX, Silent Hill 2 remake and Wattam, to name a few. However, all the Mario and Kirby titles that have been part of the event in previous years are glaringly absent.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/gettyimages-2217743482-1754500679089.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Don't expect Nintendo games at Japan's biggest charity speedrunning event. Photo by RICHARD A. BROOKS/AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On August 4, RTA in Japan posted an <a href="https://rtain.jp/rtaij/nintendo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official announcement</u></a> on their website, explaining exactly why the Summer 2025 event will not feature any Nintendo titles. According to the announcement, Nintendo pointed out to the non-profit organization on June 13 that “organizations require prior permission to use Nintendo games,” adding that RTA in Japan’s previous use of Nintendo titles was “unauthorized,” as permission was not obtained in advance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon receiving this notification, RTA in Japan began negotiations with Nintendo, in the hopes of using the Japanese game giants’ titles again for future events. As of August 4, it has been decided that RTA in Japan will apply for permission on a per-event, per-game basis, basically having to ask Nintendo every single time one of their contestants wants to play through a game (even if it has been featured at a previous RTA in Japan event). In their announcement, RTA in Japan revealed that they were unable to establish clear guidelines on this process in time for the Summer 2025 event, hence the decision to omit Nintendo titles this time round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RTA in Japan also apologized to those who had applied to speedrun Nintendo games for the Summer 2025 and had their hopes dashed. Considering the number of Nintendo titles including classic games like Super Mario 64, in previous RTA in Japan event line-ups, it seems likely that many applicants were disappointed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At first glance, this seems like over-protective Nintendo picking on a small charity event. However, the majority of Japanese-speaking users commenting on the matter via Twitter / X took a balanced view of the situation or even sided with Nintendo, with many saying they understood why Nintendo had taken this action now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RTA in Japan started off as a small, volunteer-run effort. However, over the past few years it has grown into a large public event with major sponsors, and the organizer is now registered as a general incorporated association, with all the bureaucracy and responsibility that brings. The event’s growing prominence is likely what made Nintendo sit up and take notice. Some <a href="https://x.com/wsSe4nneZyMWvW1/status/1952515228874559675" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commenters</u></a> even said RTA in Japan should have been more responsible and proactively taken measures to ensure that they had Nintendo’s permission to avoid disruption to speedrun events (comments archived on <a href="https://togetter.com/li/2585429" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Togetter</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a side note, with the Summer 2025 event, RTA in Japan will be doing <a href="https://x.com/englishrestream/status/1949258455589548514" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>restreams of speedruns with English commentary</u></a> for the first time, making the event more accessible to viewers overseas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by RICHARD A.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tekken spinoff <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-tag-tournament">Tekken Tag Tournament</a> won over a generation of fans not just for coming out alongside the PS2 in the year 2000 (and having an amazing Tekken Bowl minigame built in), but for being a quality Tekken game in its own right. A sequel followed in 2011, but since then Bandai Namco has remained quiet on the prospect of a series return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is now the time, given tag fighting games are back in vogue with the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs">Invincible VS</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a> in the works, for Tekken Tag Tournament to finally return?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We asked Kohei Ikeda (Nakatsu), game director on Tekken 8, Katsuhiro Harada, Tekken Project director, and Michael Murray, Tekken 8 producer exactly that. Harada’s response makes for interesting reading for fighting game fans. He said, essentially, that a new Tekken Tag Tournament would be too much for casual fighting game fans to contend with because it would force players to learn multiple complex characters and how they work together. And so, it’s far more likely for Tekken Tag Tournament to pop up as a separate mode within a standard Tekken game, should Bandai Namco ever decide to return to it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Back in '99 when I made the original Tag Tournament… each character has so many moves in a 3D fighter, right, compared to these other games that there's so much to learn just for one character,” Harada began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then to pair that with two, even though back then in Tag 1, a lot of the characters were called compatible or you'd have versions that look different, but they share a similar type of move list. Whereas the Tekken series progressed, the characters became more unique in their move sets, etc. So it's even more involved to try to learn and master a character, and then another one on top of that. And then when you throw in the combination of the two and your opponent's characters, there's just so much more knowledge that's necessary to enjoy the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So the hardcore, they ate it up, for example, in Tag 2. But for your average player, it was very hard to gain a more casual audience, I guess you could say. So if we were to do it again rather than have a standalone game, it would probably be better to have it as some kind of a separate mode within a normal Tekken franchise, right?”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/gettyimages-2221602697-1754482065283.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Harada has thoughts on a potential Tekken Tag Tournament return. Photo by Sia KAMBOU / AFP.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Michael Murray, Tekken 8 producer, chimed in to agree with Harada’s point about tag fighters being harder to learn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nakatsu and myself, we probably grew up in the arcades playing while he was making Tag 1, so we really enjoy the game,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I guess we're more on the hardcore side of being able to use several characters and such, and we loved Tag 2. But we are fully aware that there were just so many people that couldn't get a handle on it because of all the knowledge that's involved.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it seems Tekken Tag Tournament is consigned to history. But Tekken 8 continues. It’s worth reading the interview in full to get an idea of what’s to come, and what Harada and co have up their sleeve for the coming years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

That earlier version of RedOctane was then quickly acquired by Activision (which also ultimately shut it down).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, this new incarnation of RedOctane has been established as part of Embracer, and will be led by Simon Ebejer, who worked as production director on various Guitar Hero titles during the franchise's Neversoft heyday, before later moving on to Vicarious Visions and Blizzard.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"This game won't be Guitar Hero, DJ Hero, Guitar Freaks or Rockband," RedOctane teased in a <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/https/redoctanegamessquarespacecom/news/blog-1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> today. "This is something new. A rhythm game built with love, by people who care, with the community at its core in this fast-changing modern world we live in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We firmly believe the expert here is the community and a new generation of development talent, the folks that have kept the lights on these last few years."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Staffed by a mix of new and veteran developers, RedOctane's rhythm project will be overseen by brothers Charles and Kai Huang, founders of the original RedOctane, as part of a special advisory board. Further details on the game, including a name and project release date, currently remain under wraps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this isn't the first attempt at a rhythm genre revival. Back in late 2023, Epic Games launched <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite-festival">Fortnite Festival</a>, a Guitar Hero-style mode developed by Harmonix (now a part of Epic) that allowed players to tap along via standard controllers or more recent instrument accesories. The offering is still kept updated with weekly tunes, but has not attracted the same player numbers as Fortnite's main battle royale modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Music has done extraordinarily well in Fortnite, but ironically, not so much in music games," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-fortnites-biggest-challenge-is-convincing-people-its-the-everything-game-and-not-just-a-battle-royale">Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney told IGN earlier this year</a>, "more just in Battle Royale and elsewhere.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>MiHoYo has announced plans to cease support for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/genshin-impact/genshin-impact-review-into-the-great-wide-open">Genshin Impact</a> on PlayStation 4. Furthermore, the game is being delisted from the platform.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408849">blog post</a>, the developer states it is ending support for the popular free-to-play action RPG on PS4 due to “limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size." In layman's terms, it sounds like the game has simply become too big and demanding for Sony's last-generation console to handle anymore. This means that in the near future, Genshin Impact on PS4 will no longer receive any updates, and MiHoYo is beginning the process of sunsetting that version of the game.</p>

<p>MiHoYo details a three-step plan that begins with the game’s removal on PS4, which takes place on September 10. The game will be unavailable to download after this date, but those who have previously downloaded the game will still be able to reinstall it, as it will not disappear from their library. You’ll also still be able to log in and receive update patches until the game is taken completely offline.</p><p>Next, in-game PS4 purchases on the PlayStation Store and the in-game shop will be disabled on February 25, 2026. Items purchased on PSN before this date but not yet claimed in-game can still be obtained, however.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, on April 8, 2026, MiHoYo will cease all support for Genshin Impact on PS4. Players will be unable to log into the game, it won’t receive any more updates, and unclaimed items purchased on the PlayStation Store will only be obtainable by logging into the PS5 version.&nbsp;</p><p>The PS5 version of Genshin Impact will be unaffected by this development, and the game supports cross-progression, making it easy to transition to the other platforms the game remains playable on. &nbsp;In addition to PS5, Genshin Impact is available on Xbox Series X/S, PC, iOS, and Android.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/06/genshin-impact-is-being-delisted-on-ps4-as-hoyoverse-plans-to-cease-support]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>"Avoiding tragedies--through methods such as never letting a love interest die--isn't a limit we set for ourselves," the Love and Deespace team told GameSpot.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Love and Deepspace is a worldwide phenomenon. Earlier this year--and less than a year after its global release--the mobile dating game hit <a href="https://x.com/Love_Deepspace/status/1881915061557764228" rel="nofollow ">50 million users</a>. A few weeks later, it was reported that, after earning a record-breaking $61 million in December 2024 alone, Love and Deepspace had raked in <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/love-and-deepspace-celebrates-first-anniversary-and-over-400m-after-record-breaking-month/" rel="nofollow ">$400 million in 2024</a>. And yet I'd still argue that, in a sense, Infold's hit title remains somewhat of a hidden gem.</p><p dir="ltr">It's no secret that mobile games, dating sims, and games designed with a female audience in mind are often dismissed, and Love and Deepspace is no exception. As such, across my year of playing the game on and off, I've shocked multiple friends simply by showing them what it actually is. With its fast-paced combat, stunning visuals, deep sci-fi setting, and focus on delivering stories that delve into "seemingly negative emotions," trauma, and uncomfortable subjects, Love and Deepspace shatters a lot of preconceived notions.</p><p dir="ltr">Love and Deepspace has challenged the preconceived notions of some of the developers, too. Following the release of Love and Deepspace's wedding-themed July 3 update, Witnessed by Deepspace, I exchanged emails with the Infold team in which we discussed what it's like designing a game with a female audience and mind. It turns out that working on the game has helped its male developers gain "progressively deeper insights into female player psychology." It also sounds like Infold might also be willing to challenge players' notions about what love is, and whether there are some lines--like killing off a love interest--the game won't cross.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544951-f3424f82a0cc3bad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544951" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544951-f3424f82a0cc3bad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544951"></a><figcaption>Love and Deepspace's five main love interests.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544951-f3424f82a0cc3bad.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Romance games usually do not include combat, but the combat system is an inseparable part of Love and Deepspace. How does the combat system fit into this romance story, and enhance players' love experience? How does the game's new roguelike mode fit into this?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"Fighting side by side" was a crucial element in our game's initial concept because we felt this encapsulates the essence of romantic relationships: two people facing life's challenges together, growing together, and moving toward the future together.</p><p dir="ltr">Therefore, when designing the game, we built our gameplay mechanics and lore around this central idea. In this futuristic setting, players and their love interest face monsters called Wanderers that are from Deepspace. By battling these creatures, they gradually discover the mysteries of the world and unravel its challenges. During this process, their relationship grows through mutual support, which is a naturally occurring experience. In the game's stories, combat and romance are indispensable. The bond built from fighting together and growing together will be stronger and more touching.</p><p dir="ltr">This update's UNICORNS Operation is the third roguelike combat mode in our game. It follows up on the previous two iterations: Abyssal Chaos--Find Tobias and Abyssal Chaos--Final Farewell. Our players enjoyed these as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of our roguelike modes features unique progression and team composition mechanics that are designed to give players an entirely new, satisfying combat experience. In addition, UNICORNS Operation introduces exploration gameplay. Players can explore Tanakahli and speak to the island's three factions. As they delve deeper into the investigation and approach the truth, they'll discover new facets of his personality and create more memories with him. Whether it's the cooperation during combat or joint exploration, both allow players to understand him better and gain special emotional experiences beyond the sweetness of daily interactions.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How does the team go about crafting emotional, high-stakes, and sometimes devastating stories while still ensuring that players feel comforted and happy while playing? Are there certain boundaries, such as killing off a love interest, that the team will not cross?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We center our creative work around the timeless themes of "characters" and "love," but avoiding tragedies--through methods such as never letting a love interest die--isn't a limit we set for ourselves.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">In reality, love is an incredibly rich, multi-faceted, complex emotion. Sweetness and romance make up one aspect of what it could be. Seemingly negative emotions like pain, anger, sadness, and reluctance are integral to love. In certain moments, the tears and heartache make us fully aware of love's presence.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">During the creation process, we don't shy away from depicting lovers' quarrels, emotional conflicts, or even the loss of a loved one. These are challenges that everyone faces. When these stories appear, we prefer to seek out their deep connection with love, explore how love helps us face pain and conflict, gives us strength, and makes our hearts more resilient.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from the expression of love, our approach to every detail, story, and line of dialogue is centered around the characters themselves. The game unveils the world of Love and Deepspace in a comprehensive manner. It conveys the events that unfold in Linkon City at one point in time. This means players will see a broader, more integrated picture of each character. While individual stories may contain tragic elements, these moments ultimately deepen the players' connection to the characters. If players feel healed or satisfied after experiencing a story with tragic elements, then perhaps it's because they embraced [their love interest's] soul in that tale.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544953-loveanddeepspace_witnessedbydeepspace1-10screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4544953" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544953-loveanddeepspace_witnessedbydeepspace1-10screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4544953"></a><figcaption>The protagonist embraces Zayne</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544953-loveanddeepspace_witnessedbydeepspace1-10screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>What inspired the team to launch a wedding-themed event? What is the inspiration behind each of the different wedding gowns and rings?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It's been almost a year and a half since the game's official release. We believe players have reached a certain stage in their emotional journey with their love interest. They've also created many wonderful memories in the game. For this milestone, we wanted to provide players with a grand ceremonial vow--a promise about love, an answer about happiness--which is why we chose the theme of "Witnessed by Deepspace."</p><p dir="ltr">The formal wear for all five love interests, along with the matching dresses and rings, was designed around each character's unique demeanor and emotional connections. These outfits feature thoughtful details:</p><p dir="ltr">Xavier's design incorporates Wavyleaf Sea Lavender, star trails woven into galactic patterns, and other decorative elements. The overall aesthetic is dreamlike and dignified, reflecting his noble, refined elegance.</p><p dir="ltr">Rafayel's outfit uses flame lilies, starfish, ocean waves, and fire-and-water motifs to represent a romance that's tied to the ocean.</p><p dir="ltr">Zayne's look features white jasmines, snowflake-cut diamonds, and frost-like embroidery to create a reserved, graceful temperament that's rich in detail.</p><p dir="ltr">Sylus's design draws inspiration from datura and fluttering feathers, creating a free-spirited aesthetic that expresses his mature, distinctive temperament.</p><p dir="ltr">Caleb's ensemble takes black holes and paper cranes as its main sources of inspiration to emphasize destiny. For instance, the chain from his bow tie to his chest symbolizes the intertwining bonds of fate.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>This update comes with a lot of new features, such as an upgraded AR companionship system, a journal module, cat adoption, and a new roguelike mode. What feature are you most excited for players to experience?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Picking one is very difficult. We believe all these features are important. For Love and Deepspace, excellent combat, companionship, and widgets crafted alongside our narrative are all part of enhancing the overall experience, so it's hard for us to say which one is the best. What we can say for certain is that providing players with the best, most unique gaming experience has always been our cornerstone and goal. Because of this, we've put in a tremendous amount of effort and refinement into every feature.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544952-863fa8432a63afdab27808383f54b8a1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544952" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544952-863fa8432a63afdab27808383f54b8a1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544952"></a><figcaption>The protagonist touches Sylus.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544952-863fa8432a63afdab27808383f54b8a1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Despite women being just as likely to play games as men, our demographic continues to be underserved or ignored by many studios. As such, Love and Deepspace serves a truly special and vital role in the industry. What is it like designing a game for a predominantly female player base?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Our objective has always remained the same: to create more immersive, visual experiences at a higher quality for players.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Your team seems to have a fantastic grasp on how to create stories and gameplay that appeal to young women so I am curious: What percentage of your team are women? Do the men who work on the game find they understand women better through their work on it?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We have quite a few female employees on our team. They're involved in very important decision-making, and the male employees on the team have gained progressively deeper insights into female player psychology throughout the development process. The shared goal that all members have been working toward is to provide our players with a better game experience that's full of respect and attention to detail.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">In addition to the above questions, I asked the team about Love and Deepspace's age rating in North America, storage-optimization issues, how they ensure each love interest gets equal treatment, the game's gacha mechanics, and if the studio plans on bringing Love and Deepspace to PC. As of right now, the studio is not ready to publicly discuss these topics.</p><p dir="ltr">Interested players can download Love and Deepspace via Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store. The hit otome game is currently a month into its 4.0 update, Witnessed by Deepspace.</p>

            <p>
After celebrating the launch of its digital library earlier this year, the preservation-focused Video Game History Foundation has expanded its publicly available collection with the full run of Computer Entertainer, described as "one of the first American video game magazines".
</p>
<p>
Computer Entertainer might not be an immediately recognisable name this side of the pond, especially 35 years after its final issue was published, but the Video Game History Foundation's <a href="https://gamehistory.org/computerentertainer/">announcement</a> details the magazine's history, highlighted exactly why it's something of a unique - and valuable - record of home console video gaming in the mid-1980s.
</p>
<p>
"Most console game magazines in the US went out of business during the 1983–84 industry crash," it explains, "except this one. As a result, Computer Entertainer is one of the only sources for American reviews of classic games like The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Super Mario Bros. And because it was run by a game retailer, this magazine is one of the only reliable sources of American game release dates during this period."

<p>
Computer Entertainer started life as The Video Game Update, a newsletter for US mail-order retailer Video Take-Out, and would run from 1982 to 1990. It was co-edited by sisters Marylou Badeaux and Celeste Dolan, which, the Video Game History Foundation notes, means it's also the "earliest console video game magazine run by women".
</p>
<p>
The foundation - which <a href="https://gamehistory.org/">describes itself</a> as a "non-profit organisation dedicated to preserving, celebrating, and teaching the history of video games" - acquired a complete run of Computer Entertainer from Marylou Badeaux last year, and began digitising the bound copies using a book scanner, resulting it what it admits were "poor quality" scans. However, following the death of Celeste Dolan, Badeaux also donated her sister's copies, after which the organisation made the decision to disassemble one set in order to scan it at the "highest possible quality".
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, the foundation sourced a number of missing copies from game historian Leonard Herman in order to complete its collection and acquired the intellectual property rights to Computer Entertainer, so the magazine could be made available to everyone for free.
</p>
<p>
As such, the <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/519c0dbd-0f5d-45fe-83c2-355a756391a9?_gl=1*1f9exmf*_ga*MTQyMDc5NzgyMS4xNzU0NDk2NzMy*_ga_4ZPZBFRVR6*czE3NTQ0OTY3MzEkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTQ0OTY3ODMkajgkbDAkaDA.">complete run of Computer Entertainer is now available to read, search, and download</a> via the Video Game History Foundation's digital archive, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-history-foundations-long-awaited-digital-library-will-be-available-next-week">launched earlier this year</a>, providing access to a magazines, art books and more spanning the history of the gaming. Computer Entertainer has been released under a Creative Commons Attribution license, meaning it can be used for any purpose provided appropriate credit is given. 
</p>
<p>
The Video Game History Foundation was established in 2017 and joins <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-preservation-took-steps-forward-in-2024-but-still-has-a-long-way-to-go">other historians and preservationists working to ensure the medium's rich legacy isn't forgotten</a>. The organisation had previously been attempting to secure excemptions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) that would permit libraries and archives to remotely share digital access to out-of-print games in their collections. Unfortunately, those efforts - which US video games industry lobby group the ESA refused to support - were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-copyright-office-rejects-video-game-preservationists-request-for-dmca-exceptions">rejected in 2024 by the US Copyright Office</a>.
</p>
<p>
Game preservation work continues, however. Last year, for instance, online retailer GOG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">announced the launch of its Preservation Program</a>, intended to maintain the compatibility of games with modern and future systems, and more recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-joins-europes-largest-organisation-dedicated-to-game-preservation">joined the European Federation of Game Archives, Museums and Preservation Projects</a>.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, talk of games preservation has overlapped with the Stop Killing Games campaign, which aims to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">mount political and legal challenges to games going offline</a>. A related EU petition <a href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007_en">recently closed with over 1m signatures</a>, meaning it can now be submitted to the EU for verification and then, potentially, either progress to a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament. Publishers, however, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">seem to object</a>.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/cup-and-ball-toy-kendama-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wooden-cup-and-ball-toy-a-review.1263678/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve spent the past handful of days with my friends in a house near the beach in Maine, communing with nature not in the sense that we’re at all removed from civilization, but certainly in that, when compared to the oppressive grays of New York, there are more trees around. In line with this slower-paced, foliage-rich approach to life, the house we’re staying in contains one of those wooden toys where you try to swing a ball into a cup. This one, Wikipedia just informed me, is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Kendama</a> and is actually of Japanese origin. I have some thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a pleasant physicality to the Kendama that makes it appealing in a gently social setting where, say, a few people might be talking while a couple others are scrolling on their phones. I could, in such a moment, also send my brain hurtling back to a realm of stress and obligation via the obsidian portal that’s always weighing down my pocket and my life, or I could swing a wooden ball attached to a string until it lands in a cup.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing beats the sheer elation of finally pulling it off – except managing to do so two times in a row. Three times in a row feels at least as good as beating one of the less-acclaimed <em>Souls </em>games. Four times, my current Everest, is probably akin to meeting Gabe Newell if you’re <a href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">really into big boats</a>. But even that does not compare to a feat I pulled off last night: spinning the handle and propelling the ball from one cup to another. In that moment, I saw the face of God, and He said, “Hey man, that was pretty cool.”&nbsp;</p><p>You can pick up the Kendama anytime, anywhere, which greatly adds to its appeal. In that regard, it’s not unlike the Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS edition, the other handheld gaming console I’ve been spending time with during my trip. The Go S differentiates itself from the rest of the pack in that it’s the first Steam Deck-alike to come with native SteamOS support, meaning that it’s as intuitive out of the box as Valve’s ultra-portable PC – and with beefier specs to boot. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ars Technica</a> has observed, SteamOS also seems to give games a minor performance boost compared to Windows 11, so the Go S SteamOS edition also outpaces its own closest relatives in Lenovo’s Legion Go line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve spent many an idle evening hour playing <em>Warframe </em>– which has barged back into my life after <a href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-old-peace-world-war-one-interview-tennocon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TennoCon last month</a> – on the Go S, and the odd frame drop here or there aside, it runs pretty much perfectly, popping off a screen which is both bigger and higher-resolution than the Steam Deck’s at 1200p (compared to the Deck’s 800p). When it’s running a game like <em>Warframe</em>, which is not super hardware-intensive but still has a flair for the dramatic in terms of scale and aesthetic, the Go S really shines. Despite owning a Deck since the machine first came out, the Go S has still given me a couple “I can’t believe I’m playing this on a handheld” moments.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, its fans sometimes get really, really loud, threatening to overwhelm its speakers, which to my ear are of vastly lower quality than the Steam Deck’s. Also, while the Go S often meaningfully outperforms the Steam Deck (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPS</a> put together some nice comparison graphs with exact framerate differences), it’s not in an entirely different league. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, for example, still requires a handful of graphical settings to be turned down just to reach an acceptable 30 frames-per-second range, and compared to a proper PC or console experience, it doesn’t look great. It’s playable, but there are so many more optimal alternatives.</p><p>At $600, the Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS Edition is also pricier than the Steam Deck, which makes it challenging to recommend: Speaking personally, as someone who also owns a Steam Deck, I like it a lot and will probably default to it in lieu of the Steam Deck from now on. But if you aren’t a power user or someone with money to burn, the Steam Deck’s combination of acceptable performance and relative affordability is better. Put simply, the Deck is the more practical option.</p><p>However, both pale in comparison to the humble Kendama, which retails for just $20-$50 and <a href="https://meccha-japan.com/it/giocattolo/112576-japanese-toy-kendama-kirby.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes in fun Kirby colors</a>, among numerous other options. It, too, is loud, but in a way that satisfies the user and delights onlookers. Sometimes the ball lands on your finger, but even then, it hurts less than you’d expect. It cannot run <em>Warframe</em>, a bummer but not a deal breaker. All in all, if you’re about to go on a trip to an old but nice home near the sea, I unreservedly recommend stumbling upon a Kendama and fidgeting with it constantly because you have undiagnosed ADHD. 9.97/10</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/eddington-ari-aster-covid-movie-pedro-pascal-joaquin-phoenix"><h3>Eddington Is A Compelling COVID Drama Until It Isn’t</h3></a><p>The film is neither good nor bad, but a secret third thing.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/akane-banashi-shonen-jump-manga-anime"><h3>The Best Shonen Manga Right Now Is About A Niche Performance Artist’s Fall From Grace</h3></a><p>Akane-banashi getting an anime isn't shocking because it's the best ongoing Shonen Jump manga</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-ziff-davis"><h3>IGN Lays Off 8 Staff, 12% Of Union</h3></a><p>The layoffs follow wider cuts at Ziff Davis, buyouts, and layoffs and departures at acquired sites</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/cup-and-ball-toy-kendama-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-nhl-26-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-matthew-tkachuk/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-nhl-26-revealed-arrives-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-this-september-with-the-tkachuk-family-on-the-cover.1263660/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has revealed EA Sports NHL 26, which will once again not be coming to PC, and will only arrive on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S when it launches on September 12, 2025. </p>



<p>This year's cover athletes also follows suit from last year's family focus, though instead of the Hughes brothers, it's the Tkachuk family who are being featured this year, with Matthew Tkachuk sharing the cover with brother Brady Tkachuk and their father Keith Tkachuk, who in his 18-year-long NHL career played for the St. Louis Blues, Winnipeg Jets, Atlanta Thrashers and the Phoenix Coyotes.</p>



<p>Unlike the reveal trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-release-date-gameplay-reveal/">EA Sports FC 26</a>, the reveal for NHL 26 features no direct gameplay, and makes no promising boasts that this year's entry will <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/">"<em>make gameplay better</em>."</a> It's instead more of what you'd expect from an annualized sports series, a flashy trailer that is chalk-full of sparks and sizzle but little substance as to what this year's entry will look like.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NHL 26 Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TI79ySF0N0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As far as what is supposedly different in this year's entry, the 'Be A Pro' mode has been "<em>revamped</em>" according to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250806397524/en/Think-Move-and-Play-Like-a-Superstar-in-EA-SPORTS-NHL-26-Powered-by-Official-NHL-Edge-Data">press release</a>, and is getting its "<em>biggest</em>" update since NHL 21, according to EA Sports creative director, Mike Inglehart. Inglehart also claims that EA Sports NHL 26 "<em>is the most true-to-life experience we've ever built</em>."</p>



<p>A new Goalie Crease Control System is also being introduced this year, aiming to make goalies "<em>more responsive, with smarter positioning and quicker, more natural saves</em>."</p>



<p>Regarding this year's new cover athletes, now back-to-back Stanley Cup champion and Florida Panther forward, Matthew Tkachuk, adds "<em>My dad, Brady and I are all unique and play the way we want to. Sharing the cover of NHL 26 is an extension of that. I've always tried to bring my own style to the ice, and seeing that captured in NHL 26 makes it feel like it is really me out there</em>."</p>



<p>Keith Tkachuk, who is gracing the cover of an NHL game more than a decade after he retired from the league, said that he is "<em>proud to be sharing the cover</em>" with his sons. Brady Tkachuk, brother to Matthew and captain of the Ottawa Senators,<em> </em>said "<em>it's an honor to be featured on the cover, and having him standing alongside us makes the whole thing even better</em>."</p>



<p>While it's nice for the Tkachuk brothers to share the milestone of making the cover of an NHL game with their father, fans of the series (myself included) can't help but feel a bit underwhelmed by this reveal. The Be A Pro mode has been the exact same since NHL 21, and even the changes brought in that year's edition of the annualized series didn't exactly shake the hockey world to its core. </p>



<p>EA can talk about how it's been updated and "<em>revamped</em>" all it wants, but we'll need to see the changes before they can be believed. </p>
