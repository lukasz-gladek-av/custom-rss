            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has finally done it. Tonight's Remix Finale event has at last beaten the game's long-standing concurrent player record, set back in 2020 when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-eye-popping-live-concert-hits-all-time-player-record">12.3 million players tuned in for the first broadcast of its lockdown-era Travis Scott concert</a>.
</p>
<p>
14.3 million people were in-game tonight for Fortnite's Remix Finale event, according to the game's public player stats, while millions more were watching online via <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> and YouTube. 
</p>
<p>
That's higher than the 9.8 million watching in-game earlier this month when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-than-10m-fortnite-players-watch-snoop-dogg-ice-spice-headline-concert-streamed-live-from-times-square">Fortnite Remix mini-season kicked off with a livestreamed concert in Times Square</a> featuring Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice. It's more than double the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-live-event-sees-56m-players-defeat-doctor-doom-in-hour-long-battle">5.6 million players who logged in for October's hour-long Doctor Doom boss battle</a>. And perhaps most impressively, it's also higher than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-the-big-bang-event-was-a-blast-of-marketing-for-the-games-multi-genre-future">last December's much-hyped The Big Bang event</a>, which was attended by 10 million players at the end of the game's hugely popular OG season.
</p>
<p>It's been a while since Fortnite itself has commented on its own player stats. Tonight, Epic Games noted the Remix Finale's huge attendance which it said was a record for a concert event. Excluding concerts - which draw huge engagement but are brief affairs - Epic Games last noted a player milestone at the launch of last year's OG season. Then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">an astonishing 44 million players logged in over 24 hours, for Fortnite's biggest day ever</a>. (Could this record be broken next week, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">Fortnite OG returns as a permanent mode</a>?)</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>You. Showed. Up.</p><p>More than 14 million concurrent players partied up for Remix: The Finale and more than 3 million estimated people streamed it online. This is a new Fortnite all-time record for an in-game concert - thank you! ü¶ã</p><p>We‚Äôre running it back at 8:00 PM ET tonight for‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/1X48yjSD2Q">pic.twitter.com/1X48yjSD2Q</a></p></div>‚Äî Fortnite (@FortniteGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1862950664281919658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24305460/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-concert-eminem-snoop-juice-wrld-ice-spice<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite</em>‚Äôs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24308372/fortnite-remix-finale-concert-juice-wrld-chapter-6-how-to-watch">most recent virtual concert</a> was supersized in multiple ways. Unlike previous events, which focused on specific artists like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/29/24187226/fortnite-metallica-concert-interview">Metallica</a>, this one featured a cast of four different artists: Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Spice, and the late Juice WRLD. And it turned each one of the large lineup into a kaiju-sized performer, while also integrating deep cuts of <em>Fortnite</em> lore and providing a tease of what‚Äôs next for the game.</p><p>Things started out at Snoop Dogg‚Äôs compound, which has been at the center of the battle royale map since the beginning of November. From there, a gigantic version of the rapper performed, before whisking players away into space for another song. In fact, the event constantly moved around: up next was Eminem who fought against a giant robot following a dramatic storm, followed by Ice Spice towering over a cityscape like Godzilla. It ended back on the battle royale island with a pair of Juice WRLD songs.</p><p>The humongous versions of the stars were reminiscent of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">the Travis Scott show from 2020</a>, and ‚Äî much like the Grande concert ‚Äî the event also weaved in bits of <em>Fortnite</em>‚Äôs strange history. Eminem‚Äôs sequence was similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701930/fortnite-epic-games-live-event-mecha-monster-battle-showdown-giant-robot">the game‚Äôs mecha-monster battle from back in 2019</a>, while during Juice WRLD‚Äôs songs players were turned into the glowing butterflies that first appeared in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"><em>Fortnite</em>‚Äôs ambitious black hole event from the same year</a>. At the end players were given a glimpse of what appears to be the new version of the battle royale island that will be playable when the game‚Äôs next chapter kicks off on December 1st.</p><p>After things wrapped up, the game was used to premiere Juice WRLD‚Äôs new animated music video for ‚ÄúEmpty Out Your Pockets,‚Äù which takes place inside of <em>Fortnite</em>:</p><div><p>This all comes after an interesting, music-filled month for the battle royale game. At the beginning of November Epic kicked off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24283508/fortnite-remix-chapter-2-concert-snoop-dogg-ice-spice">a remixed version of <em>Fortnite</em>: Chapter 2</a>, which was a month-long and focused on a different musical artist each week. It was preceded by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music">a real life concert in Times Square from Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice</a>. The mini season also introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301624/can-i-kick-it-yes-i-can-on-thursday">a new cosmetic item in the form of kicks</a>, and saw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301710/fortnites-subscription-is-about-to-become-a-better-deal">Epic revamp its battle pass structure</a>.</p></div><p>The concert not only closed out Chapter 2: Remix, it also set up the game‚Äôs next mainline season. It‚Äôs called ‚Äú<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306403/fortnite-minus-one">Hunters</a>,‚Äù and it kicks off on December 1st with new additions like Godzilla and Baymax, along with a completely new battle royale island.

		<p>The War of the Worlds: Siberia has got its first proper trailer that gives a look at the game which has been inspired by H.G. Wells classic story. The game is set in 1896, in a world where the Martians have invaded Earth. Cities and nations have fallen to the invasion. London fell first followed by other capital cities. The story of The War of the Worlds: Siberia is set after the invasion of Petrograd, and your are one of the survivors heading east.</p>
<p><iframe title="The War of the Worlds: Siberia ‚Äî Premiere Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/63r65WiQoww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The player character is simply called Student. He is separated from his friends and family after fleeing Petrograd, and is embarking on a new life in Siberia on a mission to survive. The War of the Worlds: Siberia is a third person action adventure, in which the Student will use weapons from the era as well as his brain to solve puzzles. The real enemies are the other survivors as groups try to survive in a world where the aliens could strike at any moment. There will be a number of characters that will shape the Student‚Äôs journey, both friends and foes.</p>
<p>War of the Worlds: Siberia is not open world and instead will have levels to progress through, with the story being the focus. In this alternative universe Saint Petersburg is Petrograd, even though in our universe, the name Petrograd was not used until 1914. The imperial family is also called Romeyev, not Romanov, and players will not meet any historical figures. Players will not be venturing as far as Lake Baikal, but the Trans-Siberian Railway does appear. Three difficulty levels are planned which will essentially be easy, medium, and hard. Player choice will impact the story in some ways, and there will be abilities to unlock though these will be grounded in reality.&nbsp; At the moment, War of the Worlds: Siberia is only set to be released on PC, though 1C will consider other platforms.</p>

With Knull still dormant, Venom prefers to wait until they can harness this power safely.

		<p>Motorsport Games has confirmed that all of its NASCAR games will be delisted from digital storefronts on December 31st, 2024. This follows on from the sale of the NASCAR license to iRacing, which has been completed. Motorsport Games is not in the best of positions as it struggles with its finances, with recent financial results stating the company needs more funding to continue operations over the next year.</p>
<p>In a statement, Motorsport Games said, <em>‚Äú<span>To the NASCAR game community! From December 31, 2024, all NASCAR game titles and their DLC content will no longer be available for purchase on all digital storefronts but will remain available to play after this time. This includes the NASCAR Heat, </span><span>NASCAR Rivals, and NASCAR Ignition </span><span>franchises. Please lookout for various platform promotions this December to complete your NASCAR console game collection while you can! We sincerely thank our community for the enthusiasm and support you‚Äôve shown for these games over the years and hope you have enjoyed racing with us.‚Äù</span></em></p>


<p>The recent <a href="https://motorsportgames.com/motorsport-games-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results/">third quarter 2024 financial results for Motorsport Games</a>, have reference to the company‚Äôs troubles, with it saying, <em>‚ÄúBased on its cash and cash equivalents position and the average monthly cash burn, the Company does not believe it has sufficient cash on hand to fund its operations over the next year and that additional funding will be required in order to continue operations. In order to address its liquidity short fall, the Company is actively exploring several options, including, but not limited to: i) additional funding in the form of potential equity and/or debt financing arrangements or similar transactions; ii) other strategic alternatives for its business, including, but not limited to, the sale or licensing of the Company‚Äôs assets in addition to its recent sales of its NASCAR license and Traxion; and iii) further cost reduction and restructuring initiatives.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Motorsport Games has already seen developers get laid off, and it seems the company could be considering such a move again if it cannot secure additional funding, along with selling other licenses. Motorsport Games currently holds the license for Le Mans.</p>

Though, I have to admit, getting $100 worth of Robux at a $20 discount is something you could even gift to yourself. A $100 gift card is equivalent to about 10,000 Robux. By saving $20, you're basically getting a whopping 2,000 Robux for free. Act fast, however, because I'm sure this Lightning Deal will sell out quick. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on what month you redeem your Roblox gift card, you‚Äôll also get a different free virtual item.

<p>"Following the release of 1.0.1, we are now ready to proceed with the 1.0.2 patch," GSC Game World explained in the patch notes. "This update includes bug fixes for six missions, along with additional error corrections."</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455844537830474746">full list of fixes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue when the second wave of monolith soldiers would not spawn during the On the Edge mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>Fixed the issue when Ritcher could be found dead during the A Minor Incident mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>The fixed issue was a player could get stuck after installing the fuse in the Wild Island area if they got the Emitter from Faust's Cell first during the Just Like the Good Old Days mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>The fixed issue was when a player could not successfully complete the All That is Left mission while exploring the Chemical Plant region.</li>
<li>Fixed issue when quest enemies could spawn in unreachable areas for a player during the ‚ÄúDown Below‚Äù mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when Scar could be missing during the Visions of Truth mission.</li>
<li>A few more EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION errors are fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Thanks again for your support. We will continue working on future updates, reading your comments and feedback, and fixing 'anomalies' if they occur," the team concluded.</p>
<p>"If you detect any - report them to our <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.stalker2.com%2Fhc%0A">Technical Support Hub</a>. That will help us investigate your particular case and implement fixes faster."</p>
<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has, of course, got off to an impressive start despite its technical issues. Earlier this week, GSC Game World revealed the shooter has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">already sold 1m copies</a> - and that figure doesn't including all those players exploring The Zone via Game Pass.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>"Apologies for this one taking so long, but it will be well worth it."</p>

            <p>Re-Logic has confirmed there's "no way" we'll see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a> 1.4.5 released this year.</p>
<p>In a lengthy update on the official <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-state-of-the-game-november-2024.139594/">forums</a>, Ted "Loki" Murphy said that whilst the team was approaching the end of their respective to-do lists, end-of-year releases are "fraught with peril" due to review cycles and people going on early leave for the holiday. Consequently, he will not "force anyone on our team or anyone else's team to crunch".</p>

<p>"The work on the final lists from each dev team member is nearing its conclusion, which is a great measure of progress," wrote Murphy. "That said, we are pretty certain that there is no way that we will see Terraria 1.4.5 release this year.</p><p>"To make a long story short, end-of-year releases (especially if you are trying to sync launch across PC-Mobile-Console AND do so globally at the same time) are fraught with peril due to review cycles, people leaving early for the holidays, etc. The hope was that we would be able to get things in ahead of that end of year mess, but that isn't looking to be the case.</p>
<p>"We are also not going to force anyone on our team or anyone else's team to crunch for what would be an arbitrary deadline," Murphy added. "So, that said, the next Terraria update is moving along into 2025."</p>
<p>After acknowledging that the news "will not be welcome for many", Murphy added that Re-Logic "remain[s] committed to being a quality-first studio, so we will take the time necessary for each update to feel 'just right'... and we think that once the update is out, everyone will appreciate that time and care".</p>
<p>"Apologies for this one taking so long for sure, but it will be well worth it," he added.</p>
<p>We recently learned that Terraria will be linking up with open world pocket monster survival game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-announces-major-update-terraria-crossover-despite-ongoing-legal-issues">Palworld for the latter's first big brand crossover</a>. Exactly what this will entail remains to be seen, but artwork posted to social media earlier this week shows characters from the two games interacting ahead of the crossover happening at some point in 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The best Asleep deck in Pok√©mon TCG Pocket is not only fun, but it‚Äôs useful for completing certain Battle Tasks. Having a top-end Asleep deck is a vital part of your Pok√©mon portfolio, and I have the perfect team you need to build.</p>



<p>Pok√©mon TCG Pocket has been a revelation. The older TCG app feels like a distant memory already, and Pocket‚Äôs future is looking brighter than a Flash HM. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Future expansion</a> details sound promising, and Pok√©mon TCG Pocket keeps dropping exciting events to bolster the wealth of content.</p>



<p>Most players already have a slew of dastardly decks designed to win battles in only a few turns. Our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pokemon-tcg-pocket-electric-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Electric deck</a> is the perfect example of this, but don‚Äôt sit around daydreaming when there‚Äôs a boss Asleep deck to assemble.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-asleep-deck-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Asleep Deck in Pok√©mon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pok√©mon TCG Pocket‚Äôs best Asleep deck requires two copies each of <strong>Drowzee</strong>, <strong>Hypno</strong>, <strong>Snom</strong>, <strong>Frosmoth</strong>, <strong>Jigglypuff</strong>, and <strong>Wigglytuff EX</strong>.</p>



<p>The only downside to this deck is it mixes Grass, Water, and Psychic Energy‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not the end of the world. Most Pok√©mon cards in this deck have moves featuring Colorless Energy anyway. </p>



<p>In terms of its strengths, you have <strong>multiple Pok√©mon here capable of inflicting Asleep</strong>. Another huge benefit to our Asleep deck is <strong>no Stage 3‚Äôs are required</strong>. There‚Äôs a high likelihood your first draw‚Äîalong with a Pok√© Ball or Professor‚Äôs Research‚Äîcan get you up and running immediately.</p>



<p>Furthermore, no one‚Äôs sleep move costs more than three energy, and the focus is on Wigglytuff EX‚Äî<strong>these are the cards we want</strong>. Its <strong>Sleepy Song move costs three Colorless Energy</strong>, does <strong>80 Damage</strong>, and <strong>guarantees your opponent falls Asleep</strong>. Prioritize Jigglypuffs and Wigglytuff EXs, if you can.</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs our best Asleep deck in full.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-asleep-alternatives-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Asleep Alternatives in Pok√©mon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>The evolution line of <strong>Oddish, Gloom, and Vileplume</strong> is the only other serious consideration for the best Asleep deck in Pok√©mon TCG Pocket. </p>



<p>Its omission from the main deck is the result of one aspect: <strong>It‚Äôs a three-stage evolution</strong>. </p>



<p>Meaning, you need a lot more luck on your side to get and use Vileplume. If you do, it‚Äôs one of the strongest Stage 3 cards in all of Pok√©mon TCG Pocket‚Äîprimarily because it deals a lot of damage, puts Pok√©mon to sleep, and has 140 HP (unreal for a non-EX card.)</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-asleep-deck-so-powerful-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Why is Asleep Deck so Powerful in Pok√©mon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>A lot of Pok√©mon TCG Pocket decks boil down to coin flips‚Äîand putting your opponent‚Äôs Mon to sleep can ruin entire game plans in the first few turns. It renders Pok√©mon catatonic, stops them from doing damage, and gives you free hits for as long as the coin flips are on your side.</p>



<p>Plus, in the case of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/venusaur-drop-event-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-new-promo-a-cards-rewards-tasks-how-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Venusaur Drop Event</a>, certain Tasks and Rewards are tied to the Asleep condition. The aforementioned event features a Battle Task instructing players to ‚Äú<strong>Make your opponent‚Äôs Pok√©mon Asleep 1 time.</strong>‚Äù So, even if you‚Äôre not concentrating on winning, this deck is sure to put someone to sleep.</p>

It's time to respawn, with upgrades. After checking out the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-review" rel="nofollow">Halo Flashpoint Recon Edition</a>, we're now delving deep into the larger <em>Halo Flashpoint </em>Spartan Edition and <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Paint Set.</p>

<p><em>Halo Flashpoint</em> is a brand new miniatures game from Mantic Games, of which we've covered several of their products over the years, from the sci-fi skirmish game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/deadzone-3e-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Deadzone</a>, the sports battler <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/overdrive-review" rel="nofollow">OverDrive</a>, and their awesome fantasy mass battle game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/kings-of-war-guide" rel="nofollow">Kings of War</a>. In this article, we won't be going over how to play <em>Halo Flashpoint</em>, you'll have to check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-review" rel="nofollow">Recon Edition Review</a> for that, here we're going to look at what extra you get in the Spartan Edition set, along with the <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Paint Set, and talk about whether it's worth the upgrade.</p>

<p>The <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Spartan Edition is a much larger box than its Recon counterpart, this is because it contains over double the amount of miniatures and extra scenery.</p>

<p>The <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Spartan Edition contains (with the items in bold signifying those that are different from the Recon Edition):</p>

<ul><li><strong>16x Spartan models</strong></li>
	<li><strong>4x Banished Elite models</strong></li>
	<li>Rulebook</li>
	<li>Playmat</li>
	<li>Pre-coloured card terrain and tokens</li>
	<li><strong>Deluxe 2-sided playboard</strong></li>
	<li><strong>20x Weapon cards</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Extra terrain and tokens</strong></li>
	<li><strong>20x Player/model cards</strong></li>
	<li><strong>3x Reference cards</strong></li>
	<li>12 x D8 dice</li>
	<li><strong>8x Command dice</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Plastic 3D arena accessories</strong></li>
</ul><p>Like in the Recon Edition, the miniatures are single piece and ready to play, but you don't just get more of the same miniatures, you get the 8 from the Recon Edition, along with another 8 (2 of each of the 4 types), but with new armaments. You also get 4 Banished Elite models to pit your Spartans against.</p>

<p>Along with the paper playmat from the Recon Edition, you get a much more durable double-sided card playboard that features 2 terrain types that match the double-sided scenery (of which you also get more of), and you also get some plastic 3D arena accessories like flags to use in the different mission types. And because you're going to be playing bigger games, you get more command dice, more tokens, and a duplicate of each of the equipment cards.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-2.jpg?itok=3bdZsGgD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-recon-edition-2.jpg?itok=xXWx2P8O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Currrently the <em>Halo Flashpoint</em>&nbsp;Paint Set is the only place to get the playable Master Chief miniature&nbsp;(Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure><h2>What Does The Halo Flashpoint Paint Set Contain?</h2>

<p>The <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Paint Set is an incredible little product. It's currently the only place to get the Master Chief miniature (worth the purchase alone), but it also serves as a starter paint set for those who might be new to the hobby. Inside the box you will find:</p>

<ul><li>8 x Army Painter Warpaint Fanatic Paints</li>
	<li>1 x Brush</li>
	<li>1 x Master Chief Model</li>
	<li>2 x Game Cards</li>
</ul><p>We've covered the awesome <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/army-painter-gift-sets-guide" rel="nofollow">Army Painter</a> sets in the past, but this isn't just a rebox of their normal paints, this comes with 8&nbsp;<span><em>Halo-</em>branded</span>&nbsp;paints:</p>

<ul><li>UNSC Armor Green</li>
	<li>UNSC Visor Gold</li>
	<li>UNSC Techsuit Grey</li>
	<li>Red Team Red</li>
	<li>Blue Team Blue</li>
	<li>Banished Black</li>
	<li>Forerunner White</li>
	<li>The Flood (which is an absolutely incredible bit of marketing, is a wash that goes over the other paints once dry to bring out the detail)</li>
</ul><p>The brush that comes in the set is a basecoating brush, which is great for putting the base layer in black or white, and then the first layer of colored paint before adding the wash. If you want to start adding detail, you just need to pick up a brush with a slightly thinner tip, and mix the paints in this set with white (to make them lighter) and you can highlight your Spartans with just this set.&nbsp;The Army Painter also has a full video tutorial for painting the Master Chief miniature that you get in the set, which you can check out <a href="https://www.manticgames.com/news/learn-how-to-paint-master-chief/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Master Chief miniature that comes in the set is awesome, and John-117's pose really captures the feeling of him striding purposefully forward with an energy sword. Master Chief's stat card is also pretty insane, and as a result, he counts as 2 Spartans when using the drafting rules out of the box. John has 3+ stats across his profile for ranged, fight, and survive, along with an extra hit point and energy shield over his Spartan counterparts.</p>

<p>Master Chief also comes with the One Man Army Special Order, which means that if you use a special order command dice, you can then use any number of advance, fight,t or shoot command dice to throw Master Chief into the fray. John-117 is armed with an Energy Sword that has the same stats as the equipment card from the set, but no ranged weapon, so you will have to cover him with other Spartans until he can collect one, or close the distance.</p>

<p>The <em>Halo Flashpoint</em> Spartan Edition comes with the same 2 copies of the 4 Spartan types as the Recon set, along with 2 copies of the same 4 Spartan types, with different armaments, and 4 types of Banished Elites.</p>

<p>The Spartan Editon includes 2 identical teams of 4 Spartans from the Recon edition:</p>

<ul><li>Spartan MK VII - Armed&nbsp;with an MA40 Assault Rifle.</li>
	<li>Spartan Brawler - Armed with a CQS48 Bulldog.</li>
	<li>Spartan Zvezda - armed with a&nbsp;VK78 Command.</li>
	<li>Spartan Deadeye - Armed with a&nbsp;M392 DMR rifle.</li>
</ul><p>Along with 2 teams of identical teams of the following 4 Spartans:</p>

<ul><li>Spartan MK VII - Armed with a Pulse Carbine, which rather than have rapid fire like the MA40 Assault Rifle, has Armor Penetration (1) and Energy Shield Depletion.</li>
	<li>Spartan Brawler - Armed with a Needler, which has a longer range than the CQS48 Bulldog, and rapid-fire / weight of fire, rather than knockback.</li>
	<li>Spartan Zvezda - Armed with a Cindershot, which has a shorter range than the VK78 Commando, but has energy shield depletion, grenade implosion, and lethal.</li>
	<li>Spartan Deadeye - Armed with a Stalker Rifle, which has Armor Penetration 1, and a sniper scope, which allows a long action shot, taking more actions, but adding 2 dice and getting headshots on a 7 or&nbsp;8.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-flashpoint-spartan-edition-3.jpg?itok=eKnqIW9_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-flashpoint-spartan-edition-3.jpg?itok=ZWkHH5qi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Currently, the only place to get hold of the Banished miniatures and profile cards is the The&nbsp;<em>Halo Flashpoint</em>&nbsp;Spartan Edition (Photo: Mantic Games).</figcaption></figure><p>The 4 Banished Sangheili Mercenaries included in the Spartan Edition, all have the same stats, with 4+ in ranged, fight, and survive, but also Energy Shield 3 and evade which allows them to move after being shot. The Sangheili come with the following armaments:</p>

<ul><li>Energy Sword / Plasma Grenade</li>
	<li>Energy Daggers / Needler / Plasma Grenade</li>
	<li>Energy Daggers / Plasma Rifle / Plasma Grenade</li>
	<li>Energy Daggers / Pulse Carbine / Plasma Grenade</li>
</ul><p>And to keep the pressure on the Spartans the Sangheili come with Reinforcements Incoming special order, which allows their player to use a special order to speed up their respawn. You can't mix Banished with Spartans, so the Banished team selection is fixed in this box, but it does add a welcome dynamic to the set, rather than just fighting against other Spartans, until further factions are released.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Halo Flashpoint Spartan Editon and Paint Set?</h2>

<p>I'm a big fan of the <i>Halo Flashpoint Recon </i>Edition box, and the Spartan Edition is the Recon Edition, but with much more. You get a lot more variety for your drafts, making teams entirely of any of the 4 types is possible here, and the different armament options make games more interesting, especially with the addition of the Banished team. It's also worth noting that while more Spartans are on the release roadmap for the next few months, the Banished aren't, so this is a very worthwhile purchase to start playing with them.</p>

<p>And if you want to add Master Chief to your games, the paint set for me was worth it for the miniature alone, and the additional <em>Halo-</em>themed paints and brush were a bonus.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Should I Buy The Halo Flashpoint Spartan Editon and Paint Set?</h2>

<p>If you just want a simple pick-up-and-play deathmatch game, then the Recon Edition is very solid for the price, but if you want a lot more variety, or you're looking to go full into <em>Halo Flashpoint</em>, then the sheer variety of the Spartan Edition makes it worth it. You get 5 different full-fire teams, along with all the extra scenery, 3D arena accessories, and the durable gameboard, which is well worth the extra investment.</p>

<p>The paint set is worth it for the Master Chief miniature alone if you're a <em>Halo</em> fan, and adding him to your games is a lot of fun. If you're a <em>Halo</em> fan but not a tabletop gamer, then this box is perfect to get the miniature and the paints you need to have him looking great on display.</p>

However, one of the better offers still available is on the latest<strong> PlayStation 5 Digital Edition</strong>, which is on sale at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-PS5-Digital-Console-Slim%2F5113183757">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/ow8vdkonq4ogj">Best Buy</a>, and Sony‚Äôs <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim">PlayStation Direct storefront</a> for an all-time low of $374 ($75 off). It‚Äôs also available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-Digital-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DJHG2VVS?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> as part of a <em>Fortnite</em> bundle that includes some in-game cosmetics and other freebies.</p><p>Alternatively, if you prefer your console to come with its disc drive (instead of having to potentially add one later), you can get a <strong>disc-ready PS5</strong> for $424 (regularly $499) at <a href="https://howl.link/a96z6zpacc2ax">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-PS5-Disc-Console-Slim%2F5113183756">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim">PlayStation Direct</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-Digital-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DJHF6Q9Z?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> (in that same <em>Fortnite</em> bundle). <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/">According to Sony‚Äôs listing</a>, the ongoing promo should last through the holidays. So, while you may have time to mull it over, there‚Äôs no guarantee your preferred retailer (or the one you collect rewards points from) will have it in stock the whole time.</p><div><p>The PlayStation 5 Digital doesn‚Äôt come with a disc drive, but you can buy one separately if you later decide you want one. The console otherwise plays all of the same games as the version equipped with a disc drive.</p></div><div><p>Sony‚Äôs new standard PlayStation 5 includes a removable disc drive, dual front-facing USB-C ports, 1TB of storage, and a slightly smaller and lighter design.</p></div><p>The PS5 has been with us for more than four years now, so it‚Äôs built up an expansive lineup of 4K-capable games and now offers a little something for everyone. It may not seem as special now that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">PS5 Pro</a> is out, but at this discounted price, the PS5 ‚Äúslim‚Äù is almost half the cost of a $699 Pro (and even with the Pro, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240906/sony-ps5-pro-disc-drive-separate-price">you don‚Äôt get a disc drive</a>).</p><p>The regular PS5s may not have the same level of graphical performance as the Pro, but in the end, they all play the same games. And if you‚Äôre not the type to notice or care about the tiniest of details when it comes to resolution, frame rate, or extras like raytraced lighting,  the difference between a PS5 and PS5 Pro may not be very stark.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
