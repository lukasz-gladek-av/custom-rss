<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/01/24/tales-of-berseria-review/">Tales of Berseria Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tales of Berseria review, Miguel said, <em>“Tales of Berseria feels like a Tales game made just for me. There’s so many games in the series now, and I’ll never play them all, but the characters and the narrative and the combat mechanics of Berseria just click with all of my tastes so well. For some, the lack of gameplay innovation might be a turn off, but for me, a classic Tales gameplay system combined with a unique narrative led to a fantastic experience. Fans both new and old would be doing a disservice to themselves if they didn’t check this game out.”</em></p>

		<p>Sucker Punch has announced that a free update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> will release next week, adding a New Game Plus mode, new trophies, new cosmetics and more. The patch will launch on 24th November</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - New Game+ | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vY8MXfksWuw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>New Game Plus will be playable once you’ve beaten the main game, and it does exactly what you’d expect. You get to start the game over and start off with all the skills and weapons from your first playthrough. So you’ll have a gun right from the start.</p>
<p>Of course, the point is that you’re then playing the game on a higher difficulty, and this adds two new Trophies</p>
<p>A new currency is also being added –&nbsp;Ghost Flowers –&nbsp;which can be exchanged for 30 new cosmetics and 10 new charms. There is also an additional tier of upgrades for existing armour sets and weapons.</p>

<p>For the game generally, the patch will let you replay content in the post-game after finishing the main story, and there’s a new stats display for this. New button mapping is available in accessibility settings, and new Photo Mode features like shutter speed and a composition grid.</p>
<p>It’s a fairly typical post-launch update that we often see for big budget games, but there’s more exciting stuff coming in 2026, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/ghost-of-yotei-legends-is-coming-in-2026-as-a-free-update/">the multiplayer Legends mode has been promised</a> for then –&nbsp;again as a free update.</p>
<p>Aran was full of praise for&nbsp;Ghost of Yōtei in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">our review,</a> saying it “is an excellent game with an engrossing story, a great lead, deep combat and a land that has so much to discover with a lot of details. This is a truly worthy successor to Ghost of Tsushima.”</p>

            <p>
Ark is one of those strange series to me that seems to have a ridiculous amount of cash to dispense, what with its star-studded cast in the animated adaptation. Gerard Butler and bloody Michelle Yeoh are in it! Not to mention David Tenant, Elliot Page, Russel Crowe and Vin Diesel, the final of whom is meant to be in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-will-hopefully-release-in-early-access-by-2027-once-studio-wildcard-crack-the-dark-art-of-soulslike-combat">borderline MIA</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>. But some of those voices will be appearing in-game through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended's</a> next expansion, Lost Colony, which now has a release date!
</p>
<p>
Said release date is a little over a month away on December 16th, and according to a press release makes direct connections between Ark's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/extinction">Extinction</a> and Genesis expansions, and Ark 2. It's a little bit of prep work, essentially.

<p>
Yeoh is back in her role from the animated series, alongside Tennant as his, as well as cast members like Madeleine Madden (Wheel of Time), Auli'i Cravalho (Moana), Katie Sackhoff (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlestar-galactica">Battlestar Galactica</a>) and Keith David (Coraline).
</p>
<p>
While this feels like an odd way to put it, Lost Colony adds in the first "canonical" expansion map into Ark: Survival Ascended, though I'm sure the presumably many Ark loreheads can speak to that better than I can. Once you start up the expansion, you'll find yourself in a big ole city where something's hunting you down. 
</p><p>
There'll be new abilities, gears, building systems, the usual expansion affair. And from today until the expansion launches, a new dino, the Ossidon, will be wandering around cold-biomes in Ragnarok, Valguero, and The Center. The trailer above puts a spotlight on this admittedly nasty looking beastie. Happy Arking, Arkers! Or Survival Ascending? You get what I mean.

                <p>David Anthony Burke, who began his music career as D4vd after uploading <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> montages to YouTube with his own original songs in 2021, has reportedly been identified as a suspect in the murder of Celeste Rivas.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/11/18/d4vd-suspect-celeste-rivas-death/#continued" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>, law enforcement said that despite there being no official paperwork classifying Burke as a suspect yet, "investigators are looking at [him] as a suspect." Those same investigators reportedly claimed they're viewing Rivas' death as a homicide while waiting on toxicology results from the medical examiner's office.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/d4vd-suspect-celeste-rivas/3806178/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NBC Los Angeles report</a> corroborates TMZ, stating that an LAPD officer with direct knowledge of the investigation said Burke has been uncooperative with the investigation and that he likely had help with dismembering and disposing of Rivas' body this past spring. According to law enforcement, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/decomposed-body-found-singer-d4vds-impounded-tesla-los-angeles-rcna230159" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">who spoke to NBC News</a>, Rivas' remains were not intact when discovered.</p><p>Sources told <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/singer-d4vd-considered-suspect-investigation-teen-found-dead/story?id=126591951" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ABC News</a> that, although the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made, investigators have contacted multiple people they believe were involved with the case in some way. This includes Burke.</p><p>Celeste Rivas disappeared in the Lake Elsinore area last year. She was reportedly last seen on April 5, 2024, in the western Riverside County community in Southern California. Family members said she knew Burke, and her brother, Matthew, <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/body-of-teen-girl-found-in-singer-d4vds-impounded-tesla-what-we-know/3826873/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told NBCLA</a> that she was on her way to see a movie with him the day she disappeared.</p><p>Rivas' body was found in the front trunk of a Tesla parked in an LA tow yard on September 8. Workers noticed a foul odor coming from the vehicle, which was registered to Burke, and notified nearby authorities. Officers came through and discovered the remains in a bag, later to be identified via forensics as the missing teenager.</p><p>Burke was a rising star in the alternative R&amp;B scene, but he started as a gamer. He uploaded various Fortnite montages and anime compilations to YouTube under a channel called "ant" in 2021, but his videos kept getting copyright strikes because of his music choices. To combat this, he started creating his own songs to pair with his videos, which eventually led to his "D4vd" persona, which he claimed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbF7opVBnHQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Zach Sang Show interview</a> was both for SEO and the four cinematic universes (and the characters) he was building.</p><p>He quickly found popularity on TikTok and eventually signed a record deal with Interscope Records' Darkroom label. He'd then produce a single for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-calls-out-netflix-for-disrespectful-ai-made-arcane-season-2-poster/1100-6527972/" data-ref-id="1100-6527972">Arcane Season 2</a>, record the official Fortnite anthem "Locked &amp; Loaded," perform at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards in December 2024</a>, and go on a world tour in August 2025. The remaining tour dates have been canceled following Rivas' death.</p><p>According to ABC News, investigators believe that the medical examiner's office will determine the official cause of death soon. Sources said this will be a vital step in making an arrest and finalizing the charges.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-sales-4m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragons-dogma-2-sales-top-4m-capcom-reveals.1358365/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed that its open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>has hit another major sales milestone, so if you're hoping for more titles in the series, this should hopefully serve as a strong motivator for the publisher.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/DragonsDogma/status/1990948257384526335" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media earlier today, Capcom announced that&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>sales have hit four million. That, naturally, includes all of the platforms on which the game is available, as well as both physical and digital shipments.</p>

<p>To celebrate the new milestone, Capcom also released a new piece of artwork thanking players who've already picked the game up. It's pretty heartwarming, so feel free to give yourself a pat on the back if you're one of the "Arisen" the artwork is thanking.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-sales-4m-artwork.jpg?itok=9iNNBoim 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-sales-4m-artwork.jpg?itok=fq_TzvMI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>has reached four million sales around the world.</figcaption></figure><p>The new milestone means that&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>has managed to amass another 1.5 million sales for itself since last count <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-sales" rel="nofollow">back in April last year</a>, so it's selling pretty steadily, if perhaps not quite as meteorically as some of Capcom's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" rel="nofollow">other titles</a>.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>, it's the sequel to the 2012 cult classic&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma</em>, with that game's director Hideaki Itsuno returning to direct (although he's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios" rel="nofollow">since departed Capcom</a> to join Tencent subsidiary LightSpeed Studios).</p>

<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>is a sequel (the clue's in that number after the name), it's perhaps better thought of as a reboot or a followup; it takes place in a parallel world and doesn't require any knowledge of the first game to enjoy.</p>

<p>You'll once again take the role of the Arisen, who must command Pawns in order to slay a dragon, all while exploring a vast open world littered with sidequests and locations to discover.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/19/new-game-plus-comes-to-ghost-of-yotei-november-24/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Sony reveals that New Game Plus is coming to&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>on November 24th (that's this coming Monday at time of writing). As you'd expect, it'll allow you to start a new run with all of your armor, abilities, and weapons from your previous playthrough.</p>

<p>Naturally, you will need to finish&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>'s main story before you can enjoy New Game Plus, but once you've unlocked the mode, you can also look forward to two extra difficulty levels to challenge you even further, plus two new Trophies to earn.</p>

<p>This update isn't just bringing New Game Plus goodies, however. It's also introducing replayable content once you've finished the main game, and a new stats screen will tell you just how well you did when you replay said content.</p>

<p>New accessibility options, including directional button remapping, are also on the way, along with enhanced Photo Mode features like a new composition grid and adjustable shutter speed to help you snap that perfect shot.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, it's the second game in what is now Sony and Sucker Punch's&nbsp;<em>Ghost&nbsp;</em>franchise. It serves as an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025" rel="nofollow">indirect followup</a> to 2019's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>, pitting new protagonist Atsu against the Yotei Six, who slaughtered her family years before the game's narrative takes place.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Embark Studios has announced that its competitive FPS&nbsp;<em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>will be losing PS4 support next year, so if you're still playing on Sony's last-gen console, it might be time to upgrade.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/reachthefinals/status/1990810282529046592" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Embark says that PS4 support for the game will be coming to an end on March 18th, which is also when the shooter's tenth season is set to start.</p>

<p>Embark says it's retiring the game on PS4 in order to "focus [its] support on current generation hardware", and it's far from alone in making that decision; it joins illustrious company like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow"><em>Genshin Impact</em>'s HoYoverse</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-november" rel="nofollow"><em>PUBG</em>'s Krafton</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-finals-ps4-support-ending-gold.jpg?itok=bqZXBdA4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-finals-ps4-support-ending-gold.jpg?itok=CeCk3NWg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>is losing PS4 support soon.</figcaption></figure><p>If and when you do decide to make the leap from PS4, all of the progress you've made on&nbsp;<em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>will be stored in your Embark account, so you'll be able to pick up where you left off wherever you are.</p>

<p>This news also doesn't affect players on current-gen platforms or PC, nor does it affect Xbox One owners, because, well,&nbsp;<em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>never got itself an Xbox One release. In fact, judging from <a href="https://x.com/jordychinchin/status/1990914208905515479" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some</a> of the <a href="https://x.com/0xmikubeam/status/1991020255057961288" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">replies</a> to Embark's social media message, many people were unaware&nbsp;<em>The Finals</em> was available on PS4.</p>

<p>News of <i>The Finals</i>' sunsetting on PS4 comes as Embark Studios celebrates another major success, namely extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, which launched last month to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" rel="nofollow">very strong sales indeed</a>.</p>

<p>That game looks set to become part of Embark's regular stable alongside <em>The Finals</em>; it's already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-cosmetics-duos" rel="nofollow">received a major update</a> lowering some of its cosmetic prices and rebalancing duo queueing, and more updates and patches are planned for the future as well.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-lore-youtube-book-2000645459</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/over-20-hours-of-elden-ring-lore-is-about-to-become-a-400-page-book.1358353/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The lore-YouTuber-to-book-publisher pipeline is alive and well. <em>Borderlands 4</em> has another busted exploit, and fired Rockstar devs aren’t going quietly. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. According to a handful of Polymarket weirdos, <em>Half-Life 3</em> has a 56 percent chance of being announced before 2027 but only a 7 percent chance of arriving before the end of 2025. Fans are <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-timeline-hype-leaks-clues-explained-release-date-november-trailer-2000645448">getting ready either way</a>.</p> <h2><em>Elden Ring</em>‘s unofficial YouTube lore master is putting out a 400-page book</h2>  <p>Michael “VaatiVidya” Samuels’ YouTube channel is where everyone who loves FromSoftware games but can’t make heads or tails of their stories while playing goes to figure out what the hell is actually going on. He’ll now be boiling down dozens of hours of video into a more digestible form, assuming you belong to an age cohort that’s still literate. <em>Lore Bound: Elden Ring Explained</em> starts at just $42 for the softback version and comes with a magnificent cover.</p>

 <p>“This book will bind together everything I’ve learned from <em>Elden Ring</em>, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, and <em>Nightreign</em> into one single volume,” VaatiVidya <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxxl2QfRJDpRsk_HP0kzlQBg9jYy1PQU6D">said on YouTube</a>. “My old video scripts will be updated, new illustrations will be commissioned, and every effort will be made to ensure each page is clear and engaging.” It arrives just in time to explain the games before the upcoming Hollywood adaptation arrives. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-movie-alex-garland-hidetaka-miyazaki-atari-2000620675">I’m sure Alex Garland will be buying a copy</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> glitch lets you speedrun the skill tree</h2> <p>Normally, you have to invest tons of points per Vault Hunter to unlock their strongest abilities at the bottom of their skill trees. There’s a shortcut, however. YouTuber&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Joltzdude139" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joltzdude139</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/borderlands-4-glitch-unlock-late-game-skills-without-wasting-points/"><em>The Gamer</em></a>) explains how it works. The glitch revolves around repeatedly using the “dump all points option” and reversing it to trick the game into thinking you’ve spent more points than you have.</p>

 <p>Time consuming though it may be, it eventually unlocks the whole tree without using all your points to engineer more busted builds, at least until it <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1990927794000572519?s=20">gets patched out</a>. The full video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwmTrfhPuhw">will take you through all the steps</a>.</p> <h2>Fired <em>GTA 6</em> devs are still protesting outside Rockstar</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fired GTA 6 devs held a protest outside the Rockstar offices in Edinburgh and the Scottish Parliament</p> <p>"GTA 6 will make billions… But I want people to think of the human cost" <a href="https://t.co/pssbIt30LK">pic.twitter.com/pssbIt30LK</a></p> <p>— Dexerto (@Dexerto) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1990857470000967749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I was scared at first, I was apprehensive to join,” one of them said outside the studio’s Edinburgh office this week, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/fired-gta-6-devs-speak-out-about-working-conditions-at-rockstar-at-protests-outside-offices-3284831/"><em>Dexerto</em> reports</a>. “Like many of my colleagues in QA I always felt a bit more dispensable and a bit less skilled than workers in other departments,” he said. “I thought that by joining the union, I could be putting a target on my back. No one should ever feel this way when organizing in their workplace.”</p>

 <p>The studio has yet to elaborate on the firings beyond accusing the developers of leaking company secrets. The matter is currently awaiting review before the UK’s employment tribunal. <em>GTA 6</em> is currently set to release exactly one year from today.</p>

 <h2>Having trouble reviving friends in <em>Battlefield 6</em>? You’re not alone</h2> <p>The shooter’s latest major patch apparently <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1990751823146389872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1990751823146389872%7Ctwgr%5Ef30118f2c4253b9223e8b70a1499cb41306c14da%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fbattlefield-6-defibs-broken-latest-update%2F">broke defibrillators</a>. Many players have reported “watching friendlies try and revive right now and so many of the hits are failing.” The game’s designers are already <a href="http://I've seen quite a few reports yeah, will investigate what's happening">investigating the issue</a>, so a fix might be on the way by this weekend.</p>

 <h2>Where is <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>‘s big expansion?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">YOU'RE WELCOME NOW GIVE US DLC PLEASE <a href="https://t.co/PaN5bzYr0e">https://t.co/PaN5bzYr0e</a></p> <p>— FightinCowboy (@Fightincowboy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fightincowboy/status/1990950415048061015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Fans are still hoping for a <em>Dark Arisen</em>-style DLC now that the friction-filled action-RPG has sold 4 million copies.

The PS1 version was already over 100 hours. The 3DS remaster was a bit shorter. Square Enix is cutting even more content to streamline the latest version. “Some of the [stories] have now been made optional, so you can play them in any order you want,” producer Takeshi Ichikawa <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-quest/at-100-hours-dragon-quest-7-is-an-enormous-jrpg-so-in-the-reimagined-remake-a-few-of-the-stories-which-werent-100-percent-relevant-to-the-main-storyline-have-just-been-cut-entirely/">told <em>Gamesradar</em></a>.” He added, “a few of the stories which weren’t 100 percent relevant to the main storyline have just been cut entirely.” I hope the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> team isn’t listening.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><em>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> campaign is very weird and very bad</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/morsels-roguelike-binding-isaac-pokemon-2000645175">Morsels, on the other hand, is super surreal and incredibly cool</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-strauss-zelnick-gta-6-pc-console-exclusive-2000645103">Is the center of gaming really moving from console to PC?</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

                <p>Epic Games is <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/news/unity-and-epic-games-together-advance-the-open-interoperable-future-for-video-gaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teaming up with Unity </a>to support the popular game engine within Fortnite. Eventually, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said, this partnership will allow "all Unity games" to be published within Fortnite. That means even games that weren't designed for Fortnite should work, and this move could pave the way for Epic to fully incorporate Fall Guys into Fortnite.</p><p>"Starting next year, Unity developers will be able to publish games directly into Fortnite to appear in Fortnite’s discovery system alongside games built with Unreal Engine and to participate in the Fortnite economy as it evolves towards an open metaverse economy connecting all users and all engines," <a href="https://x.com/unrealengine/status/1991074004963057977" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sweeney said</a> Wednesday at Unity's Unite conference.</p><p>This is major news for developers, who will be able to make things for Fortnite without using Epic's tools and may be able to import their existing games into Fortnite as well. And with the recent news that Epic will allow <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-creative-may-be-going-pay-to-win-soon/1100-6536230/" data-ref-id="1100-6536230">Creative maps to sell things for V-Bucks</a>, these Unity devs might actually be able to sell their games in Fortnite.</p><p>It's been a common theory among Fortnite players that Epic will eventually incorporate as many of its other games into Fortnite as it can--and this Unity news will surely fuel rumors about Fall Guys becoming a proper Fortnite mode. While most Epic titles run on Unreal Engine, as you'd expect since that's Epic's own engine, Fall Guys is a rare exception that runs on Unity. Epic has allowed folks who use the Unreal Editor for Fortnite to make their own Fall Guys islands in Fortnite since August 2024, and so it wouldn't be all that surprising if Epic ended up adding the proper full Fall Guys game into Fortnite as part of this partnership with Unity.</p><p>This deal is still fresh, though, and it'll be a bit before we learn many specific details--Epic promises to deliver more info next year.</p>

<figure data-uuid="4efef45db134a"><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4efef45db134a/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The full release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> is right around the corner, and to make sure that everything is in tip-top condition on launch day (tomorrow), Nintendo has released a day one patch to up the game to ver. 1.1.1.</p>

There are a bunch of features included in this one too, such as the addition of a Team Battle to City Trial, the ability to share replays, and amiibo support for the upcoming Air Riders figures.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared on the <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/switch2/software_support/aaaba/111/index.html">Japanese Nintendo Support website</a>, and we've included the Google translation of them below:</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-will-require-age-verification-with-facial-recognition-to-unlock-chat-going-forward.1358314/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat">announced it will soon require facial recognition-based age verification</a> from its players to unlock communication features. Beginning in the first week of December, starting with Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands, and the rest of the world in 2026, this new security feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-experiences-iarc-age-ratings-age-verification-end-of-2025/">is the latest effort from the company to make it a safer platform for children</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>All users can now voluntarily go through the Facial Age Estimation process to secure their access to communication features," </em>it wrote in a new blog post<em>. "During the first week of December, we’ll begin enforcing the age check requirement in select markets including Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. Those requirements will extend to the rest of the world wherever chat is available in early January.</em>"</p>



<p>With this decision, Roblox claims it is "<em>ushering in [a] new safety standard</em>," and says "<em>this innovation supports age-based chat and limits communication between minors and adults</em>."</p>



<p>Following the passing of new legislation in the UK, Discord implemented its own facial recognition age verification for its British users. Facial recognition that was immediately tricked <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/brits-can-get-around-discords-age-verification-thanks-to-death-strandings-photo-mode-bypassing-the-measure-introduced-with-the-uks-online-safety-act-we-tried-it-and-it-works-thanks-kojima/">with nothing more than a copy of Death Stranding</a>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Introducing Age Checks to Unlock Chat" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wrt2Cs5LbbI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Of course, Roblox's verification could fare much better, but while this new measure could do what the company claims it can do, it's by no means a perfect solution. </p>



<p>"<em>As the internet has matured, technological advancements in safety and security have steadily shifted the industry's approach to age assurance. While initial efforts relied on simple self-declared age to manage access to features, the industry has since progressed to behavioral based methods</em>," the blog continues.</p>



<p>"<em>Today, Roblox is going further. We’re unlocking chat and age-appropriate experiences for our users by requiring them to complete an age check through Facial Age Estimation or ID verification<sup>1</sup>. Once the age check is complete, users will only be allowed to chat with others in similar age groups, unless they become <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/advancing-safety-on-roblox-with-age-based-communication">Trusted Connections</a> with people they know.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>This initiative is designed to provide even more age-appropriate experiences for all users, which we believe will improve interactions for users of all ages on Roblox."</em></p>

            <p>
It's been seven years since the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a>, and in all that time, I've somehow never noticed that the title is a reference to sleepless penury. My mind jumped to the association of moonlight with magic and romance, skimming clean over the less enchanting sense of "moonlighting" as working a second job after dark. Luckily, this knowledge has dawned on me just in time to softly kneecap my enthusiasm for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</a>, which launches into early access today, and appears quite a bit different from its predecessor.

<p>
What's the same? Well, it's still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/moonlighter-review">a real-time action-RPG about having a second job as a village storekeeper</a>. By day, you stock shelves with potions, etcetera and work the till. By night, you head into the catacombs to replenish your wares. 
</p>
<p>
What's changed? Well, it's now a 3D game with an angled third-person camera, rather than a top-down pixelganza. They've also moved away from the original Zelda or Binding Of Isaac-style dungeon format. Instead of an expanse of rooms that seal you in till you've killed all their monsters, you'll be picking from branching paths as in a roguelike such as Hades.</p><p>The inventory management side has been re-puzzlified with (for example) new items that consume adjacent items, perhaps gaining in strength for every treasure they eat. The shop management stuff is more elaborate, with new modifiers to boost the value of otherwise homely goods.
</p>
<p>Developers Digital Sun and publishers 11-Bit aren't sure how long it'll be in early access. The current version includes three dungeon biomes with their own enemies, around 120 relics, four main weapons, and roughly 100 shop and dungeon perks. The final version will have more environments, bosses, loot, NPCs, quests and story stuff, plus expanded shop systems, events and customisation options. All this plus the customary bugfixes and general improvements.</p>
<p>
Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2350790/Moonlighter_2_The_Endless_Vault/">Steam</a>. I enjoyed the first Moonlighter, and I'm uncertain about the new dungeons and visual direction, but the inventory and shop enhancements sound worthwhile on paper. To circle back to my intro, I'm a bit concerned that I can be persuaded to overlook exploitative or precarious working conditions if they're presented to me in fluffy fantasy language. Please do not start referring to staff cuts as Ye Olde Layoffs, publishers.

            <p>
I won't comment on the quality of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, the game, because I've not had the chance to play it, though obviously it's not been received with all that much fanfare. You know what I did quite like? Marathon, the short film, the one that came with the game's reveal from Alberto Mielgo. It felt like a strong promise of a (more-or-less) fresh sci-fi world, the performances were subdued, it felt larger than life. Good stuff! Yet as many things currently are, it's been scrutinised over potential AI use, prompting Mielgo to put out a (understandably aggro) statement.
</p>
<p>
Taking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRKzO0XDsow/">Instagram</a>, Mielgo said that he couldn't believe "we’ve reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes: this is not AI. HELLO." He went on to note that everything in the film, including "paintings, animations, 2D and 3D work, compositing, and renders [were] done with [a] huge team - 155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, months… Yes, our Achilles’ heel: time."
</p>
<p>
On the topic of what Mielgo's personal opinion on AI was, he perhaps more sheepishly noted that he has "no idea." To his credit, he followed that up by saying that "AI will never take away my (your) urge or joy for making art and painting. That part will never be replaced." He then sort of ruined that sentiment by finishing with the line, "this text was kindly edited with ChatGPT," a line written so dryly I honestly can't tell if it's a joke or not (I hope so).
</p>
<p>
In seemingly now-deleted comments on the same Instagram post (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/alberto-mielgo-marathon-cinematic-ai-bungie-plagiarized-material/">The Game Post</a>), Mielgo responded to someone asking about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">Marathon's plagiarism issue</a>, obviously a hot button topic in the world of AI, and his thoughts on the fact that some of these plagiarised assets may have been handed off to the director to make his short film with. He explained, "you know what I hate the most? Working our asses off for years to create something cool, only for it to get eclipsed by sphincter smelly press and headline readers. Go whistle around."
</p><p>
To be unfair to both Mielgo and Bungie, there <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">has been</a> a <a href="https://x.com/ELEMENTJ21/status/1671281580831297536">pattern</a> of <a href="https://x.com/relay314/status/1441825409562120201">plagiarism issues</a> at the studio over the years. A one off is one thing, but this is notably questionable. Anyway, I do think people should stop trying to sniff out AI use because annoyingly the stuff is getting better at making "art", so let's put our focus into just completely snuffing it out, yeah?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon has started offering its early Black Friday deals, and if you’re a Nintendo Switch player, one of the best gaming accessories is currently going for nearly half off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5697/">The PowerA wireless controller (Mario Joy Edition) is down to just $27, thanks to a 46% discount that’s live on Amazon right now.</a></p>
<p>The discount is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will also enjoy free shipping on their orders. Even better, you don’t need to worry about entering any weird coupon codes or following complicated checkout processes to score the discount. Just add the item to your cart, and the discount applies automatically. The offer, however, is selling fast, which means it won’t be around for much longer. Grab it while it is still live!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5697/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfortable to Use for Long Gaming Sessions</h2>
<p>This fun red controller has a lot of personality. There’s a Mario graphic on the side, plus colorful buttons that elevate the look while sticking to the overall theme. The ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold, so you can game for hours without ending up with sore palms. You’re getting a familiar button layout with precision analog sticks, a full-size D-pad, and all the essential ABXY and shoulder buttons.</p>
<p>The controller plays nicely with all current models, including the Nintendo Switch, Switch OLED, Switch Lite, and even the latest Switch 2. It runs on AA batteries that offer up to 40 hours of gameplay. You can easily go a couple of weeks without worrying about swapping them out. And since it’s wireless, you can move around freely without a cable getting in the way. Sitting back, standing up, or just passing it around; gaming is going to be convenient.</p>



<p>Just note that it doesn’t support HD rumble, IR camera, or Amiibo NFC scanning, like most other options in this range. If that isn’t a dealbreaker for you, this PowerA wireless controller in Mario Joy is a great option to consider otherwise. It not only looks cool, but offers solid performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5697/">The compatibility is impressive as well, as so is the battery. This deal brings the price down to just $27 after a massive 46% discount.</a></p>
<p>This is the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, but the retailer is likely going to push the price back up soon. Act fast before that happens!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-timeline-hype-leaks-clues-explained-release-date-november-trailer-2000645448</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-the-internet-thinks-half-life-3-is-being-announced-today.1358293/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the last few weeks, you might have noticed something odd. A lot of people seem to think that <em>Half-Life 3</em> is about to be announced. Some folks have dates marked for when we should expect the sequel. There are even some who think <em>Half-Life 3</em> will be announced at the Game Awards. And a lot of people seem to believe that <em>Half-Life 3</em> is real and nearly finished despite, you know, Valve never confirming that. So uh, what’s going on?</p> <p>Since 2021, d<a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINqBTwM=/?moveToWidget=3458764648489439347&amp;cot=14">ataminers have been finding and documenting many snippets of code</a> left in other Valve projects, like<em> DOTA 2</em>, related to something known internally at Valve as “HLX.” And while Valve hasn’t told us what&nbsp;HLX refers to, fans and dataminers have connected a lot of dots over the last four years or so.</p>

 <p>From what has been found, HLX appears to be a single-player, non-VR FPS featuring a character in an HEV suit who fights aliens and soldiers through various levels while possibly solving physics-based puzzles. Now, that sounds a lot like a new <em>Half-Life</em> game. And most of the community following HLX, as well as multiple reliable leakers, have started to call this datamined project <em>Half-Life 3.</em></p>

 <p>The fact that Valve has been working quietly on what appears to be a new <em>Half-Life</em> game for at least roughly five years, and likely longer than that, has created some hype online. But everything got kicked into high gear last week after Valve announced three new pieces of hardware: <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">The Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Half-Life 3</em> hype explodes</h2> <p>For many fans, already hungry for a new <em>Half-Life</em> game and convinced by dubious Reddit posts and TikToks that it was totally being announced soon, this hardware announcement from <a href="https://youtu.be/t1qwXTXVlXE">Valve was a very big deal.</a> Valve often releases new games with new hardware, like <em>Alyx</em> with the Index and <em>Desk Job</em> with the Steam Deck.</p>

 <p>So, naturally, many started to speculate that Valve’s next game, likely HLX aka <em>Half-Life 3,</em> would be announced soon and launched around the release of the new Steam Machine in 2026. <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-steam-machine-is-the-perfect-time-to-launch-half-life-3-2000644102">Heck, even I think that might be possible</a>. But then folks went into overdrive trying to predict the date <em>HLX</em> would be announced.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1oyt88p/summary_of_why_it_will_be_november_2025_and_most/">November 18 became a popular date for many</a>. It would mark the six-year anniversary of <a href="https://x.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584"><em>Half-Life: Alyx’</em>s announcement</a>, the last <em>Half-Life</em> game, and would give Valve plenty of time to market the sequel before an early 2026 launch. Others believe November 19 is the magical date, as it’s the 27-year anniversary of the original <em>Half-Life.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>People soon noticed that there’s a gap in sales events on Steam <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/steam-sale-dates/#:~:text=November%2010%20%E2%80%93%20November,15%3A%20Sports%20Fest">starting on November 18 and ending on December 8.</a> Some theorized that this was because Valve wanted a clear runway for <em>Half-Life 3</em>‘s reveal, though it seems unlikely that Valve would delay sales for a new game reveal.</p> <h2>More clues, more hype</h2> <p>Then fans noticed Geoff Keighley, the creator and host of the Game Awards and master of video game reveals, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1p02x4w/geoff_keighley_has_one_game_on_his_wishlist/">only had one game on his Steam wishlist</a>. When asked about it, he offered up some eye emojis. This threw people into a frenzy, despite the fact that <em>Half-Life 3</em> doesn’t have a Steam page, so it can’t be added to a wishlist yet. Didn’t matter; this was evidence <em>Half-Life 3</em> was going to be announced at Geoff’s annual trailer extravaganza, the Game Awards, in December.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">27 years ago today, Valve released HALF-LIFE, it's first game. <a href="https://t.co/9d13MAyAmB">pic.twitter.com/9d13MAyAmB</a></p> <p>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1991101144207085644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1991101144207085644">The Game Awards tweeted about <em>Half-Life</em> on Wednesday</a>, noting the anniversary of the first game’s release. People freaked. But, as pointed out by<a href="https://x.com/Tyler_McV/status/1991160882202546235"> longtime Valve reporter and leaker Tyler McVicker</a>, the Game Awards account tweets this same anniversary every year. (And does it for <em>Half-Life 2,</em> as well.)</p>

 <p>But that didn’t matter either. At this point, people can’t ignore how many insiders, leakers, and reporters are hinting at some big announcement from Valve. Too many “clues” are being found by the community every day this week for fans to stop getting more and more excited. The hype levels are out of control. The hopium is off the charts.</p> <p>But keep in mind that, officially speaking, Valve has not announced that a new <em>Half-Life</em> game is in development. Still, Valve did reportedly have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/820533/valve-secrecy-security-guards-steam-machine-valve-hq-no-hl3">a lot of extra security at their offices</a> while revealing all the new Steam hardware. And the company does seem to have one more thing to announce, as its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/valve/">official Steam page lists two upcoming games</a>, but only shows one, <em>Deadlock</em>. Is the other game <em>Half-Life 3</em>? The internet seems to think so.</p> <p>As a longtime <em>Half-Life</em> fan who has been waiting a long time for <em>Half-Life 3</em>, I’m inclined to believe, though I’d also advise everyone getting excited right now to remember that this could all lead to nothing. Expect nothing and you’ll be pleasantly surprised with whatever we get.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft’s On-Hold Financial Report Will Be Published Before Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-on-hold-financial-report-published/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft%E2%80%99s-on-hold-financial-report-will-be-published-before-friday.1358284/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has revealed that the H1 FY 2025-26 report that was recently put on hold will be published ‘before the opening of trading on Friday 21st November 2025’. This news comes mere days after Ubisoft delayed the release of the report and put a hold on trading, fuelling widespread speculation.</p>



<p>The leading belief was that Ubisoft was going to uncover something huge, such as an imminent buyout. That has not proven to be the case thus far, but at the very least, we’ll have fresh numbers to examine before Friday.</p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-to-reveal-performance">Ubisoft to Reveal Performance</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cfo-internal-memo/">a report</a> circulated by Insider Gaming last week, Ubisoft’s Chief Financial Officer explained why a hold had been put on trading:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to let you know that we are taking extra time to finalize the closing of the semester, and as a result we will publish our first-half earnings results in the coming days instead of tonight.</p>



<p>Due to legal regulations, we cannot share more information with you at this time. To limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay, we have asked Euronext to suspend the trading of our stock until the results are announced. We know this is likely to raise questions and drive media coverage. </p>



<p>I encourage you all to listen to the conference call – which will be available via the Investor section of our site — just after the results are released so that you have a more detailed view of our earnings.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has now been confirmed that the financial release will drop before trading opens on Friday, which means it’ll probably be published <strong>tomorrow</strong>. Despite trying to remain cool and prevent ‘unnecessary speculation’, Ubisoft sparked just that by this action, which has mostly gone unanswered.</p>







<p>In a recent filing, Ubisoft’s United Kingdom arm stressed that the face of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-people-playing-fewer-games-struggling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games industry is changing</a> as people ‘play fewer games for longer’, which is causing standalone, single releases to ‘struggle to stand out’.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you thought a 7-year-old game couldn’t have one of its most iconic action scenes imitated by an animated Indian film, then think again. Accusations have suddenly come to light that Mahavatar Narashimha blatantly copies some of God of War 2018’s most iconic fight scenes.</p>



<p>Santa Monica’s 2018 reboot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-developers-new-ip-was-cancelled-after-investing-25-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> is a masterpiece. The combat is classic Kratos chaos, and its boss fights and action sequences go up a notch. Who can forget the opening sequence between Kratos and Baldur? Not Mahavatar Narashimha, apparently.</p>



<h2 id="h-god-of-war-and-mahavatar-narashimha-have-something-in-common">God of War And Mahavatar Narashimha Have Something In Common?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sometimes, art imitates art. Credit to Santa Monica</figcaption></figure>



<p>It wouldn’t be a shock if you’ve never heard of Mahavatar Narashimha. The Indian animated movie isn’t well-known outside the country of its origin. Even though it was first debuted at the International Film Festival of India in 2024, it only got a proper theatrical release this year.</p>



<p>It’s been a few months since its July 2025 debut on the silver screen. However, one narrative has suddenly come to the fore: One of Mahavatar Narashimha’s sequences looks like a direct copy of Kratos and Baldur’s first encounter.</p>



<p>X account <a href="https://x.com/BT_BlackThunder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Thunder</a> has done a side-by-side video, showing the God of War sequence, and the alleged Mahavatar Narashimha imitation. The 19-second clip features Mahavatar Narashimha’s character being sent flying through the air—like Kratos—before crashing and lying face-first on the floor—like Kratos.</p>



<p>The next few seconds are unnervingly identical as each antagonist flies toward the character, misses, and stands up menacingly. Both heroes then rip a tree out of the ground, before being tackled and attacked in (again) frame-by-frame copies of one another.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>You can be the judge on this one. It’s not like this would be the first time something has ever copied something else; it’s just odd. Do you think this is nothing more than a happy coincidence? Or is Mahavatar Narashimha blatantly honoring Santa Monica’s game?

                <p>Veteran RPG developer and Fallout co-creator Tim Cain argues that modern games have forgotten some lessons of history--a point he made in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEF1Ankos0g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube video</a>--you can watch the full video below--responding to a viewer's question about whether older titles contain any supposed lost wisdom. Cain's answer--"Yes, there is. Good question." Looking back at his own early years in the industry, he describes an era with only programmers and some artists, but no narrative designers, and far fewer competing priorities. In contrast, he says today's games "try to be everything to everyone."</p><p>In about 13 minutes, Cain explains how he attributes the sharp focus of early games to the era's severe technical limitations and fragmented hardware landscape. "Games were being made for PC, for Apple, for Atari, for Commodore, for a wild assortment of consoles," he recalled, with no shared standards to ease development. Teams were small and multitasking was essential--programmers often acted as artists and sound designers, reverse-engineering undocumented hardware to make their games function.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEF1Ankos0g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YEF1Ankos0g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"These games were really focused, because they had to be," he explained.</p><p>The first major lesson he believes modern developers should reclaim is the importance of efficiency. With the tiny memory budgets and slow processors of the 1980s, Cain says, "you write efficient code or your game doesn't work on the Atari console." Designers were equally constrained: They couldn't stack crafting systems, puzzles, companion mechanics, and sprawling narratives on top of each other. Instead, they had to choose a single segment of gameplay and perfect it.</p><p>"The idea that you could have a core game loop that was a huge variety of actions just did not exist," Cain added, noting that a game like Gauntlet had to nail its narrow focus on dungeon-clearing because that was the entire experience.</p><p>Cain warns that today's games risk "becoming indulgent" by adding features that "dilute the game" rather than improve it. To illustrate, he compares 1980s game design to a high-end restaurant where a chef prepares a superb dish from a few exceptional ingredients, while modern blockbuster games resemble buffets that prioritize variety over quality. His advice for developers--especially those in small indie teams--is straightforward: simplify.</p><p>"You need to be simple. You need to stay focused, and whatever you do has to be extremely well executed. And then you'll be like that fancy restaurant ... that meal was delicious."</p><p>People in the comments, though, were mixed on this observation. Games like Fallout 4 were brought up, and how that has crafting, companion quests, community building, and is a fan-favorite out of the series. Conversely, one commenter in their early 20s went back to play the original Diablo and found it kept them engaged, with practically none of the "modern tactics" that they were used to.</p>

I know some of you have experienced errors and lag while voting, and I want to apologize," he said.</p><p>Keighley went on to say that his teams have been "working around the clock" to help "improve the experience" for people looking to cast their vote online. Voting is open until December 10, so no one needs to rush to vote, Keighley reminded people.</p><p>"I'll keep you updated as we continue to improve performance. Thank you--from all of us--for your passion, patience, and support for TGA," he said.</p><p>Fan-voting makes up 10% of the vote for each category at The Game Awards, with the other 90% coming down to The Game Awards jury.

            <p>
It's been so long since dino-survival sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a> was unveiled, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-revealed-with-preposterous-van-diesel-starring-trailer">preposterous Vin Diesel-starring CGI trailer</a> almost feels like a dream. But developer Studio Wildcard remains adamant it's still happening, and it's paving the way for its arrival with a brand-new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a> expansion, Ark: Lost Colony, launching on 16th December.
</p>
<p>
Officially, Lost Colony serves as a link between Ark's 2018 expansion Extinction and its 2019 follow-up Genesis, while also laying the groundwork for Ark 2. But it doesn't stop there. Lost Colony <em>also</em> ties into Ark's (still only 50 percent aired) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-the-animated-series-surprise-releases-in-us-and-canada-ahead-of-april-debut-elsewhere">animated TV series</a>, bringing some of the show's star-studded cast over to the game. As such, you can expect to hear the likes of Oscar winner Michelle Yeo, David Tenant, Battlestar Galactic's Katie Sackhoff, and more - all appearing in "cinematic anime sequences" by Japanese studio MAPPA - when Lost Colony comes to Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC in December.

<p>
Lost Colony is described as Survival Ascended's "first canonical expansion", and deposits player in the snowy wastes of Arat Prime - birthplace of the ARKs - where they'll follow Mei Yin's footsteps through an "intense journey into the heart of darkness". There's talk of "lost" character ability trees to unlock, "cursed" gear tiers and new building systems to craft, plus new creatures to tame - including the Ossidon, a "hulking, engineered apex winter-predator".
</p><p>
Players eager to check out the Ossidon ahead of Lost Colony's December arrival can do so right now, but only by purchasing Ark: Survival Ascended's £29.99/$29.99 USD Lost Colony Expansion Pass. Cough up and the Ossidon can be experienced as "preview gameplay content" on existing maps, as it temporarily roams the cold biomes of Ragnarok, Valguero, and The Center.
</p>
<p>
Lost Colony arrives some six months after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-developer-acknowledges-missing-in-action-sequel">originally announced June launch window</a>, but there's still no indication of when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-delayed-survival-evolved-official-servers-to-shut-down-later-this-year">repeatedly delayed Ark 2</a> might show up. It was originally announced in 2020 (with that silly Vin Diesel trailer) but didn't feature in the Ark content roadmap released earlier this year, leaving many to speculate it won't arrive until sometime after December 2026. Studio Wildcard is, of course, no stranger to delays; even the second half of the Ark animated television show - originally promised for 2024 - couldn't escape the curse, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-missing-in-action-second-half-of-the-ark-animated-tv-series-has-reappeared-oh-with-a-formal-delay">now due sometime next year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-delays-first-half-2025-26-fiscal-results-release-major-announcement-could-be-coming/">Last week, on November 13, approximately fifteen minutes before</a> they were meant to be published, Ubisoft announced it would be delaying the release of its financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year. It also announced that it would stop trading ahead of the market's opening the next day, which was a step reportedly taken "<em></em><em>to limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay</em>." Now, it has been confirmed <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2ek0UOt9DZO072eswdJsmx/8585762d888e7a5f75001725aba1ab2b/PR_19_11_2025_EN.pdf">that those delayed results will be public by the market's opening on Friday, November 21, 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, nothing can stop people from speculating, necessarily or otherwise, and the big speculation surrounding the delay is the idea that Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">is going the way of EA and becoming a privately owned company</a>. Not owned by the same Consortium that is in the process of owning EA Sports FC, but by Chinese publisher and developer Tencent, with which Ubisoft recently opened a new subsidiary called Vantage Studios.</p>



<p>The same Vantage Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">that now houses the rights to Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six</a>, the three franchises Ubisoft considers to be its most significant across its portfolio. It's worth noting that there's been no official word that Ubisoft is actively looking to be acquired. </p>



<p>We've seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">reports of the company's shareholders allegedly talking about a buyout</a>, but Ubisoft's only word on the question has been, "<em></em><em>We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options.</em>"</p>



<p>It's also worth noting that the delay could have been for something as small as a copy error in the results that needed fixing, instead of the latest major shift in the layout of the video game industry. Though if it happens, it'll continue the streak of extremely high-scale consolidation we've seen in recent years.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-40%E2%80%B3-full-hd-smart-tv-2025-looks-more-like-a-clearance-giveaway-than-a-real-sale.1358236/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Entertainment upgrades don’t have to be expensive, especially with early Black Friday deals dropping in fast.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you’re after a modest-sized screen that still delivers on both visuals and sound, here’s some good news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5695/">The 2025 model of Samsung’s 40-inch Full HD F6000 Smart TV is currently available on Amazon for just $148, thanks to a 25% discount</a>. It normally retails for close $200, so this deal is taking a good chunk off the price, making the upgrade much more affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5695/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>You don’t have to worry about entering any weirdly long coupon codes or following some complicated checkout steps to score the discount. Just add the item to your cart, and the offer applies automatically. It’s also important to note that the retailer has listed it as a limited-time discount, which means it won’t be around for long. If you’ve been looking to treat yourself to a new screen, now is the time to make the move.</p>

<h2>Brilliant, Sharp Visuals for All Your Content</h2>
<p>This screen is not exactly big, which makes it ideal for smaller living rooms and even bedrooms. The sleek profile and slim bezels give it a minimal look while also keeping distractions at bay.</p>
<p>It pushes 1080p Full HD resolution for brighter, sharper visuals. Of course, it won’t rival a 4K screen, but it’s still fairly decent for everyday streaming. There’s High Dynamic Range (HDR) that actively expands the contrast between the lightest and darkest parts of a scene for better color accuracy, plus mega contrast, which automatically adjusts brightness and depth in real time. Watching a nature documentary or streaming your new favorite crime thriller, you’re going to enjoy an immersive viewing experience that pulls you in.</p>



<p>The Object Tracking Sound Lite feature helps the TV simulate directional audio to make it feel more dynamic. It’s pretty solid on its own, but you can always add a compatible Samsung soundbar to improve it even further.</p>
<p>The TV is also powered by Samsung’s One UI Tizen platform, which brings all your major streaming apps into one place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5695/">You’re going to have instant access to over 2,700 free channels, including 400+ from Samsung TV Plus.</a> New content is also frequently added, so there’s always going to be something new to watch. Best of all, it also lets you cast your phone to the big screen to scroll, watch shows, and even take video calls.</p>
