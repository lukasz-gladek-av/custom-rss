		<p>Big Bad Wolf and Nacon have announced Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, an investigation adventure that’s inspired, as with everything cosmic tentacle horror, by the Lovecraft universe. The game is coming out in 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss | Reveal Trailer (UK | PEGI)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fwtLXbt5n04?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This first person psychological thriller will cast players as Noah, an agent of Interpol’s secret occult investigation department, Ancile. The case he’s got to investigate is all about the miners who have been disappearing in the deepest depths of the Pacific ocean, an investigation that will take him down to the ancient sunken city of R’lyeh where Cthulhu has been imprisoned.</p>
<p>You won’t have to go alone, though, with an AI companion called Key embedded in his eyes, presumably able to help with solving puzzles, but you will have to make choices that shape the story’s direction, trying to resist the power of Cthulhu along the way. That, going by the trailer, seems like a pretty tricky task, as it shows Noah struggling with visions, haunted by past events that saw him lose three digits from his right hand, and getting sucked under the surface to come up against big ol’ tentacle face.</p>
<p>The game is coming from the makers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/03/13/the-council-episode-one-the-mad-ones-review/">The Council</a> and Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong, narrative games that had a similar investigative angle, though The Cosmic Abyss will be shifting to that first person view.</p>

<p>For our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/18/vampire-the-masquerade-swansong-review/">Vampire: The Masquerade – Swansong review</a>, Steve said, “Swansong is a good investigative adventure dressed up in vampire finery, but doesn’t quite live up to my expectations due to some overly restrictive design and a disconnect between the third person perspective and the largely text and table top mechanics. Once some of the bugs are patched and there are resources available to support the build choices you make, there is a solid adventure to be found here. It’s not the new Bloodlines, but it’s an authentic Vampire: The Masquerade experience nonetheless.”</p>

They’re a local forest tribe of stubby-looking cats, but not to be confused with the series’ long-running feline Palico pals. Wudwuds have a bit more of Disney’s Stitch in them. They don’t know English well and speak in very broken sentences. Except for Rove, who instead carries himself like <em>Sailor Moon</em>’s Tuxedo Mask trying out for the Royal Shakespeare Company.

There are not many iconic lines in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. Rove has most of them.

You can bump into him out in the field and there are several side quests he’s involved in, including one particularly major story mission in the late game after hitting high rank. And every time you run into him he’s spouting stuff like, “Forget me. Go. If fate wills it, we shall meet again.” Same Rove, same.</p><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>might not ultimately be most people’s 2025 GOTY, but Rove is without a doubt my current front-runner for 2025 video game character of the year. I wouldn’t take a bullet for him but I would take him to Hot Topic and we’d have a blast picking out dumb T-shirts together. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to Yoc9Official,  the man seen in the video wearing a  black hoodie, baseball hat and white pants, was waiting in his car for the restock and tried to push past Yoc9Official to access the Pokémon vending machine. The two men pushed and shoved each other, as seen in the viral video below. </p><p>The video was recorded by someone else and shared by Yoc9Official, according to a comment posted the creator on TikTok. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@yoc9official/video/7478570100677889326&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yoc9official/video/7478570100677889326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a follow up video</a></span>, you can hear the man yelling at what appears to be a store employee, who explains they reviewed footage before being cut off by the aggressive man in white pants. Yoc9Official claims that eventually police showed up and arrested the other man. </p><p> “He claimed being in his car was in line,” said Yoc9Offical in a comment on TikTok. “Cops came [and] got him and he fell out pretending to be hurt.

We’ve reached out to Yoc9Official for more information about the incident and what happened. </p><p>After the clip went viral, people online reacted with confusion and disgust over grown men fighting over cards designed primarily for children. The two men are also believed to be Pokémon card flippers, leading to even more venom and anger directed at them. </p><p>“I’m sorry but I was part of the generation that had my Pokémon binder out trading with my friends on the front porch,” posted one user on Twitter. “It’s an absolute shame that this hobby has gotten so out of control.

                <p>Amazon has revealed all of the free PC games that'll be coming to Prime Gaming in March, and there's a pretty solid lineup of classic open-world, fantasy, and puzzle games to grab. In total, there'll be 20 games offered this month, with four games available right now. As a reminder, all of the free games that you claim through Prime Gaming are yours to keep forever, even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> for as little as one month to take advantage of the subscription and the freebies offered through it.</p><p>The month kicks off with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/saints-row-the-third/" data-ref-id="5000-40483">Saints Row: The Third Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mafia-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-32858">Mafia 2: Definitive Edition</a>. Considered to be the best in the Saints Row series, the threequel is a goofy sandbox of crime and dubstep-powered weapons, and this remastered edition features enhanced graphics and all of the post-launch DLC. Mafia 2: Definitive Edition is a story-driven open-world game set in the 1940s, as war hero Vito Scaletta becomes entangled with the mob.</p><p>You can also redeem <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crime-boss-rockay-city/" data-ref-id="5000-577630">Crime Boss: Rockay City</a> if you feel like gawking at bad gameplay and want to see Chuck Norris as the bad guy, and there's also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/naheulbeuks-dungeon-master/" data-ref-id="5000-590955">Naheulbeuk's Dungeon Master</a> to round out the first batch of games. March 13 will give you five more games to choose from, with the highlight here being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/endling-extinction-is-forever/" data-ref-id="5000-484683">Endling: Extinction is Forever</a>. It's not a game for the faint-hearted, as Endling lets you take control of the last mother fox on Earth. Driven to protect all of her cubs in a merciless world that is on the brink of destruction, Endling is a stressful and emotional survival-adventure game.</p><p>Moving ahead to March 20, the Prime Gaming library will expand with five more games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mortal-shell/" data-ref-id="5000-510197">Mortal Shell</a> is a flawed but interesting souls-like, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wolfenstein-the-old-blood/" data-ref-id="5000-403573">Wolfenstein: the Old Blood</a> is a spooky spin-off from the first Wolfenstein adventure developed by MachineGames, and you can jump into 2003's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/legacy-of-kain-defiance/" data-ref-id="5000-18258">Legacy of Kain: Defiance</a> to check out the final game in the classic series.</p><p>Finally, March 27 will see six more games arrive to cap the month off with games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deus-ex-invisible-war/" data-ref-id="5000-3789">Deus Ex: Invisible War</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-forgotten-city/" data-ref-id="5000-483405">The Forgotten City</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/session-skate-sim/" data-ref-id="5000-483355">Session: Skate Sim</a>.</p><h2>Prime Gaming free games for March 2025</h2><h3>Available now</h3><ul><li>Saints Row: The Third Remastered (GOG Code)</li><li>Mafia 2: Definitive Edition (GOG Code)</li><li>Crime Boss: Rockay City (Epic Games Store)</li><li>Naheulbeuk's Dungeon Master (Amazon Games App)</li></ul><h3>March 13</h3><ul><li>Wall World (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Syberia: The World Before (GOG Code)</li><li>Endling: Extinction is Forever (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Dark Deity: Complete Edition (GOG Code)</li><li>Beholder 3 (Amazon Games App)</li></ul><h3>March 20</h3><ul><li>Wolfenstein: The Old Blood (Xbox and PC via Microsoft Store Code)</li><li>Mutazione (GOG Code)</li><li>Figment 2: Creed Valley (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Legacy of Kain: Defiance (GOG Code)</li><li>Mortal Shell (Epic Games Store)</li></ul><h3>March 27</h3><ul><li>The Forgotten City (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Deus Ex: Invisible War (GOG Code)</li><li>Session: Skate Sim (Epic Games Store)</li><li>Let's Build A Zoo (Epic Games Store)</li><li>Gamedec - Definitive Edition (GOG Code)</li><li>The Wisbey Mystery (Legacy Games Code)</li></ul><p>Prime subscribers will also be able to the following games in January via the Prime Gaming Luna channel:</p><ul><li>WRC Generations: Fully Loaded Edition</li><li>Overcooked 2</li><li>Spitlings</li><li>The Jackbox Party Pack 3</li><li>Strange Horticulture</li><li>Fortnite</li><li>Fortnite Ballistic</li><li>Lego Fortnite Brick Life</li><li>Fortnite Battle Royale</li><li>Fortnite Festival</li><li>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</li><li>Rocket Racing</li><li>Fortnite</li><li>Trackmania</li><li>Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition</li><li>Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</li></ul>

My work has been around, including one of my more popular games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Everything is going to be OK</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, making it into the permanent collection of MoMA in New York.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last year I started lecturing for various events. One of the going themes in my public speaking has been the way social media privatized the internet, and how that has affected our own creative freedom on computers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a long-standing concern for me because computers started out as such egalitarian things where (simply put) anyone could make a thing and share it, steadily shifting to today's tech-vision where we have all these walled gardens and private platforms that are actually fairly restrictive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The social media layer built over the internet, and the type of internet that we use the most now, has caused positive social change, sure, but I fear that the positive is widely being overshadowed by the empowerment of far-right radicalization and fascism. There's a lot of uncertainty about the future of tech (and the place any individual human has in it) under the shadow of AI and monopolies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My hope of turning some of these talking points into an interactive essay was that maybe it would reach a different crowd that usually doesn't care about reading long articles. It did, too! The conversations it started were interesting to follow.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we challenge these things as artists, we encourage people to believe in a better vision of the future. Art is the greatest conduit to inspire social change. I believe the same to be true for games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we have these movements to "keep politics out of games" or attack marginalized voices to keep them out of games, or whatever... then you have to acknowledge the other side of the coin that there's something about games that can affect social change. Games are a type of art that is deeply meaningful in the digital landscape. I think, even if there is negative friction, that's where artists need to be.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I started as a net-artist in the late 90's and eventually ended up in games because "game" became an umbrella term to encompass pretty much all interactive art on a computer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>individualism in the dead-internet age: an anti-big tech asset flip shovelware r̶a̶n̶t̶ manifesto</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interactive essays—using games for the sake of critical theory or documentarian purposes—have been a thing for a long time. There have been these beautiful experiences like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bagenzo.itch.io/madotsukis-closet">madotsuki's closet</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a digital art piece about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yume Nikki</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or experiences like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://essaygames.itch.io/the-last-survey">The Last Survey</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that are more of a narrative essay. The intersection between essays and games based on personal experiences is strong.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What fascinates me is how existing in a game can grow to encompass more than just fiction. You can use it to illustrate these impactful topics in a way that is deeply meaningful to players. The end result is much more personal to the person playing it than if they were to just read an article about what you have to say.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A while ago, someone pointed out the quote "Writing about music is like dancing about architecture" when I was talking about how making a game is an impactful way to talk about games, and I love that comparison. There's so much room for the medium to grow here. I think games criticism, critical theory, and essays being "playable" is an obvious thing to explore. It's certainly much more impactful to people when they are "in" the thing you are talking about.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I used Unreal. The itch page jokingly boasts the features of: "Pedantic views on tech feudalism with nice shader work, and good reflection captures. Overly critical views on capitalism with lumen and nanite enabled."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I wanted to use something that's usually associated with high fidelity AAA type of games, using all the latest offerings of the engine, because it's kind of punk to appropriate that type of AAA aesthetic for something completely counter to what that aesthetic represents. The mainstream has always appropriated queer, punk, and subculture aesthetics. It seemed like an interesting statement to do the opposite as a way to package criticism of capitalism.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges and/or exciting possibilities came out of the idea of presenting your thoughts on this subject as a playable experience? What felt compelling about creating an essay players could inhabit and explore instead of one out of just words?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think you can reach more people if you package what you are saying in an intriguing way. Digital art is a huge possibility space. The internet is kind of divided into these groups of text, audio, or video, but computers can take that so much further. Games are the intersection of all these things, and there's space for exploring how essays could look in context of a game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think it's interesting to point out that streamers and Youtubers have, in many ways, grown more popular than online text-based outlets. Youtubers often repackage these messages into their own videos, and people will rarely actually look into the writing being sourced. Video is just more intriguing of a delivery platform. That's a generalization, but I think it captures how people consume content online.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following that tangent, I wondered if a video game would be just as impactful. Would people be receptive to "playing" an essay about this? If it looked intriguing and high quality enough, would it draw people in?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Individualism in the dead internet age</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is built to be something you meander through while letting the environment illustrate the words. Links to different articles offer tangents, or rabbit holes, that you can fall into, all illustrating the points of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We need more playable essays. It's a wonderful format!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into structuring the experience? Into creating the museum-like environment that guides the player through history and your thoughts while also allowing them the freedom to ignore the path and follow what they desire?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've been steadily saving "free for the month" asset bundles from the Epic game store, where developers give away these expensive beautiful assets for free.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm usually, and just on a personal artistic level, against using assets from others for my own work. There's a stigma to it that I'm paranoid about. I feel like that superstitious fear of what gamers will think is something that holds me back. I decided I wanted to just go completely into that direction of what's considered "taboo" to deliver a commentary on tech culture. It turned out interesting because there's this level of self-awareness and self-parody that kind of comes through.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Things are paced out so that you are tasked with "collecting" parts of the essay, like it’s a museum tour, while stopping in front of these assets to look at them, or look at the links in the display windows.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Understanding that players will be players and some will just run through the whole thing, I kept in mind to build it so it can be silly and weird to do that too. You can actually escape the "museum" and walk off into the void if you wanted to. It ends up being a very strange relic of a world to explore.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you shape the loud, colorful, chaotic varied, vibrant spaces the player would explore as they played the game? How did you choose the many, many varied visual elements in this game? Are there elements of the creative Wild West that was the early internet present in how you shaped this game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Individualism in the dead internet age</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is built to be kind of like a museum so you have these throwbacks to old internet art and old desktop elements that all illustrate how vibrant our online culture used to be. Some of it is worked into the world to be almost unsettling... Like being stalked by the giant smiley face as you suddenly find yourself exploring the old Windows 3D Maze screensaver while listening to rants about AI and social media.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The results ended up feeling kind of haunted. I think it's because these familiar old elements are used so out-of-context—like you're exploring a lost past.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What unique thoughts and challenges came from creating this work? From doing so using third party assets?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was really hard pacing the audio out in a way that players would get it all, within the order they're supposed to get it, while letting the player also feel free to go where they want.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've never used third party assets before to this extent. It was beautiful to be introduced to this generous space of asset creators that put out so much of their work that kind of ends up being melted into other people's games. Even if you work alone, game development is collaborative in nature.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I really wanted to highlight that work without it getting lost in the background.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The exaggerated use of third party assets plays a big part in giving the text a voice. Building this definitely made me more appreciative of asset creators, or these movements in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://itch.io/c/2861178/plundercore-not-by-me-mostly">Plundercore</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where games are made up of recognizable stolen pieces that are re-contextualized to become something else. Other media has so much of this, like sampling culture in music, or collaging for zine making.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was an intentional decision to use other people's assets—these assets then being re-contextualized into something that is criticizing the current tech culture of AI... when one of the major criticisms of AI is that learning models are populated by "stolen work." It challenges my own discomfort surrounding ownership, fairness, and copyright. How am I different as an artist using these assets? Am I being a hypocrite, or am I being "subversive"?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You also put a great deal of thought into the presentation, playfulness, and language of the game's itch.io store page (although you always put this kind of creativity into your store pages). What particular elements felt important to implement into the game's store page, and what drew you to draw from language about shovelware and visual fidelity/effects for your description of the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The title is the best explanation. It's a chaotic bundle of everything that popular culture has tried to reject about games. It's an asset flip, which is a strong insult. It's shovelware, which players complain about. The word rant is crossed out because, for the sake of self-importance, it's a manifesto!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the self-awareness on the outset is a good commentary on itself. The fact that it so heavily criticizes capitalism, while being built in Unreal Engine, bragging about using all the latest bells and whistles, is also a wonderful self-criticism. It criticizes AI while also using re-contextualized work. The comment wheel is spinning, so is this even a serious work? It's weirdly between being really super critical while also mocking itself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The current culture of technofeudalism, technocapitalism, mixed with a good dose of dead-internet... all these keywords... Present day is so darkly dystopian it comes around to being almost funny, in a morbid way. I kind of hope people get the subtle ridiculousness of it all.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/adaptive-frame-generation-is-lossless-scaling%E2%80%99s-latest-feature.1127175/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/adaptive-frame-generation-is-lossless-scalings-latest-feature/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The software Lossless Scaling was updated this week to support a new feature called Adaptive Frame Generation. As you may recall, Lossless Scaling <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-adds-universal-frame-generation-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made the news in early 2024</a> when it introduced a universal frame generation feature that worked practically on all GPU and PC games. The developer continued to improve the feature by adding more generated frames with <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-2-1-can-now-triple-your-frame-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X3</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-2-3-adds-x4-fg-mode-initial-nvidia-g-sync-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X4 modes</a>, not to mention last month's 3.0 beta update that improved latency and reduced artifacts.</p>
<p>Now, with beta version 3.1, Adaptive Frame Generation can be selected to dynamically adjust fractional multipliers to maintain a set frame rate picked by the user, regardless of the base game frame rate. According to the developer of Lossless Scaling, this provides a smoother frame rate than fixed multiplier mode. It is particularly beneficial for games that are hard or soft capped at framerates that aren't aligned as integer multiples of the screen refresh rate (e.g., 60 → 144, 165 Hz) or for uncapped games.</p>
<p>There is a downside, however. Adaptive Frame Generation will generate most of the displayed frames, increasing GPU load and potentially slightly decreasing image quality compared to fixed multiplier frame generation. Latency is also very slightly increased, as seen in the comparison below.</p>

<p>To support Adaptive Frame Generation, the capture engine of Lossless Scaling had to be tweaked significantly. The GDI capture mode is no longer supported, and WGC capture is no longer available before Windows 11 24H2 and will default to DXGI on earlier versions if selected.</p>
<p>There is a 'New Queue Target' option that users will find, with the following recommendations provided by the developer:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 - Unbuffered capture, which always uses the last frame captured for the lowest latency. However, performance may suffer under high GPU load or with an uncapped base game frame rate.</li>
<li>1 - (default) Buffered capture with a target frame queue of 1. Maintains low latency while better handling variations in capture performance.</li>
<li>2 - Buffered capture with a target frame queue of 2. Best suited for scenarios with an uncapped or unstable base frame rate and high GPU load, but may introduce higher latency. It is also the recommended setting for frame generation multipliers below 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, Lossless Scaling will disable frame generation when the base frame rate drops below 10 FPS. This prevents excessive artifacts during loading screens and reduces unnecessary GPU load when using AFG.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lossless Scaling - Adaptive Frame Generation Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dB8sxLr4n3k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>According to the first user impressions, Adaptive Frame Generation offers better frame pacing compared to the fixed multiplier option. It'll never be quite as good as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-support-75-games-apps-rtx-50-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 4</a> or the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD FSR 4</a>, but it's still impressive what the developer of Lossless Scaling has been capable of achieving without relying on any specific hardware technology.</p>

<p>Sony and PlayStation have unveiled a new leasing program for users in Japan and the United Kingdom. The new program, called Flex, allows users to rent a PlayStation 5 or one of several other PlayStation products, for 12, 24, or 36 months at a time.</p>



<h2 id="h-players-can-rent-or-lease-the-ps5-in-japan-or-the-uk">Players Can Rent or Lease the PS5 in Japan or the UK</h2>



<p>In the UK, users can <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/leasing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lease one of several PS5 models</a>, the PlayStation Portal, PS VR2, or even a DualSense Edge Wireless Controller through Raylo, a tech leasing company. As with any other lease, you can lock in a lower monthly rate the longer your lease term is. 36 month leases offer the lowest monthly cost, and there’s a monthly rolling lease that can be canceled at any time that’s much more expensive. For example, the PS5 Pro costs £35.59/month under a rolling monthly lease, but a 36 month lease lets player pay just  £18.95/month. Currently, a PS5 Pro is retailed at £699.99 in the United Kingdom.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is not a rent-to-own plan, but the Flex FAQ section does note that players “may have the option to purchase the device at the end of [a] lease, subject to Raylo’s discretion and pricing at that time.” While the service leases controllers as well, each PS5 comes with at least one controller included, as well a “fair” wear-and-tear policy that covers minor scratches or dents.</p>



<p>In Japan, video game retailer GEO launched its own PS5 rental service at the end of February. Players in Japan have the option of renting a PS5 for an eight-day or 15-day window for just a few dollars. However, according to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japans-new-ps5-rental-is-massively-popular-with-service-fully-booked-across-all-regions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automaton</a>, the service is already completely booked until mid-April.</p>



<p>Would you consider leasing a PS5 instead of buying one? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

The team has also published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN0mNkrXHJc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer deep dive</a> with a more detailed look at what the team is planning for combat, exploration, and optional investigation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside these trailers, Frogwares has launched a Kickstarter today to help get the game over the finish line. In a statement, CEO Wael Amr explained that the Kickstarter funding was necessary due to the ongoing war in Ukraine:</p><blockquote>After 3 years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we've learned to adapt, though it has never been easy. In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we’ve decided to take the same route as before.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Frogwares has faced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sinking-city-2-revealed-after-messy-legal-battle-finally-comes-to-an-end-xbox-partner-preview-2024">numerous challenges</a> over the years in its work on both the original The Sinking City, and now its sequel. In addition to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ukrainian-game-developers-persevere">immense challenges of developing games during wartime</a>, Frogwares was locked in a publishing rights struggle over the first The Sinking City with original PC publisher Nacon that resulted in the game being <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sinking-city-disappeared-frogwares-nacon-bigben-royalties">pulled from some platforms back in 2020</a>. Fortunately, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sinking-city-developer-frogwares-now-sole-publisher-after-long-legal-battle">Frogwares won full publishing rights last year</a>, and announced it had settled its disputes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1741278322505880&amp;usg=AOvVaw2jsHgYaXpv_7u6Q5W5NCnZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kickstarter for The Sinking City 2 is live now</a>, with a target of $105,000 USD.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

These are anomalies that occur in the world as a result of Mio and Zoe entering the same simulation. Razer tries to steal unfinished stories and ideas from the girls, and as such, there are some very weird occurrences going on.</p><p>Finding and experiencing side stories is a vital part of your Split Fiction experience, and you'll even get an achievement if you manage to find them all. They're split up by level, so we've detailed where they are and what happens during them. Almost all of them are easy to find, so we won't focus too much on location beyond which level they're in.

You'll need to think about timing and plan your routes, and at one point, you'll even find yourself on the back of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-how-to-escape-the-sandfish/1100-6529814/" data-ref-id="1100-6529814">sandfish</a>.</p><h3 id="Farmlife">Farmlife</h3><p>One of the funniest side stories in the game, Farmlife sees Mio and Zoe transform into pigs. Cute, right? Wrong! Eventually, Mio and Zoe will become sausages. No happy ending for pigs in this story.</p><h3 id="Mountain_Hike">Mountain Hike</h3><p>This is one of the trickier side stories to locate. When you find an area that you'll need to interact with some portable toilets, pause. Mio will need to enter the toilet, and Zoe needs to use her grab skill to pick it up and throw it at the ladder hanging from the roof to the left. This will drop the ladder down, revealing the path to the side story. It can also be easy to miss as it doesn't have the audio cue that other side stories have. When you do find it, it's totally worth it. Mio and Zoe will spend some time traversing a mountain, trying to dodge the footsteps and wrath of giants.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454766-split-fiction-side-stories%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454766" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454766-split-fiction-side-stories%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454766"></a><figcaption>Exploding Star side story</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454766-split-fiction-side-stories%284%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Hopes_of_Spring">Hopes of Spring</h2><h3 id="Train_Heist">Train Heist</h3><p>Train Heist is less of a heist and more of a chase, with Mio and Zoe returning to some side-scrolling action, fighting The Conductor, a large orb-like boss who isn't super happy about them being there.</p><h3 id="Gameshow">Gameshow</h3><p>This was one of the tricker side stories we experienced, as you're at the mercy of a deranged robot gameshow host who insists on creating entertainment out of forcing Mio and Zoe to handle ticking bombs. Each bomb can only remain in your hands for a few seconds before you need to pass it to your partner. The arena gets more complex each time, with fire, electricity, and disappearing platforms adding additional danger.</p><h3 id="Collapsing_Star">Collapsing Star</h3><p>During this side story, Mio and Zoe find themselves staring into the sun, quite literally. The sun is dying, and as it does it sends lethal waves of light through the world. You'll need to find areas to hide behind. A huge tip for the end of the story is Mio and Zoe should use one shield to cover them both, and alternate between whose shield to use. If you try to complete this side story just using your own shield to protect yourself, you'll never escape the collapse of the sun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454764-split-fiction-side-stories%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454764" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454764-split-fiction-side-stories%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454764"></a><figcaption>Kites Side Story</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454764-split-fiction-side-stories%283%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Final_Dawn">Final Dawn</h2><h3 id="Kites">Kites</h3><p>This side story is a race between Mio and Zoe as they traverse the skies via tunnels, kites, and wind sockets. Who will win? It can be tricky to aim for the circles that give you a boost through the air, and if you miss one you'll fall to your death. Our tip is to not move the camera angle as it quickly becomes disorienting.</p><h3 id="Moon_Market">Moon Market</h3><p>It's time to rescue some cats! Mio and Zoe have a total of four cats to rescue in order to open some gates that reveal the path forward. When you get the Moon Market itself, make sure to interact with the many elements around the town square, especially the potions.</p><h3 id="Notebook">Notebook</h3><p>This beautiful sketched art level sees Mio and Zoe on a quest to rescue a prince. It's easily located within the Factory level, as Zoe will point it out with an audio cue. As you traverse the level, Zoe will rewrite the story, and areas of the level will appear, disappear, and be modified.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454757-split-fiction-side-stories%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454757" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454757-split-fiction-side-stories%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454757"></a><figcaption>Birthday Cake</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454757-split-fiction-side-stories%282%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Rise_of_the_Dragon_Realm">Rise of the Dragon Realm</h2><h3 id="Slopes_of_War">Slopes of War</h3><p>This is one of the most fun side stories in Split Fiction. Remember the SSX games? This is Split Fiction's version of those. Mio and Zoe take to futuristic snowboards, with the goal of racking up the best score possible.</p><h3 id="Space_Escape">Space Escape</h3><p>Mio and Zoe face the challenge of running out of oxygen in space. The grappling hook mechanic from earlier in the game returns with a twist as the two wrestle with zero gravity. There isn't a time limit, despite the fact Mio encourages Zoe to work as quickly as she can, but if you take too long the gravity meter will deplete so it's best to hurry along anyway. Make sure you work with your co-op partner to find oxygen tanks before it's too late.</p><h3 id="Birthday_Cake">Birthday Cake</h3><p>One of Mio's rare 'fun' side stories, she wrote this when she was younger. You'll control teeth that need to find their way through the level via bright cartoon platforming sections. Eventually, after lighting the candles on the birthday cake, you'll end up in a dentist's office trying to survive.</p><p>Now that you've ticked off all of the side stories, why not check out how to hatch the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-how-to-hatch-the-underlands-bird-egg/1100-6529869/" data-ref-id="1100-6529869">Underlands bird egg</a>, or how to get through the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-how-to-get-past-underlands-piranhas/1100-6529867/" data-ref-id="1100-6529867">piranha-infested waters</a>, in case you're having trouble.</p>

                <p>The music world lost a legend this week, when Roy Ayers passed away at the age of 84. The jazz-funk pioneer was also the voice of Fusion FM, the in-game radio station in GTA IV.</p><p>Rockstar Games paid tribute to the late "Everybody Loves the Sunshine" musician in a social media post, saying, "Rest In Peace to the pioneer of Jazz Funk and host of Fusion FM, the legend Roy Ayers."</p><p>Ayers hosted <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Fusion_FM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fusion FM</a>, one of many in-game radio stations for GTA IV, and he was known for his passionate and exuberant presentation style, and quotes like, "Try to be happy all the time." Some of the songs featured on Fusion FM included Ayers' own "Funk In The Hole," along with tunes like "The Edge" by David McCallum and "Holy Thursday" by David Axelrod.</p><p>You can listen to more of the songs from Fusion FM through the Spotify playlist below.</p><p>Ayers' family <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RoyAyers/posts/pfbid0c4uWZoookuetVWmeuKdhskTEEcBCEYyzfYfsRqmT27iH1tbnASY48GWD83pNZ1bdl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a statement</a> this week confirming he passed away on March 4 in New York City after a long illness. "He lived a beautiful 84 years and will be sorely missed. His family ask that you respect their privacy at this time, a celebration of Roy's life will be forthcoming," the family said.</p><p>"Everybody Loves the Sunshine" is Ayers' most enduringly popular song, and it was sampled more than 100 times by artists like Dr. Dre with his song "My Life" and "The Dream" by Outkast.</p><p>Music is expected to play a major role in the forthcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>. It was recently reported that DJ Khaled will have his own in-game radio station in GTA 6. The report went on to say there is potential for other real-life artists to appear in the game as well with their own radio stations. GTA 6 launches this fall for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. </p>

            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' release finally almost upon us <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">after multiple delays</a>, Ubisoft is rattling through its remaining announcements - with its latest update detailing the various enhancements <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> owners can take advantage of come launch on 20th March.
</p>
<p>
As per a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/assassins-creed-shadows-20-minutes-of-new-castle-gameplay-launches-march-20/">post on the PlayStation Blog</a> (hence the absence of details relating to the Xbox version), Assassin's Creed Shadows features a choice of three different graphics modes - Performance, Fidelity, and Balanced - and can played at up to 2160p and 60 FPS on both PS5 and PS5 Pro when Performance mode is selected.
</p>
<p>
In all cases, ray tracing is supported, but your machine and selected mode will determine exactly what kind of raytracing you can expect. PlayStation 5's Performance mode, for instance, features "selective" ray tracing, which Ubisoft defines as computing "global illumination for diffuse lighting in the Hideout portion of the game".

<p>
Standard raytracing, meanwhile - applied in Fidelity or Balanced modes on PS5 and Performance mode on PS5 Pro - is "used to compute global illumination for diffuse lighting throughout the game world". And that just leaves PS5 Pro's "extended" ray tracing, which computes "global illumination for diffuse lighting and reflective surfaces throughout the game world" when applied in either Fidelity or Balanced modes.
</p>
<p>
The full breakdown of supported resolutions, frame rates, and ray tracing options per console and mode is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>PS5 – Performance Mode</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 60 FPS, Selective Ray Tracing</li>
<li>PS5 – Fidelity Mode</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 30 FPS, Standard Ray Tracing</li>
<li>PS5 – Balanced Mode (requires 120/240hz display and HDMI 2.1)</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 40 FPS, Standard Ray Tracing</li>
<li>PS5 Pro – Performance Mode</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 60 FPS, Standard Ray Tracing</li>
<li>PS5 Pro – Fidelity Mode</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 30 FPS, Extended Ray Tracing</li>
<li>PS5 Pro – Balanced Mode (requires 120/240hz display and HDMI 2.1)</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 40 FPS, Extended Ray Tracing</li>
</ul>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">left a positive impression on Eurogamer's Katharine Castle</a> earlier this year - launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 20th March. But if you're looking for a more granular release breakdown, Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-global-launch-times-detailed-pre-load-live-now-on-xbox">detailed its global launch times</a> too.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> is getting a major patch on 13th March, developers Warhorse have announced. It will enhance the bracingly mucky <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with modding tools and a "trove of updates", including what the devs ambiguously refer to as Barber Mode. Going by <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1897316277355757987">the promotional image</a> they've knocked together, this is just a selection of beards and haircuts for protagonist Henry. But it is not yet 13th March, so let us dare to dream. Let us imagine that the update will let Henry <em>become</em> a barber, cutting a swathe through the innumerable fringes of 15th century Bohemia.</p>
<p>I had not realised till writing this post how much I want to play a game in which you play a travelling barber, perhaps departing each day from my salon to groom the magnates of the realm. A game in which I, Quiff Sideburn, Texturizer At Law, must carefully organise different sizes of scissors in my roll-out velvet barbering kit. A game in which my choice of do has a bearing upon international politics. In which I mull my own beard oil from juniper berries and slaughtered moles. In which I can recruit three side characters and form a barbershop quartet, then butcher them all because Quiff Sideburn is secretly Sweeney Todd.</p>
<p>A quick glance at Steam reveals that there is, very tentatively, such a thing as the "barber sim genre". There's the forthcoming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2682260/Barber_Party/">Barber Party</a> from Second Wind, for example, which is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a> except that you're rounding necklines rather than plating the pasta. There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1206910/Bizarre_Barber/">Bizarre Barber</a> for the VR crowd, in which you are a hairdresser who's gotten their Diet Coke mixed up with the shampoo and is now hallucinating magic fish on a train platform. And there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2809250/The_Midnight_Barber/">The Midnight Barber</a>, a visual novel in which you coiffure werewolves, which is designed for ASMR but is also about a political revolution in Barcelona. The barber sim is a richly confusing genre. But alas, an underpopulated one. Mostly, that search term turns up games featuring BBQs, barbarians or women called Barbara.</p>
<p>Barbering would fit naturally into Deliverance 2. The game already lets you practice a range of medieval trades, from brewing to cooking to tanning and smithing. I'm pretty sure Henry's smithing skills would translate naturally to giving Hans Capon a Pompadour - though this would of course be anachronistic, because that particular style is from 18th century France. See, I'm already an expert on hair. Don't make me have carried out all this research for nothing, Warhorse. Don't let me down on 13th March.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I, like plenty of other millennials growing up in the ‘90s, have a lot of good memories of watching the Cartoon Network show following three superpowered sisters, and not only did I think CW’s pitch of a more “mature” version of these characters going through adult problems sounded like the basis of a YouTube parody, but I’d also wasted enough hours of my life watching CW’s DC Comics universe shows to know that this company’s version of melodramatic campy riffs on legacy characters only works half the time. Today, March 6, a trailer for the scrapped show has been published online, and <em>Powerpuff Girls</em> fans are both glad the show never saw the light of day and morbidly curious about what it could have been.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The trailer was posted (then subsequently taken down by Warner Bros.) by Lost Media Busters, a YouTube channel that posts videos from canceled, deleted, or otherwise not publicly available shows, movies, and video games. The one good thing I will say about it before we start dragging the three-and-a-half minute clip is that it sounds like CW got Tom Kenny (who most know as the voice of SpongeBob) to reprise his role as the narrator for the trailer. Either that or they got a really convincing soundalike. And that does it for the positive because, holy shit, this looks <em>terrible</em>.</p><p>It looks like <em>Powerpuff </em>(there’s no <em>Girls</em> in the title because they’re grown women now, of course), would have started the same way the original cartoon did, with <em>Scrubs </em>actor Donald Faison playing Professor Utonium as he accidentally created three superpowered girls who fought crime and were generally considered heroes to the city of Townsville. Their heroism led to a wave of popularity, including merch lines and even a cartoon riff on their exploits (the original show which, in a bit of meta-humor, live-action Buttercup says “completely whitewashed” the trio), and things were going well for the girls. That is, until something happens that turns the public against them. We see protests against the girls, and eventually the three of them do something that gets Townsville mayor Mojo killed, paving the way for his son Jojo to take over. (The pair’s names are clearly an homage to Mojo Jojo, a monkey with human intelligence who was one of the cartoon’s main villains.)</p><p>After this, the girls go their separate ways, and this is where the show goes from what looks like an okay YouTube parody video to a bad <em>Saturday Night Live</em> sketch about the girls crashing out in their young adult years. Blossom runs away, Buttercup becomes a firefighter, and Bubbles becomes a burnout who drinks her nights away and tries to cash in on her lost fame. Eventually, the girls regroup in Townsville and Jojo hatches an evil scheme they must band together to stop.</p><p>But, my god, this whole thing is a hard watch. The three minutes of curated footage amounts to a series of unfunny jokes, awkward and stilted action, some of the worst green-screened flying you’ve ever seen, and a signature CW needle drop of the most popular song on the radio at the time, Dua Lipa’s “Levitating.” It oozes focus-tested flavorlessness with a slight pinch of edgy toilet humor so people know this time the Powerpuff Girls are Not For Kids. If you’ve got the stomach for it, check out the full trailer below.</p><p>CW’s campy shlock can sometimes work. <em>Riverdale </em>managed to take its self-seriousness and morph it into something enjoyable over several seasons. The company’s decade of DC Comics extended universe shows produced some real garbage, but <em>Legends of Tomorrow </em>was pretty exceptional before it was unceremoniously canceled in its seventh season. But I see no such spark here. Fans of the original show are mostly celebrating that the show was canceled before it had a chance to sully the <em>Powerpuff</em> name, though some admit they probably would have hate-watched it and others think the adaptation could have had potential.</p><p>Well, I’ll leave you with the one laugh I’ve had through looking at this all day.

<p>Ahead of the game’s release on March 20, Ubisoft has released 20 minutes of new Assassin’s Creed Shadows gameplay.</p>



<p>The new gameplay shows both Naoe and Yasuka “infiltrating Nijo Palace, the castle complex (also known as a tenshu) in Kyoto, a major city in the larger region of Yamashiro.”</p>



<p>“Castles in Assassin’s Creed Shadows are strongholds, filled with hostile guards, valuable resources, and one precious loot chest,”  Ubisoft’s Youssef Garcia-Maguid wrote on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/assassins-creed-shadows-20-minutes-of-new-castle-gameplay-launches-march-20/?sf276574441=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog.</a> “Conquering a tenshu means eliminating any Samurai Daisho on the premises, which unlocks the loot chest, giving you powerful gear. You can see the contents of these chests when you hover over the castle icon in the map.”</p>

<p>Garcia-Maguid added that Castles are “just one of the many activities” in the game that players can complete in order to increase their Knowledge Rank. Increasing your Knowledge Rank will let players learn higher-level abilities.</p>
