            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a>, the global data firm for videogame industry sales has collaborated with <a href="https://www.tebex.io/">Tebex</a>, a monetization platform that videogame studios use for in-game purchases to publish a report that dives into player spending in North America and Europe. </p>



<p>The <em><a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/trend-reports/newzoo-tebex-unlocking-games-revenue-player-behavior-and-payment-trends">Unlocking Games Revenue: Player Behavior and Payment Trends in the West</a></em> report has more than a few interesting revelations about player spending in North America and Europe, like how players in those two regions are the minority of the world's gamers but <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-of-worlds-gamers-drive-nearly-half-global-gaming-spend-north-america-europe-newzoo/">drive nearly half of all spending in the videogame industry</a>.</p>



<p>But the videogame industry is not what it was 20 years ago, where spending trends would be mostly based on players buying individual games. Microtransactions are the name of today's game in the modern videogame landscape, and there are some interesting differences between North American players spending on microtransactions versus European players.</p>



<p>At a top-level look, players in Europe spend on microtransactions than players in North America, with sports games being the top genre in Europe, while shooters are the top genre in North America. "<em>Microtransactions make up nearly half of PC and one-third of console gam revenues in Europe</em>," according to Newzoo and Tebex.</p>

<p>In both North America and in Europe, however, consoles are the only platforms where premium game purchases still account for over 50% of player spending. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo and Tebex</figcaption></figure>



<p>But when it comes to why players are spending their hard-earned cash, the reason for hitting the 'buy now' button is very different for players in North America and players in Europe. 28% of European players, according to Newzoo and Tebex, will choose to spend their money in the videogame industry if something is on sale or at what they deem to be a 'good price.' Whereas North American players top reason for buying anything is so that it gives them access to extra or exclusive playable content.</p>



<p>Buying something because it's on sale is the fifth of the top-five reasons listed for North America.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo and Tebex</figcaption></figure>



<p>As far as what microtransactions players are buying in North America and Europe, however, those lists are much closer. Four out of the top five categories of in-game microtransaction purchases are the same between North American and European players, with players in both regions prioritizing expansions, power-ups, in-game currencies, and in-game subscriptions.</p>



<p>Loot boxes or gacha, as they're listed by Newzoo and Tebex, are at the bottom of the list for both North America and Europe, but that feels at least slightly misleading, since it seemingly means loot boxes purchased directly with real money, rather than a player buying an in-game currency to then spend on loot boxes.</p>



<p>For all the new statistics and bits of information shared in Newzoo and Tebex's report, one element that isn't news to anyone is, to the chagrin of some players, microtransactions and virtual currencies are not going anywhere, anytime soon.</p>



<p>"<em>Virtual currencies and microtransactions are no longer just revenue streams</em>," writes Liam Wiltshire, head of payments and compliance at Tebex. "<em>They're becoming strategic levers for retention and differentiation</em>."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-life-of-a-showgirl-announcement-cover-date-2000617177</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/taylor-swift-is-music%E2%80%99s-best-game-master.1268124/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>Last night, country-music-it-girl-turned-pop-culture-centerpiece </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-dark-souls-1851439461"><span>Taylor Swift</span></a><span> did something a little different. She announced a new album called </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span>, but not with the usual gravitas she’s become known for throughout her 20-year career. Rather than endless teases, easter eggs, or waiting until she was on stage accepting an award, Swift revealed her 12th studio album on the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@newheightshow/videos"><i><span>New Heights</span></i></a><span> podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs. It all happened very fast, with much of the pre-announcement teasing happening in the span of less than 24 hours. But despite its brevity, Swift’s rollout felt calculated and littered with the same cheeky nods that send fans into overdrive that she’s come to be known for. Even as a casual Swift listener, I can’t help but respect her love of the literal game.</span></p> <p><span>It all started on August 11 as Swift’s publicity team, Taylor Nation, </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNN0isCNpBb/"><span>posted several photos</span></a><span> of the singer on her Eras Tour on social media. Notably, each picture shows her in an orange outfit, with orange eventually being revealed as the primary color for </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span>. Miss </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spotify-wrapped-2024-sabrina-carpenter-espresso-streams-1851714545/2"><span>“Espresso”</span></a><span> herself, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-sabrina-carpenter-icon-skin-leak-festival-1851772197"><span>Sabrina Carpenter</span></a><span>, is also in one of these photos, sparking speculation that she might be featured on the album when it launches. The post has the caption, “Thinking about when she said ‘See you next era…’” referencing a line in Swift’s book documenting the Eras Tour. All of this made it clear that Swift was nearing an announcement, but the quickness with which it came was both surprising and a bit of a relief. Kelce’s show posted a teaser for the episode that would eventually feature Swift, which included her silhouette on the thumbnail, but Swift’s usual playful microcosm of marketing came from her own website, and included a countdown that ended at 12:12 a.m. this morning. You get it? 12? Because it’s her 12th album?</span></p>   <p><span>The actual </span><i><span>New Heights </span></i><span>episode will go live on Wednesday at 7 p.m. Eastern, but the album is already up for pre-order, both as a standard CD and on orange vinyl or cassette. Fans haven’t seen the cover or heard a song, and they’re already showing up to buy the album. Right now, </span><i><span>New Heights</span></i><span> has posted a brief clip of Swift showing off the album, but its cover has been blurred out, presumably to get more eyes on the podcast when it goes up. Even when Swift is going the more straightforward route, she can’t help but make it a waiting game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Even with less than 24 hours between tease and announcement, Swifties are hard-wired to start the guessing games the second they get a whiff of a hint. Sometimes it sends them down a rabbit hole with a dead end, such as when they spent a year looking for clues about a coveted </span><i><span>Taylor’s Version </span></i><span>re-recording of her 2017 album </span><i><span>Reputation</span></i><span>, only for the singer to reveal that she </span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-reputation-taylors-version-not-releasing-1235351379/"><span>had barely done any work on it</span></a><span>, and now doesn’t really need to after she </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/31/nx-s1-5418406/taylor-swift-buys-back-master-recordings-now-she-controls-all-of-her-music"><span>bought back her masters</span></a><span> and could leave the </span><i><span>Taylor’s Version </span></i><span>project behind. The fact that no re-recorded version was even imminent makes creative decisions like Swift changing up her outfit for the </span><i><span>Reputation </span></i><span>set of the Eras Tour </span><a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a62658289/taylor-swift-new-reputation-bodysuit-eras-tour-photos/"><span>after months of wearing the same thing</span></a><span> feel like trolling meant to throw off the most detail-oriented fans looking for any hint that the album might be on the way.</span></p> <p><span>Swifties have been trained to view every creative decision, big and small, as a reference to what’s next. Not everything is a misdirect, and fans have felt vindicated when what seemed like small nods ended up being clues to major reveals. The music video for “Bejeweled,” for instance, has a scene in which Swift’s Cinderella-like character enters an elevator, and each of the buttons has a different color scheme, with each one seemingly corresponding to one of her albums, all of which have noted “main” colors. Fans noticed that the last button on the elevator had the same purple as her third album </span><i><span>Speak Now</span></i><span>, which seemed to hint that she would be re-recording that record next as part of the </span><i><span>Taylor’s Version </span></i><span>project. Lo and behold, the remade album was released the following July.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Taylor Swift - Bejeweled (Official Music Video)" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b7QlX3yR2xs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Some of these nods are more subtle than Swift literally pointing at a representation of the next album to be re-recorded. When she announced her 11th album, </span><i><span>The Tortured Poets Department</span></i><span>, at the 2024 Grammys ceremony, she put up a “V sign” with her hand when she said that she’d been keeping the album a secret for two years. However, in retrospect, it’s clear this was a knowing nod to </span><i><span>TTPD</span></i><span>’s status as a double album, which was a closely kept secret until it was released that April and the second half was published on streaming platforms and digital stores two hours later.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Taylor Swift Announces 'Brand New Album' 'The Tortured Poet's Department'" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/REqdODABGXo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>To be a Swiftie is to spend every day looking and listening for clues like you’re exploring an elaborate, decades-old escape room, only to decide with each door you open that you’re content to go deeper into the vault, never actually escaping. She notoriously weaves her personal life into her music, crafting a story people are invested in on both a narrative level and a parasocial one. Each album is like a new chapter in an ongoing story, and even when albums like </span><i><span>Folklore </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Evermore</span></i><span> are presented as fictional concept albums, they mask reality, with fans theory-crafting what nuggets of truth might lie behind each song. Swift crafts lore and legacy like a dungeon master spinning a tale for a party waiting with bated breath for the next session. Even if you’re not a fan of her music, you have to respect the game design at the heart of her work.</span></p>

<p>Fortnite’s Shock N’ Awesome is giving a very Helldivers 2 vibe, and Arrowhead has finally addressed it. </p>



<p>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 ‘Shock N’ Awesome’ went live <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-shock-n-awesome-season-details-revealed-new-enemies-weapons-pois-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last week</a>, introducing new enemies, POIs, weapons, cosmetics and more. Talking about new enemies, Fortnite Island is now facing a bug invasion, with players teaming up to take down hordes of creepy crawlies. Many players feel that this type of bug invasion was already seen in Helldivers 2. </p>

The Arrowhead CEO, Shams Jorjani, was the first to respond, stating that Fortnite’s latest season “feels very democratic”. Jorjani has also mentioned previously that he doesn’t play Fortnite as the building feature can be frustrating for him. Jorjani’s go-to shooters are Helldivers and Battlefield. </p>



<p>The community manager at Arrowhead, Katherine Baskin (aka Baskinator), also weighed in on Fortnite’s new season, stating, “it’s giving ‘we have helldivers at home”. When asked if this new season could impact their player numbers, Baskinator stated that she’s “not worried” as “Fortnite is Fortnite” and “Helldivers is Helldivers”. She also praised Fortnite, stating, If the kinds of video game drip think our drip is cool enough to… inspire them… then that’s super cool.” At same time, she adds that both game “couldn’t be more different from one another” and that there’s “room for us all at the king’s table.”</p>

            <p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has today received a new patch on PC, offering improved performance and much-needed balance adjustments to tweak some of its infuriatingly cheap difficulty.</p>
<p>As a result, the rougher edges of the Soulslike are being smoothed out, allowing the more unique elements of the game to shine through.</p>
<p>Initially, Wuchang didn't sit well with me. I previewed the game back at the Game Developer Conference but, thrown into a demo partway through the game with little explanation of its intricacies, it all felt intensely derivative. I expected that to continue when playing the game in full, but instead I've been pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p>Part of the issue with Wuchang is it doesn't explain its best ideas very well. The early game is filled with terminology and functions - skyborn might, alacrity, feathering, to name three - but with little explanation or clarity. That leads to frustration and at first I was simply playing this like any other Soulslike without really engaging in its systems.</p><p>But there are interesting ideas here. Take skyborn might: this is an extra resource that's spent on special abilities and magic spells alike, and is gained through last-minute perfect dodges (as well as other means later unlocked on the skill tree). This is the core of combat and, once fully comprehended, lends Wuchang its own peculiar combat rhythm. It's almost <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>-esque, with protagonist Wuchang swiftly dancing around enemies before attacking with typical Soulslike heft, aided by beautiful wuxia animations.</p>
<p>Then there's the madness gauge that, when full after repeatedly dying, forces the player to fight a demonic reflection of Wuchang to regain lost currency. Sure, it's a fun twist on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, but being able to lure your demon to fighting other enemies for you is wonderfully cheeky.</p>
<p>Elements like this ensure Wuchang isn't just another derivative Soulslike but does have its own identity within the typical confines of the genre - the looping level design, say, or the high level of difficulty. Along with its multiple weapon types, unlockable special moves (disciplines), buffing weapons through acupuncture (tempering), and gradually expanding Wuchang's stats on a Sphere Grid-esque skill tree, there is a surprising amount of depth here once players overcome any initial Soulslike fatigue. Much like last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>, once you get past all that costume fetishisation, there's some really strong combat here.</p>
<p>But it's also too rough around the edges, particularly when it comes to that difficulty level. Wuchang takes an <em>age </em>to get off the ground when knocked down, for instance, with enemy combos seemingly perfectly timed to knock you back down again. Similarly, healing takes far too long, turning boss battles into a frustrating lesson on when to heal, rather than when to attack.</p><p>Thankfully, both of these frustrations have been tweaked in the new patch: the invincibility frames of Wuchang's get-up animation have been adjusted and her healing animation sped up (and can now be cancelled with a dodge). Other tweaks include making it easier for light attacks to interrupt enemy animations, and reducing the number of traps, while a future update will allow players to choose to respawn at shrines or a boss door after death.</p>

</figure>
<p>These are all very welcome changes that arrive on top of a number of performance optimisations on PC. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498329191821869869">patch notes</a> don't mention console updates, though presumably this will follow soon - I've been playing the game on PS5 and even now there are stutters and poor textures that mar the twisted, grotesque visuals.</p>
<p>It's these sorts of details, I think, that separate the derivative Soulslikes from the original work of FromSoftware. Sure, the Dark Souls and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> studio released plenty of post-launch patches to adjust difficulty levels, but to me its games are challenging without feeling cheap. That's a distinction many lesser developers haven't quite mastered.</p><p>Wuchang, at times, has felt like a laborious slog despite its interesting twist on the formula. But it's reassuring to see its developer offer tweaks to improve the experience - now it deserves to stand alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-difficulty-options">Lies of P</a> as Soulslikes able to transcend the ever-present FromSoftware comparison.</p>

			<p>The something-punk genres are easy reference material to reach for when cooking up a new game and setting, but you know what they’re missing? An abundance of salt. Abyssus is here to change all that, eschewing the random cogs, goggles and oily machinery of steampunk, and the dystopian body mods and neon of cyberpunk in favour of corrosively salty water and lashings of cosmic horror.</p>
<p><iframe title="Abyssus | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_YeAjcv3GOg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Abyssus has you diving into a first-person shooter roguelike, stepping into the deep-sea diving suit of a brinehunter before descending into the depths to follow The Signal. The story doesn’t really matter here, though you’ll inevitably be drawn to the mildly amusing notes and messages left behind.</p>


<p>Playable in up to four-player co-op, I immediately grabbed a few fellows to play alongside me, thinking that the more of us, the merrier it would be to descend into the murky depths. And that’s true, with the obligatory harmonised song that you can all engage in –&nbsp;now a standard feature of any watery multiplayer game –&nbsp;the strange dancing, and the tussle with the red-eyed automaton enemies that assault you as you venture through the depths of the first region.</p>
<p>With just two of us, the first few runs were a real trial to make progress, butting up multiple times on the way to and then at the first region boss. There was a nice twist here, in finding a boss that really leans in on MMORPG ideas, with hefty area-of-effect attacks, invulnerability phases, and area-blocking hazards. It’s honestly quite overwhelming at times.</p>


<p>Adding a third compatriot, and with the smattering of metagame upgrades applied, we were able to persist and overcome, venturing into the second jungle-like region to battle lizard peoples, and promptly succumbing as the difficulty ramped up. Thankfully, we made it far enough to unlock a few new weapons and abilities – having turrets instead of grenades as an ability was an instant bonus that was so impactful to our steady damage output, we nicknamed them Terry.</p>
<p>With this challenge, I approached playing solo with a sense of trepidation, so you can imagine my surprise when Abyssus was suddenly just…. easy. The number of enemies presented in an area dropped, the number of bullets they take to overcome plummeted, and where even the first few areas of a new run would require a bit of effort in co-op, here I was just breezing through with barely a scratch. I made it just as far on my own as I had with my trio on the first effort, without feeling anywhere near as pressured until the final moments.</p>

<p>Part of this will, of course, be down to powering up in the metagame, spending what I’d earn from each run to grow the options available on successive attempts. These range from having an additional ability charge, to opening up new altars and upgrade stations sprinkled through each region, and simple percentage boosts for damage output. Healing stations are a great help to give you more health stims and aid deeper runs.</p>
<p>On each attempt, you’ll find a selection of different elemental blessings that can be applied to your primary fire, secondary fire and ability. Ice will freeze, fire will burn, lightning will arc between enemies, but there’s also tentacles that can spawn to chuck rocks, shadows that will debuff affected enemies, and vengeful spirits that will build up and then just unleash themselves at enemies. There’s some great combos here that encourage you to coordinate with buddies, or even just shift between fire modes – and again, having Terrys that will steadily ping enemies with shadow damage is just a huge help.</p>

<p>The main problem with Abyssus – outside of the steep co-op difficulty – is that the actual structure of the game is uninspiring. There’s a bunch of hand-crafted arenas for each environment and they’re combined in different ways, but they quickly become overly familiar, and the notes you discover between combat rooms are unchanging, so the world isn’t significantly expanded through lore. The challenges you get to try and spice up the action are also quite basic – destroy a few extra objectives in a room, try to avoid taking damage for a given depth level (which is brutal in co-op), stand on and charge up some floor plates (which is very punishing given that this is a movement-based shooter).</p>
<p>The structure and gradual expansion of both overarching and moment-to-moment possibilities through Abyssus is just a bit too safe, too linear when compared to the best roguelite shooters out there, like a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/">Returnal</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/risk-of-rain-2">Risk of Rain 2</a>. Hopefully this will grow over time, with DoubleMoose Games confirming that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1721110/view/523098989784990109">post-launch content updates will be free</a> with more weapons, modes, mods and more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/abyssus-review-return-to-the-depths-again-and-again.1268094/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Enter the depths of <em>Abyssus </em>with friends in this co-op shooter that has you exploring the ruins of an ancient, sunken civilization. Through attempt after attempt, learn more about the civilization, improve your character and loadout, and try to survive to the end.</p>

<p><em>Abyssus </em>is a dieselpunk co-op shooter that you can play with up to four friends, or that you can just as easily run yourself. The gameplay loop is simple but addictive. You'll descend into the ruins in a massive diving bell and emerge on a floor. Each floor is linear and filled with rooms where you'll be forced into combat with the strange, ancient, yet mechanical enemies that call this place home. After the forces of a room are wiped out, the door forward will open, and you'll continue.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abyssus-review-death.jpg?itok=fYa8yE6E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abyssus-review-death.jpg?itok=8ZI33Kem 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Every two floors, you'll find alternating mini-bosses and bosses, but it's quite simply your main goal to get as far as you can, gather resources, and then do it all over again.</p>

<p>There's an interesting level of variety in the rooms and their contents that you'll come across. At its base form, there are a few set rooms that are pre-generated and then filled with a random assortment of enemies in waves.</p>

<p>Additional objectives also randomly occur that focus on room-based objectives, like holding areas ala King of the Hill, or destroying crystals. As you play further, entire floors may get their own objectives, like getting to the end in under two minutes or completing a whole floor without taking damage (good luck on that one…).</p>

<h2>Upgrades In <em>Abyssus</em></h2>

<p>It's not just the world that is randomized, but also the upgrades for the player. At certain points, players will obtain relics that can add different effects to the game and add new elemental abilities to their primary, secondary, and ability attacks.</p>

<p>Even if every new player starts with an assault rifle and grenades, by the time you reach the third floor, your health, abilities, and experience could be wildly different.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abyssus-review-abilities.jpg?itok=sVVrmc1F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abyssus-review-abilities.jpg?itok=7oJKNOp5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When playing, I thoroughly enjoyed the level of randomness. It was never just about killing enemies, but looking to take on some additional objective. The enemy pool is a bit shallow; it does change when you reach areas past the main bosses, but even then, if you die, you're back to the original pool of enemies.</p>

<p>There are also a large number of permanent upgrades. Completing certain objectives while playing will grant you access to additional loadout options, and by defeating bosses and getting lucky with opening chests, you'll obtain Soul Fragments that give powerful advantages.</p>

<p>I wasn't too sure about the gameplay loop of <em>Abyssus</em>; it's a good loop, but it might not have been enough to grab me. Seeing how quickly my abilities scaled and how much further I was able to get with Soul Fragments is what really dragged me into the game. Each upgrade isn't far off from another, so there's always some big improvement to be made.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abyssus-review-character-upgrades.jpg?itok=g9c71Ee3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abyssus-review-character-upgrades.jpg?itok=gEYyy5o1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On the first tier of upgrades, I could see features to slightly improve damage, but also ones that allow you to start with a second syringe (a powerful healing item). On the second tier alone, these upgrades started getting a bit crazy. Getting to increase your health by 20%, getting additional ability uses, and even getting to start each run with valuable keys and coins.</p>

<p>A single good run can net you one to two upgrades to begin with, letting you quickly scale and see yourself barely making it through the first mini-boss, to confidently taking out a boss.</p>

<p><em>Abyssus </em>is a game that could be replayed over and over until the end of time, but it's also very respectful of your time in that you can make progress in a single 20-30 minute run.</p>

<h2>Keep Going Deeper</h2>

<p>Interestingly, playing the game and defeating bosses will earn you Soul Fragments that improve your character's abilities, but completing Expeditions (reaching the end of the game) will net you Brine Canisters.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abyssus-review-dungeon-upgrades.jpg?itok=EeZeh4uo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abyssus-review-dungeon-upgrades.jpg?itok=rI9Lop_H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Brine Canisters can be used to make your game harder. A clear example of this would be the ability to make Healing Shrines no longer restore Syringe uses. This takes away the ability to refresh what is one of the most powerful ways to heal yourself as you're making your way into the depths.</p>

<p>This culminates in the ability to alter enemy and boss damage and health modifiers.</p>

<p><em>Abyssus </em>presents multiple levels of play to the player. You can adventure on your own and with friends, and your aim can be to just get to the end of an Expedition and be happy that you got to enjoy the game. Completionists have hundreds of objectives to complete to unlock additional weapons, modifications, and cosmetic items. This will continue to keep the game fun and have you playing in ways you may not be most inclined to.</p>

<p>Then, for the masochist, there's the ability to take all of that progress and stack on additional difficulties to prove that you aren't just able to reach the end, but you can do so with added weights dragging you down.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abyssus-review-objectives.jpg?itok=qp_dREh9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abyssus-review-objectives.jpg?itok=xY64yJbp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>At no point would any player who reached their level of satisfactory play feel like they were missing out, or that they had been locked out of experiencing more of the game due to difficulty, but it's clear how much time and consideration was put into an experience that would challenge the best of them.</p>

<h2><em>Abyssus </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Whether you want a game to run once or twice in an afternoon to blow off some steam or dive into it for a longer session with friends,&nbsp;<em>Abyssus </em>is a fantastic choice. The randomness of the runs serves to lift up the player, allowing them to gather what's necessary to break through to the next barrier in just a run or two, and not a few hours.</p>

<p>The game maintains its difficulty while also providing players with a wide host of options to power up their characters and gear, and reshape the dungeon they're making their way through to maximise their abilities.</p>

<p>The satisfaction of continuously reaching a new personal best or getting incredibly close will keep bringing you back for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has previewed changes coming to an army in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a>. The new <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Nighthaunt Battletome brings the ghostly army into the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-fourth-edition-signals-new-age" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newest edition</a>, bringing some rules and mechanics updates along the way.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/hsrvwzdi/scare-the-wits-out-of-your-foes-and-open-up-a-phantasmal-pharmacy-with-battletome-nighthaunt/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community</a> post, Games Workshop previews some of the changes coming in the new <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Nighthaunt battletome.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-nighthaunt-battletome-ethereal-statblock.jpg?itok=tCkvmBSa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-nighthaunt-battletome-ethereal-statblock.jpg?itok=q424004a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Some of these changes are buffs and quality-of-life improvements. The units will retain their Ethereal rule, but now ignore just negative modifiers... except for Nagash. To balance for this, saves are now reduced to 5+ for Hero units and 6+ for spectres. But, to help reinforce the idea of the Nighthaunt as incorporeal warriors, they are all getting a 5+ Ward save and an additional unit of health per model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Warhammer Age of Sigmar Nighthaunt Battletome introduces new passives and resources. Mounting Dread debuffs the enemy's control scores based on how long the battle has gone. Etherreal Translocation lets you teleport a unit once per turn away from the enemy. Vanish and Reappear grants units bonus movement and lets them ignore terrain or enemy units.</p>

<p>The new battletome also includes new heroic traits and artefacts. Undead wizards can now use Wrench Souls, which can move friendly Nighthaunt units outside of movement phase, Alternatively, they can burden the enemy with Chains of Death, burdening them with strike-last for the rest of the turn. Then there's the unlimited spell ability, Fell Blades, which subtracts 1 from enemy save rolls against subsequent attacks.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-nighthaunt-battletome-lord-vitriolic-artwork.jpg?itok=vLaJHemI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-nighthaunt-battletome-lord-vitriolic-artwork.jpg?itok=ECTit7X_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Lastly, the <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Nighthaunt Battletome preview features a new unit: the Lord Vitriolic. This ghastly potion-maker's Spectral Alchemy ability lets you provide a buff to your army. Spectral Solvent dissolves anything with a negative move characteristic. Choking Vapours debuffs enemy Wizards. And Unholy Prescription prevents the enemy from making Ward saves for a single turn.</p>

<p>All of these changes and more can be found in the new <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Nighthaunt Battletome, which will be available for pre-order this upcoming Saturday.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-halo-crossover-seemingly-teased</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-halo-crossover-seemingly-teased-in-latest-trailer.1268088/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>trailer may hint at the existence of a crossover between Arrowhead's shooter and Microsoft's iconic&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">launching on Xbox Series X|S</a> later this month, and to commemorate that launch, Arrowhead and Sony have released a new "Bring the Boom" trailer, showing gameplay highlights for the game. It's a fairly standard trailer, but it's the final few seconds that are particularly interesting.</p>

<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-bring-the-boom-trailer-teases-odst-at-the-very-end.1267872/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Klyka</a>, the final few seconds of the Bring the Boom trailer depict scenery that looks very close to&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST</em>'s New Mombasa, complete with music that's strongly reminiscent of that spinoff. It looks like a crossover with that game is on the cards.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-halo-odst-crossover-visual.jpg?itok=uqNXoTcA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-halo-odst-crossover-visual.jpg?itok=S2c2fC9R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>&nbsp;is getting a&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>crossover.</figcaption></figure><p>If this crossover is going ahead, then&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>feels like the right game for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>to cross over with. While the core&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>series follows the exploits of unstoppable badass Master Chief,&nbsp;<em>ODST&nbsp;</em>is much more about the little guys on the ground, which matches&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s "you are a cog in a miserable machine" feel.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that we don't know what form the crossover will take, if it's coming at all. We could be getting a full New Mombasa map, or the crossover could be limited to&nbsp;<em>ODST&nbsp;</em>skins or cosmetics. It's also not clear whether that crossover is coming just to Xbox or to the PS5 as well.</p>

<p>This trailer comes just a couple of months after Chinese gaming giant Tencent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arrowhead-tencent-stake-report" rel="nofollow">purchased a 15% stake</a> in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>developer Arrowhead, which, despite the fact that both <i>Helldivers&nbsp;</i>games were published by Sony, remains an independent company (for now, at least).</p>

<p>At any rate, you can check out the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Bring the Boom trailer right here. The&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>tease (if, indeed, that's what it is) can be found right at the end.</p>




<p><i>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</i>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on August 26th. You can read our review of the game from back when it launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>

              <p>The Nintendo Switch is home to a number of games in <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> franchise, such as the award-winning open-world adventures of <i>Breath of the Wild</i> and <i>Tears of the Kingdom</i>, the inventive Zelda-starring <i>Echoes of Wisdom</i>, and quite a few classic titles via a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Last but not least, we even got a remake of a sometimes-underrated entry: <i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i>.</p> <p>Though it sports an all-new chibi art style and some basic quality-of-life features, such as improved menu navigation and button mapping features, <i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i> on Nintendo Switch maintains the integrity of the 1993 Game Boy to ensure that both new and returning fans can enjoy the fourth game in the series just as it’s always been.</p> <p>And with everything intact just as you’d expect, you can be certain that you’re getting a game with the same runtime as the original, too. But just how long is <i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i> on Nintendo Switch? And does it run any better on Switch 2? Let’s get into it.</p>

 <h2>How does <i>Link’s Awakening </i>run on Switch 2?</h2> <p>Unlike <i>Tears of the Kingdom</i>, and many other original Switch titles, <i>Link’s Awakening</i> doesn’t have a specific Switch 2 upgrade you can purchase. But that’s not to say the game didn’t receive any love when Nintendo’s new console dropped. On June 3, 2025, <i>Link’s Awakening</i> got a patch that optimizes the game’s visuals, upping the resolution and improving HDR support.</p> <p><i>Link’s Awakening</i> also ran into some troublesome framerate issues on the original Switch. Running on Switch 2, however, the issue has been dramatically improved, if not fixed entirely. So if you’re waiting on upgrading to a Switch 2 before diving into this remake, your patience will be rewarded with improved performance. Check out a direct comparison <a href="https://youtu.be/e2kBayO4bqY">here</a>:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Zelda: Link's Awakening - Switch/Switch 2 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e2kBayO4bqY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>How long is <i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i>?</h2> <p><b><i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i></b><b> will take the average player between 12-15 hours</b> to reach the credits. Much of this time will be spent solving puzzles, talking to NPCs, and tracking down useful items required to complete your journey. But that doesn’t include finding every heart piece and seashell, finishing every trading sequence, or engaging with other optional tasks.</p>

 <p>If you’re wanting to collect all of that stuff and see every bit of additional content, <b>you’ll be looking at closer to 20-25 hours of play time in </b><b><i>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</i></b>. That’s a whole hell of a lot of Hyrulian fun, but it’ll require some patience (or a nifty guide), as there are some well-hidden secrets to be found throughout this bright and colorful version of Hyrule.</p> <p>If you’re on the fence about this one, just remember that it’s a remake of a Game Boy game, for better and worse. It offers some memorable dungeons, a unique tale, and toy-like visuals that will appeal to newcomers and returning fans alike. But its fairly linear structure and occasionally frustrating old-school design philosophy may be a little polarizing, sticking out even more to those introduced to the franchise during the <i>Breath of the Wild</i> era.</p> <p>If <i>The</i> <i>Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening </i>sounds up your alley, though, it’s available now on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>The Battlefield 6 beta is one of the hottest tickets in town. Many people have locked in pre-orders already based on the first few hours of gameplay. This is leading to confusion about whether you must pre-order BF6 beta to gain beta access. This guide answers all and has everything you need to know.</p>



<p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ll have no doubt heard about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-start-times-today-explained-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 beta</a>. Whereas Battlefield 6 Labs served as the testing ground for BF6, the open beta is where everyone gets a proper chance to get stuck in. We already think (whisper it if you need to) <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-impressions-battlefield-is-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield is back</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for your first Battlefield 6 beta taster and need to know if the meal ticket is free, we’ve got you covered.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Bat away those beta doubts. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You don’t need to pre-order any edition of Battlefield 6 to gain access to the BF6 beta.</strong></p>



<p>I’ll say it one more time for those in the back: Battlefield 6’s beta doesn’t require a pre-order. This means there’s no pre-ordering to get a code and canceling the pre-order like in years gone by.</p>



<p>I remember being so excited for Battlefield: Bad Company, I had it pre-ordered as an early birthday present so I could play the demo with Gold Rush on Oasis. I didn’t cancel the pre-order, but this is an example of how long these pre-order strategies have been around!</p>



<p>As of writing, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-start-times-today-explained-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next Battlefield 6 beta is the second weekend of August</a> and is still part of the open beta incentive—meaning it’s inclusive for all players on all applicable platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-explained">How to Play The Battlefield 6 Open Beta, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>To play the Battlefield 6 beta, you must have taken part in Battlefield Labs, have an EA Play Pro subscription, or have redeemed a free code through the BF6 website.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-battlefield-labs">Battlefield Labs</h3>



<p>Quite simply, if you signed up for Battlefield Labs and you playedtested the game in its preliminary phase, you will have free access to the open beta.</p>



<h3 id="h-ea-play-pro">EA Play Pro</h3>



<p>If you’re an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-battlefield-6-be-on-ea-play-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Play</a> Pro member, you get free access to the BF6 beta. <em>Technically</em>, it’s not free, as you have to pay for the subscription, but you get the idea.</p>



<h3 id="h-official-bf6-website">Official BF6 Website</h3>



<p>Head to the Battlefield 6 website and navigate your way over to the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-open-beta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">‘Download Now’</a> section for quick access to a Battlefield 6 open beta slot. It allows you to seek access through various storefronts:</p>

<li>EA App</li>



<li>Epic Games Store</li>



<li>Microsoft Store</li>



<li>PlayStation Store</li>



<li>Steam</li>



<li>Windows</li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>You don’t have to pre-order BF6 to play the beta, and there are many ways to secure beta access. It’s happy days all around! Let me know if you get a chance to play the BF6 open beta and how you find it. Has it sold you on actually pre-ordering Battlefield 6?

It's called TMNT: Empire City, and in the new developer diary video above, you'll get a look at some first-person parkour/traversal gameplay in this early look at the upcoming co-op action-adventure starring your favorite heroes in a half-shell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative director Ace St. Germain gives some insight on the first-person VR parkour mechanics of Empire City: "Movement through sewers is slower and stealthier, while above-ground movement emphasizes parkour, allowing for fast and vertical exploration. We’re not recreating the full New York City but are focusing on key areas. The city's haze and mist are narrative devices, rather than invisible walls. The architecture is inspired by real New York buildings, like the Confucius Plaza (renamed “Wise Man Building”). Using hands for parkour, players can grab ledges, dash mid-air, and launch themselves dynamically. Zip lines and uninterrupted momentum mechanics enhance freedom of movement. This verticality is essential for exploration, combat, and player expression.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3713650/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Empire_City/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wishlist</a> TMNT: Empire City on Steam or <a href="https://vr.meta.me/s/1L2KRVYie9Nqfgj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the Meta Store </a>if you're interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <p>Katsuhiro Harada spoke to Eurogamer at Evo earlier this month about the future of the Tekken series without him at the helm. The legendary game director had previously stated <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-leads-uncertain-future-tekken-team">that the next Tekken game could likely be his last before </a>leaving for other ventures..</p>
<p>When asked by Eurogamer whether the Tekken team would be ready for a future without him, Harada responded (via translation courtesy of game designer Michael Murray): "There are two types of games. A game that solely focuses on its story and setting, and games where the gameplay and the game's systems are the focus. So when you divide games into those two categories, a series that's narrative-focused is hard to envision when a major person driving it is gone.</p>
<p>Harada continues: "But for Tekken, [I] feel that it's the latter. Of course people are in love with the characters and the story, but it's mainly a 3D fighting game where you launch your opponent, do aerial juggles, etc. [I] feel over the past 30 years the gameplay has been polished and everything is in place, so it's much easier to continue with someone else.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that Harada (paired with Michael Murray, who has also stated they might only have one more Tekken in him) are more than just developers closed off from the outside world. For years, Harada and Murray have been traveling the world and acting as direct links to the Tekken community. The recently revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> character - Miary Zo - was designed after the team including Harada travelled to Madagascar personally to research the region and its culture.</p><p>When asked whether this approach is important to maintain for a post-Harada Tekken, Harada via Murray responded thus: "We're public figures for Tekken, sure. Compared to other people outside of the company - and this is [my] personal opinion not the official stance of Bandai Namco - it really depends [on the game]. There are other games out there - even fighting games - where there is no public figure to attach to it.</p>
<p>"For Tekken we stand out, but that's because when we first started doing community interaction Evo was much smaller, other tournaments were much smaller, the community was smaller. We were right at the time also when arcades across the world disappeared. So it was like, where do you see your audience and find out what they want? We personally felt it was better to go to these events and interact with people, to get a broad sampling and make our mind up about what to do with the game.</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean that's necessary perhaps. Other games are successful without that, it's not like you have to do that or a game won't succeed. It's just what we felt was necessary for us at that time."</p>
<p>Murray would add his own personal perspective as well, noting: "Personally I feel similarly. At the time there was no internet and forums, there were just arcades. Now it's just the internet! But, is that really where you want to take all your information from? I think you have to make the best decision at the time. Personally, I don't know if we would continue doing things the same way we've always done. I don't get paid a stipend for talking to people on the internet either (laugh)."</p><p>The idea of Tekken without Harada at the helm is a bizarre one, so tied together the two entities are. Though with Harada already exploring new ventures such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-labyrinth">Shadow Labyrinth</a>, perhaps the slow departure is starting already. Whether or not the series can maintain its momentum without its lifelong lead is a big question, perhaps most for the person meant to fill his shoes.</p>

<p>As part of the partnership, Nintendo has pledged to provide "a large quantity" of Nintendo Switch Online memberships and game download codes at no cost. How nice!</p>
<p>ISEA President Danielle Johnson said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are so excited to partner with Nintendo as we continue to grow and expand competitive gaming opportunities for students across the country. Games are a fun, communal experience. We want to make gaming accessible to as many students as possible regardless of their previous gaming experience.</p>
<p>School-based gaming programs connect students that may have not been involved in social competitive activities before, and every student deserves a place to belong at school. These programs not only raise student attendance and achievement but also help students build healthy relationships that can last a lifetime.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/20-of-the-world%E2%80%99s-gamers-drive-%E2%80%9Cnearly-half-of-global-gaming-spend-%E2%80%9D-says-newzoo-with-those-players-annually-spending-325m-on-average.1268046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new report from global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a>, created in collaboration with Tebex, a monetization platform that videogame studios use for in-game spending, has a few major revelations based on data collected in the past six months on the modern gaming landscape about the spending habits of gamers. </p>



<p>The report, titled, <em><a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/trend-reports/newzoo-tebex-unlocking-games-revenue-player-behavior-and-payment-trends">Unlocking Games Revenue: Player Behavior and Payment Trends in the West</a></em>, shares that according to Newzoo's findings, North American and European gamers spend an annual average of $325 million on videogames per year. All that spending comes from only 20% of the global videogaming population, or as Newzoo puts it, "<em>A small share of players, a large share of spend</em>."</p>



<p>Newzoo also predicts that the global videogame market will balloon to $188.9 billion, with 46% of that spending coming from North America and Europe.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo and Tebex</figcaption></figure>



<p>For clarification, as you can see in the graph below, Newzoo defines a player in this case as "<em>All people who play (digital) games on a PC, console, mobile device, or cloud gaming service in the past six months</em>." Another interesting tidbit that's not in the least bit surprising if you're even remotely aware of how most people play videogames nowadays, is that there are way more mobile gamers than PC and console gamers. According to Newzoo, there are 930 million PC gamers, 653 million console gamers, and 2,945 million mobile gamers. Or, to say it another way, almost 3 billion mobile gamers.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo and Tebex</figcaption></figure>



<p>But for all that spending, is there any growth to it? In North America, from 2023 and looking into the future to 2027, Newzoo predicts a 1.1% annual growth. In Europe, it expects a 3.1% annual growth in that same time frame.  That's "<em>slower growth in mature markets</em>," according to Newzoo, who also says that to respond to the slow growth in such high spending markets, "<em>studios must look beyond new payer acquisition - evolving monetization strategies will be key to driving value and engagement</em>."</p>



<p>And that's one of the key takeaways from the report, according to Newzoo and Tebex. That studios need to look towards "<em>deeper monetization</em>" for the future of the industry. </p>



<p>"<em>With modest payer growth in North America and Europe, studios must shift focus from acquiring new payers to maximizing value from existing ones. Aligning monetization with how and why players choose to spend is essential to driving engagement and revenue</em>," Newzoo and Tebex write as the first key takeaway at the bottom of the report.</p>



<p>When Fortnite first launched in 2017, it was one of many videogames players could choose to spend their time with on their preferred platform, with the distinction of a platform in videogames generally meaning a specific piece of hardware. Fast-forward to 2025, and Epic couldn't care less whether you play Fortnite on your phone, your console, or PC, because Fortnite is the platform now.</p>



<p>Individual games are extracting more out of individual players than ever before, but how games go about doing that is what matters, as Newzoo and Tebex point out. Not every game can be successful trying to sell hundreds of thousands of microtransactions, nor can they all be successful premium releases. And with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-gta-vi-likely-wont-be-priced-100-according-to-an-analyst/">uproar around rising prices</a>, increasing the buy-in for every game isn't the answer either.</p>



<p>"<em>Today's players want to know what they're paying for - and why</em>," writes Liam Wiltshire, head of payments and compliance at Tebex. "<em>How you monetize matters more than ever. Evolving monetization strategies are key to driving deeper engagement and long-term value</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>An incident at a Burbank Chuck E. Cheese on August 7 is a useful PSA for what not to do at the kids arcade chain. An adult woman snuck into the Snow Day game meant for very small children and got her arm stuck in one of the holes. I guess she didn’t want the game to end. How many firefighters does it take to get a an arm out of the Snow Day game <a href="https://kotaku.com/chuck-e-cheese-subscription-fun-pass-tickets-price-1851620006">at Chuck E. Cheese</a>? At least six, it seems.</p> <p>It was around 3:30 p.m. last Thursday when the unidentified woman became trapped inside the large plastic arcade game, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/woman-stuck-in-chuck-e-cheese-game-burbank/3761451/">NBC Los Angeles reported</a>. The Snow Day game revolves around putting plastic balls into a central hole. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53xiyTvBrWc">A suction tube then pulls them up</a> and spits them back out the top of the machine. The higher the score, the more tickets you get for prizes. At no point do you need to stick your hand inside the hole, let alone your whole arm.</p> <p>You might be thinking, wow, that sounds like a really boring game. And you’d be right! It was created to fill “an under-served age gap in our industry,” i.e. to be something even a two-year-old could have fun doing.</p>   <p>The local fire department was called and apparently dispatched at least six people to the Chuck E. Cheese to witness the third-degree shame first-hand. Video from the scene showed one person seemingly trying to take the machine apart while several others stood around and contemplated the “place where a kid can be a kid.”</p> <p>“We prioritize children’s safety above all and have verified that the game poses no risk to our young guests,” a Chuck E. Cheese spokesperson said following the incident. The design prevents children’s arms from reaching the area in question. There was no injury to the young adult or any children, and the family continued to enjoy an evening of fun with the family.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-matchmaking-doesnt-prioritise-skill/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-matchmaking-doesn%E2%80%99t-prioritise-skill.1268037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 developers have stated that matchmaking considers skill as a factor, but doesn’t prioritise it. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 open beta is the only thing players have been talking about recently, after we got to see a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-biggest-ever-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spectacular show</a> over the past weekend. As we gear up for the new map and modes for BF6 Open Beta weekend 2, new details about the game’s matchmaking system have been revealed. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-prioritises-ping-over-sbmm">Battlefield 6 Prioritises Ping Over SBMM</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-lead-says-skill-is-a-factor-in-matchmaking-but-far-down-the-list-so-please-lower-your-pitchforks-and-torches/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, the lead producer for Battlefield, David Sirland, was recently <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1954901993245581459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">asked</a> whether any form of SBMM kicks in during Battlefield 6 server match-ups. Sirland clarified, stating that BF6’s open beta matchmaking prioritised all elements they expect for launch, and they remain the same as in the previous title. The biggest priority for Battlefield 6’s matchmaking is “ping and time to game”. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Clarification: Open beta used all matchmaking priorities we expect for launch. And they are the same as they have been in previous titles. We prioritize Ping, and time to game ahead of most things. 1/2</p>— David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1954901993245581459?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Sirland explains that skill is a factor in Battlefield 6’s matchmaking; however, it is “far down the list”. The lead producer added that the game’s large mode requires “a spread of skill to work well”. The sandbox needs players to have different types of skillsets to “function well”, which is “also why the matchmaker teambalances to make the teams even as part of that process.” </p>



<p>Ahead of the open beta, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-sbmm-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Battlefield 6’s skill-based matchmaking will rely on four core aspects: Ping, Player’s Location, Server Availability and Some Skill Factor. Moreover, it was said that the matchmaking factors “will vary based on each game mode and player counts”.</p>



<p>On the topic of Battlefield 6, the viral VTuber ‘RileyCS’ has&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-rileycs-cheating-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been banned on Twitch</a>&nbsp;following allegations of cheating. Additionally, BF6 developers are looking into “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-devs-are-looking-into-unexpectedly-fast-time-to-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unexpectedly fast” time to death</a>. What are your thoughts on Battlefield 6 developers not prioritising skill for matchmaking?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In an all-new trailer promoting the imminent launch of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series platforms, Arrowhead has slipped in a teaser for a potential Halo 3: ODST crossover. It’s only a few seconds worth of content, but it has proven enough to get chins wagging in the comment section under the video.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 will be released on Xbox on August 26, more than a year and a half after it first dropped on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bring-the-boom">Bring the Boom!</h2>



<p>The newest Helldivers 2 trailer has been released, two weeks before the game launches on Xbox platforms worldwide.</p>



<p>Here’s the minute-and-a-half showcase of what’s coming (as if you don’t already know!):</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Bring the Boom | Out August 26" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>If you’re an eagle-eyed gamer, you’ll have spotted the nod to Halo 3: ODST at the end of the video. The sequence containing the drop pod backed by an orchestral score is pulled straight from the 2009 Xbox 360 title, and it has fans <strong>excited</strong>.</p>



<p>The trailer was also one of the first times we’ve seen this surface, which is mind-bending:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans are expecting some kind of launch day crossover between Halo and Helldivers 2, and honestly, there couldn’t be a more perfect thing to hope for. One user wrote on YouTube, ‘Don’t give me hope like that. If there’s an ODST-themed crossover, I’ll cry tears of joy.’</p>



<p>In recent Helldivers-related news, it was revealed that Arrowhead Studios wants to make <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-developers-want-to-make-game-more-challenging/">the game more challenging</a>. It was also confirmed that the developer and publisher have no plans to bring the game to any subscription services <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-have-no-plans-of-putting-it-on-game-pass/">like Game Pass</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A game that bears a striking resemblance to Pocketpair’s popular survival crafting title, Palworld, has been spotted on the Nintendo Store. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Pocketpair is already fighting a patent infringement lawsuit from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, with Nintendo alleging that Palworld has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-argues-invalidity-and-non-infringement-against-nintendos-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infringed on 3 of their patents</a>. Interestingly, now a game that feels like a lookalike of Palworld is available for purchase on the Nintendo Store. </p>



<h2 id="h-palland-and-palworld-look-eerily-similar">Palland and Palworld Look Eerily Similar</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/with-the-palworld-lawsuit-rumbling-on-in-the-background-the-nintendo-switch-welcomes-palland-a-survival-game-that-looks-a-whole-lot-like-pocketpairs-creature-collector/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/palland-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOooQaIk-Baos18U8SW8wkjXAqdMfQRjonByqq4OCiP4XMJEGR9eI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listing</a> for Palland has appeared on the Nintendo Store, and from the outset, players will notice many similarities to Palworld (if Pal-land wasn’t a big giveaway already). The key art and gameplay screenshots feature a similar red-haired woman we have seen in Palworld’s screenshots, with different types of creatures. However, the art style of the two games is slightly different.  </p>



<p>Coming to the description, here’s where players will see more similarities between Palland and Palworld. The description states that Palland features a world with captivating survival, building, and exploration, where players choose “how to gather resources, expand your shelter, and deal with wild creatures that can be both threats and valuable sources of power.”</p>

<p>Palland has been priced at $9.99 ($3.99 on discount till August 14) and is available as a digital game for the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. BoggySoft has published the game, and it was released on July 31, 2025. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> had quite the 2024 on PlayStation 5 and PC, and it's set to bring its bullet heaven, bug-killing mayhem to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-airdrops-on-xbox-series-xs-in-august">Xbox later this month on August 26</a>. Ahead of the game's launch on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox has released a new "Bring the Boom" trailer highlighting the fun (and explosions) of Helldivers 2, and at the end of it, there seems to be a tease for a Halo 3: ODST collaboration or crossover.&nbsp;</p><p>At roughly 1 minute and 11 seconds in, after the meat and potatoes of the trailer have finished, the video fades away to one of Helldiver 2's cities, moody and atmospheric with rain and few lights on the horizon. Then, the smooth jazz of a saxophone as a Helldiver pod drops into the city. Check it out for yourself below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, it's pretty clear what Xbox is trying to do here: that's a Halo 3: ODST tease. Sure, Helldivers <em>do </em>drop into cities, but in the game, it's typically not as moody or as ambient as what's pictured here – what <em>is </em>as moody or as ambient as what's here is the atmosphere of Halo 3: ODST. And then the saxophone seals the deal. As for what it means or when we can expect to learn more, that remains unclear. But given Helldivers 2 has crossed over with PlayStation's Killzone series before, it wouldn't be surprising for the game to feature cosmetics or something from one of Xbox's most beloved games.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting to learn more, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven"><em>Game Informer's </em>Helldivers 2 review</a>, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/halo_3_odst/b/xbox360/archive/2009/09/28/review.aspx"><em>Game Informer's </em>Halo 3: ODST review</a>. After that, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/05/11/every-mainline-halo-game-ranked"><em>Game Informer's </em>ranking of every mainline Halo game</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What would you want out of a Helldivers 2 x Halo 3: ODST crossover?

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1021-patch-notes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1-021-brings-new-endgame-content-and-more-tomorrow.1268001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom is releasing a new&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>update tomorrow (or today, depending on where you are!), and the studio has released the patch notes ahead of the update's launch, showing what kind of endgame content you can expect.</p>

<p>Back in late July, Capcom revealed that it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-august" rel="nofollow">bumping up</a> some of the monster-hunting RPG's endgame content to mid-August, seemingly in response to criticisms from players regarding the game's lack of same. According to the patch notes, that's exactly what you can expect, too.</p>

<p>The patch will run anywhere from 2GB to 6GB depending on which version of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>you have, and it'll land tomorrow at 2:30am UTC (that's around 7:30pm Pacific or about 10:30 Eastern tonight).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1.021-patch-notes-monsters.jpg?itok=hJqIknFK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1.021-patch-notes-monsters.jpg?itok=OpvtVARi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is getting a new update tomorrow with some more endgame content for you.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, you're getting tempered versions of nine of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' creatures when you reach HR 100. They'll take the form of nine-star quests, and you'll also find "regular and tempered versions of Rey Dau and Nu Udra" appearing in the Wounded Hollow if you reach that rank.</p>

<p>Monsters at HR 100 or higher have had their appearance rate adjusted, and standard monsters have had their appearance rate raised slightly. Not only that, but you'll find a new Glowing Stone appraisal item that will grant you "a talisman with random skill attributes" when appraised.</p>

<p>A number of other changes are coming as part of this update too, and if you want to see what those are, you can check out the <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.021.00.00.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes right here</a>. It's worth doing so, as there are a number of improvements that could make your experience just a little bit better.</p>




<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series. Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">in February</a>, the game was initially a phenomenal success for Capcom, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">selling 10 million copies</a> within the space of around a month and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">breaking records for its developer</a> into the bargain.</p>

<p>Since then, however, sales have <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/capcom-admits-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-are-soft-as-pc-issues-persist-but-really-theyve-plummeted-barely-beating-2021s-monster-hunter-rise-and-losing-to-8-other-old-games-including-devil-may-cry-5/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">slowed</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent reviews</a> on Steam have dipped to Mostly Negative, with players decrying a lack of performance updates and simplified gameplay (although reviews seem fairly heavily weighted towards the former).</p>

<p>If you'd like to see the state of the game for yourself, you can check it out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and if you need another opinion, you can check out our&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" rel="nofollow">review right here</a>.</p>

            <p>Please, for the love of all that can be side-swiped into oncoming traffic, make a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/burnout-paradise">Burnout</a> game. This has been one of the five thoughts that fill my head on a daily basis for years at this point, and thanks to a website that's letting people draw pixel art all over Google Maps, I've been given yet another outlet via which to let it out.</p>
<p>That site is <a href="https://wplace.live/">wplace</a>, and it'll look familiar if you've been partial to the now defunct Reddit thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/place/">r/place</a> at any point. Basically, anyone can hop into its map and colour in pixels to doodle over the top of any place on Earth, creating vast canvases of cool art and scrawled messages to whomever might be watching.</p>

<p>So, naturally, I've joined in. First, I had to find a place to write. Enter Paradise City, a <a href="https://www.p-city.com/">swanky resort</a> just next to the airport in Incheon, South Korea. I had to fit my work in next to someone who seems keen to go and see My Chemical Romance in 2026, which is fitting, because we're united by our lust for things that were good in the 2000s. There are also some pretty creepy looking gingerbread people nearby, but I'm sure my unhinged wonky writing will put them off from messing with my demand: 'NEw Burnout PlS!'.</p>

<p>I wasn't done there, though. A resort felt a bit too hopeful for the situation this series has ended up in. So, I found the stretch of Oregon river named Shitten Creek, and have neatly written another 'New BurnouT! PlS' up it, for all to see. There's no other art in this remote bit of the beaver state as of writing, so if you head southwest of Eugene you get a lovely clear look at my struggle to spell out each word while sticking to wplace's 64-pixels-at-a-time limit.</p>

<p>You do get more than that paltry sum, but you've got to wait for a cooldown timer to replenish your stock before you can start drawing again. Will my efforts directly result in current rights holders Electronic Arts seeing and going 'oh bollocks, we'd better finally greenlight a sequel to Paradise or sell up to someone who will'? Look, anything's better than just a single cryptic tease from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/burnout-paradise-remastered-review">Paradise Remastered</a> co-devs Stellar Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/need-for-speed-unbound-dev-offers-a-very-strange-teaser-and-fans-think-its-for-a-burnout-game/">last year</a> that the unnamed arcade racer they've got in the works might, possibly, be Burnouty.</p><p>Anyway, I'm far from the only one who's scrawled something game-related across wplace's Earth. There are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age</a> fans <a href="https://x.com/Scar3crowss/status/1954560684559065413">in Scotland</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>ers everywhere (including near Team Cherry's HQ in Adelaide), and I'm glad to report someone's written "It just works" in Bethesda's hometown of Rockville, Maryland.</p>
<figure>

<p>Naturally, I also looked at my local area and was glad to find someone had penned the logo of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-43588365">defunct local shop chain Grainger Games</a>, with a number of nearby messages saying they still miss it.</p>
<p>I might come back and write a bunch of other dormant racing series that I'd love to see revived and brought straight to PC in some other places. Los Angeles might be gridlocked with graffiti, but I'll stay up til the small hours finding room for Midnight Club.</p>

              <p>Later this month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers</em> 2</a>—previously a PS5- and PC-only PlayStation-published sci-fi shooter—arrives on Xbox with crossplay support. And a new trailer teases the possibility that some Orbital Drop Shock Troopers from <em>Halo 3: ODST</em> might appear as backup.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573">Back in July</a>, Arrowhead and PlayStation Studios announced that their super-successful live-service shooter <em>Helldivers 2</em> would arrive on Xbox on August 26. The co-op shooter leaping to the PS5’s main rival is yet more evidence that the console wars are over. Plus, it means a bunch of Xbox-only players get a chance to enjoy one of the best co-op games released in years. Now, just about two weeks before <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-ps5-sony-playstation-decision-ceo-discord-2000616377"><em>Helldivers 2</em> crashes onto Xbox Series X/S consoles,</a> Xbox and Sony have teamed up (which is a little weird to say) to tease some <em>Halo</em> content coming to <em>Helldivers 2.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>On August 12, a new trailer for <em>Helldivers 2</em> on Xbox dropped and it shows off a bunch gameplay, featuring the kinds of loud explosions and mayhem you’d expect. But at the very end of all that is a quiet, jazzy tease that seems to heavily imply<em> Halo 3: ODST</em> soldiers are inbound. I’ve set up the trailer below to start right at the teaser:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Helldivers 2 - Bring the Boom | Out August 26" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE?start=70&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Ohhh, how I’ve missed the rain-soaked streets of <em>Halo 3: ODST a</em>nd its chill jazz music soundtrack. What a game. And a perfect fit for <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Both Helldivers and ODST soldiers land onto battlefields via drop pods to fight intergalactic threats. <em>Helldivers 2</em> has been very careful with its IP crossovers, but <em>ODST</em> makes sense and visually won’t feel too out of place. The real question is how fans will get their hands on some ODST armor, and also, will it feature some smooth jazz music? We’ll likely find out more before <em>Helldivers 2</em> launches on Xbox Series X/S on August 26.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Finish the fight?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> looks set for an unlikely Halo crossover after a new trailer teased the arrival of the ODST.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead's hugely successful PC and PlayStation 5 third-person shooter launches on Xbox Series X and S on August 26 as the first Sony-published game on Microsoft’s console. The trailer, below, ends with what looks like the arrival of an ODST on a rain-drenched battlefield, alongside the iconic music from the game. It's all very ODST!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Bungie-developed Halo 3: ODST came out exclusively on Xbox 360 in 2009. You play as an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper, or ODST, during and after the events of Halo 2. So, this is <em>not</em> the chance to play as what would be an over-powered Master Chief in Helldivers 2, rather a pretty powerful standard soldier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next obvious question is whether this ODST crossover will come alongside other Halo items, such as its iconic assault rifle and perhaps even the Warthog. Helldivers 2 seems particularly suited to a Halo crossover of this kind, so it will be interesting to see just how far it goes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-published-helldivers-2-gets-shock-release-date-on-xbox-series-x-and-s">announced Helldivers 2’s Xbox release date last month</a> (bizarrely, it comes out the same day as Microsoft releases Gears of War: Reloaded on PlayStation 5). In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Xbox Wire</u></a>, Helldivers 2 Game Director Mikael Eriksson commented on what this launch means to the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game," he said. "We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Crossplay across all platforms is confirmed, which means PC, PlayStation, and Xbox players will be able to play together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 launched on PC and PS5 in February 2024 and was a rare live service smash hit for Sony. It is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time, shifting an incredible 12 million copies in 12 weeks. While player numbers on Steam, which Valve makes public, remain healthy a year-and-a-half on from the record-breaking launch, the Xbox release will no-doubt boost the player pool even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The timing of Halo in Helldivers 2 coincides with Halo also being featured in Fortnite, during a bug-infested season that some Arrowhead developers have said is basically <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-says-fortnites-new-alien-bug-season-is-very-we-have-helldivers-at-home">a Helldivers-themed Fortnite</a>. "Hmmm... it's giving 'we have Helldivers at home,'" community manager Katherine Baskin wrote on the game's Discord, before adding: "I'm not worried."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Halo, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-teases-more-halo-news-this-october">Microsoft has teased more on what's to come in October</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
