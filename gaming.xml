The free update will no doubt contain other new features as well, including new settings options and tweaks to combat. </p><p>While <em>Stellar Blade</em> might not be a clear GOTY contender for many, it’s a really slick action game with some beautiful visuals and neat, old-school charm. It’s a promising debut project for Shift Up that punches way above its weight.

It has since seen two mainline sequels, <em>Metro: Last Light</em> and <em>Metro Exodus</em>, which have continued to expand its story set in an apocalyptic Russia. Now, the franchise has returned with a VR-exclusive game called <em>Metro Awakening</em>, which lets you experience this tattered world as if you lived there yourself.</p><p>If you’ve been eagerly awaiting a new game in the franchise, a VR-only title may not have been on your bingo card. But luckily, <em>Metro Awakening</em> doesn’t abandon what came before it, but expands upon it instead with a side story that may shock long-time <em>Metro </em>enthusiasts with some incredible revelations about a fan-favorite character.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmetro-awakening%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmetro-awakening%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Metro Awakening</em></a></span>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d9276730a497cc2a78eca0b3ddb9f323" data-recommend-id="image://d9276730a497cc2a78eca0b3ddb9f323" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A monster lunges toward the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A monster lunges toward the protagonist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Vertigo Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d9276730a497cc2a78eca0b3ddb9f323" data-recommend-id="image://d9276730a497cc2a78eca0b3ddb9f323" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A monster lunges toward the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Metro Awakening</em> is a spin-off prequel to the first game in the series, <em>Metro 2033</em>. Unlike the main games, players no longer control beloved protagonist Artyom, and instead take on the role of a doctor named Sedar, who is on a mission through the Moscow tunnels to find his wife—even if it leads him to darker and more mystical places than he could’ve ever expected.</p><p>Don’t worry, though: Everything you’ve loved about the mainline games is largely here (albeit in VR form), including all of the tense and claustrophobic thrills of exploring the dark and dreary underground subways humans call home in the <em>Metro </em>universe. And yes, you still have to survive with limited ammo, engage in stealth, and wear gas masks to avoid radiation if you want to reach the end of your journey. In other words, if you’re a fan of the previous entries in the franchise, rest assured that <em>Metro Awakening</em> hasn’t strayed far from the path.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3539ec0df030205e6ea0f41ad4c0f52c" data-recommend-id="image://3539ec0df030205e6ea0f41ad4c0f52c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist observes two dead characters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist observes two dead characters." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Vertigo Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3539ec0df030205e6ea0f41ad4c0f52c" data-recommend-id="image://3539ec0df030205e6ea0f41ad4c0f52c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist observes two dead characters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Metro Awakening</em> is developed by Vertigo Games, an award-winning studio known for other well-received VR titles like <em>Arizona Sunshine</em>, <em>A Fisherman’s Tale</em>, and<em> After the Fall</em>.

So, if you want to experience this entry in the series then you’ll definitely want to decide which VR headset will be best for you and grab it on that respective platform.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7ceae139c7259d3577faa94f1a0ecf4e" data-recommend-id="image://7ceae139c7259d3577faa94f1a0ecf4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist stalks a pair of characters in a train tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist stalks a pair of characters in a train tunnel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Vertigo Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ceae139c7259d3577faa94f1a0ecf4e" data-recommend-id="image://7ceae139c7259d3577faa94f1a0ecf4e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist stalks a pair of characters in a train tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <em>Metro </em>series has long been a singleplayer-focused franchise, and that doesn’t change with <em>Metro Awakening</em>. This is an entirely solo experience from beginning to end, meaning there are no cooperative or competitive modes. It’s doubtful that Vertigo Games will ever expand the game with any type of multiplayer, so make sure you’re prepared to enjoy this title alone before picking it up.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fa128d0fdc79a9432ce5b0e91f31f924" data-recommend-id="image://fa128d0fdc79a9432ce5b0e91f31f924" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A lamp stands in an abandoned train car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A lamp stands in an abandoned train car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Vertigo Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa128d0fdc79a9432ce5b0e91f31f924" data-recommend-id="image://fa128d0fdc79a9432ce5b0e91f31f924" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A lamp stands in an abandoned train car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The <em>Metro </em>series is popular around the world, so Vertigo Games has ensured that language barriers are mitigated as well as possible in <em>Metro Awakening</em>. As such, the game supports English audio, as well as subtitles for English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Spanish, Czech, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian.</p><hr><p><em>Metro Awakening</em> is available now. If this kind of post-apocalyptic survival shooter is your kind of thing, make sure to also keep an eye on the long-awaited sequel <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl </em>launching November 20.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s everything that was confirmed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Black Friday Switch Game Deals – Starting Nov. 24</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Beginning November 24, several Nintendo Switch games will be available at lower prices at major retailers like Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Walmart. This includes $20 off games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and other games down to at least $29.99. We predicted we'd see very similar deals in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-game-deals-predictions-for-black-friday-2024">"What to Expect" for Nintendo Black Friday</a> column. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/12/nintendo-holiday-offers-1731423438423.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also worth mentioning that the deals over Black Friday will likely extend beyond what Nintendo has discussed, so stay tuned for even more updates. Moreover, on Nintendo’s digital storefronts, including the eShop and My Nintendo Store, holiday sales on select games will be a few days ahead of the other deals on November 19. But retailers could start to price match on this day instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Switch games on sale for Black Friday:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – $49.99 ($20 off)</li><li>Super Mario Maker 2, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Pikmin 4, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and the physical version of Nintendo Switch Sports – $39.99 each</li><li>Super Mario Odyssey and Pikmin 1 + 2 – $29.99 each</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Accessories will also see price drops:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Neon Red/Blue Joy-Con controllers and the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller – $20 off</li><li>Tears of the Kingdom-themed Nintendo Switch Carrying Case &amp; Screen Protector – $10 off </li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Black Friday Holiday Console Bundles</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-nintendo-switch-mario-kart-8-deluxe-black-friday-2024-bundles">Black Friday Holiday Switch bundles</a> are something we already knew about and are already available, but it has now been triple confirmed by Nintendo. You can now purchase a Nintendo Switch: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle for $299.99 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6Pol?object_uuid=1a2a0f56-456f-4f5d-9c60-712dd750ddc0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Best Buy</a>), or a version with the Switch OLED for $349.99 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QKDm0Y?object_uuid=1a2a0f56-456f-4f5d-9c60-712dd750ddc0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Best Buy</a>).

"This is why Link doesn’t talk either." But with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-for-nintendo-switch-with-zelda-as-protagonist">the role of Zelda supporting Link reversed in Echoes of Wisdom</a>, it now fell on Link's shoulders to guide Zelda along.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Legend of Zelda Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo therefore gave Link a voice for the first time after nearly four decades of Zelda games.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-last-of-us-season-twos-2025-release-window-narrowed-down-by-hbo.1034052/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-twos-release-window-narrowed-down-by-hbo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
If you've been looking forward to your second dose of fungi-orientated misery, there's some good news: HBO has narrowed down the release date for season two of its highly acclaimed The Last of Us live-action adaptation, confirming it's now targeting "spring" 2025.
</p>
<p>
The inevitable second season of The Last of Us (inevitable given the original season was both a critical and commercial smash, managing to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">win eight Emmys</a> and attract an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-averaging-32m-viewers-per-episode-in-us-most-watched-hbo-max-show-in-europe">average of 32m viewers per episode</a> the US) was announced in January 2023, just two weeks after the first episode aired. Then, last December, HBO confirmed the show was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-now-confirmed-for-2025-release">targeting a "2025" release</a>.
</p>
<p>
And now, HBO and Max content CEO and chairman Casey Bloys has narrowed that window down further, revealing - during a 2025 programming slate presentation (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/max-reveals-new-release-date-details-for-the-last-of-us-season-2-and-peacemaker-season-2">IGN</a>) - that The Last of US season two will launch in "spring" next year.

<p>
As to what The Last of Us' second season will entail, showrunner Craig Mazin has already confirmed it'll be delving into the events of developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us Part 2, albeit with the game's storyline being split across more than one season. 
</p><p>
"We don't think that we're going to be able to tell the story even within two [more] seasons because we're taking our time and [going] down interesting pathways which we did a little bit in season one too," Mazin <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">explained</a> earlier this year. "We feel like it's almost assuredly going to be the case that - as long as people keep watching and we can keep making more television - season three will be significantly larger. And indeed, the story may require season four."
</p>
<p>
HBO also previously confirmed season two will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">feature a slightly shorter episode count</a>, coming it at seven episodes compared to season one's nine. "The story that we're telling is much bigger than the story of season one, there's just a lot more going on, it's a lot harder to produce but we want every episode to feel like its own blockbuster," Mazin said in an interview at the time. "When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the [natural] breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes."
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us season two sees the return of Bella Ramsey as Ellie and Pedro Pascal as Joel, with currently announced newcomers including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a>, Isabela Merced as Dina, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-series-casts-beef-actor-young-mazino-as-jesse">Young Mazino as Jesse</a>, and Catherine O'Hara in an unannounced role. Oh, and fans can also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">expect</a> "a lot more infected", according to Mazin.
</p>
<p>
HBO released a new trailer for The Last of Us' second season back in September, and you can read series aficionado Victoria Kennedy's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-trailer-shows-our-best-look-yet-at-season-two">thorough breakdown of its shots</a> elsewhere on Eurogamer. If nothing else, it'll tide you over until spring next year.

<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and uses core features like Lumen and Nanite, although it won't feature any hardware ray tracing effects. In an <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gamescom-qa-gsc-game-world-talks-about-the-final-rush-to-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with Wccftech at Gamescom, the developers explained those may be added later with a patch.</p>
<p>Today, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-launches-stalker-2-and-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-driver-nvidia-app-also-now-out-of-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the latest GeForce Game Ready driver optimized for the game. They also confirmed that NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation will be included to boost frame rates on GeForce RTX GPUs. While we don't know for sure, it's a safe bet that Intel XeSS and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution will be available as well.</p>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches on Wednesday, November 20, for PC and Xbox Series S|X. Game Pass subscribers will see it added to their library from day one.</p>

While nothing is set in stone, it sounds like the team hopes they can continue a dual approach to developing <em>Zelda</em> games in the future. “And so we will also have those dynamic 3D <em>Zelda</em>s as well,” he told the <em>BBC</em>. “But in addition to that, we’re also hoping that we can continue with these 2D top-down <em>Zelda</em>s.”</p><p>Ever since the era of the original Game Boy, the adventure games have been on dual trajectories, with console versions pushing the boundaries of 3D exploration while the portable ones explore new 2D mechanics. The Nintendo DS and 3DS eras especially were full of multiple projects, but as the company’s development pipelines converged with the Switch, which functions as both a handheld and a home console, it’s felt like the 2D side of that equation has languished a bit. </p><p>Prior to <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, the multiplayer spin-off <em>Tri Force Heroes</em> was the only new original 2D <em>Zelda </em>in the last decade. <em>Link’s Awakening</em> in 2019, which Grezzo also worked on, was good, but still just a remake of an existing <em>Zelda</em>. <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, on the other hand, introduces entirely new mechanics in addition to making the franchise’s namesake actually playable for once. </p><p>Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-sales-officially-surpasses-two-million&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-sales-officially-surpasses-two-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently confirmed</a></span> that the game has already sold 2.5 million copies in its first month.

<p>Sure, you could sell your harvest wholesale using a combine harvester, load up a trailer, and then drive the load across town to sell. You’ll make a few thousand dollars per harvest, and adequate money compounds over time. But if you’d rather keep your harvest at home to earn more money, take advantage of production chains. They’ll earn you top dollar but require more time and investment. For now, here’s a look at all of the products in Farming Simulator 25!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-product-you-can-craft-in-farming-simulator-25">Every Product You Can Craft in Farming Simulator 25</h2>



<p>I completely understand the desire to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-crops-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harvest your yield</a> and immediately rid yourself of the trouble. You dump the whole lot in a truck and drive it off to make a quick buck. Then, you repeat the process. But if you plan ahead, you can make significantly more money in Farming Simulator 25 by investing in production chains that allow you to craft canned goods, cereal, olive oil, and furniture. I mean, you can even build a cat tree toy. What?!</p>

<h2 id="h-how-do-production-chains-work-in-farming-simulator-25">How Do Production Chains Work in Farming Simulator 25?</h2>



<p>As its name implies, the production chain mechanic requires a chain of goods, materials, and machines to process raw items into tangible, physical goods that you may sell to corporations or businesses around the map. First, you’ll likely prioritize crops, as every map begins with a few fields. As such, I recommend prioritizing canned goods, as they’ll initially provide a more straightforward production chain.</p>



<p>That said, you must invest copious amounts of money. Not only must you buy seeds, prep the fields, and perform the usual harvesting processes to gather your vegetables, but you also require a factory. With a factory, depending on its type, you can turn crops and animal products, like milk or eggs, into processed goods that earn more money. There are numerous factory types in the game, some specifically for crops and others for forestry, for example.</p>



<p>You can buy a pre-built factory somewhere on the map or place one yourself using the game’s build mode. Either way, expect to pay an arm and a leg.</p>



<p>What’s your first production chain in Farming Simulator 25 going to be? Let us know in the comments, or start a thread in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a> to discuss strategy and crop rotations with other fans!</p>

<p>If you don’t want to invest too much money, whether it’s in your video games or your production chains, then you’re likely wondering about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/farming-simulator-25-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Farming Simulator 25 on Xbox Game Pass</a>, right?</p>

Concord is officially no more, and neither is the studio that made it thanks to recent layoffs at Sony. But the ill-fated PlayStation shooter is set to live on in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">Amazon's upcoming Secret Level video game series</a>, and the show's creator reckons its Concord episode - commissioned long before the game's fate was sealed - shows the 'potential of its world and characters'.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/tim-miller-secret-level-prime-video-1235161263/">Rolling Stone</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-ill-fated-concord-animation-shows-potential-of-this-world-and-characters-creator-says">IGN</a>), Secret Level creator Tim Miller - who also directed the first Deadpool movie, and oversaw <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>’s sci-fi anthology series Love, Death &amp; Robots - explained the possibility of removing the Concord episode from Amazon's anthology was never even considered. That's despite Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-unceremoniously-goes-offline-with-an-anticlimactic-error-message">pulling the plug on the live-service game just weeks after launch</a> and its recent decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">shut down Firewalk Studios</a>.
</p>
<p>
"I don't feel bad that it's a part of the show," Miller told Rolling Stone, "because I think it's an episode that turned out really well, and you can kind of see the potential of this world and the characters. If it's the remaining vestige of that product, I hope the developers feel that it's in some way worthy, just a little bit, of the blood, sweat, and tears they put into it."

<p>
"There was no nicer, more invested group of developers than the team on Concord," he added. "I honestly don't understand why it didn't work. I know that they were trying to do the best they could, and they were a talented group of artists, so I feel terrible for that."
</p><p>
And while Miller acknowledged the irony of airing an episode based on a game that no longer exists, he noted it's not a whole lot different to the Secret Level episodes dedicated to long-dormant franchises such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> and Mega Man.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level makes its Prime Video debut on 10th December and consists of 15 episodes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-trailer-for-amazons-secret-level-reveals-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-keanu-reeves">reportedly starring the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Keanu Reeves</a>. Armored Core, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, New World: Aeternum, Pac-Man, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>, Warhammer 40,000, and a number of PlayStation Studios games are also set to feature - with the first batch of episodes covering the mature end of the spectrum, while the latter is more family friendly, according to Miller.

After initially offering special <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246126/nintendo-switch-mario-kart-8-oled-bundle-nintendo-online">holiday bundles of its Switch consoles</a>, Nintendo has also announced <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fnintendo-announces-black-friday-offers-providing-even-more-ways-to-play-this-holiday-season%2F">a Black Friday sale on various games and controllers</a> set to begin November 24th and run through the 30th.</p></div><p>Major Nintendo titles like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, <em>Pikmin 4</em>, <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>, and more will be $20 off at retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart once the sale commences. Additionally, Switch accessories like Joy-Con controllers and Nintendo’s Pro Controller will also be $20 off, along with a slick <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> carrying case getting a $10 discount. </p><p>This is all likely to be the tip of the iceberg, as early Black Friday deals are already beginning and retailers will run sales on further games and hardware come the day-of. But while it’s common for retailers to be aggressive with the sale during Black Friday and Cyber Monday times, we don’t always see Nintendo extending as far-reaching of discounts. Since there’s a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Switch successor</a> poised to drop in the new year, it’s quite possible Nintendo is a little more sales-heavy this season to help retailers clear as much stock as possible before it’s inevitably replaced by updated hardware and accessories.</p><p>While Nintendo recently came forward to clarify that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">the next Switch will be backwards compatible</a> with original Switch games, we don’t yet know if that will include physical cartridge versions. I’m crossing my fingers that the next Switch will maintain a cartridge slot for all my physical games, but the tides have been shifting towards digital distribution for years. It’s just a matter of time until one of the big three console-makers release a new generation based solely around digital titles, and with the Switch successor looming Nintendo could continue the status quo for a bit longer or really upend things.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This all culminates in a romantic scene between protagonist Rook and their paramour, and they’re…mostly fine. I was initially caught a bit off-guard by how tame most of the love scenes are in <em>The Veilguard</em>, until I remembered that this series has rarely been as spicy as its sci-fi sibling, <em>Mass Effect </em>(and even that depends on which game you’re talking about). In <em>Dragon Age II</em>, for instance, you’d get some heavy petting and making out, but it would cut to black before you saw anything that would have to be blurred out on public television. <em>Inquisition</em> had more nudity, but the actual deed still tended to be behind a black screen. But the emotional core of each scene still rings true, and that’s what counts, right?</p><p>All that being said, not all of&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>’s love scenes are made equal, and we’re going to rank all seven of them right here and now. If you haven’t finished the game yet, avert your eyes, because there are spoilers ahead.</p></div></div><div><p>Much like the dwarven rogue (mage now?) herself, Harding’s love scene is very sweet. She tearfully tells Rook that she never gave up on them after their Fade prison, and they both give each other corny lines about being each other’s rock. See, she has stone-based magic. Do you get it? But then the two embrace, kiss, and her magic rumbles under her as she does a little <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PRwR2J5sCU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PRwR2J5sCU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">foot pop</a></span>.</p><p>That’s all well and good, and really fits Harding’s kindhearted demeanor. But where it gets real good is in the pillow talk afterward, when she starts to question if her lover is really the Rook she knew, or maybe a spirit who wandered out of the Fade and became a person. She’s seen this before, and having been present for two world-changing events in the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, she’s got reason to speculate. Before she started this quest to stop the elven gods, she was a simple scout who signed on to help save the world. Now, she’s seen so much of what she knew change before her. Is it really so surprising that she would question whether her true love was even real?</p></div><div><p>Like most of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s sex scenes, Lucanis’ is pretty tame as far as the physical intimacy, but much more memorable for the emotional intimacy that comes after. Lucanis climbs onto Rook and his crow-like wings appear on his back in a fit of passion. The two kiss briefly, then the cursed black screen shows up again. When the deed is done, Lucanis starts to drift to sleep. The reason for his coffee habit is that he tries to stay awake as long as possible, lest his body be overtaken by the Spite demon that inhabits his body. But it’s not about maintaining control of his body, he just doesn’t want to miss a moment with Rook now that they’re back. It’s a lovely touch to an understated scene. Much has been made of Lucanis’ sleeping habits up to this point, and here they’re used to illustrate that his fears, once focused largely on himself, are now more about Rook. It’s an effective way to communicate how profoundly this relationship has changed him in the context of a love scene.</p></div><div><p>I admire Neve Gallus’ commitment to serving at every moment. As she tearfully expresses her relief at Rook’s return, she is working the camera. Her pushing her lover down onto the couch and closing the door with her ice magic? A slay. Queen shit.</p><p>The debrief with Neve is, much like the Tevinter detective herself, pretty straightforward. She’s always been a straight-to-the-point kinda gal, even when it’s clear she’s dealing with so much uncertainty. She says that even as her city is under siege and she doesn’t know if the two of them will have a future, she’s not going to operate on the assumption that the story of her and Rook ends here. Just like a Shadow Dragon, hoping for a better future at every turn. God, I love her.</p></div><div><p>Bellara is the socially awkward one of the group, and her romance scene doubles down on it. Even when she’s with someone she feels comfortable with, when it comes to discussing the big stuff, she’s still unsure of herself and has to bring a notebook with her, full of things she wants to say to Rook after they disappear into the Fade. She repeatedly has to look back at her notes and still can’t find the words, even when they’re written right in front of her. Bellara has lost so much already that she’s afraid to hope for Rook’s return, or to believe that they truly want her as they say they have. But as Rook reassures her and the two embrace, she drops the book at her feet. Sometimes you don’t need a script to express how you feel when you can show it in other ways.</p></div><div><p>By the time Rook and Taash actually get around to “doing it,” there’s been a lot of outward sexual tension. A few flirts into their conversations will prompt the Qunari warrior to pin Rook against a wall and ask how serious they are about getting on the ride, so when things finally reach that point, it’s more catharsis than anything else. Taash is one of the only two characters who undresses at all during their love scene, and watching a Rook of shorter stature straight-up climb Taash is an incredible sight. As Taash struggles with how to articulate their intentions and finds most labels failing them, the two resign to calling each other “Taarala,” the Qunari word for “mine.” Most of Taash’s story has been about them trying to find ways to express how they feel and resorting to a combination of different dialects, languages, and cultures to express them. It’s fitting, then, that when it comes to putting a label on a relationship, they’d pick one that felt right for them, even if it’s not the most traditional.</p></div><div><p>I adore the Emmrich romance scene because, even if it’s not as steamy as some of the others, it is undeniably his. No other character in <em>The Veilguard</em> could have conceivably been a part of this moment. Rather than going at it in Rook’s quarters, Emmrich takes our hero to the Necropolis to run some magical tests. Rook then takes him by the hand and they do the horizontal tango in one of the open coffins.</p><p>When Rook wakes up in the coffin, Emmrich kindly asks if they’d like some breakfast, completely desensitized to the somewhat morbid scene of someone waking up with a post-sex glow in something usually meant as a resting place for the dead. Then they can go for round two. Death is so central to Emmrich’s being that it only makes sense that it would make its way into the bedroom. If he chooses to become a Lich, there are some slight variations as Rook tells him he doesn’t have to hide his new face from them when the two are alone, which adds a new layer of emotional intimacy not found in other relationships. That’s right; if you wanted to bone a skeleton, <em>The Veilguard </em>is here to let you live out that fantasy. </p></div><div><p>Full disclosure, Davrin was my romance in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and I think the elven Warden’s sex scene set me up to be relatively disappointed by most of the others. It’s still pretty PG-13, but it’s definitely one of the more explicit ones. Davrin comforts Rook after their return from the Fade, and unlike in most other scenes, you actually get to see the two undress each other. They share some cheesy banter as Rook mounts Davrin on the couch, then is picked up and laid on their back in the bed. His scene, along with Taash’s, are undeniably the two that get hot and heavy. Like, I’m watching it again and it makes me wonder just why the actual sex in the sex scenes felt underserved in most other romances.</p><p>But even with all that, the emotional come-down after is one of brutal honesty, as Rook wonders if the two’s previous conversation about their future still applies. Davrin is the kind of guy who hears his significant other ask if he’d still love them if they were a worm and says, “Yes, dear,” instead of telling them that’s a stupid question.</p><p>You get to imagine what your future looks like if and when the elven gods are defeated. Is it hanging up your gear for a life of domestic bliss with your bird cat son? Or will the two of you go out and find new adventures facing the monsters of Thedas? Okay, look. I’d planned on putting some other scene above Davrin’s when I started writing this ranking so as not to play favorites, but BioWare cooked here. This is the best one. Sorry. I’m winning. F’s in the chat for the rest of y’all, but my Rook is bouncing on it in a way that would end the Blight.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Activision has lifted the lid on the Call of Duty League 2025 season Operator skins, and they’re… Well, they’re not good. They’re pretty basic and almost nothing seems to have influenced their design beyond basic colour schemes, but at least Boston Breach has a demonic face mask.</p>



<p>The smattering of skins hasn’t impressed COD League fans worldwide, but they’ll of course sell because Call of Duty players love to represent their favourite team in-game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cod-league-skins-confirmed">COD League Skins Confirmed</h2>



<p>All 12 COD League skins have been revealed by Activision, but they’re not very innovative. That’s a surprise considering how inventive teams have been with other Operator skins in Black Ops 6 thus far, and the Season One Battle Pass continues that trend in earnest.</p>



<p>Here are the teams competing in the Call of Duty League 2025 season:</p>



<ul>
<li>Atlanta FaZe</li>



<li>Boston Breach</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Cloud9 New York</li>



<li>LA Guerrillas</li>



<li>LA Thieves</li>



<li>Miami Heretics</li>



<li>Minnesota Rokkr</li>



<li>OpTic Texas</li>



<li>Seattle Surge</li>



<li>Toronto Ultra</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>
</ul>



<p>The design follows the ‘backwards-cap-and-goggles’ aesthetic that has been present in the Call of Duty League skin circle for years. It’s about time something changed, but at least the team branding is on point. </p>



<p>Some of the flashier skins have been reserved for Boston Breach and OpTic Texas, while the LAG and C9 skins have a full-body colour change on deck – everyone else is just wearing a standard black outfit.</p>



<p>Traditionally, teams have very little input in the design of these skins. They can choose colours, the locations of said colours, and usually the design of the central flash that makes up the skin’s core identity, but that’s it. They’re not going to have Rokkr’s skin wearing a horned helmet or have the Royal Ravens’ skin boast a set of wings now, are they?</p>



<p>The COD League skins will be released later in Season One.</p>



<p>Are you going to invest in a COD League 2025 skin? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Here’s How The Black Ops 6 Season One Battle Pass Works]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-battle-pass-how/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-how-the-black-ops-6-season-one-battle-pass-works.1033986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-battle-pass-how/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>From November 14, Black Ops 6 players can invest in the Season One Battle Pass, an optional add-on that’ll reward them with countless boosts and bonuses as they rank up throughout the season. It has changed a little compared to recent years, with Activision’s teams opting for a page-by-page system, as opposed to the ‘tac-map’ system deployed in recent games.</p>



<p>That means unlocking things in the Black Ops 6 Season One Battle Pass works a little differently – but not much.</p>



<p>Read on to learn about this new Battle Pass and how it all works.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-black-ops-6-season-one-battle-pass">How to Get The Black Ops 6 Season One Battle Pass</h2>



<p>If you wait until November 14, the Season One update for Black Ops 6 will be deployed, and the game’s first Battle Pass will come along with it.</p>



<p>Once you’ve secured the update, you can unlock the Season One Battle Pass by parting ways with 1,100 COD Points – either the COD Points that are already in your account, or points that you buy fresh for the Battle Pass. If you’re willing to invest a little more in your game, you can get the ‘Battle Pass Bundle’ for 2,400 COD Points, which includes 20+ Tier Skips.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-the-new-battle-pass-work">How Does The New Battle Pass Work?</h2>



<p>In Black Ops 6, the Battle Pass is like a book, with content such as Double XP Tokens, Free COD Points, weapons, and charms all being spread across 17 pages. As soon as you buy the Battle Pass (or the BlackCell Battle Pass), you’ll blitz through a couple of pages, and then after that, you’ll be working your way through every other reward.</p>



<p>Once you’ve completed every page, you’ll gain access to an exclusive ‘Completion Page’ that houses the season’s most aspirational rewards.</p>



<p>It works like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Earn Battle Pass XP to unlock more Tokens for the Pass</li>



<li>Use these Tokens to unlock rewards on the pages of the Battle Pass in whatever order you want</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s it – if you open a page and see a free camo that you’d like before the charms, loading screen art, or Double XP Tokens, then simply click to secure that camo. If you’ve not invested in a Battle Pass, you’ll still be entitled to a few free rewards in Black Ops 6 – so don’t worry about being left out (you just don’t get access to the Token system). </p>



<p>As you flick through the pages, you’ll regularly unlock ‘HVT Tiers’. These are revealed when you complete a page, and they’re usually more sizeable rewards like a new Operator. If you’re a BlackCell owner, you’ll have the advantage of unlocking pages in a non-linear fashion, which regular Battle Pass owners won’t be able to do.</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I’ll probably spend most of my time in Farming Simulator 25 planting and harvesting crops. I do the same in games like Stardew Valley. Now and then, however, I’ll specialize in a playthrough, focusing on a specific animal type or good. This time, I’m looking forward to the new water buffalo. Here’s a look at all the animals in Farming Simulator 25!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-animal-you-can-raise-in-farming-simulator-25">Every Animal You Can Raise in Farming Simulator 25</h2>



<p>As usual with the franchise, Farming Simulator 25 advances the core gameplay with additional crops and animals you can raise and harvest. In this year’s release, water buffalo and goats act as the newest additions, but we also have baby animals that you’ll spot wandering inside the pens around your farm. They’re cute and allow you to expand your livestock offerings without spending more money on adults, but don’t expect to make too much money off the children until they’re grown.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Animals in Farming Simulator 25</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Bees</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Chickens</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Cows</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Deer</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Dogs</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Goats</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Horses</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Pigs</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sheep</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Water Buffalos</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>I have not acquired any water buffalo on my current farm, but I have a few cows and chickens. I can’t wait to check out the new animals, though!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-the-most-profitable-animal-in-farming-simulator-25">What’s the Most Profitable Animal in Farming Simulator 25?</h2>



<p>If this year’s release is anything like the last entry, pigs will make the most money in Farming Simulator 25. However, you cannot discount water buffalo or goats yet. They’re brand-new, and as we delve deeper into the game, we’ll create a specialized farm focusing on both to discover precisely how much they earn. For now, prioritize pigs. You can earn thousands of dollars daily with a packed pen.</p>



<p>While bees are relaxed and fun to breed, they’re not much of a money-maker. However, it can’t hurt to generalize somewhat, as you can invest in various production chains that utilize components like honey to craft higher-grossing goods.</p>



<p>Which livestock do you intend to prioritize in Farming Simulator 25? Let us know in the comments below, or start discussing the game on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a>!</p>

<p>If you’re on the fence about the latest hardcore farming simulation game, you might be eyeing Game Pass expectantly. But is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/farming-simulator-25-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Farming Simulator 25 coming to Xbox Game Pass</a>?</p>

Given the age of the game, a lot of players were unable to receive theirs.</p><p>"Imagine you buy a pinball machine, and years later, you enter your den to go play it, only to discover that all the paddles are missing, the pinball and bumpers are gone, and the monitor that proudly displayed your unassailable high score is removed," the plaintiffs' lawyers <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/790913960/Crew-Lawsuit-via-Polygon?irclickid=T12QpzWwGxyKUbL2Qm1gnXbPUkCTvDVlRVh%3ATI0&amp;irpid=10078&amp;utm_source=impact&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Scribd_affiliate_pdm_acquisition_Skimbit%20Ltd.&amp;sharedid=vice.com&amp;irgwc=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote in the lawsuit</a> that was uploaded by Polygon.

were duped in two ways: First, by allegedly misleading players into thinking they were buying a game when they were merely licensing it, even if a player bought the physical disk. Second, Ubisoft "falsely represented" that The Crew's files were on those physical disks to access freely, and that the disks weren't simply "a key" for the game. The lawsuit adds that Ubisoft is violating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-think-you-own-your-games-california-law-says-otherwise/1100-6526747/" data-ref-id="1100-6526747">California consumer protection laws</a>.</p><p>This is just another addition to the development of gamers not realizing what they're getting when they're purchasing a game, which is more often than not, the license and not the game itself. That difference is something that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-now-makes-it-clearer-what-youre-really-buying/1100-6527127/" data-ref-id="1100-6527127">platforms like Steam</a> is trying to make more apparent when you buy a digital game. </p><p>Ubisoft declared it shut down its servers after a decade due to "server infrastructure and licensing constraints." Both the 2018 sequel, simply titled The Crew 2, and the latest entry in the franchise, The Crew Motorfest, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-the-crew-was-rendered-unplayable-its-sequels-will-be-preserved/1100-6526400/" data-ref-id="1100-6526400">will remain unaffected</a> after the servers go dark.</p>

Core to these are four specific decks that are dominating in online battles, forming a meta that looks unlikely to shift <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-expansion-event-schedule-leak-1851694729&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-expansion-event-schedule-leak-1851694729">until January’s delivery of a whole new set of cards</a></span>. We’ve put together our best versions of all four decks.</p><p>There’s always a chance that The Pokémon Company might see fit to add some surprise drops to the set, in an attempt to bring in some more balance, or could even tweak the game in response to people’s disappointment with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195">how much it sucks to go first</a></span>. But beyond that, right now, we’re seeing four particular decks getting the most play and the most success.</p><p>It’s fair to say that Mewtwo’s is the deck that’s causing most consternation, given that it really does feel a little too over-powered, although others would argue Charizard’s build is the most dangerous. But all four of these builds are winners, and all capable of taking on each other. So, read on for the strengths, weaknesses, and best ways to play each of these four decks.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="165622e6b7d56ae70b57b1298c51fe29" data-recommend-id="image://165622e6b7d56ae70b57b1298c51fe29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mewtwo ex / Gardevoir." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mewtwo ex / Gardevoir." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="165622e6b7d56ae70b57b1298c51fe29" data-recommend-id="image://165622e6b7d56ae70b57b1298c51fe29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mewtwo ex / Gardevoir." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Every online card game sees a deck develop that has everyone just want to quit. For <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, it’s Mewtwo/Gardevoir. And I <em>love</em> playing it.</p><p>There are so few drawbacks, too. Occasionally you’ll get plain unlucky, and the game will just refuse to give you a Ralts or a Mewtwo, which leaves you with a pile of mediocre cards that’ll fall to any other solid deck. But that happens far less often than you’d think.</p><p>It’s outrageously easy to win with this, to the degree where you start wondering if The Pokémon Company is going to be forced to issue a nerf. If they did, it would make sense to prevent it from attacking two turns in a row. But please don’t, because it’s too fun right now.</p><h3 id="h19137"><a id=""></a><strong>Advantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>All-dominating</li><li>Hard to mess up</li><li>Hard to counter</li></ul><h3 id="h19138"><a id=""></a><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Can be tricky to evolve Gardevoir</li><li>People quitting on you</li></ul><h3 id="h19139"><a id=""></a><strong>Cards</strong></h3><p>The essential cards for this deck are two of Ralts, Kirlia, and Gardevoir, and at least one Mewtwo ex. I’ve not been fortunate enough to pull a second of those, so back it up with a standard Mewtwo that lacks the two-energy 50 damage attack but otherwise works the same. Then, you’re going to want two Poké Balls, two Professor’s Research, and at least one X Speed. After that, you can experiment. My setup is:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Jynx x2</li><li>Ralts x2</li><li>Kirlia x2</li><li>Gardevoir x2</li><li>Clefairy</li><li>Clefable</li><li>Mewtwo ex</li><li>Mewtwo</li><li>Potion x2</li><li>X Speed x2</li><li>Poké Ball x2</li><li>Professor’s Research x2</li></ul><h3 id="h19140"><a id=""></a><strong>How to play the deck</strong></h3><p>The trick here is that Mewtwo ex (and even the regular Mewtwo) has a devastating 150 attack, which the game attempts to temper by having you require four energy to use it and discard two of them every time you do. Except, along comes Gardevoir, evolved from Ralts and Kirlia, with the Ability to add an energy to your Active Pokémon every turn. That means, along with the energy you get per turn anyway, you can replenish back up to four every single turn. It’s unrelenting.</p><p>The two key things are to get Mewtwo in the Active Spot and Gardevoir evolved. So, you want Ralts on deck ASAP, and then put Jynx or Clefairy into play from the start. They can absorb early attacks while you prime Mewtwo with energy and get Ralts into Kirlia, then Kirlia into Gardevoir. When the cards fall right, this can happen in just two turns. Otherwise, hold your nerve, let your starting card take a dive if you need to, and then put Mewtwo in when you’re ready.</p><p>The Professor’s Research and Poké Ball cards should help you get any missing Pokémon out of the deck, and it’s worth having those X Speeds so you can pull out Jynx or Clefairy for free when you’re ready to move in Mewtwo—otherwise you’ll end up an energy behind, spent on the retreat cost. Then, blast, replenish, blast, replenish, and your opponent is likely going to be dependent upon unlikely coin flips to outdo it.</p><p>If anything, the main failing with this deck is that when people see you setting it up, they concede before you even get going. They lack spirit. Although, it’s hard to blame them, given there’s very little that can stand up to it.</p><p>I think, eventually, people are going to start countering with decks featuring Aerodactyl, given every attack has a 50 percent chance of the opponent having to shuffle their Active Pokémon into their deck. That’d be a devastating blow against Mewtwo, so shhhh, don’t tell anyone else.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a6b8fa62fd678837ac99dee96a45b12" data-recommend-id="image://8a6b8fa62fd678837ac99dee96a45b12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charizard ex / Moltres ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charizard ex / Moltres ex." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a6b8fa62fd678837ac99dee96a45b12" data-recommend-id="image://8a6b8fa62fd678837ac99dee96a45b12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charizard ex / Moltres ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Depending on your vantage point, there are those who would argue it’s Charizard that may have a slight edge on every other deck out there at the moment. While it takes some time to get online, and once again relies on coin-flip energy accrual, the ex variant of Charizard guarantees a one-hit kill on everything, and can start attacking as early as three energy. It’s also just a lot of fun for any old Pokéheads out there for whom a holographic Charizard was the de facto all-star of the trading card game’s early years.</p><h3 id="h19141"><a id=""></a><strong>Advantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Strongest attack in the game</li><li>Simple strategy</li><li>Edges out every other ex card in an equal race</li></ul><h3 id="h19142"><a id=""></a><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Takes a while to come online</li><li>At the mercy of Moltres Inferno Dance coin flips</li></ul><h3 id="h19143"><a id=""></a><strong>Cards</strong></h3><p>There are two options for the Charizard ex deck. One is to focus just on Charizard and Moltres and fill up on items to insulate you in the early game. The other is to swap in Ponyta and Rapidash for Red Cards and Sabrina to give you more flexibility and early game options.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Charizard ex x2</li><li>Charmeleon x2</li><li>Charmander x2</li><li>Moltres ex x2</li><li>Potion x2</li><li>X Speed x2</li><li>Poké Ball x2</li><li>Professor’s Research x2</li><li>Sabrina x2</li><li>Red Card x2</li></ul><h3 id="h19144"><a id=""></a><strong>How to play the deck</strong></h3><p>The number one goal is to get Moltres ex out as soon as possible, with a Charmander on the bench, and start loading the latter up with fire energy. From there, all you need is to evolve it to Charizard in a timely manner and start unloading Crimson Storm attacks for 200 damage each.</p><p>If you don’t luck out with the coin tosses, or it’s taking longer than desired to get Charizard up and running, your best bet is buying time with item cards and making sure Charizard has at least five energy before bringing him out to fight. That way, he can use back-to-back Crimson Storms. And at 180 HP, it’s very likely he’ll be able to at least get both off before getting killed.</p><p>Red Cards and Sabrinas, meanwhile, should help you disrupt your opponent’s flow to buy you time to bring Charizard online and prevent them  getting a Starmie ex, Mewtoo ex, or Pikachu ex into position and loaded up with energy first. An extra 10 damage from Giovanni will be useless in most cases, which is why that card isn’t in the deck.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ad1a1e21b60bc67365b564e63c36e5c3" data-recommend-id="image://ad1a1e21b60bc67365b564e63c36e5c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Starmie ex / Articuno ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Starmie ex / Articuno ex." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ad1a1e21b60bc67365b564e63c36e5c3" data-recommend-id="image://ad1a1e21b60bc67365b564e63c36e5c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Starmie ex / Articuno ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s one deck that’s received more prominence than any other, and that’s Lapras and Starmie. Star of the game’s first big event, it’s the deck absolutely everyone’s been battling in order to win those Lapras ex cards to start building their own. <em>Don’t use it</em>. There’s a better variant.</p><p>That’s not least because the Lapras version is also the deck absolutely everyone’s learned how to beat. The real star here is Starmie, teamed up with Articuno ex and the mercurial Misty, for a risky deck that dishes big damage</p><h3 id="h19145"><a id=""></a><strong>Advantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Low-cost, powerful attacks</li><li>Very quick to set up</li><li>Devastating to Fire decks like Charizard</li></ul><h3 id="h19146"><a id=""></a><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Misty is unreliable for energy</li><li>Weak to Electric decks</li><li>Needs a fast setup to work</li></ul><h3 id="h19147"><a id=""></a><strong>Cards</strong></h3><p>There’s less room for improvisation here, given that there’s really no better back-up choice than Psyduck and Golduck, and the deck absolutely depends on both Misty and the cards to pull Pokémon from your deck. Articuno ex is your best second-runner to Starmie, too, as alternatives like Blastoise would require a three-step evolution and take over the deck.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Staryu x2</li><li>Starmie ex x2</li><li>Articuno ex x2</li><li>Psyduck x2</li><li>Golduck x2</li><li>Potion x2</li><li>Red Card x2</li><li>Poké Ball x2</li><li>Professor’s Research x2</li><li>Misty x2</li></ul><h3 id="h19148"><a id=""></a><strong>How to play the deck</strong></h3><p>The key here is speed. This is all about getting Starmie ex in play before your opponent has had a chance to get their deck rolling. The brutal Mewtwo/Gardevoir deck is tough to beat, but a lot easier if you’re already taking chunks out of your opponent while Mewtwo is still tying his shoes.</p><p>The ideal situation is getting Staryu in the Active Spot before the game even starts, then evolving as quickly as possible, which is why you need two of each to improve the odds of this working. If Staryu is AWOL, putting Psyduck in is an excellent delay, as while its one-energy hit only does a paltry 10 damage, it also prevents the other player from using any Supporter cards on their next turn, and that means they can’t use Professor’s Research to dig out cards they need from their deck. It also blocks all the specialist supporters, like Blaine, Koga, Lt. Surge, and Brock from helping get Pokémon ready, and indeed the infuriating Sabrine from making you swap out your active Pokémon.</p><p>Once you’ve got Starmie ex evolved, you’re flying. You can now do 90 damage a turn, for just two energy. That’s not the 200 a Charizard ex can deliver (although it’d be 110 against Charizard thanks to its weakness!), but the idea here is to be dishing out those 90s to Charmander and Charmeleon before the ‘Zard has ever evolved. Also, Starmie ex has no retreat cost, so you can pull it when it’s getting weak, preventing the opponent taking those two points, and you don’t need to waste space in your deck with X Speeds. (Other setups for this deck keep the X Speed cards in, but we’ve subbed them for hand-wrecking Red Cards, because it’s such an excellent dick move to annoy your opponent.)</p><p>Articuno ex is there to sub in, in case Starmie is a no-show or is weakening. It’s a poorer option—doing 80 damage for three energy, with the bonus of a further 10 to opposing benched Pokémon—but it’s a Basic card, requiring no evolution, and its 140 HP will hold off enemies for a while. It’s really for Articuno that you want Misty in your deck, as should the coin-flips fall your way, you could get it loaded with energy to fight on turn 2.</p><p>Hopefully, when the cards fall your way, this means you can demolish your opponent long before they’re ready to fight back.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8eab2935ae4815c4a1064ba057adb1c2" data-recommend-id="image://8eab2935ae4815c4a1064ba057adb1c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pikachu ex / Zapdos ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pikachu ex / Zapdos ex." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8eab2935ae4815c4a1064ba057adb1c2" data-recommend-id="image://8eab2935ae4815c4a1064ba057adb1c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pikachu ex / Zapdos ex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Pikachu ex is another straightforward deck to play, but unlike Charizard ex it goes a lot faster. While Zapdos ex can’t quickly fill up the energy reserves of your bench, you don’t need it too, since most cards in this deck only require two electric energy to be off to the races. The goal is to move fast and break things with Voltorb and Electrode before later retreating at no cost, thanks to the latter’s built-in speed X perk.</p><p>Pikachu ex and Zapdos ex then provide the heavy hits, with advantages against other legendary birds and water decks. And because of the low retreat costs, you should be able to rotate your bench aggressively and snag kills without losing anyone in return. And unless you’re getting lucky with Zapdos’ Thundering Hurricane coin flips, you’ll need to be retreating since most attacks in this deck aren’t hitting for over 100 damage.</p><h3 id="h19149"><a id=""></a><strong>Advantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Comes online fast</li><li>Very efficient</li><li>Lots of maneuverability</li></ul><h3 id="h19150"><a id=""></a><strong>Disadvantages</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Lower ceiling on single-turn damage output</li><li>Must utilize electric Pokémon to maximize Pikachu ex’s Circle Circuit effectiveness</li><li>Weak to water decks</li></ul><h3 id="h19151"><a id=""></a><strong>Cards</strong></h3><p>While Pikachu ex and Zapdos ex take time and luck to acquire, even newer players will quickly be swimming in Voltorb and Electrode. There’s also a lot of versatility outside of the two stars, with options for variants that mix in Raichu, Zebstrika, and Magneton. Lt. Surge is a must for Raichu and Magneton builds, since he makes it easy to quickly reroute energy from retreating Pokémon to those on the bench taking their place.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Pikachu ex x2</li><li>Zapdos ex x2</li><li>Electrode x2</li><li>Voltorb ex x2</li><li>Potion x2</li><li>X Speed x2</li><li>Poké Ball x2</li><li>Professor’s Research x2</li><li>Sabrina x2</li><li>Red Card x2</li><li>Giovanni x2</li></ul><h3 id="h19152"><a id=""></a><strong>How to play the deck</strong></h3><p>The name of the game with Pikachu ex is speed. You want to hit the ground running, filling up your bench with electric Pokémon—though always saving an open spot for Pikachu ex if it hasn’t already been deployed. Voltorb is a great starting Pokémon because its Electrode evolution does a guaranteed 70 damage for just two energy, and it can retreat at no cost anytime, leaving room to bring Pikachu ex or Zapdos ex out and start wreaking havoc.</p><p>A mix of Giovanni and Potion can help you get a pick off early without giving any ground, while Red Card and Sabrina hopefully scramble your opponent before they can get a Mewtoo, Charizard, or other heavy-hitters that will kill your Pikachu ex or Zapdos ex in one hit.</p><p>If your opponent is able to establish that foothold, this deck will struggle to wrest back control of the board. That’s why it’s all about dictating the pace of the match early, and finishing things before one of those decks can come online.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As with every new entry in the Farming Simulator franchise, this year’s launch, Farming Simulator 25, includes a rather large selection of new and returning crops that give virtual farmers a chance to sow their seed and make some money in a cutthroat industry. Of course, you won’t plant everything, at least not all at once, so knowing your options beforehand gives you time to plan your harvest for the foreseeable future. Here’s a look at all of the crops in Farming Simulator 25!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-crop-available-to-you-in-farming-simulator-25">Every Crop Available to You in Farming Simulator 25</h2>



<p>When you kick off your farming adventure in Farming Simulator 25, following along with the tutorial will teach you the basics of preparing fields, planting, and harvesting crops. You’ll start slow and simple with canola and wheat. But as you better grasp the gameplay mechanics, you’ll expand your harvest to include potatoes, sugarcane, beans, and so much more! It’s a lot to learn, especially for newcomers to the series.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Farming Simulator 25 Crops</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Wheat</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Barley</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Canola</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Oat</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sorghum</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Corn</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sunflowers</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Soybeans</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Potatoes</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sugar Beet</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Sugarcane</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Cotton</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Grapes</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Olives</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Grass</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Red Beet</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Carrots</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Parsnips</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Green Beans</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Peas</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Spinach</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Long Grain Rice</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Rice</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>Alongside these crops, you can also plant, grow, and harvest Grass, Hay, and Straw. You’ll find uses for everything in the game, as nothing goes to waste here. Every crop and item in the game serves a purpose: improving crop yield, feeding livestock, selling wholesale, or being a component in one of the many production chains.</p>



<p>What’s your favorite crop in Farming Simulator? I think I’ll specialize in my first playthrough and focus on rice.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-designer-dishes-on-environmental-destruction-and-hero-synergy-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>[Editor's note: Thank you to the team at IGN China for conducting this interview. It has been translated into English.]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to reflecting the characteristics of "Marvel Heroes" in-game and making Marvel Rivals stand out among other hero-based PvP games on the market, recreating their signature appearances and actions are of course important, but so is coming up with recognizable features in terms of both gameplay and character characteristics, as this is what will leave a deep impression on players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Environmental destruction and hero team-ups are two very prominent features of Marvel Rivals at the system level. Although their focus is different, at their core, they are both meant to represent the unique presence and abilities of "Marvel Heroes." If heroes canonically capable of destroying entire worlds can't even break a wall in-game, or if "ride or die" partners like Rocket Raccoon and Groot have no interactions with each other, it would create a sense of disharmony within the game and leave players with the impression that the creators do not understand Marvel heroes, let alone the Marvel universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN China was recently invited to interview Zhiyong, the lead combat designer of the Marvel Rivals team, and we asked him to introduce a lot of settings and information related to environmental destruction and hero team-ups, which he believes will help players better understand and become immersed in the game's content and atmosphere.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel Rivals - Team-Up Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How different would the game be with and without destructible environments?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: The difference is very significant. As a game built around superhero battles, our goal in adding destruction effects is to showcase just how powerful they are beyond the conventional sound effects, special effects, and actions. This is the most basic design expectation for this feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But beyond that, we hope to use it to introduce dynamic changes within maps, such as knocking down a high platform to hinder enemy snipers, or creating a whole new path for a sneak attack. These effects all have the potential to turn the tide in battle. This helps ensure no two battles are alike even on the same map, which is the second level of consideration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, we will also integrate themed environmental destruction into different maps. For example, in Yggsgard, some broken things can be restored, and the transition between destruction and restoration will bring new variables to players' strategies. Another example is the Tokyo 2099 map, where even if players destroy walls and pillars, part of the roof will still be suspended by spider webs. This kind of aerial cover can also lead to changes in tactics and operations. These are our basic expectations regarding the design of destructible environments. Their presence is sure to make a large difference in gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: During our hands-on experience, we noticed that the total area of the destructible environment and the locations of objects that can be destroyed, such as platforms and potential passages, are often fixed. Do you anticipate players seeing the destruction effects as fixed parts of the map after playing several rounds, and thus not feeling there is anything special about them?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: Indeed, we did not make the scene completely destructible. This is because certain static features, such as obstacles, key firing line-blocking structures, and crucial points of cover, are the glue that holds the map together. If these are completely removed, the map's design will lose its meaning. All the destruction effects are designed on this basis. But despite this, we've still managed to include a high proportion of destructible elements in each map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During battle, players can quickly see which areas can and can't be destroyed by pressing B. This is introduced through and integrated into the setting through "Chrono Vision," making it more than a feature simply added out of thin air.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While ensuring there are enough destructible parts of the environment to feel satisfying, we've still ensured that it's sufficiently difficult to completely tear down the map. For example, a single round on a Domination map may only take about four minutes, but if it's a Convoy or Convergence map, a single non-Competitive round may take eight to ten minutes. Players need to fight and carry forward at the same time. If you don't deliberately tear down a building, it's really difficult to take into account all the destruction points. In this way, there will be a more obvious difference between each round.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Do all the abilities of all heroes have the ability to destroy the environment, or do only some of the abilities of some heroes have this ability?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: All the abilities of all heroes have the ability to destroy scenes. In fact, each ability in the game has two types of damage: damage to characters (the more conventional type of damage), and damage to destructible buildings and objects. Each character's abilities have both attributes, with only a few exceptions, such as some control abilities that specifically target heroes and may have no effect on buildings. Most abilities do have a destructive effect, though. For example, Hulk's fists can break walls, as can Rocket Raccoon's machine gun when he shoots specific locations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Over the past two days, I've experienced three new heroes, such as Moon Knight with his darts. These darts may look too small to do any real damage, yet they too are capable of breaking down buildings. What is the standard for configuring destructive power?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: To a certain extent, a building is treated like a "character" with a certain HP value, such as 500 HP or 1,000 HP. When a hero uses their abilities on it, part of the building's HP will be deducted, and once its HP is depleted, the building will be destroyed. We do indeed adapt the destructiveness of different abilities according to their power.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the most important thing for us is certain buildings collapsing after the battle reaches a certain stage or has progressed for a certain length of time, as it plays into a match's flow. In order to control this rhythm, we will reverse the calculation based on damage data. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, we expect that at a certain location and under normal circumstances, two players who have engaged in one to two waves of combat will switch between offense and defense. Either a certain foothold will be shot down, or a car will be occupied, etc. Then, the fight will progress to the next location. Based on such a rhythm expectation, we will reverse the calculation of the approximate amount of damage that can be caused. With this sort of basic scale, we can infer how much destructive power each hero's abilities should have, and there is a complete set of formulas and logic behind it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: For example, characters like Spider-Man and Venom rely heavily on pulling themselves up to high places for maneuvering or attacking, so they may struggle once a high-rise building is destroyed.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: Exactly. This is, to a certain extent, the concrete manifestation of the changes we hope scene destruction will bring to the battle. Including buildings, platforms, cover, and other elements will affect players' strategies and how they choose to advance through the map.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Here are some questions about hero team-up abilities: First of all, I'd like to ask whether this feature will be designed and developed based around existing teams of heroes in the original comics, or whether there will be some original team-ups?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: We actually have both kinds. For example, the combination of Groot and Rocket Raccoon is directly lifted from classic scenes in the MCU and comics, while Hulk enhancing Iron Man and Doctor Strange with his Gamma Boost is more of along the lines of our exploration of the possibility of interactions between heroes and their abilities. In addition, Venom's enhancement effect on Peni Parker and Spider-Man is also our original creation to a certain extent. In the game, Venom can separate part of the symbiote from his body and give it to his teammates, thereby enhancing the abilities of Peni Parker and Spider-Man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: In addition to enhancing an ability's power or expanding its range, are there some special or unique team-up abilities?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: There are many types of team-up abilities. For example, the group of Hulk, Iron Man, and Doctor Strange mentioned earlier provides an enhancement to the heroes' existing abilities, without changing their form. But the team-up of Magneto and Scarlet Witch essentially grants Magneto a new long-ranged ability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team-up group of Venom, Peni Parker, and Spider-Man I mentioned earlier is also one that adds new abilities. There are also some special team-up abilities in our game, such as Hela, Loki, and Thor. Hela is the queen of Hel, and based on that concept and thorough exploration, she was designed with the ability to revive Loki and Thor, which is completely out of the scope of numerical enhancement or expansion of the three characters' original abilities.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: After several rounds of large-scale close testing, have you made any new discoveries when it comes to balancing these team-up abilities? For example, were there any team-up effects that you originally thought to be unpopular but turned out to be used by many players?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: Overall, it is generally within our expectations, but the strength of some combinations may be slightly over-tuned. For example, the team-up combination of Magneto and Scarlet Witch is indeed quite direct, and many players can use it easily. It has a high floor as well, making it relatively powerful in both ranked and competitive situations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also "Easter egg"-type combinations like Rocket Raccoon and Groot. It's not particularly powerful, but players actually like it very much. Maybe it's because this combination and being able to fight while riding Groot is just fun in and of itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The preferences and tendencies of players are generally within our expectations, but some team-up effects that fall under personal preferences have become popular, which is indeed slightly beyond our expectations.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You're likely continuing to observe the effects and usage frequency of these team-up abilities to make balance adjustments, right?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: Absolutely. This continues to be a focus of ours. In addition, we will continue to introduce new characters, and with new characters comes new team-up abilities. At the same time, we have previously announced that there will be a concept of dynamic team-up in the game. Simply put, this "dynamic team-up" will make introduce adjustments to some team-up combinations on a seasonal basis. Of course, the ultimate goal is to introduce more variety to the team-up combinations and keep things fresh, as team-ups are a crucial part of our lineup diversity. Thus, we put it in a larger dimension for overall consideration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: If a player encounters a team without any hero team-up abilities when queuing up solo, will there be a big gap in overall strength compared to teams with team-up abilities?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: We have actually considered this issue very carefully and have plans to avoid such situations. First of all, the existing team-up framework generally includes a combination of two to three heroes, but we do not require that all three heroes must be present to activate the enhancement effect. For example, if a team includes only Hela and Thor, those two players can still activate the resurrection ability. Smaller unit design is obviously conducive to the triggering of team-up effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition, there is a concept called "team-up core" in the game. Some characters, which account for about one-third of the roster, can enjoy some special effect enhancements throughout the season. Even if the hero team-up is not activated—for example, if I choose Hela but no one in the team chooses Thor or Loki, Hela will still enjoy the season gain effect as a "team-up core" character, which guarantees the strength of the character to a certain extent.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Under this premise, only in extreme and rare cases in which players deliberately choose to do so would a team of six players wants to choose a combination that ha s neither the buffed "team-up core" nor any team-up combinations. Based on the aforementioned design, generally speaking, teams with team-up effects are competing against each other. In addition, looking at our data from many rounds of testing, there were almost no teams that lacked any sort of team-up effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, from the experience of our developers—because we almost always play ranked—through our own observations in the ranking environment, players are gradually getting used to the team-up system. When I choose Scarlet Witch, my teammates will naturally choose Magneto to cooperate with me. When I choose Iron Man, there is a high probability that my teammates will choose Hulk, or when they see me choose Hulk, my teammates will select Doctor Strange, etc. This situation is becoming more and more common.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After all, most players will not limit themselves to just one hero. Rather, they will be good at at least three or four characters in different roles. As long as they reach this level, they will certainly have the know-how needed to cooperate with teammates to activate team-up effects, even when matching with strangers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Are there more active effects or passive effects in hero team-up skills?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: Generally speaking, there are more active abilities. If a character's inherent abilities are more complex, however, we may tend to use passive methods to trigger the team-up effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: If it's an active ability though, you may need to tell the player how to use it and what effects it has.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: Indeed. Our current tutorial is not quite complete, but we are already working on a new tutorial program. In it, we will select some heroes and explain how to trigger and use team-up effects through the hero's introduction. Of course, we also hope to continue making additions to our beginner tutorial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the perspective of regular battles in the game, after an active team-up ability is activated, an animation will play. Generally speaking, it will be bound to a certain key/button, prompting the player to actively use it. There is no key/button prompt for passive types, such as Hela and Thor, which directly prompt resurrection.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is the ultimate development goal of the hero team-up system to allow any hero to have a team-up effect with any other character?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zhiyong: Frankly speaking, we don't want just any hero, or any two heroes, to be able to activate team-up abilities, as this would make the game overly complicated. After all, this is not a card game—players do not have an overview of the entire match available at all times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our players are more like six individuals joining forces to defeat their six opponents. They need to communicate and cooperate with each other. Therefore, we should not make the hero team-up design too complex. In principle, we should try to keep it to the current two to three heroes in a group, with a dozen or so team-ups available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the continuous addition of new characters, we will also introduce new team-up abilities, and the old team-ups will also be changed and adjusted to adapt to the new meta. But in general, we still want to continue exploring in this direction. In doing so, we can better help players to learn and master various character combinations, and the overall context will appear clearer.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It sees a small blacksmith's hammer appear between Geralt's ankles and stay there perpetually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1goiiut/i_got_infected_by_the_sledgehammer_bug_is_it/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Idratherhikeout</a> brought it to fans' attention once again this week when they posted an image of Geralt with the infamous hammer. "I got infected by the sledgehammer bug," they said. "Is it still not fixable?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I am playing Witcher 3 for the Nth time and I now have a sledgehammer between my legs," they continued. "It’s always there. Walking. Under roach. Under me swimming. Weirdly it switched to Uma during their scenes at Kaer Morhen. Any known fix?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The short answer is no. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-entering-full-production-very-soon">CD Projekt is now deep in development on the next Witcher game</a> so has long since moved on from The Witcher 3, and told IGN there are no plans to address the hammer bug. Some infected players have allegedly found success by shifting back a few saves and deleting all the infected ones, but there's no guaranteed fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every player who does come across the bug seemingly spawns a few dozen who simply find it hilarious though. "Why is this so funny," said one user in the comments. "I quite enjoy this," said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes despite the hammer bug being around for years. "Help. Why is there a hammer under Geralt?" asked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1dsiv76/help_why_is_there_a_hammer_under_geralt_its_been/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zelter7</a> in July. "What the hell is this hammer doing between his legs.

"There is a constant floating hammer between my Geralt's feet," said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/73bmwt/help_there_is_a_constant_floating_hammer_between/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Divexz</a> in 2017.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was even there at launch, evidenced by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/38iqah/whats_the_floating_hammer_under_geralt/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tgat's</a> post on June 4, 2015, barely two weeks after The Witcher 3 launched. "What's the floating hammer under Geralt?" they asked, innocently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, for a couple game hours now I haven't been able to figure out what this thing is. It looks like a small sledgehammer or blacksmiths hammer and its standing upright on the ground between Geralt's legs, and it moves with him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Even in cutscenes, it'll be in the shot, but not under Geralt, it's always where he eventually ends up. So it seems like some sort of character mark. Anyone have any idea?" But no one did then, and no one does now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This little bug has thankfully not impacted the overall reception of The Witcher 3, which has otherwise gone down as one of the most beloved video games of all time.

			<p>Embark Studios has finally shared the debut gameplay trailer for ARC Raiders. The game was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2021 as a free-to-play cooperative shooter. However, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-the-latest-game-to-be-delayed-to-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> several delays that led Embark to <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-discovery-team-fps-embark-studios-first-game-before-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focus</a> on The Finals (formerly known as Project Discovery), their competitive shooter, first.</p>
<p>In May 2023, the developer finally re-<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> ARC Raiders as a third-person PvPvE extraction shooter, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-pc-playtesting-begins-this-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playtesting</a> took place last month. Today, Executive Producer Aleksander Grøndal said about the playtest:</p>
<p><em>This was a really encouraging playtest for us. We now have lots of data and feedback to sift through. We know that players appreciate the atmosphere of the world we've created and the immersion we bring to the table. We also know there's a lot we can do to continue to optimize and balance the experience. We're keen to deliver on a much expanded late-game experience, with deeper progression and extensive quests that take players across new locations, as well as a larger variety of ARC machines and other world-encounters.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="ARC Raiders | Gameplay Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OpCooWm-PDs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In ARC Raiders, players scavenge the surface of the world for vital supplies and materials through quests and raids assigned by the merchants of Speranza. While scavenging the surface, they will encounter enemy ARC machines and other raiders competing for resources.</p>
<p>Engaging in firefights may be the only way out of a tight spot, but it's also risky. Sometimes, being cautious and staying out of sight is a better option to stay alive. To keep the hard-earned loot, players must reach extraction points and risk being ambushed. Success means getting their hands on vital materials for crafting and upgrading, or items to sell to the merchants for currency.</p>
<p>According to the developers, ARC Raiders mixes high-intensity, time-sensitive extraction challenges on the surface with strategic survival elements underground, where progress is closely tied to the player's workshop. Building and upgrading various crafting stations allows users to craft new equipment, such as advanced weapon mods or unique gadgets.</p>
<p>The merchants in Speranza will give quests in exchange for extra currency and experience, as well as the occasional item. The vendors offer different items and equipment, depending on their specialty. Players may also spend experience in a skill tree to customize their playstyle.</p>
<p>ARC Raiders will be released next year on PC (Steam and Epic Games Store, with support for NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
