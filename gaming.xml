			<p><strong>Build a Rocket Boy</strong>, the studio behind the biggest flop and the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/2025/metascore/?page=19">worst-reviewed game of 2025</a>, <strong>MindsEye</strong>, is still chipping away at fixing and improving the game that was the butt of its fair share of jokes last year. The game's latest update, <strong>Update 7</strong>, is "<em>a big step forward</em>" for both the game and the studio, according to <strong>Mark Gerhard</strong>, chief executive and chief technical officer at Build a Rocket Boy.</p>



<p>The new update focuses on improvements to "<em>campaign flow, making objectives easier to follow, and continuing to refine AI behavior</em>," the patch notes on the <a href="https://support.mindseye.game/hc/en-gb/articles/41491756760205-Update-7">game's official website reads</a>. The tangible effects of that statement include more objective markers and viewpoint locations in certain missions, changes to mission design, like removing an "<em>unfair</em>" failure condition in one mission and increasing a character's health in others for a more balanced experience.</p>



<p>Gerhard also confirmed that the studio is working on new content for the game, but it feels like that might be putting the cart before the horse, since Build a Rocket Boy has to get MindsEye to a more playable, acceptable state before it can get players excited about new content.</p>



<p>"<em>Update 7 is <strong>a big step forward for MindsEye, and our studio</strong>,</em>" Gerhard said in a press release. "<em>I want to thank everyone who's been playing and sharing feedback, and our dedicated team who have worked incredibly hard to continue to delight our community. We've listened, we've moved quickly, and we're continuing to refine performance, make continuous improvements, and deliver substantial combat and gameplay enhancements.</em> <strong><em>New content is in</em> <em>development</em></strong><em>, and we're committed to steady, meaningful progress. Our core focus remains on delivering the MindsEye experience we always envisioned and the one our players deserve</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Even before MindsEye launched last year, there was reason to suspect things weren't going well at Build a Rocket Boy. <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">Two of the studio's chief executives left the company,</a> just two weeks before the game was due to come out. Prior to those departures, <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">early previews of the game had been very negative</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">physical copies of the game getting out in the wild early, without a day-one patch</a>, fueled many of the memes that came out of the game.</p>



<p>Not that those meme creators needed the unpatched version to harp on the game. Even after its day-one patch, the game was in such poor shape that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">PlayStation offered players refunds</a></strong>, and the studio said it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">"<em>heartbroken</em>"</a> with how the game's launch had gone. </p>



<p>Following the poor launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">the studio suffered <strong>mass layoffs</strong>,</a> while founder and<a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-ceo-blames-saboteurs-mindseye-struggles/"> former <strong>Rockstar</strong> producer, <strong>Leslie Benzies</strong>, blamed internal and external "<em>saboteurs</em>"</a> for the game's poor state. Developers at Build a Rocket Boy, however, lay the game and the studio's issues <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developers-call-out-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-build-a-rocket-boy/">at the feet of Benzies, Gerhard, and the rest of the management team</a>, with an open letter calling out Benzies for his poor management and behaviour. </p>



<p>Shortly after the open letter was published, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-report-details-how-leslie-benzies-leadership-failed-staff/">a report from the BBC revealed more about the studio's internal issues,</a> which, once again, pointed to Benzies, Gerhard, and the rest of the studio's leadership as the source of the problems. Most recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-said-to-have-ended-publishing-deal-with-io-interactive-after-last-years-mindseye-bomb/">a report from last month pointed to Build a Rocket Boy and <strong>IO Interactive</strong> ending their publishing deal,</a> with Build a Rocket Boy said to be the one choosing to end the deal so it could have more control over it and MindsEye's future.</p>



<p>If Build a Rocket Boy is able to fix MindsEye and deliver a game truly worth experiencing, then that'll be one of the greatest comebacks in video game history. But it'll take a lot more than just a bunch of bug fixing to get there. For all its technical faults at launch, underneath the bugs, <strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong> was always a world-class RPG. MindsEye didn't get a <strong>37</strong> on Metacritic just because it was broken on release. Even when it was working, players still called out its flawed gameplay, design, and narrative.</p>



<p>If Build a Rocket Boy is able to redeem the game, that redemption won't come without significant changes. It may even be an entirely different game by that point, if Build a Rocket Boy is able to get there.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Season 2 Review: Give Us More Episodes Or Stop Adding Subplots]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-two-review-amazon-more-episodes-bethesda-new-vegas-2000665533</link>
            <guid>1425532</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finale-teases-new-location-and-something-big-liberty-prime-colorado-2000665525"><em>Fallout’</em>s second season</a> on Amazon was bigger, that’s for sure. But was it better? Well, I’m not as sure about that. It depends on how you define “better.” At the very least, there was a lot happening.</p> <p>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-1-free-to-watch-youtube-prime-2000664098">first season of Amazon’s live-action adaptation</a> of Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> franchise had plenty of moving parts, too, but for the most part, it was focused on our three main characters—The Ghoul, Lucy, and Maximus—venturing out into the wasteland in search of answers. Their stories intersected as we learned more about the Ghoul’s connections to the past. By the end of that season, our characters had grown, learned some things, and it felt like the show had reached a satisfying and logical stopping point for this chapter of the story while still teasing what was to come next. In other words, a good season of a TV show. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finale-margot-enclave-cooper-janey-2000665411"><em>Fallout’s</em> second season</a> was a lot more complicated and a lot less satisfying. In other words, not a great season of TV.</p> <h2><em>Fallout</em> Season Two Is Overstuffed With Subplots</h2> <p>Many, many, <em>many</em> different plot points and ideas were tossed at the wall this season, and while some of them got an ample amount of screen time, like the Ghoul’s past encounters with Mr. House and the Cold Fusion capsule, plenty of other storylines didn’t. Here’s a Super Mutant. He knows stuff about the Encalve. That’s cool, right? Okay, well, that’s all you get, and it won’t factor into any part of the rest of the season. Worse, some ideas did get decent screen time, but I’m not sure why. We spent a lot of time tracking the growth of a snack group in Lucy’s old vault, and I thought it was building up to some big clash or change. Nope. Or if that did happen, we’ll have to wait until season three to see it.</p>

 <p>Maybe the worst example of <em>Fallout</em> season two wasting time is the subplot involving Lucy’s brother, Norm. At the end of the first season, he was stuck in a vault filled with frozen Vault-Tec employees who were supposed to be woken up every so often to help lead. He ends up freeing them all and pretending to be part of the company. They help him escape, and he manipulates them and lies to lead them outside in search of his sister and answers about what Vault-Tec’s grander plans are for his home. And then…they all discover he’s lying, he gets knocked out twice, and eventually rad roaches kill all of them except Norm and one woman from the group who was sympathetic to him.</p> <p>Okay. Um…what was that all about? I was excited to see Norm using manipulation and deceit to survive in the wasteland, unlike his sister, who stayed (mostly) nice and honest. And the idea of Norm leading a group of people on the surface sounded like a great way to give his character more to do. Instead, the group is killed, and now he’s heading back to the Vault with a woman he liked. He did learn about the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV), which will likely play a role in season three, but beyond that, this whole side quest didn’t work for me.</p>

  <p>Mr. House, a character from <em>Fallout: New Vegas,</em> plays a major role in this season. This live-action version of him is fantastic and shows that the series can bring in game characters and do them justice.&nbsp; Yet by the end, his status is left up in the air, and I’m not even sure what happened to him. It’s very strange to spend so much of the season fleshing out Mr. House, only for the finale to seemingly leave his fate unknown and not even explain why.</p>

 <p>Some will argue that the show is setting up events and plot points for season three and will suggest that’s just how TV works. The thing is, a good season of TV should feel somewhat self-contained. A chapter of the story with its own ideas and endings. I don’t need or want every plot thread tied up. However, a TV season should wrap up in a way that feels like a natural stopping point while also providing enough closure and answers that you don’t feel like you wasted your time watching most of it. <em>Fallout</em> season two doesn’t do this, and I think it either needed to gut some plotlines or extend the episode count beyond eight.</p> <h2><em>Fallout</em>‘s Main Characters Are The Best Part Of Season Two</h2> <p>Thankfully, while the show did a poor job of balancing all its plots this season, it was able to deliver some great moments for Maximus, Lucy, and the Ghoul.</p>

 <p>In particular, the Ghoul’s storyline bounced wonderfully between his time before and after the bombs, revealing a lot more about his connections to House, The Enclave, and Vault Tec. For fans of <em>Fallout</em> lore, this is where the show shines the brightest, though for non-<em>Fallout</em> fans, some of this stuff is poorly explained. I had to answer a lot of questions after each episode when talking to people who like the show, yet have never played the games.</p> <p>Maximus escaping the Brotherhood and becoming a beacon of hope for the people of New Vegas after standing up against invading Deathclaws is a great evolution of the character. The moment when he walks by a young boy while wearing the NCR power armor is a perfect way to visually show his growth. The young boy who was saved by a power-armor-wearing soldier is now the one in armor saving the day.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000665730" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665730"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665730">© Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p>And Lucy’s relationship with her father and his plans to use control chips to save the wasteland were also a highlight of the season. It’s clear that Lucy would love for the wasteland to not be so violent and dangerous, but she won’t let her dad turn people into robot-like slaves to achieve that goal. As she tells him late in the season, after handcuffing him to an oven and before running off to destroy his work, “Thanks to you, I’m not a fudging idiot.” She still loves her dad, still respects that he raised her right, which makes his betrayal and eventual choice to wipe his own mind in the end all the more heartbreaking for her.</p>

 <p>At least seconds later, she’s reunited with Maximus and can begin the next chapter of her life in the wasteland. I mean, as she points out, the return of Caesar’s Legion and the NCR means New Vegas is likely going to be involved in a big war, one which she could have prevented with her dad’s tech. That’s the thing about war, though, it uh…never changes.</p> <p>As for the Ghoul, he’s off to Colorado to find his family. So it does seem like once again our main characters won’t all be hanging out together, as Lucy and Maximus are staying back in New Vegas. The change of scenery could help the show a lot. One can only spend so many hours in desert-y wastelands before getting bored.</p>

 <p>Still, I’m very nervous that season three of <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-way-to-play-fallout-new-vegas-in-2026-pc-mods-steam-deck-xbox-ps5-2000664195"><em>Fallout</em></a> is going to try to balance even more storylines and ideas across two different locations. If the showrunners can pull that off, season three could be amazing. If not, season three could end up being even more complicated, unsatisfying, and messy than season two.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-cancelled-mechner-2000665726</link>
            <guid>1425529</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been a couple of weeks since Ubisoft </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"><span>canceled its </span><i><span>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake</span></a><span>, and fans, the developers, and actors on the project are all still reeling from the news. One person who is also reacting to it is Jordan Mechner, the creator of the original </span><i><span>Prince of Persia</span></i><span>, who also acted as a designer on </span><i><span>Sands of Time </span></i><span>back in 2003. </span></p> <p><span>Mechner hasn’t been with Ubisoft in decades, and has largely left the video game industry in favor of writing books, but he still posted about the cancellation </span><a href="https://www.jordanmechner.com/en/latest-news/#winter-days"><span>on his personal website</span></a><span>, offering his condolences to the team.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>I’d hoped my first post of the new year would celebrate </span><i><span>The Sands of Time</span></i><span>‘s release, but alas, that’s not in the cards. The remake’s cancellation as part of Ubisoft’s restructuring was disappointing news to all fans who’d been eagerly awaiting it, myself included.</span></p> <p><span>My sympathy goes to the development team in Montreal; I can only imagine how they must feel. Having a project killed is a brutal experience. It’s an aspect of the game industry that the public doesn’t often see, but developers are all too familiar with.</span></p> <p><span>A cancellation so close to release can be particularly devastating for younger team members who don’t have decades of past shipped titles on their resumé. It’s tough to suddenly absorb that the past four years of hard work you were proud of, and looking forward to seeing out in the world as your new calling card, will now never see daylight. Words like loss and grieving might seem exaggerated, but artists put their hearts into their work. Memories of nights and weekends spent in studio crunch instead of at home with loved ones, sacrifices that felt worth it at the time, only add to the pain retrospectively once their object ceases to exist.</span></p> <p><span>I love games — playing them, making them — but news like this makes me feel especially grateful that for the past five years, I’ve been focused on making books and art. The production budget of a graphic novel is minuscule; the creative freedom of trusting that what I write and draw will reach readers directly is priceless.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Honestly, good for him for getting out and finding something less soul-crushing than game development right now. He touches on something significant here in that people who are still early on in their game dev career will be especially affected by this, as they likely spent years working on something they can’t include in their portfolio, and Ubisoft </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-art-leak-canceled-remake-2000663501"><span>seems dead set on making sure no one sees what the team was working on</span></a><span> by scrubbing leaked art and screenshots from the internet. Eman Ayaz, an actor who is believed to have played a role in the remake, recently released a video lamenting how her work on the project was one of her best performances, but now it will never see the light of day.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><i><span>Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake cancellation came as part of a </span><a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf"><span>larger restructuring at Ubisoft</span></a><span>, which resulted in the shelving of six games and the delaying of seven others.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Pokémon 30th Anniversary Commercial Is Forcing Me To Care About The Super Bowl]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-30-commercial-super-bowl-lx-ad-2000665640</link>
            <guid>1425526</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Look, I get it: there’s absolutely nothing interesting or special about not being interested in football. People who are performatively uninterested in watching sports are deeply tiresome. But I have a special excuse: I’m British. To me the Super Bowl is like a broadcast from an alien planet, recognizable in some respects, but completely indecipherable in others. Although I hear it has commercials and a nice bit of live music in the middle. One of those commercials, however, has piqued my interest: <em>Pokémon</em> is making some noise about having bought one of those impossibly expensive spots as the launch of its 30th anniversary promotions.</p> <p>Admittedly, my Britishness is not a&nbsp;<em>very</em> good excuse. Not least because I have friends who’ll be staying up literally all night to watch the event, and even some who already know the names of the teams involved. But they are oddities on our isle, those willing to start watching an hours-long live sporting event that begins at 11.30 p.m. And despite my reading that a game of your American Football only lasts 60 minutes but for all the stopping and starting, apparently the entire Super Bowl event goes on for more than four hours. (Also my excuse becomes tattered nonsense when I also admit to having lost many a night’s sleep to stay up watching a U.S. baseball game, because that is the only good sport, and go Phillies.)</p>

 <p>I’ve tried to come to terms with the rules of football. I’ve spent a lot of time in the States (when it felt safe to visit), and I spent a lot of that time watching baseball either in stadia or on ESPN, and fell deeply in love. And I know from that experience that my issue with football is that I don’t understand how to understand it, rather than there being anything inherently wrong with the sport itself. Like that moment when it clicked that baseball wasn’t about the batting but the pitching, I’m sure if I dedicated the time, the true nature of NFL games would slot into place for me, I’d understand its chess-like elements, and see more than what appears to be rugby with every last element of fun removed.</p> <p>But what I am far less likely to ever come around to is the crassness of celebrating the Super Bowl for its commercials. The most expensive spots on U.S. TV are spoken about each year as if they represent a cultural moment, with the ads rated for their entertainment value and artistic merit, as if these constant interruptions are benefiting the viewer in any way. I detest advertising, I do all I can to avoid it in all its forms, and god I’m such a bloody hypocrite because I really want to see what <em>Pokémon</em> has lined up.</p>

 <h2>The Pokémon 30th anniversary begins at the Super Bowl</h2> <p>2026 is <em>Pokémon</em>‘s 30th anniversary, and The Pokémon Company International (TPCi) has announced it will begin a year-long “campaign” to mark this beginning with a commercial during February 8’s Super Bowl LX. As a teaser for this, it has released a peculiar 21-second promo featuring Jigglypuff goofing around in what looks like a recording studio’s editing suite.</p>

  <p>It had been expected that TPCi would be waiting until February 27 to begin the anniversary noise, given that’s what’s become known as Pokémon Day, to match the date on which the original <em>Pokémon Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Green</em> launched in Japan in 1996. While there has been no official announcement, it’s inevitable that on that date we’ll receive a Pokémon Direct that will—and here I’m very confidently speculating—give us the first details about <em>Pokémon</em>‘s Gen X starters, and likely an announcement for a new mainline entry in the game series due to launch before Christmas 2026. It’s been four years since <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em> released, the longest gap between main games in 15 years, and it’d be a new level of crazy, even for Nintendo, not to see the tenth generation of pocket monsters arrive for the 30th birthday.</p> <p>As for the Super Bowl spot itself, it’s probably best not to get hopes&nbsp;<em>too</em> high. Recent teases like the Jigglypuff clip above have resulted in deep anticlimaxes, like all the excitement over a Pikachu-led music game resulting in, instead, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legend-z-a-youtube-dj-pikachu-1851786626">an hour-long “DJ set” ahead of last July’s Direct</a>. TPCi describes the forthcoming commercial spot as something that will” illustrate the brand’s mission to bring people together through a shared love of Pokémon and honor its growing audience of diverse, global and multigenerational fans across three decades,” and indeed where fans will “see themselves and their fandom reflected in unexpected ways.” Which to me sounds like a super-long montage of <em>Pokémon</em> nostalgia amounting to reminding you that you loved it at some point in the past.</p>

 <p>Alongside this, the various international versions of the online Pokémon Center stores are selling 30th anniversary gubbins, but there’s no point even linking them as at the time of writing they’ve all inevitably gone down under the weight of scalpers scooping it all up.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000665715" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665715"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665715">© Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>And yet, for all my cynicism, I really want to see what is being put together. TPCi&nbsp;<em>are</em> capable of some <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-horror-trailer-creepy-2000619530">truly extraordinary advertising campaigns</a> that play out more like VHS horror than commercials, and while it’s too much to hope it’d lean that weird during the big football game, it at least creates the possibility of something that’s not wholly generic. Yes, it’s much more likely to be a cloying play on your childhood memories, but let me be the optimist. Not quite optimistic enough that I’ll stay up until 2 a.m. to watch whatever comes of it, let alone sit through the interminable stop-starting of men in suits of armor crying because someone trod on their toe. (Dear God, America, watch some rugby union and get a grip.) But I’ll likely seek it out the following morning, not least because of a naive hope for a glimpse of Gen X starters hiding somewhere in there.</p>

<p>Take-Two CEO has put fans’ minds at ease, revealing that they have “every reason to believe” GTA Online will continue after the GTA 6 launch. </p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6, the next mainline title for the wildly popular Rockstar Games series, is all set to release in November 2026, and the developers have recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-release-date-earnings-call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaffirmed the date</a> as well. However, with the new instalment on the way, players have been wondering whether the online services of the previous title will sunset after GTA 6’s launch. </p>







<h2 id="h-take-two-has-every-reason-to-continue-gta-online-support-once-gta-6-arrives">Take Two Has ‘Every Reason’ to Continue GTA Online Support Once GTA 6 Arrives</h2>



<p>During the most recent <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/bb6700ad-114c-4457-b4da-379bbd89053b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings</a> call, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick responded to an investor’s question about the support for GTA Online. Zelnick expressed strong confidence in the service’s ongoing support, stating that they have “every reason to believe” it will continue. He emphasized that the game has a “great community” that remains engaged, and noted that Rockstar has demonstrated how the title can remain relevant for years after its release, thanks to the high-quality additional content.</p>



<p><strong>Interested readers can check out Strauss Zelnick’s complete statement below: </strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“At the same time, I have every reason to believe we’ll continue to support&nbsp;GTA Online.&nbsp;There’s a great community that loves it, that stays engaged. And again, in this quarter, Rockstar has shown that when you deliver great additional content, despite how long GTA Online has been in the market, people show up.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GTA Online has been around for more than a decade and is still a top contender in the games industry. On Steam alone, GTA 5 is able to bring in more than 100,000 players daily, and that’s almost all thanks to the Online service. What’s more, it was just announced that GTA 5 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-has-sold-225-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 225 million copies</a> worldwide, and GTA Online contributed significantly to that as well. </p>



<p>In discussing the title, Zelnick pointed out that the Grand Theft Auto series has “vastly outpaced” their forecasts. This impressive performance can be attributed to a “recurrent spending growth of 27%,” driven by the latest update for GTA Online, titled “A Safehouse in the Hills.” This update introduced new mansion properties and marked the return of the game’s protagonist, Michael DeSanta.</p>







<p>In other news, GTA 6 marketing will begin this summer and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-marketing-to-start-this-summer-will-have-physical-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will have a physical edition</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-genai-has-zero-part-in-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GenAI has zero part</a> in the upcoming title.

    <div>
        
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will be shown during Thursday’s Nintendo Direct event.</p>



<p>According to known leaker NateTheHate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix</a> is expected to show the game during the Partner Direct on February 5. He adds that it’s also possible that they’ll announce a release date for the game as well.</p>







<p><strong>“They will give it a release date and a brand-new trailer,”</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8B7axb3JMY&amp;t=3323s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. <strong>“Last week it was reported that Square Enix was targeting a summer release for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Switch 2 and Xbox. And to my understanding, that information is correct.”</strong></p>



<p>He then said that he thinks that the game will release sometime in June. </p>



<p>Of course, despite his track record with rumors and reports, it’s important to take the latest claims with a grain of salt.</p>







<p>The Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-partner-direct-announced-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takes place at 9am ET/6am PT</a> on February 5. It will focus on games from external developers coming to both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>As is customary, we thought it wise to throw a bunch of predictions into the ring and see what Nintendo's partner publishers might be cooking up for the Switch and Switch 2 in the coming months. We already have the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> on the way, but we reckon there's room for a <em>lot</em> more.</p>
<p>As ever, we encourage you to share your own predictions with a comment in the usual place, but for now, let's see what Team NL thinks will be announced in the upcoming Direct...</p>

<h2>Fantasy Isn't Dead - Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9b1239656cdb6"><a title="Direct Predictions 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b1239656cdb6/direct-predictions-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hello, yes, I’m going to gently ask for more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a>…</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a nice way to start out the Switch 2’s 2026, isn’t it? I bet Atlus will bring <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> to the table. I don’t know whether I’ll make time to play through it again… but gosh, it’d be nice to make it available on another platform. It’s my favourite modern Atlus game.</p>
<p>Capcom’s Switch 2 support will continue, too, and I think there’s a good chance <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will pop up, seeing as they’re working on improvements for other platforms.</p>
<p>Two games I want to see more of are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/orbitals">Orbitals</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a> – two very different ones, I know, but the former looks <em>beautiful</em> and the latter is just more HD-2D but in action form.</p>
<p>I’ll end things on another Square Enix prediction (which is on-brand): Final Fantasy… <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xiv_online_a_realm_reborn">XIV</a>. Yep. I reckon this could be a big showcase for the company anyway (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Rebirth</a>, anyone?), so why not throw in something extra?</p>
<h2>Arise Now, ye Tarnished - Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<figure data-uuid="25588ed099d64"><a title="Direct Predictions 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/25588ed099d64/direct-predictions-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, I'll make the most of these invincibility frames and dodge roll right into the most obvious picks of the bunch. I think this is when we get an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> date. It has been cropping up at far too many public events to still be <em>that far</em> off, and I can't imagine FromSoft wants to extend the delay any longer than it has to.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> feels likely, too. It's weird how much of the Switch 2 reveal Direct was dedicated to this one (it even got a Creator's Voice spotlight afterwards), and then we've heard... nothing since. Give this little rat boy some more info!</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'll throw in all of the usual suspects that I like to get out on a prayer. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> Switch 2 port, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a> on Switch (it's too big for an Indie World now, I reckon), Nintendo's finally given the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> guys a devkit. Go on, let's have a release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton</a>, too — I need this game to come out before Level-5 destroys my enthusiasm completely.</p>
<h2>Come Out Swinging - Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<figure data-uuid="007777613c997"><a title="Direct Predictions 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/007777613c997/direct-predictions-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’d love to see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/alan_wake_2">Alan Wake 2</a> with the DLC bundled; kind of the equivalent of the <strong>Resident Evil Gold Editions</strong>, y’know? It’s also a bit of a long shot, but I think it’s time <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox/psychonauts">Psychonauts</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/psychonauts_2">its sequel</a> came to the Switch 2. And let’s get another fighting collection from Capcom, hm? I know we’re kinda running out of titles at this point, but I’m sure there’s room for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/ultra_street_fighter_iv">Ultra Street Fighter IV</a> somewhere.</p>
<p>Sticking with the fighters for a moment, I know y’all are hankering for <strong>Capcom vs. SNK 3</strong>. Me too, man, me too. I think the Switch 2 has a real shot at being a legit destination for fighters, and an announcement here would give it a real boost with the FGC.</p>
<p>Capcom won’t stop there though – oh no. Given that it recently took part in a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/pragmata-might-wind-up-being-the-biggest-surprise-of-2026">huge preview event with Nintendo</a>, this paves the way for some other titles. Resident Evil’s 30th anniversary is on the way, so it’s about time we get the OG trilogy on Switch and Switch 2. Don’t stop there, though. Give us a remastered port of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Outbreak</a>, dagnabbit!</p>
<p>Oh, and Ubisoft will fail to read the room with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2026_edition">Just Dance</a> update.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-ipad-a16-chip-all-time-low-deal-quietly-makes-a-comeback-no-need-to-look-for-budget-tablets-2000659253</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Apple iPad 11-inch (A16) is a portable tablet made for watching videos, browsing the web, and some light creativity, and it also has a powerful A16 chip inside to make everything run smoothly. It has 128 GB of storage for downloading apps and content, Wi-Fi 6 connectivity to quickly connect to compatible wireless networks, and one USB-C port for charging your device and attaching accessories. The tablet also includes a 12 MP front camera with Center Stage technology to keep you well-framed during video calls, a 12 MP rear camera with flash for better photos, and 4K video recording. It also has Touch ID on the top button and a long-lasting battery, so it’s always ready when you need to use it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">You can purchase the Apple iPad 11-inch (A16) at Amazon right now for only $300, instead of the regular price of $349; that is a savings of $49 and 14% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>One of Apple’s best tablets in an affordable size and form factor</h2>
<p>This iPad has an A16 processor, designed to give users a fast app-opening experience, whether they are moving between programs like Safari, Messages, or games and creative apps. iPadOS allows users to run multiple apps simultaneously in a layout of their choice, for example, playing a video while keeping notes and a browser open. Because this iPad comes with 128 GB of internal storage, the user can download and store a variety of apps and files without needing to delete any items.</p>
<p>The 11-inch Liquid Retina display is large and very sharp, making it great for viewing movies, photos, and text clearly at arm’s length. Its brightness adapts automatically to ambient light, helping you see what you are doing more clearly. This screen is large enough to support split-screen work, but small enough to hold comfortably when you’re just scrolling through the internet or checking out your favorite TV show.</p>



<p>The front-facing 12 MP landscape Center Stage camera on the iPad will keep you centered on the screen during video calls, even as you move around. The back of the iPad features a 12 MP wide-angle lens camera and a flash, letting you shoot both 4K video and photographs, including scanning receipts, taking pictures of homework assignments, and capturing clear images of important documents. It also has two built-in microphones and dual speakers for voice clarity.</p>
<p>For those who would like to turn their iPad into a digital notebook or sketch pad, they can use the Apple Pencil to create handwritten notes, draw ideas, and edit PDFs on the iPad’s glass surface. Then, with just a couple of taps, you can send the documents you’ve created to others via email or messaging apps. You can also add a Magic Keyboard Folio to your iPad, which converts it into a lightweight laptop when you need to do some extended typing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">This iPad offers a lot of capabilities at an affordable $300, $49 less than the original retail price of $349.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The Epic Games Store might still feel to some like just a glorified <em>Fortnite</em> launcher. It was until recently the only way to play Epic’s hit battle royale on PC and that’s certainly what many of the people downloading the client use it for. But there’s a growing contingent of players that use it for playing other PC games as well. In fact, while total gameplay hours spent on the store fell a whopping 14 percent last year, total hours spent on non-Epic games was actually up 4 percent. This is one of the details Epic VP Steve Allison is focused on when I talk to him about the company’s new 2025 year-in-review report published this week.</p> <p>“Sixty percent of our audience are dual users,” he tells me. “They use Steam and the Epic Games Store. Forty percent don’t. But not all the 40 percent are <em>Fortnite</em> players. A lot of them are coming off of games like Riot’s games or <em>Minecraft</em> or <em>Roblox</em> or things like that. I’m actually always pretty surprised at how big that incremental group is. But for those dual players, there’s an interesting thing. In the totality of the story, what I can tell you is of the average monthly active users of 67 million, only about 26 percent of those players are <em>Fortnite</em> players. The rest are third-party.”</p>

 <p>It’s the end of the day. Allison, a 30-year industry veteran with stints at Atari, Midway, and Telltale, is clearly exhausted from briefing journalists all day about the pitch to make more people actually want to use the Epic Games Store. “The launcher sucks. Let’s call it what it is,” he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-launcher-sucks-lets-call-it-what-it-is-epic-game-store-boss-says-promising-a-year-of-big-improvements-to-speed-new-forum-type-social-features-more">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. “We’re ripping the guts out” and replacing it with something better, he <a href="https://www.polygon.com/epic-games-store-egs-update-avatars-voice-chat/">told <em>Polygon</em></a>. “Our goal isn’t to dance on Steam’s grave,” he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-goal-isnt-to-dance-on-top-of-steams-grave-how-epic-plans-to-convince-pc-gamers-to-buy-their-games-from-the-epic-games-store-instead-of-steam">told <em>IGN</em></a>. So what is the goal, exactly? And why is it taking so long to get there?</p> <h2>If Steam is Google, Epic feels like PC gaming’s Bing</h2> <p>Released back in 2018 with an announcement at the Game Awards, there was a brief groundswell of hype around how the<em> Fortnite</em> maker might offer a meaningful competitor to Steam’s dominance in the PC gaming marketplace. Valve’s storefront is an incredibly powerful engine for game discovery that can also be a cesspool <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-14/white-supremacist-nazi-content-spread-on-steam-gaming-platform">attracting some of the worst people on the internet</a>. Maybe Epic could curate the best of PC gaming without toxic dregs? But many years later it’s still missing key features and feels a bit like a massive but empty mall. There’s tons of vendors hawking their wares but no real sense of a community.</p>

 <p>2026 is supposed to be the year that changes, or at least starts to. Epic is promising sweeping overhauls to the underlying infrastructure of the store to make it load faster and run better. More ambitious are the “community spaces” it claims will spring up when it ships voice chat and parties that exist at the platform layer outside of within any particular game you’re playing. Other incoming features include avatars, player profiles, and private messaging. Yes, it’s taken Epic eight years to unlock these 2000s-era online gaming features.</p>

 <p>I asked Allison why. He blamed, in so many words, Epic’s five-year-long crusade to get Apple and Google’s mobile storefronts to allow competing storefronts and third-party payment processing. “The litigation gave us the opportunity to bring the mobile stores,” he said. “That was a part of the vision from jump, but we just couldn’t get to it. The minute we could get to it, we pivoted to it really hard. That’s the kind of company Epic is, it pivots hard and fast, and that came at the expense of getting some of those [features].”</p> <p>Mobile versions of the Epic Game Store came to iOS devices in the EU and Android devices everywhere last year, and the company’s long-term strategy is to make the launcher part of a connected network that exists beyond any single platform. A unified text chat system rolled out last year and a shared library of cross-platform games people can play on both mobile and PC is coming in the future. “It’s taken a while,” Allison, who’s been along for the entire ride, admitted. “It’s going to be on us to earn those players back by hopefully doing cool shit, and we’ll, we’ll get there, but I think we’re finally doing the work that’s expected of us, and hopefully we can make some of those players come around again.”</p>

 <h2>Staying exclusive while others go multiplatform</h2> <p>But even if the Epic Games Store can hypothetically match Steam feature-for-feature, or even exceed it, there’s still no guarantee it will be enough to overcome the entrenched networking effects and decades of player investment that give Valve’s storefront an advantage. Early on, Epic tried to coerce players to switch with a series of controversial timed exclusives, like <em>Borderlands 3</em>, that mostly just pissed people off and hurt sales. Allison confirmed that strategy is in the past and exclusives aren’t a priority moving forward.</p> <p>“There’s 20,000 releases a year on PC, we could pick wrong 1,000 times and end up with $0 so we needed to focus no matter,” he said. “I understand how people felt about it, but that was a purposeful strategy that really worked for the beginning of the store, but it has really moved on from that.” It doesn’t sound like that means Epic-published games like <em>Alan Wake 2</em> will ever be coming to Steam, however. Epic-funded games “will always be on the Epic Games Store as long as we have a publishing deal in place with our partners,” he said when I asked.</p> <p>Epic now relies mostly on carrots instead of sticks to lure over PC gamers. Its monthly free games <a href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-steam-epic-games-publishing-deal-tim-sweeney-2000662259">were recently dunked on</a> for reportedly helping to fuel sales for the Steam versions, but Epic isn’t shying away from that attention. Its year-in-review report openly boasts about the lift games get across multiple platforms when they are given away for free on the Epic Games Store. In 2025, the company gave away 100 different games that were claimed a total of 662 million times. It estimates the total value per player in claimed games was $2,316.</p>

 <p>It doesn’t sound like Epic plans to turn that money spigot off anytime soon. The free drinks, even for people who continue to spend most of their time on Steam, will continue. But is it having any effect? Allison <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/epic-says-only-16-to-18-percent-of-people-claiming-free-games-on-the-epic-games-store-buy-games-there-afterwards-but-for-cost-per-new-user-its-hard-to-beat/">told <em>Gamesradar</em></a> that less than 20 percent of users who collect the free games then go on to spend money buying others afterwards. That’s an expensive user acquisition strategy, though it certainly earns you a lot more positive PR than <a href="https://kotaku.com/monopoly-go-ad-budget-bigger-than-spider-man-last-of-us-1851350182">spending hundreds of millions to market clicker games on mobile</a>.</p> <h2>A CEO who tweets too much</h2> <p>One thing Epic isn’t rushing to copy from Valve, however, is its AI disclosure policy. Developers on Valve’s storefront are required to tell players when a game includes assets made with generative AI (LLMs for coding and other work doesn’t count). Epic CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/epics-sweeney-says-platforms-should-stop-tagging-games-made-with-ai">recently made fun of these rules</a>, saying they “make no sense” when, he contends, all games will eventually use genAI in their production. “I don’t disagree with that,” Allison said. I understand how the discourse and conversation are going, but it’s it. I don’t want to say it’s a fool’s errand, but it’s a very, very difficult thing to accurately police.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “If they’re using it to fire people and all those kinds of things that people are worried about, that’s a terrible thing that we don’t endorse. But we don’t think that that’s how AI is going to be used in game development. We think that it’s going to help a lot of these smaller teams make awesome shit, like, like we haven’t seen from a six- or 10-man team, and we’re in a period of time where we’re starting to see the impact of the current situation in the industry on large teams. So we’re not going to require people to disclose it. It’s really up to the developer what they want to disclose.”</p> <p>Sweeney also took a swing at Steam after a class-action lawsuit in the UK over regional pricing <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-class-action-lawsuit-steam-uk-ruling-2000663481">was allowed to move forward</a>. He called Steam’s 30-percent commission on game sales “<a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2017028895875195171">junk fees</a>,” likening them to the monopoly rent-seeking on iOS and Android that he spent years fighting Apple and Google over in court. But no PC gamer would liken Steam’s robust game discovery mechanisms to Apple’s poor stewardship of the App Store, and unlike on mobile, Steam is kicking the Epic Games Store’s ass without locking players out of competing stores on PC. If Valve is a business built on junk fees, it’s because players and developers have thus far been all too eager to pay them.</p> <p>It’s sometimes hard to know how much to distinguish Epic’s grand strategy from Sweeney’s own ideological crusades. Earlier this month, the CEO came to Elon Musk’s defense against, of all things, regulatory attempts to restrict <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-argues-banning-twitter-over-its-ability-to-ai-generate-pornographic-images-of-minors-is-just-gatekeepers-attempting-to-censor-all-of-their-political-opponents/">AI-generated CSAM material from spreading on X</a>. He likened the creation of sexualized images of kids to AI “<a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2009753835456156088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2009753835456156088%7Ctwgr%5E314650d7dadff0c1aa9d6234049569646ffe2c5d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcgamer.com%2Fgaming-industry%2Fepic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-argues-banning-twitter-over-its-ability-to-ai-generate-pornographic-images-of-minors-is-just-gatekeepers-attempting-to-censor-all-of-their-political-opponents%2F">going off the rails</a>” and noted that no AI tools are “perfect” while arguing against calls for the app’s removal from storefronts. He then <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2010497254495342610?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2010497254495342610%7Ctwgr%5E623d893e2f1f48f01e6c25eb1e028e6a67d652f4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Ftim-sweeney-grok-controversy%2F">got angry at websites for quoting him</a>. In a follow-up email after our interview, I asked whether Allison agreed with that reasoning and whether it’s hard having a boss who tweets so much. He declined to comment.</p>

 <h2>A bigger slice of a growing PC gaming pie</h2> <p>The Epic Games Store’s ambitions for 2026 gesture at something much bigger than it’s ever been. One new pitch to developers is to compliment free game giveaways with more free in-game rewards for <em>Fortnite</em>. Buying <em>Crimson Desert</em>, the upcoming open-world action-adventure game, will get players exclusive cosmetics in the battle royale. The goal is to find new ways to leverage the success of the one to build up the latter. Those giveaways, the messaging integration, and the upcoming voice-chat parties feature <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-sdk-nitro-ads-ipo-profitable-splitgate-2-1851770484">remind me a lot of Discord</a>. Epic’s goal might not be to topple Steam after all. It might be to leapfrog it by becoming the next gaming social media platform that also happens to sell some games.</p> <p>Allison says the company’s not thinking in zero-sum terms. PC and mobile gaming is growing while consoles plateau. His view is that these platforms can all grow together. “Our goal was to compete with Steam and if things worked out that PC gaming would grow as a result of having real competition.” He said he’s proud of how far the store has come since launch, when <em>Fortnite</em> had 8 million monthly active users and the store was at zero. Now the Epic Games Store’s 67 million users a month averages about half of where Steam is as at while each keeps growing.</p> <p>“They’re like 140 million, not sure exactly, because of how much bot traffic they have, but it’s still significant. It’s close to double, and we’re at that level,” Allison said. “So PC gaming has grown substantially since we’ve entered the market. We believe it’s because we’re competing. And, you know, we would be thrilled to be in a bigger pool of PC gaming that is much bigger than it was in 2018, which is where I think that’s going to continue to go. We’re starting to see console consumption behavior shift to PC and mobile. And so look, if Steam keeps growing and we keep growing, we’ll be super stoked, I will be happy. And our goals are really to get to be about 25, 30 percent of all PC gaming on the PC side of the business. And if we do, if you push past that, that’s awesome, but it’s like that will still be a multi-billion-dollar business in third party, and I think PC gaming will be better for it.”</p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/epic-games-store-free-fortnite-discord-steam-2000665313]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a special day for this NYT Connections hints guide, because today is <strong>my birthday! </strong>It’s nice to celebrate in many ways, but today I’m welcoming my most recent trip around the sun by helping you solve today’s NYT Connections puzzle. Below, you’ll find the hints and solutions you need to get this puzzle completed as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Read on to learn what you need to know, and perhaps leave me a ‘Happy birthday!’ in the comments below!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>

<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #970:</p>



<ul>
<li>AMERICAN FLAG</li>

<li>BRUCE</li>



<li>OCEAN</li>



<li>CHRISTOPHER</li>



<li>SKY</li>



<li>SPIKE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Quintessentially American</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – When things are in your way</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Just like the group</li>

<p>Very well!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[WD To Release A 100TB Hard Drive By 2029]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wd-100tb-hard-drive-2029/</link>
            <guid>1425487</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WD wants you to never have to by another storage device again. The digital storage company—also known as Western Digital—announced its new High Bandwidth Drive and Dual Pivot technology.</p>



<p>The Dual Pivot technology, <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/2026/2026-02-03-western-digital-accelerates-storage-innovation-for-ai-era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WD says</a>, will add a second set of “independently operating actuators on a separate pivot and will deliver up to 2x sequential IO gain within a 3.5-inch drive.”</p>







<p><strong>“This differs from previous dual actuator designs that sacrificed capacity and required extensive customer software changes,”</strong> WD says. <strong>“Dual Pivot enables reduced spacing between disks, allowing for more platters per drive and higher overall capacity.”</strong></p>



<p>The High Bandwidth Drive will allow simultaneous writing and reading from multiple heads on multiple tracks. This technology, according to WD, will offer double the bandwidth of standard HDDs without any power setbacks. </p>



<p><strong>“The technology has a clear path to scale up to 8x bandwidth gains and is already in customer hands for validation,”</strong> they said.</p>







<p>With the new technologies, and others that continue to improve, WD has plans to scale its HDD offerings in a major way over the next few years. The company has already announced its 40TB UltraSMR ePMR HDD that will enter production in the second half of 2026. </p>



<p>After the 40TB drive comes a 60TB offering before moving to 100TB by 2029. </p>



<p><strong>“The result is unprecedented flexibility,”</strong> they say. <strong>“Hyperscalers and enterprises can adopt either technology on their own timelines with predictable capacity planning and seamless scaling – no forced technology transitions, no infrastructure disruptions, just continuous and accelerating capacity growth built on architecture they already trust.”</strong></p>

Over the course of eight months, the company launched Grounded 2 in early access, followed by both The Outer Worlds 2 and Avowed after protracted developments. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the three games, only Grounded 2 was qualified as a success — and while further titles in the Avowed universe are planned, a third Outer Worlds title is not in production. Unsurprisingly, this news has disappointed fans of the space-based role-playing game series, who have offered their own opinions on what went wrong. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I feel like TOW2 paid for the sins of TOW 1 and Avowed," Godlike013 wrote in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1quyu5o/obsidians_the_outer_worlds_2_underperformed_and/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lengthy thread on The Outer World's main subreddit</a>, suggesting that The Outer Worlds 2 had deserved a better reception. "After two mid games in a row negative sentiment unfairly fell on TOW2 when it is a genuinely good game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'll be honest, it's not surprising in the least," countered Lafitte1812. "TOW2 is, in every possible way a better game. It's a night and day difference, and most of my problems have been fixed, but at the end of the day I still don't really give a damn about the universe, and positive word of mouth alone is only so impactful."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm not surprised," agreed CardTrickOTK. "I think it was better than the first in a lot of ways, but when BG3 drops and lets you do some frankly insane things with the companions, I think a lot of people had their standards raised for RPGs, and this game is just okay."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Outer Worlds 2 Game Awards Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Several other fans noted the recent launch of other RPGs — and particularly 2025's beloved Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 — as having provided tough competition and even tougher comparisons in some areas such as story and fully-fleshed out characters. Others suggested that the lengthy wait for The Outer Worlds 2 had also raised expectations, which were not met by the sequel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The first game was incredible but lacked content," wrote RUKnight31. "We excused that due to limited budget and dev time for a new franchise. Given the increased resources and development time that went into OW2 we expected to have a lot more content than OW. It didn't and the obvious 'business decisions' that led to chopped content sucked to see."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A larger number of fans expressed frustration at Microsoft for the game's pricing fiasco, which initially saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-is-microsofts-first-confirmed-80-game">The Outer Worlds 2 set to become the company's first $80 game</a> — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers">before the company put the initiative on pause and backtracked</a>. While the game ultimately launched at $70, fans say that the snafu dominated headlines and killed hype that the game struggled to win back. Some even pointed out the irony of the situation happening to The Outer Worlds 2, a game which tells the story of people caught up in the actions of megacorporation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So capitalism was the true villain all along," QQBearsHijacker quipped.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">"They overshot asking $80 and that turned a lot of gamers off," RUKnight31 continued. "The backtrack to $70 was too little too late. In this economy $60-$70 is already a lot. Trying to push $80 as the new norm was outlandish for leisure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Did not help at all that the biggest splash this game made on the overall gaming lake was the stupid 80 bucks fiasco that Microsoft tried to push," agreed ElGodPug. "Like, even after they reduced to 70 (still too much IMO), first impressions are pretty important, and to many it was 'oh hey, it's the sequel to that 7/10 game asking us to pay 20 bucks more'."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There were a lot of great RPGs this year and unfortunately this one was forgettable," Philosophers-Bone bluntly summed up. "Not horrible or anything, just didn't stand out. I'm glad I played it on Game Pass and didn't shell out $80 or whatever insane price they listed it for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review">The Outer Worlds 2 review</a> returned an 8/10, and stated that "once you get past a weak first act, The Outer Worlds 2 sharpens Obsidian’s RPG formula with smarter writing and better combat." We continued: "[It] doesn’t try to rewrite Obsidian’s RPG playbook, but it’s yet another strong refinement."

            <p>We're sure we'll be hearing a lot <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-30th-Celebration-Teaser">from The Pokémon Company</a> this year, as the massive franchise is turning 30 this month and already announced a major spinoff in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a>. It's also reasonable to expect news on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-teraleak-reveals-unannounced-games-seemingly-laying-out-franchises-major-releases-through-2030">the next generation</a> sooner rather than later, but first, Jigglypuff might show up at this year's Super Bowl. Yes, really.</p>
<p>On 4th February, the official Pokémon social media accounts revealed a "special video" will be shown during the 8th February broadcast, and The Pokémon Company even gave fans a cheeky tease that you can watch below:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Jigglypuff appears to be set to be the star of the show, and while we're low-key hoping for a halftime musical performance of sorts that puts everyone to sleep, the most likely scenario is that we'll get a nostalgic edit that also hypes up the franchise's busy future.</p>
<p>In any case, I personally doubt Nintendo and TPC have chosen to reveal more about the next batch of Pokémon games at the Super Bowl of all places, but I wouldn't rule out a few quick teases and/or winks. That's just speculation on my part, and I invite you all to theorize as well.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/30th-celebration/">Pokémon Center site</a> has also kicked off a big anniversary promotion with all-new 30th anniversary items presented as the 30th Collection. Pikachu's head shape has been chosen as the main icon for the celebrations, with the number 30 replacing the species' famous red cheeks. Cute!</p>
<p>Though we're still waiting for official updates on what's next for Pokémon on the gaming front past <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive Pokopia, recent weeks have brought us fun little behind-the-scenes tidbits about the making of older Pokémon games like the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-original-pokemon-games-took-lots-of-trial-and-error-to-develop">Red &amp; Green</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-sun-and-moon-ultra-beasts-design-inspiration-confirmed">Sun &amp; Moon</a>.</p>

<p>Or in other words, if you are playing God of War, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=kratos">Kratos</a> will make you a personalised podcast about the God of War series, or Aloy may pop up and tell you about her day hunting robotic beasties. The mind boggles as to what the Helldivers 2 podcast would sound like, probably a lot of shouting.</p>
<p>The podcast may also include video, and use data collected from your PlayStation to work out where you are in a specific game and give you some tips on how to progress.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting idea, but certainly not one that will happen any time soon. Sony does not own the rights to the actors’ voices, and Christopher Judge isn’t going to allow his gravelly tones to be used without a big fat pay cheque. Most actors are very much against their voices being used in AI anyway; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%932025_SAG-AFTRA_video_game_strike">2024–2025 SAG-AFTRA video game strike </a>was a response to AI concerns.</p>

<p>Previously, Sony have filed patents for a virtual controller which allows you to use any object instead of a DualSense, the patent design specifically showing a banana. An AI Emotional Modulator was patented in 2021, which would monitor your in-game chat and would automatically mute you if you got angry, and there was also a patent for a fluffy cloud-like robot that could sit beside you on the couch and analyse your emotions and offer condolences when you get beaten in a boss battle.</p>
<p>Or just have a cat. Almost the same thing.</p>

            <p>Valve’s upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a> reboot might not be as troubled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">ongoing memory shortages</a> as previously feared. Or, at least, not as delayed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-says-steam-machine-is-on-track-to-ship-early-this-year-and-xbox-2027-soc-work-is-progressing">VideoCardz</a>, AMD – who provide the custom processor nestled within the Steam Machine’s matte black walls – recently held a quarterly earnings call, in which CEO Dr. Lisa Su declared Valve to be "on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year." While still vague, that’s in line with Valve’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">originally announced</a> "early 2026" release window, suggesting that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ram-may-be-abominably-expensive-but-hey-at-least-ssd-prices-are-also-exploding">soaring RAM and SSD prices</a> haven’t pushed the new Machine back by much, if at all.</p>
<p>Now, a pessimistic mind might not be entirely reassured. Earnings calls can be helpful for illustrating a company’s past fortunes, but when predicting the future, the audience being full of shareholders can incentivise optimism over hard realism. And as one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/for-its-gaming-hardware-contingent-ces-2026-was-a-good-week-to-bury-good-news">tech industry’s leading AI peddlers</a>, AMD are also partly responsible for the memory shortage – in which rich firms are hoarding RAM, storage, and GPU products to build gigantic AI data centres – that caused delay concerns in the first place.</p>
<p>Still, it’s also in AMD’s interest to get the Steam Machine into as many waiting hands as possible, and since component shortages are widely expected to continue all the way into 2027 and beyond... well, if I were Valve, I probably would prefer to start selling at a higher-than-preferred price instead of leaving an untouched mountain of GabeCubes stacked in some warehouse, making a profit of precisely zero. Unless I could build a fort out of them, obviously.</p><p>Anyhoo, the Steam Machine itself remains <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-a-new-steam-machine-when-the-first-ones-flopped-because-this-time-valve-say-itll-actually-have-games">an intriguing piece of kit</a>: a little bit customisable PC, a little bit lounge-dwelling console, with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>-inspired <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-stress-again-that-therell-be-more-steam-machine-verified-games-than-steam-deck-ones-with-fewer-constraints-in-their-testing-programme">compatibility programme</a> and a redesigned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a> to make besties with.

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Sees a Price Cut, Moving Closer to Its Pre-Surge Pricing After Last Year’s 50% Increase]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-sees-a-price-cut-moving-closer-to-its-pre-surge-pricing-after-last-years-50-increase-2000665433</link>
            <guid>1425421</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For a long while, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate was colloquially known as the best deal in gaming—and for a good reason. Unlimited access to tons of awesome games, big and small, for a pretty reasonable price. But then in late 2025, Microsoft announced a staggering 50% price hike, bringing the service from $20 per month to $30 per month. By the end of the year, that’s an extra $120 out of pocket you would not have had to spend had the price stayed the same.</p>
<p>The service is still great, it’s just a little more expensive than most folks would like it to be. Though right now, it’s come back down a bit when you buy from StackSocial. It’s not back down to its original price, but it’s partway there. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7033/">The StackSocial deal brings the one month price down from $30 to just $25, and it brings the three-month price down from $90 to just $74.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7033/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<p>What’s really good is that the membership is stackable as well as not being region locked. This means you can load up on a bunch and set yourself up with Game Pass Ultimate for the foreseeable future at the reduced rate.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="377">If you own a Samsung TV from 2023 or later, you don’t even need to own an Xbox. Thanks to Samsung Gaming Hub, these newer TVs can stream games directly from the cloud, no console required. Pair an Xbox controller, sign into Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and you’re instantly playing major releases like <em data-start="326" data-end="337">Starfield</em> or <em data-start="341" data-end="356">Halo Infinite</em> straight on your TV.</p>


<h2 data-start="379" data-end="419">A Library That’s Easy to Get Lost In</h2>
<p data-start="421" data-end="654">Game Pass Ultimate opens the door to more than 500 games, covering everything from experimental indies to blockbuster releases.</p>
<p data-start="656" data-end="1346"><em data-start="656" data-end="663">Tunic</em> is a standout. At first glance, it looks like a charming throwback to the early <em data-start="744" data-end="751">Zelda</em> era, with an isometric view and a cute fox hero. Dig a little deeper and the game reveals its clever hook: the entire world speaks in a fictional language. Menus, dialogue, and instructions are all unreadable at first. As you explore, you discover pages from an in-game instruction manual, styled after the booklets that used to come tucked inside game boxes. Those pages slowly teach you how the game works, while also hinting at its secrets and lore. The result is a constant stream of satisfying revelations.</p>
<p data-start="1382" data-end="1707">Indie gems like <em data-start="1398" data-end="1405">Tunic</em> share space with major AAA titles. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate regularly delivers high-profile games on day one, including recent additions like <em data-start="1547" data-end="1583">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>. The subscription also includes EA Play at no extra cost, adding popular series such as <em data-start="1672" data-end="1682">The Sims</em> and <em data-start="1687" data-end="1695">Madden</em> to the mix.</p>
<p data-start="1709" data-end="1980">On top of that, Game Pass Ultimate bundles in Xbox Live features, unlocking online multiplayer for any supported game in the catalog.</p>

Fans will know that one of Derpy’s quirks is that he knocks down plants like a regular cat, but becomes fixated on trying (and, without thumbs, failing) to set them back up. The set will come later in 2026, with more planned to launch in 2027. There’s no sign yet of Huntr/x, the titular Kpop demon hunter group, but the trio did show up in Lego form in last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-rei-ami-stream-zoey-rumi-2000632536"><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>collaboration</span></a><span>, so we’ll probably be getting minifigures of Rumi, Mira, and Zoey at some point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>While Netflix and Sony were clearly not prepared for just </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><span>how big </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>was going to be last year</span></a><span>, the merchandise and collaborations that have been slowly trickling out over the past eight months or so have been pretty great.

Many of the products we’ve seen are expensive collector’s items, however, so hopefully we see more stuff that is actually appropriate for the film’s younger fans, too.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-netflix-release-date-2029-2000641414"><span>getting a sequel</span></a><span>, but it sounds like it’s a long ways away, as Sony and Netflix are currently aiming for a 2029 release. The first movie is still having a moment, though, as it’s been cleaning up this award season on both the film and music side. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why PIONER Could Only Be An MMO, And What Comes Next]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/why-pioner-only-mmo-what-comes-next/</link>
            <guid>1425415</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I fell in love with PIONER when it was released in early access on December 16, exclusively on Steam. It’s a post-apocalyptic MMORPG with serious potential, which is what I alluded to in my full review of the game. It has an unmistakable charm, despite being rooted in an irradiated, glum, and perilous world, fraught with mutants, bandits, and lethal anomalies.</p>



<p>PIONER was pieced together by GFA Games, a small studio with roots in the likes of STALKER and Metro. Recently, I had the opportunity to interview the studio’s founder and CEO, Aleksandr Nikitin, about the future of his game and why PIONER simply <strong>had to be </strong>an MMORPG, despite a troubling climate for the genre.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-post-apocalyptic-pioner-had-to-be-an-mmo">Why Post-Apocalyptic PIONER Had To Be An MMO</h2>



<p>Talking to Aleksandr Nikitin, I was curious to learn why PIONER wasn’t a single-player game, given that it’s the studio’s debut title, and soaring out of the gate with a PvPvE MMORPG seemed like one hell of a bold ambition. According to Nikitin, opting for the MMO format was a strategic choice as much as a creative one.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Single-player games can certainly be self-contained as complete works or replayable like a movie you can rewatch multiple times.</p>



<p>However, much like the difference between a movie and a TV series, MMOs have clear advantages: beyond delivering new content and expanding the world, we can develop the story in front of players and allow them to become a part of it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nikitin suggested that the choice to develop an MMO was an intentional one from ‘the very beginning’ of the studio’s foundations. From a rocky origin that saw the studio traverse a financial downturn, the COVID-19 pandemic, and an outbreak of <strong>war</strong>, GFA Games stayed true to the notion of making a stellar MMORPG for an eager audience.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have both large-scale content already in progress, and active development of new content for future patches and expansions.</p>



<p>If players say they want more raids and we see that this mode is statistically more popular than expected, we need to be ready to postpone something else and increase the priority of what players want, because we are making this game for them.</p>



<p>It is important to preserve our vision that brought players to us in the first place, and finding this balance is truly critical for an MMO.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-review-early-access-mmo-ambition/">my PIONER review</a>, I revealed how well the game works as an MMORPG title, and how it can be compared to something like Fallout 76. It’s grittier and more serious in how it delivers content, but it’s just as entertaining and is loaded with enough original content to keep players <strong>engaged</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-gfa-is-aware-of-the-struggles">GFA is Aware of the Struggles</h2>



<figure><figcaption>PIONER looks fantastic on screen</figcaption></figure>







<p>The MMORPG space is a rocky, tumultuous one, and the sentiments of the genre ebb and flow. It was just a few days ago that we saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ashes-of-creation-collapse-entire-intrepid-studios-laid-off/">Ashes of Creation</a>, an early access MMORPG that raised millions of dollars, implode as the entire studio was laid off.</p>



<p>Nikitin is wholeheartedly aware of that but is willing to compete with the downturn to create something special:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Even legendary giants like Lineage 2 and World of Warcraft are facing serious challenges right now. Next-generation giants like TESO, FF, and F76 are also going through a rough period, while AAA projects like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rust-director-offers-25-million-to-keep-new-world-alive/">New World</a> are simply shutting down.</p>



<p>The MMORPG genre truly struggles to survive and compete with session-based games.</p>



<p>In our view, the only viable path forward is to combine genres, taking their strongest elements and creating a mix.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s what GFA Games did with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-roadmap-revealed-ambitious-few-months/">PIONER</a>. It has arena-based elements like traditional multiplayer matches, some battle royale mechanics, the classic MMO vibe, and the post-apocalyptic action-RPG feel you get from games like Metro and Fallout. It’s an open-world construct with multiple maps, countless threats, and stacks of missions to solve, and progression is everywhere.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-pioner">What’s Next for PIONER</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a showcase of post-apocalyptic vibes</figcaption></figure>







<p>Nikitin was generous enough to give me a look behind the veil of what comes next for PIONER.</p>



<p>There are plenty of aspirations to go above and beyond at GFA Games, which is great news for anyone neck-deep in PIONER, but also for anyone curious about the game and wanting to experience it on other platforms.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have ambitious plans to lay the foundation for a console release, further develop the game’s story, and create new modules.</p>



<p>We plan to focus on developing and optimizing the in-game economy.</p>



<p>We also plan to delight players with new content that was not ready for inclusion in the intitial early access version but already has strong groundwork. This includes new locations such as Big Earth and Shadowlands, new world bosses, and a number of features that are only now beginning development based on player requests.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Throughout the interview, it’s clear how much Nikitin and his team value community feedback. That’s the gist that I got from the game when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-open-beta-launches-again-new-trailer/">I was testing it</a> ahead of the early access launch and experiencing it <strong>after </strong>it dropped. It’s the <strong>only way </strong>to develop a game that only survives if people are actively playing it.</p>



<p>In my opinion, PIONER is an underrated gem of the MMORPG space that deserves way more attention.</p>

            <p>A Netease spokesperson has told Eurogamer that statements made by Suda 51 on its generative AI policy are not correct, and that the company continues to work with the technology.</p>
<p>The spokesperson has also pointed to an upcoming GDC talk hosted by Netease covering generative AI."The assertion that NetEase Games has closed an AI department or that we've mandated teams or studios not to use AI is not true," said a representative speaking on behalf of the publisher. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-has-told-their-studios-not-to-use-ai-at-all/">Elsewhere</a>, NetEase has offered a comment saying: "The situation described did not occur, and we have not published any related policies".</p>
<p>Suda 51, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-melting-faces-generative-ai-jazz-band">talking to Eurogamer as part of an interview on Grasshopper Manufacture's upcoming game Romeo is a Dead Man</a>, stated the following: "They originally had a section researching and developing AI-related stuff, but at one point they decided not to do that any more. They folded that section and told their studios to not use AI in games, to not use it at all."</p>
<p>"I don't know, they never explained directly why," Suda continued. "If I had to assume, it was probably one or both of two things. A lot of gamers out there don't like AI and having it in their games. Another thing is issues with copyright infringement. That can be tricky to get around, and clear before making something. That was probably part of it too - it would be easier to get rid of it altogether. But, again, that's my assumption. No one told me directly."</p>

<p>As for Grasshopper's own involvement with generative AI, Suda 51 also stated the company had not done any research into AI, and he believes there's something in the human brain that tells them something is off when they see it.</p><p>Suda told Eurogamer: "At some point there may be this thing I've heard be called the "New Reality", but even if it does get to that point and it's really good and realistic, I feel humans have something in their brain that tells them something is off. So while I don't have a strict opinion either way on people using it in their own games, that's not the way we do it. That's one of the things that bring people to Grasshopper games - they can feel people's efforts themselves. It's something we're proud of.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon To Kick Off 30th Anniversary Celebrations At The Super Bowl]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-to-kick-off-30th-anniversary-celebrations-at-the-super-bowl</link>
            <guid>1425391</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> will be at the Super Bowl! No, they're not taking to the field — we're not sure we'd want to see some cute critters get trampled on during the biggest night in sports (though we reckon Machamp could sack Drake Maye or Sam Darnold), but the franchise will be bringing a commercial to the show.</p>
<p>Super Bowl commercials are usually a big deal, and with Pokémon about to celebrate its 30th anniversary, what better time to kick off the party than on 8th February 2026, during the game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks. As an aside, the <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> is <em>also</em> meant to <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/super-bowl-movie-trailers-preview-2026-1236705023/">be getting a trailer</a>, so that's two things to keep an eye out for.</p>
<p>For Pokémon, at least, we have a little teaser to go on that shows Jigglypuff in what looks like a comfy backstage area. The pink Pokémon is mostly chilling on the sofa, but they move around every so often. We also get another look at the 30th anniversary logo, a simple Pikachu face with 3 and 0 replacing its red cheeks.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-30th-Celebration-Teaser">press release</a>, The Pokémon Company International says that the commercial is intended to kick off a yearlong campaign for the franchise, and that "More details about the yearlong campaign will be unveiled following Super Bowl LX, including fan-focused activations."</p>
<p>But, ahead of Sunday, if you head over to the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/30th-celebration">Pokémon Center</a>, you can check out a whole range of 30th anniversary apparel and goods, which are on sale right now.</p>
<figure data-uuid="52c1591b86339"><a title="Pokemon 30th anniversary apparel" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/52c1591b86339/pokemon-30th-anniversary-apparel.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Don't expect any big announcements from the commercial itself, though. We expect we'll be getting the usual Pokémon Presents on the 27th February, which is when some of the bigger gaming news will hit.</p>
<p>For now, just enjoy Jigglypuff. And if you happen to be in New York later this month, then why not plan a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-30th-anniversary-nintendo-store-event-announced-us">trip to the Nintendo Store for some 30th anniversary goodness</a> on the date?</p>
