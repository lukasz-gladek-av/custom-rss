            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Tencent have rebuffed Sony’s claims that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/light-of-motiram/">Light of Motiram</a> is a “slavish clone” of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/horizon-zero-dawn/">Horizon franchise</a> and that it copies multiple elements from they games that would confuse consumers.&nbsp; Sony asked the court to award unspecified damages and block the release of Light of Motiram, Tencent are asking for the whole thing to be thrown out of court.</p>
<p><iframe title="Light of Motiram - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0Of5Xjdwbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Plaintiff Sony has sued a grab-bag of Tencent companies—and ten unnamed defendants—about the unreleased video game&nbsp;Light of Motiram, alleging that the game copies elements from Sony’s game&nbsp;Horizon Zero Dawn and its spinoffs,” the complaint reads, according to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/">TheGamePost.</a></p>
<p>“At bottom, Sony’s effort is not aimed at fighting off piracy, plagiarism, or any genuine threat to intellectual property. It is an improper attempt to fence off a well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it Sony’s exclusive domain.”</p>
<p>I won’t bore you with the rest of the legal waffle but the short version is that Tencent claim that elements such as a red-haired heroine, robotic creatures, and ruined cities are tropes that can be found in many video games, and they give examples such as Far Cry, BioMutant, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west/">Enslaved: Odyssey to the West</a>. Sony themselves published a Ninja Theory game with a red haired heroine, Heavenly Sword, but that doesn’t get a mention.</p>

<p>“In Sony’s telling, Horizon Zero Dawn is ‘like no fictional world created before [or] since.’ That claim is startling, because it is flatly contradicted by Sony’s own developers, not to mention the long history of video games featuring the same elements that Sony seeks to monopolize through this lawsuit,” say Tencent.</p>
<p>That line about Sony’s own developers may be a problem for the PlayStation giant. Sony released a documentary about the making of Horizon Zero Dawn, and in it, Jan-Bart Van Beek, the art director for the game, references Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and suggests the new Horizon title is similar: “I don’t think we should do this; it touches too much of these other points.”</p>
<p>“Long before this lawsuit was filed, the developers of Horizon Zero Dawn publicly acknowledged that the very same game elements that, today, Sony claims to own exclusively, were in fact borrowed from an earlier game,” say Tencent.&nbsp;Enslaved is an action game with mechanical beasties set in a ruined landscape but the hero is male, the red-haired character, Trip, is not playable.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enslaved: Odyssey to the West - PS3  Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nzwQX_orYf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking at Enslaved at first glance it does resemble Horizon but I don’t think Tencent have much of a chance, Sony’s complaint isn’t really about claiming all the individual elements are their own, they are claiming the combination of all these things, along with the art style and music, make Light of Motiram a copy of Horizon.&nbsp; Their claim is comparable to a claim over music copyright; there are only so many notes and everyone uses them, but if you put them in the same order as someone else, then you are making a copy.</p>
<p>Tencent have recently <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/11/all-similarities-between-light-of-motiram-and-horizon-have-been-wiped-from-steam/">wiped every similarity between Light of Motiram and Horizon from the Steam store page</a> and removed all official videos of the game. References to world a “overrun by colossal machines” called “mechanimals” has been removed, as have all the shots of the beasts and the Aloy-like heroine.</p>
<p>Now, can we please, please have that remaster of Enslaved now?</p>

                <p>After several years of being a PlayStation console exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-release-date-confirmed/1100-6534646/">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is headed to Xbox Series X|S and Switch 2</a> in early 2026. Depending on how confident you feel, the game can be fairly challenging with its blend of real-time combat and action-RPG elements. But if you're looking to cruise through each battle and just focus on the story, then you can choose to play the game with the "Streamlined Progression" options enabled.</p><p>This makes Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade even easier than the old-school combat mode that slows the action to a crawl with menu-based commands, giving you an extended window to choose your tactics. Streamlined Progression gives you unlimited MP and HP at all times, unlimited limit and ATB gauges during battles, and every attack will deal a whopping 9,999 points of damage.</p><p>Additionally, you'll gain a faster weapon ability charge, and with some exceptions, you'll always possess the maximum number of items at all times. This mode can be toggled on and off at any given time from the main menu.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4570949-ff7-remake-mode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570949" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4570949-ff7-remake-mode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570949"></a><figcaption>Sephiroth won't be smiling for long.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4570949-ff7-remake-mode.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-mtg-preorder-bonuses-release-date/1100-6534723/">Square Enix has also revealed several of the preorder bonuses</a> for the launch of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on new platforms.

			<p>While CD PROJEKT RED is focused mainly on The Witcher IV, work at the new Boston office is already ongoing on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel codenamed Project Orion. As of July 2025, 116 developers were already on the project, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently in the pre-production phase</a>. That number is expected to grow steadily, including an intriguing new position for Lead Network Engineer that already has fans guessing at potential online multiplayer modes. Here's the relevant excerpt from the <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/jobs/20217-lead-network-engineer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job ad</a>:  </p>



<p><em>CD PROJEKT RED is currently seeking a Lead Network Engineer to join our team working on Cyberpunk 2, the next mainline Cyberpunk 2077 game. As a Lead Network Engineer, you and your team will play a pivotal role in designing and implementing the network architecture and online systems. You will lead and manage a team of talented engineers, working collaboratively to ensure seamless and robust online systems.</em></p>



<p><em>We are seeking a candidate with a blend of proven management experience and technical expertise in networking for games.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Design, implement, and maintain scalable and efficient network architectures for online features.</em></li>



<li><em>Ensure low-latency, high-performance online experiences for players.</em></li>



<li><em>Lead your team to develop and optimize multiplayer systems, including matchmaking, and address challenges related to latency, bandwidth usage, and server performance.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><em><strong>Qualifications</strong></em></p>



<p><em>Proven track record of leadership in a senior network engineering role</em></p>



<p>As our readers might recall, Cyberpunk 2077 was supposed to receive online multiplayer post-launch. However, just a few months after the game's December 2020 release, CD PROJEKT RED d<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-plan-reconsidered-by-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ecided to reconsider its multiplayer strategy</a>, effectively delaying it so that it might be applied to future projects instead. That made sense at the time, especially due to Cyberpunk 2077's launch issues, such as bugs and performance, particularly on consoles.</p>



<p>Now, the studio appears to believe it's time to go all-in for the sequel. We never really got any inkling as to how the multiplayer would work in the first game, but given the open world city setting, fans have speculated that it could play not too dissimilar to GTA Online, albeit with its own twists.</p>



<p>Recently, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/keanu-reeves-absolutely-play-johnny-silverhand-cyberpunk-2077-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that Keanu Reeves would love to return as Johnny Silverhand in the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel. Mike Pondsmith, creator of the fictional universe, also <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that there will be a second city in addition to Night City, and that it will feel like 'Chicago gone wrong'.</p>



<p>It's worth noting that Project Orion is at least four or five years away, if not more. Fans will have to brace for a long wait.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app for Switch Online subscribers typically gets one update per week, but this week is a little bit different.</p>
<p>Following the shadow drop of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a> DLC on the Switch 2 last week, Nintendo has now added a "special release" to this app featuring select music from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. It's similar to the recent update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, which also added a handful of tracks.</p>
<p>Here's a sample of the tracks in this update including Kong Bananza, 2D Challenge Course #1 (Jungle Level), and Breaking Through (Heart of Gold). You can have a listen below:</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4yqklxm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo has also rolled out new themed Switch Online icons based on the new DLC for Donkey Kong Bananza. The first wave starts this week and will be followed by three other waves. Here's a look at the icons up for grabs:</p>

How<a href="https://aftermath.site/humankind-re-review-amplitude-impressions-pc-sega-4x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Humankind</em> is now merely OK instead of Not Great</a>. How<a href="https://aftermath.site/millennia-4x-paradox-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> many of the newcomers to the genre have got nearly everything about it wrong</a>. It really feels like something is going increasingly awry at the heart of the genre, and <em>Endless Legend 2</em>--an Early Access game I've been playing for the past week--is no exception.</p><p>To recap: the original was released back in 2014, adding tactical battles and some cool factional and narrative twists to what was even then looking like a genre in need of some fresh air. And it worked! People <em>loved </em>that game,<a href="https://kotaku.com/endless-legend-the-kotaku-review-1655274702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> myself included</a>, and so fans have been hanging out for a <em>very </em>long time to play the sequel, arriving on September 22 in Early Access 11 years later.</p><p>The thing is, a lot has changed in those 11 years. After years of listing to port, <em>Civilization </em>appears to have finally run aground, and in the middle of that decade <em>Endless Legend's</em> developers, Amplitude, released their own wannabe <em>Civ</em>-killer, <em>Humankind</em>, a game that had some very cool ideas but which also robbed the 4X experience of a lot of its personality, and ended up being pretty boring as a result. I think of all <em>Civ VII's</em> missteps, the worst was that it copied the parts of <em>Humankind </em>that least needed copying. Sadly (if not surprisingly, given it’s the same studio!), <em>Endless Legend 2</em> has now done the same thing.</p><p><em>Endless Legend 2</em> is a game that simultaneously looks gorgeous but is also overwhelming. That appears busy but feels meaningless, because so many of your endless (sorry) notifications are for the most mundane pieces of city-building. There's so much going on at all times, but I quickly found myself numb to the drudgery of progression, of endlessly (SORRY) encountering the same people triggering the same dialogue. <em>Humankind </em>had this same problem, in that watching all those units swoosh around on such a beautiful map is meditative, but not <em>interesting</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ENDLESS™ Legend 2 - Reveal Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5rvxUoYFDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I want to find whoever is responsible for modern 4X's obsession with adjacency bonuses and their resultant megacities and tell them just how disappointed I am. The enormous settlements you have to build in <em>Endless Legend 2</em>--just like those you have to build in <em>Humankind</em>, and <em>Civ VI</em>, and <em>Civ VII</em>--sprawl across half a continent, look ridiculous and even become gameplay concerns later on because, with so much else going on and gently pinging you constantly on the interface, and with 117 units gliding across the screen at all times, you can completely miss the fact they're <em>under attack</em>.</p><p>For all the issues I’ve raised thus far, <em>Endless Legend 2</em> also continues many of the best things about <em>Endless Legend 1</em>, like asymmetrical factions and a very strong insistence on weaving story into the game. The former feels pretty limited right now (only five factions were available in the build I played, meaning you just keep running into the same leaders all the time), and the latter does a much better job of weaving the story into your games, down to turning dialogue options into victory pathway selections, which is a <em>fantastic </em>idea. But again, with the same story repeating each playthrough, and this being the kind of game designed to be played through a <em>lot</em>, it gets tired pretty quickly.</p><p><em>Endless Legend 2</em> also has maybe the single most fascinating 4X twist I've ever seen, in that you start the game on a reasonably normal map--some different types of identifiably Earth-like climate, surrounded by ocean--and then throughout the game these huge storms happen, after which the ocean gets sucked out and the amount of landmass keeps increasing in its place. In theory it's like <em>Civ VII's</em> map getting bigger at the exploration age, but in practice it's much more dramatic, even visually; while the original land area is full of grass and forests, the "new" land is a variety of weird alien undersea stuff. The first time it happened, I gasped. But like so many other attempts at 4X innovation, I'm not sure I'm into it in the longterm, because once the novelty wore off it made the map feel both crowded and indistinct, every game ending up a single chaotic mass of regions all sharing land borders.</p><p>One thing I did like without reservation was the way it continues to get right into the weeds of jacking the game full of fantasy RPG stuff. Your hero units can be levelled up and equipped with loot, but they also just pop up sometimes to have conversations. You can even build them little houses on the map where they can, uh, get married to other characters in the game? Which then prompts even more little dialogue sequences and hero perks? It's wonderful stuff, and really has you investing in the <em>character </em>of your best units.</p><figure></figure><p>Maybe my genre gripes are just a me problem, or at least a generational problem for others who have been playing 4X games for so long. I've been playing Civilization since the first game's release back in 1991; it's now 2025, so it would be totally normal for me to be numb to so much of the genre's bedrock. And yet,<a href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I still find myself drawn to older games built on that very bedrock</a>, and have become increasingly turned off by newer games’ attempts to shift the genre's boundaries.</p><p>This has become a piece about so many other games, not just <em>Endless Legend 2</em>, because so many of these games have done the same thing. The two biggest studios making the two biggest series of 4X games, responsible for nearly all of its best-selling titles of the past decade, are both trying to take the genre to a place that I just...don't like.</p><p>4X games became a thing because they empowered players and let them feel things in a strategy game they'd never felt before. The feeling of being a small tribe, alone in an unknown world, facing the darkness. Of running into rivals who were passionate and erratic and memorable as characters, not just AI trading partners. Of the world you knew so little about feeling <em>vast</em>. And while there was management to be done, so much of the more tedious stuff was kept under the hood.</p><p>Firaxis and Amplitude's more recent games, built with <em>Civ's</em> own board game heritage in mind, have shrunk the borders of that world. Everything feels smaller, less like a planet, more like a game of <em>Catan </em>confined to your dining room table. And the numbers, whose obfuscation was once the point, are now everywhere. These are no longer games about exploring, expanding, exploiting and exterminating. They're about adjacency bonuses.</p><p>Which is fine to a point; the formula has been shaken up because it needed to be, I'm not questioning that. Innovation is good! But I had such high hopes for <em>Endless Legend 2</em>, given how much I loved its predecessor, so I've been bummed to see it fall into the same pothole as so many other big games in this space lately.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't know if things will always be like this, or whether they're just a consequence of the game launching perhaps a little too early into Early Access (I’ve played an early release of this build, which goes on sale on September 22). In 6-12 months’ time, who knows: Amplitude might add more factions and story options to the point where things feel more fleshed out and hang together a bit more elegantly.</p><p>Until then, though, I'm left looking at a game that promised so much, but has slipped on the same ol' banana peels, and also maybe launched a bit too soon. It'll take some time, and work, before I want to spend another whole week with it.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/arma-trans-platoon"><h3>Arma Can Be A Boys Club, But This Trans Women-Only Platoon Aims To Change That</h3></a><p>'It’s a community that is made for the trans community...

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/two-of-the-best-co-op-games-of-all-time-launch-today-on-nintendo-switch/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I do like to play co-op games. Luckily for me, there’s enough of us kicking around in TSA towers that we’re able to generally find someone of a similar mind to play a game with. If you’re a Nintendo Switch owner, you’re probably pretty used to the odd spot of co-op too, and that’s about to get better as today marks the launch of two of the greatest co-op puzzle adventures of all time, appearing for the first time for Nintendo’s handheld hybrid. Those games are the iconic We Were Here and We Were Here Too, the first two games in the We Were Here series. </p>
<p><iframe title="We Were Here &amp; We Were Here Too Launch Trailer I Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUn4X9HajDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frankly, if you’ve got a co-op buddy to call on, I’d tell you to just go and pick them up now, but if not, then here’s a little context in order to get you interested. The We Were Here series has captivated players with its co-op puzzle designs and challenging duos to think outside the box since 2017, when We Were Here launched as a free game that has now been downloaded almost 10 million times. </p>
<p>Since then, the We Were Here series has been enjoyed by more than 20 million players. We Were Here Expeditions: The FriendShip is the latest release and it broke all previous records out of the water by hitting more than 8 million downloads within its first year. The puzzling adventures are playable in any order, although a common narrative thread runs through them.</p>
<p>Communication and lateral thinking are your two biggest weapons in the We Were Here series, and things are made all the more interesting by physically having to activate the in-game walkie-talkie to communicate with your teammate. This leads to all sorts of shenanigans on the way to solving each puzzle, and there’s just such a strong sense of identity and visual design that you can’t help but be drawn ever further into its idisyncratic world. </p>

<p>Players can pre-purchase the third entry of the series, We Were Here Together, on September 25 in the Nintendo eShop. A demo will then also be playable from September 25 to 28 at the Total Mayhem Games booth at Tokyo Game Show. The release of We Were Here Together will follow on October 9.</p>
<p>The We Were Here series, including We Were Here, We Were Here Too, and We Were Here Together, has also undergone significant enhancements. These include a visual overhaul, updated user interface, expanded settings, additional language translations, bug fixes, and cross-platform compatibility with PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. These updates are also making their way to other platforms, with full implementation expected by 9 October 2025.</p>
<p>﻿The We Were Here games will be fully compatible with Nintendo Switch™ and Nintendo Switch™ 2. A Nintendo Switch Online Membership and a headset with a microphone (or a different way to communicate with your partner) will be required to play the We Were Here Series on Nintendo Switch™ and Nintendo Switch 2).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sometimes, a game speaks to you before you know anything about it. Absolum, the latest collaboration between DotEmu, Supamonks and Guard Crush, captures your attention with every single glance thanks to its incredible visual design, but it’s fair to say that being beautiful is not its only trick. Excited Rogue ’em up fans can get a new glimpse of the hard-hitting combat and exploration in the latest gameplay trailer, stoking the fires of excitement even further.</p>
<p><iframe title="Absolum | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3zhPXKrv3M?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For anyone that grew up on games like Golden Axe, Streets of Rage and Final Fight, Absolum will immediately hit home, as you stroll from left to right dealing out as much damage as possible against a host of horrible monsters and their evil accomplices. This isn’t quite your dad’s beat ’em up though, as Absolum straps on a modern Roguelike structure, making the way that you progress, improve and evolve an ever-shifting experience as you search for the perfect run.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game earlier in the year – when I say we, I mean me – and I came away thoroughly impressed with the beautiful visuals and the exceptional combat. That’s hardly surprising when you think that DotEmu and Guard Crush are just coming off the success of games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-platforming-perfection/">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>. </p>


<p>Looking back, I said, “On early impressions alone, Guard Crush have crafted something truly special with Absolum. It looks and sounds incredible, and the Roguelike action is made all the more tantalising by discovering new areas and hideous enemies to fight. I can’t wait to see more.” After this new trailer, that’s truer than ever, and there’s not all that long to wait now, with Absolum set to release on October 9th for PC, Switch and PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 as well. </p>

              <p>Windows may prove a perfectly suitable platform for gaming on a traditional PC, but on handheld devices like the ROG Ally, Legion Go, or even the Steam Deck, it’s another story. Microsoft’s operating system is often too clunky and frustrating when you’re restricted to a gamepad for input. The upcoming Xbox-branded Ally from Asus, however, has promised a solution with a dedicated, controller-friendly user interface for running PC games on the go. These devices have yet to hit shelves, but a downloadable preview of a new version of Windows 11 is giving folks access to the new interface on just about any Windows handheld device.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-microsoft-steam-deck-steamos-xbox-pc-handhelds-1851735440">Steam Ate Microsoft’s Lunch On PC, It’s About To Do The Same On Handhelds</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780388/microsoft-xbox-fullscreen-mode-windows-11-handheld-leak">As noted by <i>The Verge</i></a>, The upcoming 25H2 update for Windows 11 lets you launch the new gaming-focused, fullscreen Xbox app for Windows with just a few tweaks to the registry and the help of a third-party tool (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1niwsfi/guide_for_enabling_the_full_screen_experience_on/">a Reddit post by user Gogsi123</a> outlines the whole process). Unlike the overlay that software companies like Asus provide for their Windows handhelds, this new Xbox app skips the entire Windows desktop environment in favor of a fullscreen, controller-friendly experience. And people are finding, by way of the preview workaround, that it seems to lead to marginal performance gains as well.</p>

Since then, other PC manufacturers have jumped in with Windows-based options. More recently, <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465">the power of the Switch 2</a> has made it something of a competitor in this space as well.</p>

 <p>It’s all the stranger, then, that we’re not actually sure exactly how much Microsoft and Asus’ collaboration is going to cost. According to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-retailer-leak-suggests-surprising-price-point">report from former <i>IGN</i> writer Destin Legarie</a>, a local Best Buy indicated that a $549 version and an $899 one would be available when he called to ask about it. If this is accurate, that puts the lower-tier version of the Xbox Ally at the same price as the smaller-capacity Steam Deck OLED, and within competitive pricing range of the current ROG Ally and Ally X, which retail for about $649 and $899, respectively.</p>  <p>Having enjoyed my time with the ROG Ally X, I can definitely attest to the value of having more games available on a handheld that’s running Windows instead of Valve’s Linux-based SteamOS, though I typically prefer the form factor and controller-focused interface of the Steam Deck. Now, if a few tweaks to the Windows registry can also give people that experience on a non-Xbox Ally X, I imagine it’ll be harder to find a use case for the Xbox Ally for those who already own a handheld gaming device and aren’t afraid to tinker with their machines.</p>

I wasn’t sure how he was going to incorporate that into the second season of <em>Peacemaker</em>, but viewers are pretty sure he’s found a way.</p><p>As someone who has a very high tolerance for James Gunn’s whole thing—<a href="https://www.troma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Troma Entertainment</a> levels of gore, dumb dirty jokes, extremely chatty characters, endlessly rehashing complicated feelings about your dad—I’ve come to understand that his politics are pretty simple. He doesn’t like that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HETgzbkvwuw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Louis CK&nbsp; jerked off in front of a lot of women</a>, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kebqC4vxxdY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loves animals</a>, and he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYYvhiNLZ-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fucking <em>hates</em> Nazis</a>. In <em>Creature Commandos</em>, a cartoon he wrote after being given the keys to the DC cinematic universe, he dedicated an entire episode to the origins of GI Robot, a robot who was designed with the sole directive of killing Nazis. And kill Nazis he does!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="GI Robot’s Fate (Coin-Operated Boy) | Creature Commandos" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEZAMa5MqLI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>How does this connect to <em>Peacemaker</em>? Peacemaker, played by John Cena, keeps trying to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/peacemaker-was-a-comic-book-show-in-all-the-right-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make amends for the kind of man he was raised to be</a>. His dad was a white nationalist—and Peacemaker killed him at the end of the last season. However, at the start of this season, Peacemaker found a portal to a seemingly perfect universe where his dad and also his deceased brother Keith are still alive, and the three of them are heralded as heroes. In this universe, Peacemaker might be able to get together with a version of Amelia Harcourt, who wants nothing to do with him in his original universe despite their intense sexual tension and mutual affection for each other. Peacemaker repeatedly calls this universe the “best universe ever,” and so far, it seems like it is—were it not for one detail.</p><p>Any universe where Peacemaker’s dad, an open white supremacist, is heralded as a hero is probably one I, and plenty of other people, would not be welcome in. More than that, I was struck by the way Peacemaker’s brother pronounced the name of the city “Blüdhaven.” Most of the time, characters in the DC Universe pronounce this city’s name as “Bloodhaven,” hilariously. But Keith pronounced “Bluthaven,” which is closer to how it would be pronounced in German, and, well….</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="That's what a nazi would say meme GI Robot" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C3dFP6s9txQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Most telling for me, though, is the absolute lack of people of color. It’s actually chilling once you start to notice it. As Peacemaker ventures out into this alternate universe, I was not able to spot a single Black, Latino, or Asian person, nor any other race other than white. In fact, there doesn’t appear to be any <em>extras</em> who are people of color, something corroborated by an extra who posted to the show’s subreddit.</p><p>“Everyone I remember seeing was at least white-presenting,” a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PeacemakerShow/comments/1ncrj9r/i_was_a_background_actor_in_peacemaker_s2e3_ama/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">background actor wrote</a> on Reddit.&nbsp; “I think the Nazi/white supremacist dimension theories have credibility.”</p><p>There are some other little tells that something is at least off with this universe. Keith doesn’t know who the Kardashians are—perhaps because OJ Simpson never existed, meaning that Robert Kardashian would never have been catapulted to national recognition for representing Simpson at his murder trial. Emilia Harcourt also appears to not know what the phrase “what’s happening?” is a reference to. <em>What’s Happening!! </em>was a sitcom about a Black family from the 1970s, and <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/what-s-happening-star-ernest-thomas-show-s-impact-race-t215884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a landmark in terms of depicting Black families</a> on television. Weirdest of all, the show goes out of its way to <em>not</em> show the audience a hot dog vendor. Like, it feels bizarre to watch the lengths that the show goes to in order to shoot around this hot dog vendor’s body. Is it because many people who own and operate food trucks in real life and in filmed media are often not white? Who’s to say, but it’s <em>fucking strange</em>.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://press.wbd.com/us/image/pm220509042024jm6080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Photograph by Jessica Miglio/HBO Max </a></figcaption></figure><p>This is all the more notable because the rest of <em>Peacemaker</em> is almost self consciously racially diverse. Peacemaker’s best friend is Leota Adebayo, a Black lesbian played by the hilarious Danielle Brooks. This season has added two more characters of color in ARGUS agents Langston Fleury (Tim Meadows) and Sasha Bordeaux (Sol Rodriguez), who also team up with last season’s Judomaster, a Vietnamese character played by Nhut Le. The universe that Peacemaker comes from has its characters of color front and center, impossible to ignore, which makes their absence feel even more conspicuous in the alternate universe.</p><p>Of course, having something be subtly wrong with an alternate universe that appears perfect is just sensible writing for the journey that Peacemaker has gone on in these two seasons of television. Peacemaker has already rejected his father’s teachings once, but he’s still looking for the easy way out in terms of making amends for the harm he has caused. It would be <em>easy</em> to escape to this seemingly perfect universe—but if fan theories are correct, it would mean rejecting the humanity of Leota Adebayo, who has stood by his side and always believed in him, even when he was at his lowest. In Peacemaker’s quest to be a better man, can he reject a world where his happiness would come at the expense of people like Adebayo? It’s a test of character that would demonstrate how far Peacemaker has come from his first appearance in <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, where he declared “I cherish peace with all of my heart. I don't care how many men, women and children I kill to get it.”</p><p><em>Peacemaker</em> fans will learn if their suspicions about this alternate universe are correct tonight, as Adebayo is poised to go there for the first time—we’re all going to find out if this is a white supremacist universe pretty fucking quick. As for me, I’m hoping Gunn can squeeze in another appearance from GI Robot.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/arma-trans-platoon"><h3>Arma Can Be A Boys Club, But This Trans Women-Only Platoon Aims To Change That</h3></a><p>'It’s a community that is made for the trans community...

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The trailer for <em>Critical Role</em> Campaign 4 has arrived. The newest campaign by the acclaimed actual play series will introduce a new expansive cast of characters, a different face behind the GM screen, and a brand new fantasy setting. All of this and more are teased in this trailer.</p>



<p>The official <em>Critical Role</em> Campaign 4 trailer is light on artwork, but heavy on atmosphere. It is carried with voice-over by GM Brennan Lee Mulligan, dropping events and proper names like the Falconer's Rebellion, the Sundered Houses, and the Revolutionary Council, and stating that the players' grandparents have defied the gods.</p>


<p>This worldbuilding is crucial since the major selling point of Campaign 4 is that it is not set in Matt Mercer's world of Exandria. Instead, it is set in the world of Araman, a world that has recently seen the death of their gods. Because of this, the trailer is helping set the world of Araman apart from the land that hosted the heroics of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-3-review-darker-season-of-dd-twists" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vox Machina</a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-announces-mighty-nein-release-date-first-image-of-yasha" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mighty Nein</a>.</p>

<p>When paired with the video description, the <em>Critical Role</em> Campaign 4 trailer seems to confirm where this story will begin. The party is brought together to uncover the truth of the fate of hero Thjazi Fang, who has been marked for execution. To this end, they will journey across the fractured world and connect in ways never imagined.</p>

<p>This campaign is one packed with firsts for the actual play series. This is the first long-form campaign not GM'd by <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a9a9913f-42e9-4189-bbde-08061c01a7e8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/matthew-mercer-interview" rel="nofollow">Matt Mercer</a>; instead, it will be helmed by Dimension20's own Brennan Lee Mulligan. In addition, the campaign will be done West Marches-style, spanning three tables of characters set in different locations across the vast fantasy setting of Araman.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I recently got to play more <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-framerate-fps-xbox-series-s-ps5-2000626043"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a>, but this time on the game’s two biggest maps, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bigger-maps-leak-datamine-eastwood-mirak-ea-bf-labs-2000618202">I had a blast playing in these big ol’ stages.</a> But when I got a chance to speak to the devs behind <em>Battlefield 6</em>, I had to ask a strange question: Do you all have a button that lets you blow up everything that is destructible in the franchise’s famously destructible maps? The answer was yes, and there’s a good reason why.</p> <p>During a Zoom interview with DICE producer Jeremy Chubb and design director Shashank Uchil, we talked about all the work that goes into making a big<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487"><em> Battlefield</em></a> map and how much effort they put into remaking the iconic and beloved Operation Firestorm map, which will be available in <em>BF6</em> at launch. But, when our conversation veered into talking about how to balance maps that can blow up in all kinds of ways, I had to ask if they had a tool or button that lets them destroy everything in one click. So I asked and got a blunt answer:</p> <p>“Yeah,” said Chubb. I then asked if it was fun to hit that button, and both Chubb and Uchil replied, with laughter in their voices, that yes, it was indeed fun to hit that big button.</p>

 <p><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d7e0" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d7e1"><span title="Play starting at 21:44"><span data-start="1303560" data-end="1315620">“It is fun!” Chubb told <em>Kotaku</em> while laughing more. “It usually causes some big meltdowns in teams working on performance because we designed the maps not to be instantly triggered, like every instance of destruction [all at once]. </span></span></span><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d7ec" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d7ed"><span title="Play starting at 21:56"><span data-start="1315620" data-end="1317120">And [the button was pressed] a few times, and t</span></span></span><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d7f8" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d7f9"><span title="Play starting at 21:57"><span data-start="1317380" data-end="1321860" data-active="">here were some raised eyebrows about what we were doing for sure.”&nbsp;</span></span></span></p> <p>When I mentioned that EA should release GIFs of the maps completely blowing up after hitting that button, Uchil said that was a “good idea.” So you’re welcome, EA marketing team.</p>

  <h2>The reason for <em>BF6</em>‘s big red button</h2> <p>You might be wondering why there’s a button in Frostbite, the engine <em>BF6</em> is built on, that lets you blow up an entire map instantly. The answer is so that the team can easily playtest the map in its most destroyed state to make sure it’s still fun and balanced.</p> <p><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d894" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d895"><span title="Play starting at 22:36"><span data-start="1356460" data-end="1360900" data-active="">“So…think of the map as [having] three different states, right,” explained Uchil. “</span></span></span><span tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8a1"><span title="Play starting at 22:41"><span data-start="1361360" data-end="1366080">The map starts out in a pristine state, or however it is meant to be at the beginning. </span></span></span><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8ac" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8ad"><span title="Play starting at 22:47"><span data-start="1367020" data-end="1369560">And then, as the map progresses, it gets more and more destroyed. </span></span></span><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8b8" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8b9"><span title="Play starting at 22:51"><span data-start="1370780" data-end="1375980">And towards the end, if everybody’s using a rocket launcher or C4, you hit peak destruction. </span></span></span><span tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8c5"><span title="Play starting at 22:58"><span data-start="1377640" data-end="1383740">And like I said, the game has to be good in all three phases, the pristine phase, the in-between phase, and the final phase.”</span></span></span></p>

 <p>According to Uchil, the “big red button” is the best tool for quickly testing that final phase of each map.</p> <p>“You can see what is the worst-case scenario,” said Uchil.&nbsp; “<span tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8e9"><span title="Play starting at 23:11"><span data-start="1390500" data-end="1391460">Is there enough cover? </span></span></span><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8f4" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8f5"><span title="Play starting at 23:12"><span data-start="1391800" data-end="1393320">Do we need to add some more things? </span></span></span>Do we need to bring some more assets s<span tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d90d"><span title="Play starting at 23:15"><span data-start="1394920" data-end="1397200">o in the final stage, it’s still fun to play? </span></span></span>So yeah, that’s why we have the big button.”</p> <p>At this point, I was fully distracted by the idea of the button, and asked if anyone had ever pressed it by accident. That doesn’t seem to have happened, and because the maps weren’t built to instantly explode, it could lead to problems if it did.</p>

 <p><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11da80" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11da81"><span title="Play starting at 25:11"><span data-start="1510520" data-end="1522440">“I mean, we have times when you can crash a bunch of things,” said Uchil. “The destruction is meant to happen in parts. </span></span></span><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11da8c" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11da8d"><span title="Play starting at 25:24"><span data-start="1523580" data-end="1527720">But if everything explodes at the same time, then it would melt down your computer.”</span></span></span></p> <p>Now I hope someone is able to mod <em>Battlefield 6</em> after it launches on October 10 and either activate this button as part of a wild mod or recreate its functionality. I really just want to hit a big button and make an entire map go ka-boom. That sounds like a blast. And after talking to the devs, it seems they agree.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is officially out next week, on September 25, 2025, but that official release date hasn't stopped physical copies of the game from finding their way out into the wild early. While physical copies of a racing game don't exactly mean big narrative spoilers are about to hit the wire the way it would for other titles getting out early, in this case, it does seem to mean the rest of the DLC collaborations SEGA had planned getting leaked early.</p>



<p>A photo of a postcard that came with physical copies of the game, which is stored inside the case, shows the remaining three collaborations that SEGA has yet to announce for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. The image was posted to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1nkh9h8/so_about_the_final_unannounced_collab_dlc/">Sonic the Hedgehog Reddit</a>, revealing that the next three collaborations after the already announced Minecraft, Pac-Man, and Spongebob collaborations are: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Avatar Legends, and Mega Man.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, this doesn't necessarily reveal which characters from each of the above series will be included. The <a href="https://asia.sega.com/SonicRacingCrossWorlds/en/racers.html">official website</a> for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds shows eight mystery spots in the roster of DLC characters. Half of those could be filled by the Turtles, but the image specifically lists TMNT: Mutant Mayhem, so we could see other characters beyond the four teenage turtles, and that's before mentioning that there might be a greater focus on including characters from the other three series.</p>



<p>At the very least, we know to expect new tracks, characters, and vehicles related to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Avatar Legends, and Megaman. Also, since this information was featured in a postcard coming with physical copies of the game that will be officially available in just a few days, it's likely we'll hear a proper announcement from SEGA regarding these DLC collaborations soon.</p>



<p>In the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">Wccftech's review</a> of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds from Nathan Birch, who writes, "<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a solid alternative to other games in the mascot-racer space, offering speedy, stripped-down action, a few clever twists, and perhaps most importantly for some folks, courses that feel more like those in Mario Kart 8 than the less universally-beloved Mario Kart World. A general lack of content and originality keeps CrossWorlds from fully breaking away from the pack, but it’s at least in striking distance of the winner’s circle.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/george-a-romero%E2%80%99s-daughter-is-making-a-zombie-drag-queen-movie-and-it-looks-great.1302030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tina Romero, the daughter of the late filmmaker and creator of the modern zombie, <a href="https://kotaku.com/that-time-george-romero-almost-directed-a-resident-evil-1766259870">George A. Romero</a>, is making her directorial debut with, appropriately enough, a movie all about an invasion of the undead. But <em>Queens of the Dead</em> shakes up the formula by having the zombies attack an NYC party featuring drag queen performers and their friends.</p> <p><em>Queens of the Dead</em> is a new horror comedy mixing together drag queens and zombies, and it’s set to hit theaters in October. The first look at this upcoming flick is out now, and the movie looks fun. It also looks like a movie that might greatly upset and confuse your conservative grandpa, who loves Fox News. Here’s the trailer:</p>  <p>The new movie stars the always excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_O%27Brian">Katy O’Brian</a>, Nina West, Jack Haven, and others, and looks to split its action between a group of clubgoers and drag queens stuck in a warehouse party, and the happenings at a hospital in New York City during the zombie uprising. After watching this trailer, I’m on board for this spin on the classic zombie movie. It’s also great to see Romero continuing her father’s legacy of making zombie movies that aren’t just gory and scary, but also filled with characters and ideas that feel extremely relevant. Romero’s iconic horror movie, <em>Night of the Living Dead,</em> essentially created modern-day zombies, or ghouls as he often called them, and laid out the basic framework most zombie movies follow: People stuck in a place fight back the dead while dealing with each other.</p> <p>Here’s the official description for the film courtesy of IFC Films:</p> <blockquote><p>When a zombie apocalypse breaks out in Brooklyn on the night of a giant warehouse party, an eclectic group of drag queens, club kids, &amp; frenemies must put aside their drama and use their unique skills to fight against the brain-thirsty, scrolling undead.</p></blockquote> <p>In 2025, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/surprise-press-conference-reveals-trump-still-not-dead-2000622401">President Trump</a> and <a href="https://translegislation.com/">other Republicans cracking down on LGBTQ people</a> and anything they deem “different,” a movie about a horde of nasty zombies trying to destroy a safe place for drag queens and queer folk seems pretty dang perfect. I’d bet George would be proud of his daughter’s first theatrical film. Before this, she had done TV and smaller projects. I’m excited to check out <em>Queens of the Dead</em> when it arrives in theaters on October 24. Just in time for Halloween.</p>

Every other week, this curated overview will feature key takeaways from a vintage or classic GDC Talk with the goal of helping today's developers unearth new lessons from the past.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In week ten (of a twelve week quarter) in my Game Design Principles class at Berklee, we focus on writing &nbsp;characters for games. My students craft game design documents for a blue-sky project of their own design, and for most folks, there is some element of character creation (except for those opting for the most abstract puzzle or strategy games, and they have heavier assignments in other areas!)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In preparing for the week ten lecture, I often like to take inspiration from the fine minds at GDC, especially for narrative design and strong, iconic character writing. One talk that I've enjoyed re-discovering recently (and showing to my students) is this GDC 2021 banger Finding Character Voice With Your Voice. In it, Wooga Senior Writer and voice actor Cyrus Nemati gives a short-but-action-packed talk on using elements of performance to really make characters pop off the page, even at early stages of writing.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/nintendo-spells-out-why-player-communication-should-only-happen-in-game" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo spells out why player communication should only happen in-game</a></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HUD3BNK-S7Y" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cast your characters (in your dreams)">Cast your characters (in your dreams)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After warning writers off of the temptation to just write oodles of lore, Nemati showcases a Mike Bithell (of Bithell Games) gem on writing for games. In a 2019 tweet, Bithell notes "My writing gets 10x better once I've settled my dream casting for the character I'm working on."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Mentally assembling a cast of actors who could play your characters is already providing characterization," says Nemati. "Imagine you are struggling with a character on making their dialogue sound consistent and iconic, and you realize 'huh, you know, Sylvester Stallone kinda sounds like this, and the dialogue starts to flow naturally,'" he drops into a Stallone-drawl as he makes the last point. "At least, as naturally as Sylvester Stallone's dialogue does, because you know what he sounds like."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The most animated table reads are the best (and most fun)">The most animated table reads are the best (and most fun)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After presenting a few case studies on characters and performance, Nemati stresses the importance of having some fun in the writer's room. "Most of us can recognize when writing is uninspired, or when it's done just to fulfill some sort of narrative checkbox. If your studio acts as though writing is just the thing one must do to push the player along, it is up to you to bring that enthusiasm for writing, and the best way to do that is really to have fun with it!"</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/digging-into-the-combat-design-of-cronos-the-new-dawn-game-developer-podcast-ep-54" target="_self" data-discover="true">Digging into the combat design of Cronos: The New Dawn - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 54</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He calls up a clip of a table read with his team, where the writers get very animated in their read of a parrot character holding the keys to a mystery.

"But that good time helps us bond as a team, which is certainly a good thing to have in your writer's room. The comfort that comes with a strong bond allows you to explore and find a character's unique voice, and voice makes your characters unique."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"My holy grail for written dialogue is for the reader to know exactly who is speaking, without a name tag."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After a brief segue revolving around Kreia's memorable performance from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Nemati goes back to the fundamental topic of the talk: "Use your voice!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's absolutely no reason not to do this in your writer's room," he says, encouraging writers to perform, have fun, and truly get into it.

Nemati offers a few pathways to hiring voice actors for this early stage as well, if your project is of a scope that supports that.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/grounded-2-exists-because-players-really-wanted-to-ride-bugs" target="_self" data-discover="true">Grounded 2 exists because players really wanted to ride bugs</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unlocking the key takeaways">Unlocking the key takeaways</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In case you want the sparknotes version of the talk—or you're just outlining some of the major lessons in your notes—don't worry, I've got you!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key takeaways here are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lesson #1: Don't rely on oodles of lore</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to write memorable characters, think of who you'd like to play that character (call it dream-casting) and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lesson #2: Perform that dialogue</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, whether by yourself, for your writer's room, or by hiring a voice actor.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/leaked-casting-calls-for-amazon%E2%80%99s-mass-effect-tv-series-stir-speculation-the-adaptation-will-feature-male-shepard.1302009/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-deal-nearly-completed-by-amazon-says-report/">Four years ago</a>, we first heard a report that Amazon was crossing the 't's on a deal with EA and BioWare to make a Mass Effect TV series adaptation. Now, we know the deal went through, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/">Daniel Casey</a> was tapped to write the show, followed by<a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-mass-effect-tv-series-taps-star-trek-beyond-writer-doug-jung-to-be-the-showrunner/"> Doug Jung</a> being selected to be its showrunner, and we've even had a <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/">confidence-boosting confirmation</a> that the same production team of artists who excellently brought Fallout to life will also be working on Mass Effect.</p>



<p>All of that still leaves a whole pile of unanswered questions, but a recent leak might've just begun to answer one of the most major questions in the series: which Shepard will it be?</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-tv-series-casting-calls-leak-sparking-speculation-male-shepard-is-canon">Eurogamer</a>, entertainment reporter and insider <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/mass-effect-138895669">Daniel Richtman</a> leaked five casting calls for Amazon's Mass Effect TV series. The calls don't explicitly say which character they're casting, but anyone familiar enough with the series can make educated guesses, and one of the calls points to Amazon choosing to go with Male Shepard for its iteration of the story.</p>



<p>The five calls are, per Eurogamer, "<em>a young Colin Farrell-type male (30-39) with open ethnicity, a female co-lead alien character requiring prosthetics (34-39), a female human providing a parallel narrative from Earth, a Doug Jones-type male villain (40-60), and a male wrestler-type soldier (30-49).</em>"</p>



<p>Fans of the series have speculated that the 'male wrestler-type' is a casting call for James Vega, while the villain casting call points to Saren Arterius. The female co-lead is very likely a casting call for Liara T'Soni, while the other female casting call could be Emily Wong, a reworked version of Ashley Williams story, or a twin Shepard, by fans best approximations.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, it's the first call listed that's causing the most ruckus, as fans are speculating that it is pointing to the show's lead, Commander Shepard, and casting for a male means Amazon has chosen to go with Mark Meer's Male Shepard over Jennifer Hale's FemShep.</p>



<p>When Casey spoke about having the Fallout production team work on Mass Effect earlier this year, he confirmed that the writer's room has been in full swing since the beginning of 2025. Which Shepard they would go with was likely one of the earliest decisions they made, so unless they restart the process, if fans are correct in their speculation for these casting calls, then we are locked in to the series featuring Male Shepard.</p>



<p>How that'll go over with fans remains to be seen, since there are plenty within the community who look to FemShep as the canon choice. The other side to this is that deciding which Shepard it'll be is only one of the many decisions that Casey and Jung will have to make that could alienate fans from the series. Which former BioWare lead writer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-show-criticized-bioware-lead-writer-david-gaider/">David Gaider, predicted would happen three years ago</a>.</p>



<p>In fairness, Gaider didn't need any prescient abilities to point out that some fans will dislike the decisions made for the coming adaptation, but as we learn more about the adaptation, it'll be interesting to see if by the time we're closing in on its premiere date, if it is starting on its back foot, needing to win over fans instead of successfully getting them excited for what's to come.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/report-charlie-kirk-shooter-suspect%E2%80%99s-steam-gaming-history-under-review-by-secret-service.1302006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It didn’t take long after law enforcement officials publicly identified a <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439">suspect in the Charlie Kirk assassination</a> for people online to begin combing the internet looking for his digital footprint. One of the profiles they found appeared to be his Steam account which, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-18/suspected-kirk-shooter-s-gaming-history-probed-by-secret-service?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">according to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, is now being investigated by the Secret Service.</p> <p>That’s because 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who was charged earlier this week with murdering Kirk at a speaking event last week, reportedly used Donald Trump’s name as an alias on the Valve-owned gaming storefront at one point. Sources told <em>Bloomberg</em> the reference to the president is what led to the Secret Service’s involvement despite the Homeland Security agency having no role in protecting Kirk at the time of the assassination.</p> <p>The Steam account many believe to belong to Robinson shows thousands of hours spent playing games like <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>, and <em>Counter-Strike</em>. The handful of public Steam reviews he seemingly authored were indistinct from the thousands of others posted for those games. People have also been combing through his apparent Steam inventory, which includes hats, trading cards, and other unlockables.</p>

 <p>Steam is among those gaming-affiliated internet platforms <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-discord-politics-helldivers-memes-2000626029">which have been called to Congress</a> next month to testify about online radicalization. The CEOs from Twitch, Discord, and Reddit have also been asked to participate. Despite a reference to <em>Helldivers 2</em> appearing on one of the casings left behind near the crime scene, there’s been little publicly disclosed evidence so far that gaming, memes, or any other part of the modern internet played much of a role in driving Robinson to allegedly assassinate the right wing podcaster.</p> <p>“The politically motivated assassination of Charlie Kirk claimed the life of a husband, father, and American patriot. In the wake of this tragedy, and amid other acts of politically motivated violence, Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,” House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.)&nbsp;<a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/chairman-comer-invites-ceos-of-discord-steam-twitch-and-reddit-to-testify-on-radicalization-of-online-forum-users/">announced on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>But <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/exclusive-leaked-messages-from-charlie">leaked Discord chats and interviews</a> with friends have so far offered little that would suggest Robinson’s history with gaming and the internet were uniquely worrying, or different from those of most other people his age.</p>
