            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-mod-support<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>mod support is on the way, although it doesn't look like console players will be able to take advantage of the feature (for now, at least).</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1771300/view/514075305730637907" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the game's Steam page, mod support is on its way to&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>via Steamworks, which means that you'll be able to download and play mods via Steam.</p>

<p>Of course, that also means PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S players are being left out in the cold to some degree, so unless Warhorse announces a separate modding solution for console players, it looks like PC is the way to go for modders. Twas ever thus, eh?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-mod-support-soldiers.jpg?itok=G5MTsb2t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-mod-support-soldiers.jpg?itok=OCHbx5h9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mod support for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>Warhorse doesn't reveal much more beyond the fact that mod support for the game is coming, so we'll have to wait a little while for more info on how you can "create, tweak, and expand" the game, per the studio's words.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's a medieval RPG set in 15th-century Bohemia. Like its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" rel="nofollow">predecessor</a>,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>emphasizes historical realism and accuracy over fantasy, so you'll be fighting lots of regular ol' people and not so many dragons or wizards.</p>

<p>The game once again picks up the story of Henry of Skalitz, a blacksmith's son who's out to get revenge for his murdered parents. Along the way, he'll get dragged into exactly the kind of political intrigue you'd expect from such a volatile historical setting.</p>




<p>If you're in the market for a hefty, beefy RPG, this will almost certainly fit the bill; Warhorse says&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s script <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">has more than two million words</a>, so you can expect plenty of content to keep you entertained.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9n4w31hsmvvd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crysis">Crysis</a> developers Crytek are dismissing an estimated 15 percent of their workforce - around 60 people out of 400 – in the face of “the complex, unfavourable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years”. This comes after they paused development of mechsuit FPS sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crysis-4">Crysis 4</a> last year, with staff shifting over to Showdown’s live service reboot Hunt: Showdown 1896. Crytek now say they need to cut back in order to remain “financially sustainable”.</p><!--more-->
<p>"Like so many of our peers, we aren't immune to the complex, unfavourable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years," <a href="https://x.com/Crytek/status/1889623029723885913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">reads a statement posted on social media</a>. "It pains us greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15 percent of our around 400 employees. The layoffs affect development teams and shared services.” </p>
<p>“This has not been an easy decision to make, as we deeply appreciate the hard work of our talented teams,” it continues. “After putting the development of the next Crysis game on hold in Q3 2024, we have been trying to shift developers over to Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>
<p>"While Hunt: Showdown 1896 is still growing, Crytek cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable. Even after ongoing efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses, we have determined that layoffs are inevitable to move forward. Crytek will offer affected employees severance packages and career assistance services."</p>
<p>You might be wondering what “the complex, unfavourable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years” actually refers to. I could do with a bit more exposition myself. Are they talking about companies expanding too fast, amid optimistic predictions of post-lockdown growth? Betting too much on the success of VR? Rising interest rates and cost of living? It's going back 10 years, but Crytek <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crytek-unpaid-staff">don't exactly have a great track record</a> for being upfront about layoffs.</p>
<p>A cursory glance at Hunt: Showdown’s SteamDB concurrency figures suggests that the game is doing well, but remains far from a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>-level money-spinner. It spiked to around 60,000 concurrent players in August 2024 with the release of the 1896 update. Games aside, Crytek have their CryEngine business, which dates back to the noughties.</p>
<p>As for Crysis 4, it was announced in 2022 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crysis-4-announced-start-saving-for-a-new-graphics-card">in a way that suggested we wouldn’t see anything concrete for a while</a>, and so it has proven: this is only our second news story about the game. I'm not hugely optimistic for the project's future. Best of luck to everybody affected by Crytek’s reductions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Official modding support is coming to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. In a post on social media on Wednesday, developer Warhorse Studios announced the new feature with a simple message.</p>



<p>“Bohemia is about to get even more exciting,” <a href="https://x.com/KingdomComeRPG/status/1889706030226956469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said</a>. “Official modding support is coming to [Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2] on Steamworks.”</p>



<p>No specific release date for when the feature will be added to the game was announced. All that was said on that front was “stay tuned”. Based on the tease, modding will be available exclusively to those with a Steam version of the game.</p>



<p>Since its release, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has been a critical and commercial success. The game sold over one million copies in its first day, and Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calls it a “masterpiece”</a>.</p>



<p>”&nbsp;From ethereal sequences packed with tearjerker scenes to a phenomenal weather engine, and from genuinely interesting side activities to a neat little photo mode, I cannot find one major fault with this game,” Taylor-Hill says in the full review.</p>



<p>What do you think of modding coming to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

This means you won't be able to play the network test throughout the entire four days, rather during five three-hour periods.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign network test session timings:</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>February 14: 3am-6am PT / 6am-9am ET</li><li>February 14: 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET</li><li>February 15: 11am-2pm PT / 2pm-5pm ET</li><li>February 16: 3am-6am PT / 6am-9am ET</li><li>February 16: 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The network test is a “preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch,” Bandai Namco said. "This large-scale Network Stress Test is designed to evaluate various aspects of the online system's functionality and performance. We are looking forward to your cooperation to make Elden Ring Nightreign even better."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign is FromSoftware’s standalone co-operative spin-off set in a world parallel to that of 2022’s Elden Ring. The network test will allow three players to team up and take their chosen Nightfarers to battle "against new terrors, and explore an ever-changing map to defeat increasingly challenging bosses and ultimately take on the Nightlord," Bandai Namco added, before confirming the network test features a three day-and-night cycle squads must try to outlast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb:</p><blockquote>The all-new adventure in Elden Ring Nightreign begins at the Roundtable Hold, set in a universe parallel to the events of Elden Ring. Players must choose from eight unique characters, each with their own abilities and powerful Ultimates. Their journeys take them to Limveld, an ever-changing environment, where they will have to make split-second decisions when it comes to combat and exploration in the face of a night cycle that shrinks the map with the coming Night’s Tide.</blockquote><blockquote>At the end of each night, players will face a powerful boss and, if victorious, awaken to bigger challenges. Each session will culminate in the third night when they must face off against the chosen Nightlord. Individuals can fight the night alone, but strength will come in numbers. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience. All is not lost for those who fall in defeat. Unsuccessful runs will grant players relics to allow them to customize and upgrade their characters tailored to their personal play styles.</blockquote><blockquote>Elden Ring Nightreign is unlike any experience created before by FromSoftware, Inc. In this condensed action RPG, players will never experience the same journey twice as enemies, rewards, and Limveld itself are ever-shifting and evolving with each new session. Defeating greater enemies and venturing into the more dangerous parts of the map will uncover more powerful weapons and greater Rune rewards. Finding Sites of Grace gives each hero a chance to level up and gain crucial power. With each session-based adventure being akin to playing through an open-air dungeon, every journey provides an opportunity to grow lasting stat bonuses. Successful runs against the night bring players ever closer to defeating the Nightlord and unraveling the story behind each Nightfarer in this parallel world.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year IGN had the opportunity to visit FromSoftware and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-we-played-it"><u>go hands-on with an early build of Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a>.

<p>The first big addition in this update is New Game Plus, which allows you to replay a difficulty level you've already finished with all of your weapons and Ninpo intact. Their levels will, however, be reset, so bear that in mind.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a photo mode that allows you to pause&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em>'s action and take snapshots, although bear in mind that this isn't&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</em>'s photo mode, so you can't essentially just wander around the level with it.</p>

Some enemies have had their HP lowered, while other encounters have had their enemy density increased.</p>

<p>Of course, the update also brings a handful of bug fixes and technical improvements. You can check out the full patch notes for this&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black&nbsp;</em>is, it's a remastered version of the 2008 action game&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2</em>, as well as its 2009 re-release&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</em>.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo's intention was to create a definitive version of the&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2&nbsp;</em>experience, and so as well as a full visual revamp using Unreal Engine 5, the game also blends <i>Sigma 2</i>'s additional content with various systems and gameplay features in the original&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2</em>.</p>




<p>It's all go for the&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;</em>franchise right now. As well as <i>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</i>, you can also look forward to&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, which is currently in the works as a co-development project between Team Ninja and PlatinumGames.</p>

<p><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3287520/NINJA_GAIDEN_2_Black/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012997" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ninja-gaiden-2-black/9N51FH42VQDS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

<p>Developer Rebellion has released a brand new features trailer for the upcoming action survival game, Atomfall. In this trailer, players get a look at various settings and landscapes in the game while also learning about what to expect as you play.</p>



<p>“This slice of Northern England includes everything from open moors, rugged hills, dense woodlands and the picture-perfect English village Wyndham,” Rebellion says. “But beware, this is a dangerous and hostile landscape filled with gangs of outlaws, crazed cultists and unexplained horrors. </p>



<p>“Even the local wildlife poses an immense threat to your life. If you are to navigate this land and survive, you will need to fight for your life and scavenge resources.”</p>



<p>You can check out the full trailer for yourself below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Atomfall launches on March 27, and will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. The game will also launch Day One on Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-preview-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview of the game</a> last summer, Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill touched on how interacting with the game’s characters can change your overall experience.</p>



<p>“Get too close to a faction that doesn’t trust you, and you’ll be set upon pretty quickly,” he said. “In conversations, you can choose from what might be several choices, each of which can lead a different way. If you want to be stealthier, you’ll put enemies on edge, and if you go in guns blazing, you’ll quickly draw an entire force down upon you.”</p>



<p>What do you think of the latest look at Atomfall? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>The Alters has been delayed once again by 11 Bit Studios. The announcement comes via a post on social media on Wednesday morning.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://x.com/altersgame/status/1889675839434010677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post online</a>, the game’s official account said that the planned release for Q1 2025 has been pushed to later in the year. An exact window, however, wasn’t given.</p>



<p>“While we recognize that this may not be the update you were hoping for, this additional time is being dedicated to further refining mission parameters and ensuring that all essential systems meet Ally Corp’s uncompromising standards,” the statement reads. “Furthermore, it is also allowing us to integrate new enhancements into Project Dolly, ensuring that your eventual deployment is more exciting and rewarding than originally projected.”</p>



<p>They continued: “This additional time will allow us to ensure that every aspect of Project Dolly operates at peak efficiency, leading to an outcome that benefits both the organization and, of course, yourself.”</p>



<p>For those unfamiliar with the game, The Alters is a “emotional sci-fi game with a unique blend of survival, adventure, and base-building elements.” Players have to work to create alternate versions of the main character Jan Dolski in order to escape a hostile planet after he was left as the lone survivor of a space expedition.</p>



<p>The game was announced back in June 2022. When it does finally release, The Alters will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It will also be available via Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>What do you make of The Alters being delayed to later this year? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

                <p>Language-learning app Duolingo has sadly confirmed that its owl mascot has died. In a social media post, the company confirmed the expiration of Duo, the little green owl. "It is with heavy hearts that we inform you that Duo, formally known as the Duolingo Owl, is dead," <a href="https://x.com/duolingo/status/1889328809054224698" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Duolingo posted on X</a>.</p><p>Naturally, the gaming industry has taken this time to mourn Duo and possibly incriminate itself with images that'll hold up quite nicely in court once the murder case gets underway. So who is responsible for the death of Duo, a noted fan of singer-songwriter Dua Lipa? One of the suspects could be the Reaper from Vampire Survivors:</p><p>Or Keit'Ehr, the Subjugator skulking around the flagship of Oryx in Destiny 2, could also be a suspect:</p><p>Police might want to also bring in Renaissance man Ezio Auditore da Firenze in for question, as people have a tendency to suffer fatal stab wounds when they get close to him:</p><p>Or maybe Duo shouldn't have dropped into a quick game of Rainbow Six Siege:</p><p>Maybe Duo's death was an accident. Such tragedies certainly do happen surprisingly often around well-tailored bald men with barcode tattoos on their neck:</p><p>Some conspiracy theorists have suggested that Duo has done an Elvis and isn't dead at all, or at the very least, might have been resurrected thanks to some gnarly viruses:</p><p>Meanwhile, some people think that Duo should have abstained from vigorous Just Dance sessions.</p><p>Is this what Master Chief meant by finishing the fight?</p><p>Like the case of Jimmy Hoffa, we'll probably never know what really happened to Duo or why there's a <a href="https://youtu.be/Fc24GNLlbLw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">strange lump</a> on the football field of New Jersey's Giants Stadium. We've got a few more prime suspects listed below, just to cover every angle of the crime of the century:</p><p>If you do decide to visit the Duolingo social media channels, the reality of Duo's death will be hammered home with a new app icon of a very dead-looking owl. The company says it will reveal more details this week on Duo's untimely death and the shocking truth behind it.</p>

The title is slated to arrive in late April, with pre-registration available now on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbjN6T2dRUEV0VF9pcHB4Ul9GMndWcVRZaGl2d3xBQ3Jtc0trNHctMU1qVVJEcmZqRTlOdFJCcXdzRU9GRF9sMFgxcHZWRXFQUDZwdTM5bzh2ZFRndURjSVdkei1DQ1JLbVZXRDBRdW9la2ZNRnp6T3ZwUUtHXzRWdVY0YjkzcHlQakswOFM1VVVsV0txSWw4SHUycw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid6474245208&amp;v=a4pxFJB6mDE">iOS</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWhsX0s0MV85bjR3WjFhVGZrUWNlUEFROUZVZ3xBQ3Jtc0tsU010aF9UTTdCZ0tlN1JqeS10cjI3RGlJSGxKOTYyRlJRd1BYVEVGVjBZNmozMnRqZlJQZWtxSnltTkRRUXhJQktNbVhsemxmY1pXUnhYZElpOEtVdXlWVzZNN2dzTVNrVEoxa19rMTVQRVJRNkJXbw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.pandoland&amp;v=a4pxFJB6mDE">Android</a>. Signing up can net you diamonds that can equate to 100 gacha pulls.</p><p dir="ltr">Pandoland is described as a casual-adventure RPG, seeing players search for treasures and explore dungeons. There are apparently over 500 characters and items to collect, and building a team of companions helps with exploration. The official trailer for the game--seen below--showcases a blocky art style as a group of characters set sail on the open seas aboard a ship. The boat passes by different islands and even a giant squid.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/common-side-effects-adult-swim-max-hbo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With Warner Bros. owning Adult Swim, it sometimes feels like only a matter of time before the adult-oriented animation channel gets sent to the tax writeoff mines. Which makes its new show <em>Common Side Effects</em> feel all the more refreshing and precious.</p><p><em>Common Side Effects</em> follows Marshall Cuso, an animal-loving mushroom expert who has discovered a blue mushroom that cures everything from common sickness to gunshot wounds. He reveals its existence to high school classmate Frances, whom he doesn’t know works for Reutical Pharmaceuticals as an assistant to its delightfully incompetent CEO Rick (voiced by Mike Judge, so you get to hear Hank Hill call a private jet a “PJ”). Frances offers to get the mushroom for the flailing Reutical, adding her to the list of people trying to hunt Marshall down. This includes two wonderfully deadpan DEA agents, Copano and Harrington, who have maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DyQ8X9OPOP4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best character introduction</a> ever.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Common Side Effects | OFFICIAL TRAILER | adult swim" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tdf8q2ax-Ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Marshall is a strange character, seeming in some ways like a washed-out hippie and in others like an accomplished scientist. We first meet him having a comment instead of a question at a Reutical shareholder meeting, his shirt hanging open as he drones on about fungus habitats until he’s dragged out. When he runs into Frances, he rants about a shady “them,” the “people who make tons of money just from keeping us sick, from keeping us <em>unwell</em>.” It’s conspiracy theory stuff, but in the show’s world there’s truth to it: different parties go to huge lengths to keep the miracle mushroom from the public for their own gain. There’s something risque in exploring healthcare-related conspiracy theories that turn out to be true these days, but <em>Common Side Effects</em> also takes aim at an industry many people are pretty <a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fed up with</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite part of the show is the way everything is so physical; characters’ bodies are wrinkled and strangely proportioned, all of their features too small for their heads. Rooms are full of detritus, coffee cups and takeout containers and grow lights, and it makes the world feel lived-in. It all feels very real, even with the fantastical element of an immortality-granting mushroom at its center. In many ways it’s a crime thriller, but everything moves so slowly, full of characters prone to small talk,&nbsp; and this languidness brings both a humor and a calm that give it a unique feel.</p><p><em>Common Side Effects’</em> third episode just aired on Adult Swim and Max, so it’s a good time to get into it if you haven’t checked it out yet. I’m excited to see where its plot goes, but more excited just to spend time in its weird world.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/beyond-citadel-indie-retro-shooter"><h3>Beyond Citadel Is Gory, Obscene, And Almost A Masterpiece</h3></a><p>Inspired by Lucasarts' Outlaws and Bungie's Marathon, Beyond Citadel is mechanically one of the best indie shooters I have played in years and absolutely not for everyone.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/metaphor-refantazio-lynch"><h3>Fantasy At The End Of The World</h3></a><p>A new world is possible, but only if we log off and put in the work</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In our review, Adrian said, <em>“Ninja Gaiden 2 Black offers a comprehensive remake of Team Ninja’s finest game, rendered in beautiful modern visuals. Combat is as bombastically brilliant as it ever was, though the awful camera will put off many of those new to the game, it really hasn’t aged well. Still, as a reminder of how good Ninja Gaiden can be, this remake offers a tantalising taste of what we can all look forward to when Ninja Gaiden 4 is released later this year.”</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will launch in late May on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, publisher Bandai Namco confirmed today.</p>
<p>The co-op survival adventure developed by FromSoftware will launch worldwide on May 30th. Besides the game's Standard Edition, multiple editions of the game will also be released on the same day, including additional goodies such as Digital Artbook and Soundtrack for the Deluxe Edition and the Seekers Edition, which will also include an additional Steelbook. The real star of the Elden Ring Nightreign special editions, however, will be the Collector's Edition, which includes every goodie included in the Deluxe Edition, the same Steelbook included in the Seekers Edition, eight Nightfarer Cards, a hardcover Artbook and a ~25 cm Wylder Nightfarer statue. Die-hard fans of Elden Ring will also be able to purchase a 1:1 scale, prop-quality replica of the Wylder character helmet. Only 9,999 pieces of the helmet will be produced, so it will be a rather exclusive item. All the game's editions and the Wylder helmet replica are also available for <a href="https://it.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/shop-now?utm_campaign=Preorder-EldenRingNightreign&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_source=SM_Official" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-order</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-cross-buy-xbox-battle-net</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-gets-cross-buy-for-battle-net-and-xbox-for-some-reason.1106841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-cross-buy-xbox-battle-net<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard and Xbox have announced that if you buy Obsidian's upcoming action RPG&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>on the Battle.net platform, you'll be able to play it on Xbox, and the reverse is also true.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24177681/avowed-breaks-down-barriers-with-cross-buy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the Blizzard website, the company grandly proclaims that the feature "breaks down barriers with cross-buy" and confirms that&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>represents the introduction of this feature between Battle.net and Xbox, suggesting more games could support it in future.</p>

<p>In short, if you buy&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>on Battle.net, then by linking your Xbox account with your Battle.net account, you'll be able to pick up where you left off on Xbox and won't need to buy the game again on that storefront.</p>

<p>The Steam Deck doesn't play very nice with the Microsoft Store, but with a little fiddling under the hood, you can install Battle.net on your Deck and it'll work alright. As such, it should theoretically be possible to play&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>across Xbox (or PC) and Steam Deck.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're going to play the game on PC exclusively (for which you'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-pc-specs" rel="nofollow">probably want a pretty good machine</a>), then there's really no reason not to just pick it up on Steam, and I can't imagine any other use case where someone might find it useful to switch between Battle.net and Xbox.</p>




<p><em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>is the latest game from&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds&nbsp;</em>developer Obsidian. Appropriately enough, it looks rather like a combination of those two games, marrying the first-person action of the latter with the setting of the former.</p>

<p>Initially, it was announced that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-30fps-xbox-target" rel="nofollow">would run at 30fps</a> on Xbox Series X|S, but Obsidian has since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obisidian-confirms-avowed-60fps-mode-on-xbox-series-x-after-previously-saying-you-dont-necessarily-need-it" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that it will implement a 60fps mode for the game on consoles.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/avowed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 18th. It'll also be available on Game Pass on day one, assuming you're signed up to the PC or Ultimate tiers.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">They say you should never work for free, but in Saber Interactive's case, offering to do exactly that landed the studio a high-profile project. The news comes from an interview <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/saber-interactive-halo-anniversary-world-war-z-matt-karch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a> conducted with Saber co-founder and CEO Matthew Karch, where Karch discussed the challenges of running an independent studio and relying on royalties from working with other studios.</p><p dir="ltr">Saber's early days included work with Ubisoft that Saber made no money from, an FPS game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/timeshift-2007/">TimeShift</a> that saw lengthy delays after Activision's Vivendi acquisition, and a game called Inversion for Bandai Namco. The latter project saw Saber go for long periods of time without pay while Bandai debated about what they wanted from the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Karch said Saber's break came when he learned Microsoft wanted pitches from third-party studios interested in developing a Halo: Combat Evolved remaster for the game's anniversary. He told an unnamed Xbox executive that Saber could do it for free.</p><p dir="ltr">“I said I’d do it for free, because it’s Halo,” Karch said. “It’s the biggest franchise in the world at the time. I said: ‘It’s like putting a Harvard diploma on your wall. Everyone in the world is going to want to work with me after they see that I’ve worked on this last Halo game, and it is going to open up doors. So I’ll suck it up and I’ll do it at a loss.'”</p><p dir="ltr">His Xbox contact pushed him to name an actual price, though. Karch said $4 million, assuming the rate was lower than what other studios pitched and knowing he could pull it off in the low-cost development environment in St. Petersburg, Russia--Saber's headquarters at the time. However, Xbox honored his original pitch after all and included clauses in the Halo remaster contract that essentially meant Saber would earn no royalties for the project.</p><p dir="ltr">Karch's initial prediction, that working on one high-profile project would benefit Saber in the long-term, proved correct when Microsoft returned with another proposition. This time, they asked if Saber would remaster Halo 2 and port Halo: Anniversary Edition to Xbox One for 2014's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection/" data-ref-id="1900-6415958">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>. Microsoft forgot to send the part of the contract that covered the porting project, and Karch said he refused to sign it unless Microsoft removed the clause that reduced Saber's royalties. The company agreed, and Karch said the royalties from The Master Chief Collection earned Saber "tens of millions" of dollars.</p><p dir="ltr">"We were off and running,' Karch said. "We've watched other people make money on our work. Now we're going to make money on our own.”</p><p dir="ltr">Saber continued handling game-port projects for other studios, including putting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-nintendo-switch-review-the-last-wish/1900-6417341/" data-ref-id="1900-6417341">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on Nintendo Switch</a> for CD Projekt Red. The studio expanded its in-house development capabilities as well, with the likes of World War Z and its follow-ups, alongside popular mobile sports game Basketball Playgrounds. Embracer Group purchased Saber Interactive in 2020, but in 2024, Karch regained control of the studio after Beacon Entertainment--a company Karch set up for this purchase--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-group-and-saber-interactive-part-ways-in-deal-reportedly-worth-500-million/1100-6521842/" data-ref-id="1100-6521842">bought Saber from Embracer</a>. Saber is currently leading development on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-is-no-longer-in-development-report/1100-6519286/" data-ref-id="1100-6519286">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake</a>, though that project's status and anticipated release date are unknown.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date-revealed-for-may.1106793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have announced the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>release date, and it's only a few more months before you'll get to play the survival-focused multiplayer spinoff.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1889676062071656525" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches across PC and consoles on May 30th. Pre-orders are, according to Bandai Namco, open now via the game's <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/shop-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>, although I wasn't able to actually pick the game up when I checked, so you may have to wait an hour or two.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">multiplayer-focused spinoff</a> of the immensely popular 2022 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>(although just like its forebear,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>can also be played solo).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-witch.jpg?itok=dkB0RnB0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-witch.jpg?itok=SKViCQdy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is launching in May.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will take place in the parallel world of Limveld, where you and two other friends (but not one other friend, strangely enough) must battle increasingly tough waves of enemies and bosses over the course of three in-game days and nights.</p>

<p>Rather than creating your own character,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will give you the chance to play as one of eight predetermined characters, each with their own backstory and lore to discover, as well as their own skillset to utilize.</p>

<p>FromSoftware has confirmed that you will be facing enemies from both&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>series</a>, and new types of enemies will also be appearing.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>has been designed to offer a standalone experience set in the broader&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>universe, so even if you haven't played the base game or its&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC, you should find something to enjoy here.</p>




<p>Ahead of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s launch, a network test is scheduled to take place in February, giving some players the chance to try out the game's online features and spend a little time in its world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, signups for that test have concluded, but if you were lucky enough to get into the test, you'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>between February 14th and 16th across a number of set time periods.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox on May 30th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Sharkmob have punched the green light, cracked open the hangar doors and launched a public playtest for their windblown open world extraction shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exoborne">Exoborne</a>, which I would gingerly summarise as Anthem meets <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a> with a touch of PUBG. From today till 17th February at 1pm GMT, 2pm CET, or 5am PST, you'll be able to get your fill of mech-o-looting via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705130/Exoborne/">Steam</a>. Here's a trailer's worth of wiggly whooshes, big bangs and exowotsits to celebrate. Mmm, exowotsits. They used to be 25p a bag in the 1990s.

If references to antique British crisp brands only leave you confused about what Exoborne actually is, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sharkmob-announce-exoborne-an-open-world-pvpve-shooter-featuring-exo-rigs-and-tornadoes">may I recommend reading my first article about the game from 2023</a>. The narrative premise is that a notional "save the environment" project called Project Rebirth has fucked the world instead, producing a landscape of renegade whirlwinds, broken cities, big sci-fi towers and lashings of loot. 
</p>
<p>
You are a "Reborn" adventurer in an exosuit with high-jumping and grappling capabilities, plus a parachute. Your job is to get in, finish quests and extract with some rad valuables before the match timer runs out, while fighting other players and NPCs. The game is built for groups of three, with a choice of exo-rigs akin to RPG classes, and there's a home hub area where you can shoot the breeze with various story characters. Hah, "shoot the breeze"! I guess that also applies to tangling with inclement weather phenomena as well: some of the game's better items are to be found inside them.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure about Exoborne so far. The idea of hook-chuting through hurricanes while gunning down robot-shouldered hooligans certainly has its charms. On the other hand, this all feels very "we smooshed a bunch of genres together in the hope of alchemising something new", and the art direction is a bit dreary. There's no release date yet - let us know if you have thoughts about the beta.

Bandai Namco announced that FromSoftware’s latest blockbuster will launch in May, and early impressions are buzzing about it being a tense hybrid of <em>Elden Ring</em> and a PVE-based battle royale. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The release date of May 30 on PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC was revealed alongside a new trailer showing off more gameplay and bosses that will be featured in <em>Nightreign</em>’s unique sandbox horde mode.

Players will have a chance to explore a randomized world map across a day and night cycle as a<em> Fortnite</em>-like circle slowly closes in on them. </p><p>It’s honestly a bonkers premise for a FromSoftware game, but early impressions of the beta test build paint a glowing picture of the <em>Dark Souls</em> studio’s  experimental genre mashup. “<em>Nightreign </em>provides a delectable hit of <em>Elden Ring</em> in a repeatable microcosm,” Ed Nightingale <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes for <em>Eurogamer</em></a></span>. “It’s got the difficulty, the levelling, the boss battles, and the sense of discovery, but all at high speed for a new type of challenge, while its grim enemy selection is like a best-of Souls mixtape I’m itching to replay.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/gaming/522325/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-network-test&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/522325/elden-ring-nightreign-preview-network-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em>’s previewer</a></span> came away similarly impressed. “In many ways it would feel more like a frantic, PvE battle royale than it would the original <em>Elden Ring</em>,” writes Austen Goslin. “What’s even more surprising is just how well all of these elements mix together into a package that feels both true to the Soulslike genre, and totally new at the same time.” He says it’s less the open invitation to new fans that <em>Elden Ring</em> was than a love letter to existing <em>Souls </em>devotees. </p><p>Unlike the 2022 GOTY hit, <em>Nightreig</em>n features faster-paced combat and  streamlined progression during each run. Leveling up happens more quickly, Sites of Grace heal you automatically as you run by, and there’s no fall damage this time around. Relics, meanwhile, provide extra stat bonuses that last in-between runs, so not all of your progress is reset each time. Combined with eight character classes, there’s potentially a lot of room to develop custom strategies and replay through the same content over and over like a classic arcade game. </p><p>I’ll have a better sense of that for myself after playing this weekend’s beta test. I was already looking forward to it and now I’m extra stoked. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

EA saw all those first and passed on all of them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking to former Activision boss Bobby Kotick, Bing said: "This is why I have double-high respect for [Kotick] saying, 'no, no, this is going to be good to own.' And then you kept the people around. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm pretty sure that some of those companies, the creative leaders, would not have stuck around [for a company other than Activision], so you did some kind of miracle of keeping them productive for long periods of time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The merger between then Blizzard owner Vivendi Games and Activision in July 2008 created the Activision Blizzard we know today. At the time, World of Warcraft was already the world's biggest subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game.

"They tried to buy us a bunch of times, we had merger conversations a bunch of times," Kotick revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gordon added: "While you were doing Blizzard, that EA passed on, and you were doing King, EA did PopCap — just stupid things."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same interview, Kotick declared <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bobby-kotick-declares-former-ea-boss-john-riccitiello-worst-ceo-in-video-games"><u>ex-EA CEO John Riccitiello "the worst CEO in video games."</u></a> Kotick also opened up about Universal's 2016 adaptation of Activision Blizzard's Warcraft, calling it "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-activision-blizzard-boss-bobby-kotick-slams-warcraft-film-calls-it-one-of-the-worst-movies-ive-ever-seen"><u>one of the worst movies I've ever seen</u></a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
