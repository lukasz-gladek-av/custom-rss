            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>2025 was a big year for gaming, and that includes gaming hardware. Nintendo launched its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a> console in June, and since then, numerous Switch 2 titles and noteworthy updates for original Switch games have launched. These include brand-new Nintendo experiences like <em>Mario Kart World</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, as well as some belated but welcome third-party titles, including <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>. Even classics like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> got some new life on the upgraded console.</p><p>If you’re considering buying a console, or you’re getting one for someone else, there are 11 games that we think are a must-buy for any Switch 2 owner.</p><p>So what if <em>Mario Kart World</em> comes in the box with the $499 Switch 2 bundle? It’s still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">so easy to recommend</a> because few other games match the briskness at which it just lets you get going and have fun. The latest entry in Nintendo’s top-selling racing franchise adds many new characters, an open-world single-player mode, unique interconnected courses, and a lot more.</p><p>One of the best ways to play the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> was on a Nintendo Switch, so it’s no surprise that the Switch 2 is a great way to enjoy the long-awaited sequel, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777653/silksong-impressions-team-cherry-metroidvania-sherma-is-cool">Silksong</a></em>. The side-scrolling action exploration game looks fantastic, and its gorgeous animations are easier to appreciate thanks to the console’s 120Hz refresh rate screen.</p><div><p id="divinity-original-sin-2"><h2><em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em></h2></p></div><p>Before Larian Studios made <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/17/23834516/baldurs-gate-3-choices-narrative-perfectionism">Baldur’s Gate 3</a></em>, it was best known for its <em>Divinity </em>series. The developers recently announced a reboot of the RPG franchise, but for now, the closest thing to <em>BG3 </em>that Switch 2 owners can experience right now is <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>, a fantastic RPG that first launched in late 2017. It just got a free Switch 2 update that enhances visuals and reduces slowdown, and I highly recommend playing it.</p><p>The team that developed <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> clearly had a ball with its most recent game, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em>. It’s just as ambitious in terms of level design, giving Donkey Kong several unique powers of transformation. But it’s significantly more destructive, letting him demolish everything in sight with his fists or punch through the ground to get around obstacles.</p><div><p id="cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition"><h2><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em></h2></p></div><p>You know Nintendo did something right with the Switch 2 when the graphics showcase <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> shows up as a launch game. The first-person-shooter-meets-RPG plays well on the system, especially when you use the Joy-Con 2 in mouse mode, which makes it feel a bit like the PC version. This version of the game includes the excellent <em>Phantom Liberty</em> DLC that adds even more action, plus Idris Elba.</p><p>After nearly a decade in development, the first new <em>Metroid Prime</em> game in nearly 20 years is now available for the Switch 2. It runs at glorious 4K on the new hardware (or up to 120 frames per second in 1080p), but beyond looks, it’s great to be back in Samus Aran’s butt-kicking boots again. This time, she’s got the Vi-O-La motorcycle for getting around the desert terrain that connects the main dungeons. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/835325/metroid-prime-4-review-nintendo-switch">story and exploration may not have the same magic as the original <em>Prime</em></a>, but its best parts are still worth paying the price of admission to experience.</p><div><p id="splatoon-3"><h2><em>Splatoon 3</em></h2></p></div><p><em>Splatoon 3</em> was already a fun game on the original Switch, but it’s even better with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686128/splatoon-3-switch-2-update-overview">free Switch 2 update</a>. With faster loading speeds and better-looking visuals, you owe it to yourself to make a splashy mess in its fun single-player campaign and online multiplayer modes.</p><div><p id="the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"><h2><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></h2></p></div><p>The release of the Switch 2 made old things new again. For example, the original Switch launch title <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> has never looked or played better than it does in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition">new Switch 2 Edition</a>, which costs $10 if you own the Switch game or $70 by itself (the upgrade is free if you have Switch Online + Expansion Pack). Faster frame rates, speedier loading times, better visuals, and a GPS-style mobile app feature make this one feel like a breath of fresh air.</p><div><p id="red-dead-redemption"><h2><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></h2></p></div><p>Rockstar Games’ open-world Western was late to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/17/23834520/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-hands-on">hit the original Switch</a>, but the new (and free) Switch 2 update makes it shine in some surprising ways. Not only does it boost the visuals and performance thanks to the new console’s more powerful specs, it adds a PC-like mouse mode to make it much easier to aim (and more fun to play).</p><div><p id="no-mans-sky"><h2><em>No Man’s Sky</em></h2></p></div><p>If you’ve never played <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/599537/no-mans-sky-worlds-2-update">No Man’s Sky</a></em>, can we switch brains so I can experience it again for the first time? The space exploration game with an infinite universe (made possible via procedural generation that makes each player’s experience unique) is one of gaming’s biggest success stories in recent years. The developers pile on numerous substantive updates each year, making this an excellent game to play, whether you want to chill or engage in building a space empire. Oh, and the Switch 2 update is free for those who own the base game.</p><div><p id="fortnite"><h2><em>Fortnite</em></h2></p></div><p><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite">Fortnite</a> </em>is the only game on this list that’s free to play, but that doesn’t make it one that you should pass up. Epic Games’ battle royale-style shooter is a cultural juggernaut that includes characters representing a huge array of fandoms. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/681222/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-hands-on">The Switch 2 port makes it feel like an entirely different game</a> than the original Switch version. You can drop in as a character from <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, lock and load as your favorite family member from <em>The Simpsons</em>, or assume the role of Sabrina Carpenter or Kim Kardashian, to name some of the literally dozens of tie-ins that are fun to see in-game.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/845401/nintendo-switch-2-best-games]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-ps-plus-january-game-leaked-coming-need-for-speed/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As gamers enter an all-new year, they’re looking forward to big releases, massive reveals, and of course, a slew of free games handed to them from subscription services like PS Plus. In a recent post, the first PS Plus game of January 2026 was revealed, and it’s coming in just a few days.</p>



<p>Fans of high-octane racing titles with an arcade twist will be pleased with what’s coming first to PS Plus in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-need-for-speed-unbound-coming-to-ps-plus">Need for Speed: Unbound Coming to PS Plus</h2>



<p>In a new post from Dealabs, it was leaked that the first game headed to PS Plus in January 2026 is Need for Speed: Unbound. It’ll be added to the PS Plus service from Tuesday, January 6th at 9 AM GMT.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-essential-on-vous-revele-le-premier-jeu-du-mois-de-lannee-2026-60812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs report</a>, Need for Speed: Unbound will be available across all tiers of PS Plus: Essential, Extra, and Premium. It’s not yet clear what the ‘other two titles’ are that will join the service at the same time.</p>



<p>Need for Speed: Unbound was released in 2022 and stands as the most recent iteration in the popular racing series. It secured a Metascore of 77, which is regarded as ‘Generally Favorable’, so it should be a nice addition to the PlayStation Plus service.</p>



<p>We recently published a guide showcasing the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-games-you-must-play-on-playstation-plus-released-in-2025/">top PS Plus titles</a> on the service released in 2025 that you <strong>need </strong>to play. No racing games found a spot on the list, unfortunately. It did feature the likes of God of War: Ragnarok, Red Dead Redemption, and Alan Wake 2, though.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to install Need for Speed: Unbound when it lands on PS Plus in January 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fans Accuse Battlefield 6 of Copying Call of Duty Art]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-fans-art-copy-call-of-duty-ghosts/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the first-person shooter space, fans of the two titans, Call of Duty and Battlefield, have found themselves up in arms again. This time, it’s over accusations that Electronic Arts has ‘blatantly copied’ Call of Duty art from days gone by, releasing a new Battlefield 6 skin that is eerily reminiscent of 2013’s Call of Duty Ghosts.</p>



<p>The latest Battlefield Pro battle pass contains a skin with a balaclava that’s admittedly walking the line between ‘inspired by’ and ‘pure replication’. Check it out below.</p>







<h2 id="h-did-electronic-arts-plagiarise-call-of-duty-ghosts">Did Electronic Arts Plagiarise Call of Duty Ghosts?</h2>



<p>If you’ve been in the Battlefield 6 space of late, you might have noticed the new Battlefield Pro battle pass drop that contains, amongst other things, the ‘Objective Ace’ skin.</p>



<p>If you were also around during 2013 and enjoyed Call of Duty Ghosts, you might have spotted something that doesn’t look right.</p>



<p>The Objective Ace skin for the Assault class has a balaclava that’s almost a stitch-for-stitch copy of the iconic ‘Ghosts’ balaclava from the 2013 Call of Duty game of the same name.</p>



<p>Here’s a comparison image of the two graphics side-by-side for you to make up your own mind:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>On social media, fans were quick to draw comparisons with bright red arrows and circles, pointing out some of the obvious similarities. For instance, the ‘spiking’ of the skull to the base of the image, the ‘craack’ across the lower half of the skull, and the ‘chip’ above the right eyebrow.</p>



<p>It’s not <strong>identical</strong>, but it’s damn close, and that’s why fans have issues with this particular skin.</p>



<p>It’s difficult <strong>not </strong>to see the resemblance, but perhaps there are only so many ways you can represent a faded, scuffed, and worn skull motif on a balaclava. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the Battlefield 6 team came under fire on December 21 for using what was believed to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-under-fire-suspected-ai-art/">AI-generated art</a> for new sticker bundles. It’s not getting better, is it?</p>







<p>Do you think the Battlefield Pro balaclava is too close to the Call of Duty Ghosts art to be acceptable? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/31/game-of-the-year-2025-overall-winner/</link>
            <guid>1394824</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As we venture into the final hours of the year, and with some parts of the world are already sneaking into the next, it’s time to reveal our overall <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/game-of-the-year-2025">Game of the Year 2025</a> winner!</p>
<p>We’ve been doling out awards for a whole host of categories, from looking at our favourite visuals, audio, and narratives of the year, to breaking games out into their genres, including a new run-based Roguelike category. For the overall winner, the favourites and front runners would have been obvious to see from the off, but who comes out on top?</p>
<p>We’re highlighting the top three, as usual, but our winner is…</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">Ghost of Yotei</a> has climbed to the top of the mountain to claim our Overall Game of the Year Award 2025, and for good reason. Sucker Punch’s follow up to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tshushima</a> is stronger in every way from the story, the combat, but most importantly the world. Ghost of Yotei’s open world of Ezo is one that is crafted so well that it invites you to explore, and you accept that invitation willingly.</p>

<p>Sucker Punch has crafted an environment where exploration is signalled by clues within the environment, like trees covered in flowers, and smoke on the horizon tapping into your curiosity. Ghost of Yotei’s world is made stronger by having a variety of environments to explore across its regions, each hiding its own dangers and secrets. The world itself is inhabited by interesting characters that weave in and out of Atsu’s story, be it through the mainline path, side missions, and even the bounty hunts that feed into the overall narrative.</p>
<p>As I said in my Ghost of Yōtei review, “This is a truly worthy successor to Ghost of Tsushima.” And the journey is not over with the Legends content coming in 2026 that will draw so many of us back to Ezo’s shores.</p>
<p><em>– Aran</em></p>
<h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Runner Up</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is just a beautiful game. It begins strong, with an irresistibly intriguing setup: in a fractured world where Paris sits upon one of few islands amidst the chaos an unravelling world, the Paintress, a giant with long hair covering her face, sits beside a monolith with the number 34 on it. She erases the number and replaces it with 33, and everyone of that age fades into oblivion. Another in a long line of expeditions readies itself to try and destroy her, including Gustave, whose long lost love just turned into smoke and flower petals. It’s just as strange and mysterious right up until the very end.</p>
<p>It’s not just story and setting, though. There’s also an intricate turn-based combat system that, when harnessed properly, can make you feel very powerful indeed. All of the characters play completely differently as well, each one a completely new playstyle to fiddle around with, but each as potentially strong as the other. On top of that, there’s a parry and dodge system, allowing you to pull victory from the jaws of defeat by ably parrying and countering if you’re good enough. Whilst it may be challenging to read the fiendishly deceptive attack animations, successfully countering a combo of six attacks is at least satisfying enough to be worth it. Clair Obscur is a remarkable achievement for such a small studio and remains one of biggest surprises and one of best games of the year.</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Gamoc</em></p>
<h3>Hades 2 – Runner Up</h3>
<p>One hundred and three. That’s the number of times I’ve commenced a run in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/26/hades-2-review/">Hades 2</a>, either sending the magic-spell concocting Melinoë on a descent to the dark-depths of the underworld, or having her travel across the surface to clamber atop Mount Olympus. Just like the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">Hades</a>, the combat remains crisp, responsive and utterly beguiling; it’s a hectic action-packed thrill-ride of a game, yet you never lose the ability to tell what’s going on despite the onscreen fireworks. In fact, even with the many roguelite imitators over the intervening years, none of the emulators have been able to achieve this perfect balance of spectacle and nuance. It took the return of Supergiant Games to show the rest how it’s done.</p>
<p>What impresses even more, is how that, after some fifty hours into the game, it’s still introducing brilliant new mechanics, fascinating new characters and entirely new storylines to me. Talk about confidence, Supergiant Games saved a lot of the best stuff until tens of hours after the end credits rolled.</p>
<p>My final point as to why Hades 2 is well deserving a place on the GOTY podium; it offers an absolutely perfect interpretation of the larger-than-life icons of Ancient Greek mythology, exploring the volatile relationships between gods, heroes and monsters. It’s a masterclass in bringing new life to ancient mythology.</p>
<p>How do Supergiant Games do it?</p>
<p><em>– Ade</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>And that’s a wrap for our Game of the Year 2025 awards. Congratulations to our winners across the board – we will be keenly watching what comes next from all of these teams!&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Speaking of which, next up we have our Most Wanted lists, looking at the games we’re most excited to see through 2026.</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/"><strong>2025 has been a great year for role-playing games</strong></a>, and 2026 is setting out to be another incredible year for one of the most popular gaming genres around. While next year won't see the release of many new properties, 2026 will see the <strong>return of some beloved series</strong>, with new entries in their respective franchises as well as <strong>remakes that breathe new life</strong> in all time classics.</p>



<p>Here are the <strong>five RPGs</strong> officially confirmed for a 2026 launch that we feel deserve your attention the most at this point in time.</p>



<h2 id="h-nioh-3-february-6-2026-pc-playstation-5">Nioh 3 (February 6, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Nioh-3.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>With its open-field mechanics and tight combat, Nioh 3 is one of the most anticipated RPGs launching in 2026</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><span>Following games like&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</strong></em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty,</strong></em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Rise of the Ronin</strong></em></a>,&nbsp;<strong>Team NINJA</strong>&nbsp;is finally returning to the series that has defined the studio's course since 2017: the&nbsp;<strong>Nioh series</strong>.</span></p>



<p>Unlike <em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/">Nioh 2</a></strong></em>, which refined the formula of its predecessor, bringing it to heights that made it rival FromSoftware games in terms of mechanical complexity, <strong>Nioh 3</strong> is set to provide a brand new experience with the introduction of <strong>open-fields</strong> that will provide a more involving way of engaging with the game's world inspired by different time periods in Japan, including the <strong>Sengoku and Bakumatsu eras</strong>.</p>



<p>This open-field approach, however, won't water down the mechanics that define the Nioh series. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">With the introduction of&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">two fighting styles - Samurai and Ninja - </strong>new mechanics inspired by other games developed by the studio, and a challenging, uncompromising experience,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em>&nbsp;is set to become one of the&nbsp;best games by Team NINJA, if not the very best.</a></strong></span></p>



<h2 id="h-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-february-5-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-2">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined (February 5, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dragon-Quest-VII-Reimagined.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will bring the seventh entry in the series to a whole new audience in 2026</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-new-information/"><strong><em>Dragon Quest XII</em> is nowhere to be seen</strong></a>, the popular JRPG franchise hasn't been dormant. Over the past couple of years, the first three entries in the series received excellent <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-classic-rpgs-at-their-best/">HD-2D makeovers</a></strong>, which will be followed this year by a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-annuounced-for-an-early-2026-release-on-pc-and-consoles/">full-on remake of Dragon Quest VII</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Although the seventh entry in the series was already remade on Nintendo 3DS, <strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</strong> is set to become the <strong>definitive edition</strong> of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-improved-visuals/"><strong>overhauling everything from visuals to gameplay.</strong></a> With its <strong>beautiful handcrafted artstyle and diorama environments</strong>, a streamlined story experience which aims at <strong>trimming the original's very long story</strong>, new scenarios focused on the Hero, Maribel and Keifer, an <strong>improved Vocations system</strong> with the ability to equip two Vocations per character, new spells and skills for an enhanced battle experience, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> promises to deliver the <strong>prime turn-based JRPG experience in 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>Will this be enough to make the long wait for <em>Dragon Quest XII</em> more bearable? We will find out this February.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-tbc-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s">The Blood of Dawnwalker (TBC 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/The-Blood-of-Dawnwalker-Key-Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In early 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-director-new-studio-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that former <strong>The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</strong> director <strong>Konrad Tomaszkiewicz</strong> had founded a new studio called <strong>Rebel Wolves</strong>. Later that year, the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that <strong>NetEase</strong> had provided an investment to create a new <strong>triple-A RPG</strong>, which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-open-world-rpg-revealed-with-gorgeous-trailer-and-in-game-sneak-peek/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> to be titled <strong>The Blood of Dawnwalker</strong>. Their game is actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being published</a> by <strong>Bandai Namco</strong>, though, which is why NetEase's move to pull back from many Western studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-isnt-in-any-danger-despite-netease-involvement-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did not affect Rebel Wolves</a>.</p>



<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker clearly borrows a lot from the framework of The Witcher III (which is only a great thing, as that is one of the finest open world RPGs ever made), but it also adds a few key innovations, such as the fact that there is essentially no difference between main and side quests. The protagonist, Coen, <strong>has 30 days to save his family</strong>; how to reach that goal is entirely up to the player. Tackling specific objectives is radically different during the day, when Coen is human, and at nighttime, when his vampiric abilities manifest. Because of these elements, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-freedom-closer-to-fallout-1-2-pen-paper-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> its role-playing freedom was <strong>inspired by pen-and-paper games</strong>.</p>



<p>Its setting and peculiar twist on vampire lore, with them actually coming out in the open and ruling the Carpathians-inspired Vale Sangora, is also intriguing. For more on The Blood of Dawnwalker, check out <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-qa-vampiric-nature-impact-coen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our exclusive interview with Creative Director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz</a></strong> from Gamescom 2025.  </p>



<h2 id="h-control-resonant-tbc-2026-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s">CONTROL Resonant (TBC 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Control-Resonant.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>CONTROL Resonant is a major shake-up of its predecessor's formula that will deliver Remedy Entertainment's most ambitious experience to date</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the first game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/"><strong>a brilliant action-adventure title</strong></a>, <strong>Remedy</strong> is taking a <strong>"not-so-safe" approach</strong> for the sequel. <strong>CONTROL Resonant</strong> officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/"><strong>shifts the series into full-fledged action RPG territory</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Seven years after the original, the lockdown on the Oldest House has collapsed, and the <strong>paranatural chaos</strong> has spilled out into a <strong>quarantined, "open-ended" Manhattan</strong>. Stepping into the shoes of Jesse’s brother, <strong>Dylan Faden</strong>, players will have to fight this new reality-warping threat with the help of the <strong>Aberrant</strong>, a brutal, shapeshifting melee weapon that pairs with expanded psychic abilities.</p>



<p>With a heavy focus on <strong>build-crafting</strong>, varied enemy types that can match your mobility, and a <strong>meticulously authored version of New York City</strong>, <em>CONTROL Resonant</em> looks to be <strong>Remedy's most ambitious project to date</strong>, and one of the most interesting action RPGs to launch in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-fable-tbc-2026-pc-xbox-series-x-s">Fable (TBC 2026 - PC, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fable-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>It was early 2018 when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fable-game-confirmed-playground/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard the first rumors</a> that <strong>Playground Games</strong> had decided to accept the arduous task of rebooting the long-dormant <strong>Fable</strong> series. The game itself was officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fable-announced-for-xbox-series-x-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> during the 2020 Xbox Games Showcase, but it quickly became clear that it still had a long road ahead of its release. In 2022, a former Playground developer who worked on the project's early stages <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-progress-slow-playground-lack-of-rpg-experience-frugal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that the studio's lack of experience with role-playing games and their frugal approach to development were slowing down progress.</p>



<p>Fable <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-first-gameplay-xbox-games-showcase-richard-ayoade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resurfaced at the Xbox Games Showcase 2023</a> with an in-game trailer that featured actor <strong>Richard Ayoade</strong>, and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">again in 2024</a> with a trailer that featured actor <strong>Matt King</strong> as well as some gameplay. More importantly, that trailer came with a promise of a <strong>2025 launch</strong>, which of course did not happen. In February 2025, Xbox Studios head <strong>Craig Duncan</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the game required additional development time and was thus <strong>delayed until 2026</strong>, accompanied by some promising new gameplay footage.</p>



<p>There has been no further news from the studio. A rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-rumored-missing-2026-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Fable might not even make it next year, although for now, there's no solid evidence to confirm that. As such, we remain hopeful in a 2026 release. </p>

<p>As mentioned above, 2026 is poised to be a fantastic year for role-playing games, and selecting only five titles proved to be a daunting task. Below are several more notable titles that are expected to make waves in the next 12 months.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Top 10 Highest Rated Video Games Of 2025]]></title>

            <guid>1394785</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There’s no question about it: 2025 has been a standout year for video games. From massive AAA blockbusters to boundary-pushing indie gems, the release calendar has been stacked with quality, and many titles have earned widespread critical praise.</p>



<p>With the year drawing to a close, it’s the perfect moment to reflect on its strongest launches. This list is based solely on Metascore ratings from Metacritic. To qualify, a game must have been released in 2025 to <strong>over 25 critic reviews</strong>—apologies to The Legend of Zelda; as great as you are on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-switch-2-claimed-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, we want new games, not ports.</p>







<p>If you’re searching for the cream of the crop, here are the ten highest-rated video games that released in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-top-10-highest-rated-games-released-in-2025">Top 10 Highest Rated Games Released In 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-10-monster-hunter-wilds">10. Monster Hunter Wilds</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Just another day out in the Wilds. Image by Capcom.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 88</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-showcase-announced-for-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter franchise</a> hardly needs an introduction. Venture through sprawling environments, craft and wield powerful weapons, and take down towering beasts—all in pursuit of better gear and ever-greater challenges. It’s a formula that has defined the series for years, and for good reason: it’s endlessly satisfying.</p>



<p>Capcom has long perfected this loop, and Monster Hunter Wilds showcases the series at its very best. It’s also the most approachable entry to date, making it an ideal starting point for newcomers. Whether you’re a veteran hunter or someone curious about diving in for the first time, Wilds stands tall as the newest and most impressive evolution of the franchise.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">9. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Take a trip back to medieval Europe. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 88</strong></p>



<p>It’s easy for early-year releases to slip from memory—especially in a stacked year like 2025—but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-devs-acquire-kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-lead-gameplay-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> refuses to be forgotten. Its remarkable immersion and gripping atmosphere have kept it firmly in the spotlight, resonating with critics right through to the year’s end.</p>



<p>Nearly every aspect of the game is executed with exceptional polish. The cutscenes, writing, visuals, and core gameplay all stand as shining examples of what a modern RPG can strive to be. If you’re a fan of rich, grounded storytelling paired with deeply engaging, authentic gameplay, then this is one 2025 release you absolutely shouldn’t overlook.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-dispatch">8. Dispatch</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Up there with the Telltale greats. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 89</strong></p>



<p>Dispatch may not have launched with the same blockbuster buzz as some of 2025’s heavy hitters, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-director-calls-dispatch-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quickly made a name for itself</a>, as it settles in as one of the highest-rated games of the year. AdHoc Studio’s episodic adventure blends sharp writing with a clever superhero twist, placing you in the role of Robert Robertson III—a former hero now managing crises from behind the scenes as a dispatcher. </p>



<p>If you thought the gameplay was reminiscent of Telltale games of old, then you’d be right. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-dispatch-adhoc-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AdHoc is made up of former Telltale veterans</a>, and Dispatch proudly channels that lineage with its branching choices, punchy character dialogue, and narrative-driven pacing. Each episode plays out as a slick animated series brought to life, backed by strong performances and confident direction. It’s tightly crafted, consistently entertaining, and a standout reminder of how impactful choice-based storytelling can be.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">7. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Kojima at his best. Image by Kojima Productions.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 89</strong></p>



<p>There are few creators in the industry with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-doesnt-know-if-od-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vision as distinctive as Hideo Kojima’s</a>, and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach might be his most striking showcase yet. At a glance, it may appear to be another atmospheric delivery-focused “walking sim,” sending players across sweeping landscapes with cargo in tow—but that surface-level read barely scratches the depth beneath. The sequel expands on the original’s foundations with richer mechanics, broader exploration, and a renewed emphasis on improvisation and survival.</p>



<p>At its core, Kojima once again crafts a story about human connection and the lengths we go to forge and maintain it. Every mechanic, from traversal to cargo management, serves a narrative purpose, reinforcing the themes woven throughout the journey. Combined with an exceptional cast delivering some of the year’s strongest performances, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-film-a24-original-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a> lands as one of 2025’s most affecting and ambitious releases.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-hollow-knight-silksong">6. Hollow Knight: Silksong</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The wait didn’t disappoint. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 90</strong></p>



<p>There were stretches over the past few years when it genuinely felt like the long-awaited sequel to Hollow Knight might never arrive. Team Cherry maintained an unwavering silence that became almost mythical in its own right, leaving fans to wonder if Silksong would remain a dream rather than a reality. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">But when it finally launched</a>, the wait proved more than worthwhile—Silksong didn’t just meet expectations, it shattered them.</p>



<p>What makes the game so remarkable is how confidently it elevates every facet of the original. Movement and combat are faster, smoother, and more expressive than ever, giving Hornet a distinct identity that feels both familiar and thrillingly new. The world is richer and more atmospheric, the story deeper, and the level design more ambitious in scope. Silksong accomplishes what many believed impossible: it meaningfully improves on Hollow Knight, delivering an adventure that stands as one of the year’s defining triumphs and a masterclass in Metroidvania design.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-donkey-kong-bananza">5. Donkey Kong Bananza</h3>



<figure><figcaption>On the hunt for Bananas! Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 91</strong></p>



<p>Fans had been hoping for a Super Mario Odyssey sequel ever since the Switch classic was first released, but Nintendo ultimately had a different vision in mind. Donkey Kong Bonanza arrived as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananzas-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spiritual successor rather than a direct follow-up</a>—a game that channels Odyssey’s spirit while carving out its own bold identity.</p>







<p>What’s immediately clear is that it’s unapologetically a Donkey Kong adventure. The refined elegance of Mario is swapped for DK’s heavier, more powerful movement, giving the platforming a satisfyingly weighty feel. Yet the team didn’t abandon the fluidity that made Odyssey such a modern platforming masterpiece. Instead, they built upon it, designing levels with verticality, momentum, and environmental interaction tailored perfectly to DK’s strengths. The result is a vibrant, imaginative, and fiercely inventive 3D platformer, one that proudly stands as one of the best the genre has seen in years, and one of the highest-rated games of 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-split-fiction">4. Split Fiction</h3>

<p><strong>Metascore: 91</strong></p>



<p>Hazelight Studios has practically redefined what co-op gaming can look like, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-is-on-course-to-outsell-it-takes-twos-20-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> carries that torch with confidence. It’s a game built entirely around collaboration—so much so that playing it solo is downright impossible. Its enforced teamwork isn’t a gimmick but one of its greatest strengths, pushing players to communicate, coordinate, and experience every moment together.</p>



<p>Even beyond its co-op brilliance, Split Fiction is an exceptional piece of game design. The sheer variety on display is astonishing: one moment you’re soaring across a fantasy realm atop a dragon, and the next you’re tearing through a neon sci-fi setting on a high-speed motorbike. Each sequence feels fresh, inventive, and packed with personality. It’s wild, imaginative, and endlessly entertaining.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-blue-prince">3. Blue Prince</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll never stop exploring. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 92</strong></p>



<p>Blue Prince emerged as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-creator-praises-blue-prince-as-one-of-the-best-games-hes-ever-played/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of 2025’s standout indie hits</a>, offering a clever blend of mystery, strategy, and roguelike design. You play as Simon P. Jones, tasked with uncovering the hidden 46th room inside the ever-shifting Mt. Holly Estate. Each day, the mansion reshuffles itself, forcing you to reopen doors, navigate new layouts, and piece together clues as you steadily rebuild your understanding of its labyrinthine structure.</p>



<p>What makes Blue Prince so captivating is how it turns that unpredictability into a deeply satisfying puzzle. Every run reveals new fragments of lore, fresh room combinations, and surprising twists that make the mansion feel alive. It’s inventive, atmospheric, and endlessly replayable, making it one of the highest-rated games of 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-clair-obscur-expedition-33">2. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Race against time. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 92</strong></p>



<p>Explaining why Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 ranks among the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sets-record-as-2025s-best-third-party-xbox-game-pass-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-rated games of the year</a> is almost impossible—not because the reasons are scarce, but because there are so many to choose from. The turn-based fantasy RPG blends a stunning Belle Époque–inspired aesthetic with a gripping, emotionally charged narrative, all while pushing the boundaries of what a modern turn-based RPG can be. Its combat system, worldbuilding, and striking visual identity come together in a way that feels both refreshingly new and instantly timeless.</p>



<p>It’s rare for a studio to deliver a debut title with this level of polish and ambition, yet that’s exactly what Sandfall Interactive has achieved. The French team has crafted something bold, beautiful, and unforgettable—an experience that resonates long after the credits roll. After all, there’s a reason it became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most nominated game ever at The Game Awards</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-hades-2">1. Hades 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hauntingly beautiful. Image by Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metascore: 95</strong></p>



<p>Hades 2 arriving in 2025 felt like the gaming world collectively holding its breath—and Supergiant Games delivered in a way only they could. After spending some time in early access, the sequel takes everything that made the original so beloved and expands it with confidence, introducing a new protagonist, a richer world, and even deeper layers of mythology to explore. The moment-to-moment gameplay is as sharp and addictive as ever, but there’s a newfound elegance in how combat, progression, and narrative flow together, making each run feel meaningful.</p>



<p>What elevates Hades 2 even further is how effortlessly it balances familiarity with innovation. Supergiant’s signature art style and storytelling return in full force, but the expanded cast, refined systems, and fresh environments give the sequel a flavour entirely its own. It’s bigger, bolder, and often more surprising than its predecessor—no small feat considering the heights the first game reached. In a year stacked with standout releases, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2 shines as the highest-rated game released in 2025</a>.</p>

		<p>The ever-reliable billbil-kun over on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/">dealabs.com</a> has got the scoop on one of the games coming to PS Plus January 2026. According to their sources, the main title for January will be Need for Speed: Unbound on PS5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Need for Speed Unbound - Speed Race Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CBPZapIh4MQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Criterion developed the game and it was published in 2022 by EA, and when it was released we gave it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/05/need-for-speed-unbound-review/">9/10 in our review</a>, calling it “the best arcade racer of 2022”. Since then it has had multiple updates but support for the game ended in in 2024 when Criterion moved on to help make Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>The PS Plus January 2026 title is the PS5 version as Sony&nbsp; announced that January 2026, PS4 games will no-longer be a guaranteed part of the PlayStation Plus monthly games lineup. Cross-gen games that have a PS4 version could certainly still be included – and there’s still tons of PS4 games being released – but it’s not going to be a requirement anymore.</p>
<p>Here’s Sony’s statement from the PS Blog:</p>

<p><em>As many of our players are currently playing on PS5 and have shifted toward redeeming and accessing PS5 titles from the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit, PlayStation Plus is also evolving with this trend and will focus on offering PS5 titles through the Monthly Games and Game Catalog benefit starting January 2026. As we shift to PS5, PS4 games will no longer be a key benefit and will only be occasionally offered for PlayStation Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog starting January 2026. We may still provide titles that can be playable on both PS4 and PS5 consoles after this date.</em></p>
<p><em>Please note, this won’t affect the PS4 Monthly Games that you have already redeemed from PlayStation Plus. You’ll continue to have access to games you’ve already redeemed as long as you remain a member.&nbsp; For Game Catalog, PS4 games will still be available to play until it leaves the catalog as part of our monthly refresh.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ll continue to evolve the experience of PlayStation Plus and optimize the benefits you receive, including exclusive discounts, online multiplayer access, online game save storage and more. As we shift our focus to PS5, we look forward to adding new PS5 titles monthly for you to enjoy.</em></p>
<p>The PS Plus January 2026 games should be officially revealed later today on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/">PlayStation Blog.&nbsp;</a></p>
<h4>What are the PS Plus December 2025 Monthly Games?</h4>
<p>There’s a big bundle of titles for PS Plus this month, available from Tuesday, 2nd December until January 6th, 2026</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LEGO Horizon Adventures</strong>&nbsp;| PS5</li>
<li><strong>Killing Floor 3</strong>&nbsp;| PS5</li>
<li><strong>The Outlast Trials</strong>&nbsp;| PS4, PS5</li>
<li><strong>Synduality Echo of Ada</strong>&nbsp;| PS5</li>
<li><strong>Neon White</strong>&nbsp;| PS4, PS5</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot’s Fighting Game 2XKO Is Getting a Full Launch on PC & Consoles on January 20, 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/</link>
            <guid>1394758</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2025 early access debut on PC</a>, <strong>Riot</strong> is preparing to launch the fighting game <strong>2XKO</strong> as a full release on both PC and consoles. An announcement trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BVTEIoD_S0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was published a few hours ago on YouTube</a> by Riot but quickly went private, which means someone posted it beforehand. Still, even though it technically counts as a 'leak', it's the kind where the official source self-leaks the news in advance, and so can be considered accurate.</p>



<p>2XKO has been a long time coming. It all started after Radiant Entertainment, the studio that made <strong>Rising Thunder</strong> (as well as the city builder Stonehearth), was acquired by Riot in 2016. While that meant the cancellation of Rising Thunder, the founders, the <strong>Cannon brothers</strong>, quickly started working on a new fighting game under Riot.</p>



<p>That wasn't very surprising. Despite Stonehearth, the Cannon brothers were always more interested in fighting games than anything else; after all, they founded the <strong>Evolution Championship Series</strong> and also developed the <strong>GGPO</strong> middleware, which provided the <strong>rollback netcode technology</strong> now practically mandatory for any self-respecting fighting game with online functionality.</p>



<p>It took many years to get this new project running, though. The first confirmation that they were indeed working on a new fighting game <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-rising-thunder-devs-are-indeed-working-on-a-fighting-game-at-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came in August 2019</a>, but it wasn't until August 2022 that fans got another major update, when the developers<a href="https://wccftech.com/league-of-legends-fighting-game-project-l-goes-free-to-play-new-fighter-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> revealed</a> that it would be a free-to-play title. The game's title, 2XKO, was only announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in February 2024</a>. That's also when we learned the first actual details on the game, which is a 2v2 tag-team fighting game where players select two characters from Riot's League of Legends setting. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="2XKO Official Cinematic: Ties That Bind ft. Courtney LaPlante of Spiritbox" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xyK3lFtz2H8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>One champion starts as the "Point," while the other starts as the "Assist." Players can tag in and out to swap active fighters, creating a four-player arena. Active tagging lets you call in assists mid-combo to extend damage or set up mix-ups. Furthermore, tag-in timing is crucial to offensive flow.</p>



<p>In an attempt to improve accessibility to those who aren't well-versed in the genre, there are no traditional quarter-circle or dragon-punch motions in 2XKO; instead, champions use button combinations. Another key feature of the game is the Fuse system, a team-building customization mechanic (similar to League keystones) that grants abilities like back-to-back assist calling, increased damage at health advantage, or dual ultimates, allowing users to customize duo synergies and playstyles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It doesn’t feel like Nintendo just released a new console. Last year around this time we were inundated with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-reveal-release-date-reddit-1851725408"><span>weekly leaks</span></a><span> about the Switch 2. They all pointed to the same thing: it would be a bigger, more powerful version of the console we already knew and loved. Nintendo kicked 2025 off by showing us a Switch 2 that was exactly that. It launched in June to significant fanfare and hype, and there has been surprisingly little to say about the Switch 2 ever since.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It looks lean, feels sleek, and runs older blockbusters and even some newer ones surprisingly well. But its boldest innovation is a video sharing feature that feels </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-one-will-play-uno-on-a-console-really-why-bother-looking-back-at-uno-the-xbox-live-arcade-hit-that-thrust-social-play-onto-the-360-generation"><span>plucked out of 2006</span></a><span> and which I never hear anyone talk about. The quintessential smartphone upgrade of video game consoles, the Switch 2 set launch sales records but dominated the conversation less than anyone expected.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Nintendo’s latest flagship console doesn’t break the mold. It remains, first and foremost, a machine for playing Nintendo games, most of which are sequels to franchises that have been around since the last millennium. And it does that splendidly, even if the games themselves haven’t always cleared the lofty bar set by the Switch 1’s first year. Do I sound a little disappointed? I’m trying not to be.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>2025 was a transition year for Nintendo’s hardware; one that feels less like a clear passing of the baton than an extended farewell where everyone spends an extra 15 minutes gossipping at the door while putting on their coats before actually saying goodbye. The Switch 1 was a must-buy in 2017. In 2025 the Switch 2 is more of a nice-to-have.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>The Hardware</h2> <p><span>You can tell when a certain line of hardware has matured by what people focus on. The raw specs? A refined form factor? New software features? With the Switch 2, it’s a satisfying but mostly inconsequential gimmick. One of the first things anyone will do with the new device is feel the tug of magnets as the new Joy-Con click into place on the sides of the console. A hundred times later, it still delights me and yields an unwarranted flash of joy. If only the thumb-stick nubs weren’t still garbage.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The other thing that stands out most about the Switch 2 is how much faster it charges. While the battery life overall isn’t very impressive, and is still sapped surprisingly quickly even in sleep mode, it’s now possible to get a mostly full charge in just one hour. This isn’t a reason to upgrade a console, but it’s one of the things I spend the most time doing with my Switch 2 besides playing it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The screen, slightly larger than that of its predecessor, also feels surprisingly revelatory. It’s like you’ve been driving with the sun visor down and then you lift it up to reveal the rest of the horizon. The addition of those few inches of space feels like having a blast shield lifted from your face. It’s not OLED, but the resolution is sharp, the colors are vibrant, and the overall build quality feels nice. Setting HDR correctly, though, is a pain.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000656191" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656191"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656191">Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Most importantly, the guts of the machine delivered the type of next-gen upgrade you’d want from a device that costs $150 more than its predecessor did at launch. It kept up well with modern third-party blockbusters like </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Star Wars Outlaws,</span></i><span> and ran first-party Nintendo games with sprawling worlds, like</span><i><span> Mario Kart World </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> Donkey Kong Bananza</span></i><span>, with no major issues, at least in docked mode.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The old Switch, meanwhile, is harder than ever to go back to. The screen is small, the bezels feel that much larger, and the OS lags more than my two-year-old on a one-mile walk around the neighborhood. The hardware has held up well mechanically, but is hanging off the edge of a cliff when it comes to actual game performance.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Fans have been seeing the original Switch show its age with new releases for years now, but </span><i><span>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i><span> are likely to serve as the final nails in the coffin for anyone trying to stick it out on the less capable last-gen machines. Are the games busted on Switch 1? Not at all. Can you enjoy them? Definitely. Would I recommend just holding off until you eventually buy a Switch 2? Absolutely.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s worth noting that, like the Switch 2, the original Switch also saw a price hike in 2025. It now costs $40 more than it did at launch. The used prices for the old hardware, thankfully, have remained surprisingly low. A secondhand Switch Lite for $100 was probably the best deal in games this year.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The Software</h2> <p><span>The Switch 2 interface remains stubbornly barebones in an era when the Xbox Series X/S and PS5 continue to add new bells and whistles to their home screen experiences. Customization options are minimal. The row of icons constantly jiggles around based solely on what you played last. Tons of blank real estate above and below is still a wasteland, with no backgrounds to swap to besides night mode.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>GameChat, the Switch 2’s actual big back-of-the-box feature, performs fine, but feels unmoored from the broader console experience. Meanwhile, the console itself can play </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span> better than its predecessor, but compared to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, the Switch 2 remains just as fundamentally uninterested in being a social hub as the Switch was.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s the only major gaming platform not to be integrated with the biggest communication platform for gaming: Discord. Sharing game capture and images now requires a dedicated smartphone app from Nintendo’s ever-growing repository of console features outsourced to second screens. It’s not a terrible idea in principle, but it doesn’t feel sane or streamlined in practice.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000656193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656193"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656193">Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>2025 was the year that Nintendo tried to divorce itself from the increasingly unstable broader internet. It set up a dedicated Nintendo Today! news app that is sometimes the only place to find out about things like the upcoming </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span> movie, but is more often than not just a glorified calendar for sharing existing character art.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s also a dedicated app for parental controls, music, and more. None of it is organically integrated into the actual device fans just spent a ton of money on. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-store-app-music-too-many-switch-2-iphone-phone-2000641401"><span>The whole setup</span></a><span> is, frankly, insane.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There were some bright spots for Nintendo’s on-system user-experience in 2025, however. It established virtual card sharing to allow users to lend out digital games across different devices as long as they’re linked by a family group or share a user profile. It’s a process that looks more complicated on paper than it feels in practice.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It makes the experience of jumping back and forth between the original Switch and the Switch 2 a lot more seamless than it was with any previous generational leaps in Nintendo’s history. The only downside is that cloud save syncing can’t always keep up. It’s a step in the right direction, but still a far cry from Microsoft’s brave new “play anywhere” future.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Another bone Nintendo threw to older Switch owners was GameShare, a way to use multiplayer across multiple devices in the same room. While GameShare works online via GameChat for Switch 2 owners, it also works locally for those with the old handheld hybrid. It works surprisingly well for things like</span><i><span> Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</span></i><span> multiplayer, streaming the game to an old Switch for player two. It runs at lower resolution and framerates, but is a nice option that adds utility to the older hardware, even if it’s probably going to stay a niche feature over the long run.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>The Services</h2> <p><span>Switch Online expanded in a big way this year with the addition of GameCube games. Exclusive to Switch 2, the new classic console experience kicked off with </span><i><span>F-Zero GX</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Soulcalibur II</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</span></i><span> in June, followed by</span><i><span> Super Mario Strikers</span></i><span> in July, </span><i><span>Chibi-Robo!</span></i><span> in August,</span><i><span> Luigi’s Mansion</span></i><span> in October, and </span><i><span>Wario World</span></i><span> in December.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Games like </span><i><span>Super Mario Sunshine</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</span></i><span> remain MIA for now, and it’ll be interesting to see how much the library expands into third-party releases. It added a lot of value to the existing $50-a-year Expansion Pack subscription, which also gained access to paid Switch 2 upgrades for Switch games like </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</span></i></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000656192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656192">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>But one thing Nintendo didn’t do was bring back Virtual Console, or some other mechanism for buying old games a la carte. Entire months still go by without any new classics added to any of the console back catalogs. And glaring omissions like</span><i><span> Super Smash Bros. 64</span></i><span> raise questions about whether some games will ever be added to the service.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Switch Online, which is still just $20 a year, will become mandatory for GameChat access starting after March 31, 2026. At the same time, users are getting other benefits like new music in Nintendo’s Spotify-like app for game soundtracks. Practically every week gets new tracks for games ranging from </span><i><span>Metroid 2</span></i><span> to </span><i><span>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</span></i><span>, though obvious albums like </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span> are still missing.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Meanwhile, other benefits have been dropped from the service. Just in time for the new console’s release, Nintendo ditched its gold coins system that gave players cash back on eShop purchases, and is similarly sunsetting its Switch Game Vouchers program, a series of coupons that let fans get new games at a discount. Done right, it was one way to keep gaming on Switch more affordable. Instead, being a Nintendo fan is only getting more expensive amid tariffs, $80 games, and Switch 2 upgrade fees.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The Games</h2> <p><span>It was an eclectic year for Switch and Switch 2 releases, if not one that will be remembered like 2017, when Nintendo launched a new console into one of the best lineups in its history. </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span> initially dazzled but doesn’t feel as full-bodied as </span><i><span>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</span></i><span> does after years of post-release updates and DLC. Despite issuing a number of balance updates, the company has been weird about actually letting fans play the game the way they want to online.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>New add-ons for </span><i><span>Mario Party Jamboree</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</span></i><span> were nice upgrade incentives but hardly groundbreaking. </span><i><span>Kirby Air Riders</span></i><span>, for all of director Masahiro Sakurai’s pre-release hype, was nice, fun, </span><i><span>fine</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Donkey Kong Bananza</span></i><span>, an unexpected highlight, provided a novel gimmick and a crowd-pleasing ending to bookend an otherwise B+ experience. </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i><span>, despite the nearly decade-long wait, was also less than transformative.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000000903" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000903"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000903">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> delivered for</span><i><span> Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span> fans, bolstering what would have been an otherwise disappointing inaugural holiday season for the Switch 2, but it did not quite transform the franchise the way Switch 1 iterations of some long-standing series did. There was certainly no shortage of new Nintendo releases in 2025, from </span><i><span>Mario Galax</span></i><span>y remasters to </span><i><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></i><span> upgrades, but nothing that quite lived up to the sky-high expectations attached to the new hardware around this time last year.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But Nintendo has done a good job of building up the Switch 2’s initial base of third-party support. Ubisoft showed up with ports that underpromised and over-delivered, even as others like </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> were indefinitely delayed. </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Hitman: World of Assassination</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Street Fighter 6</span></i><span> all showed the breadth of what fans might expect heading into this new Nintendo console generation, which is access to many of the biggest modern games around, available with fewer compromises than expected, at least early on.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you look at the 10 highest-rated releases of the year according to Metacritic, seven of them are available on Switch and four of them, including </span><i><span>Hades 2</span></i><span>, are console exclusives. It’s not hard to see the rest, including </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> Blue Prince</span></i><span>, eventually coming to the platform in 2026. At least for now, Switch 2 is shaping up to have a broader powerhouse library of games than its predecessor. The only real question is whether Nintendo can raise the bar again, or has hit its current ceiling.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The Future</h2> <p><span>There were four things that made the first year of the original Switch so special: portability, indie games, a great</span><i><span> Mario</span></i><span> game, and a groundbreaking </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span>. The Switch 2 benefited from none of those things in quite the same way. It still feels like we’re in the warm-up phase. Nintendo isn’t one to rest on its laurels, but it’s also looking beyond just games these days.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Nintendo’s biggest release of 2026 probably won’t be on Switch 2. If it performs as well as the first one, </span><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</span></i><span> will, in terms of cultural reach and box office prowess, outshine anything that the company can stick on a cartridge. It opened a new Super Nintendo World theme park location in Orlando this year, and continues branching out into real-world experiences, new stores, more toys, and other transmedia products.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The Switch 2 feels like the Switch 1 all grown up, and it is both more useful and more boring as a result. It wears a half-zip, pays its bills on time, and always shows up on time at the bar. It has its shit together. Give it your money. It’s the gaming equivalent of investing your 401k in an index fund.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But can Nintendo still flood it with imaginative possibilities that surprise and delight the way it did with releases like Labo and </span><i><span>Ring Fit</span></i><span> on the Switch in its early years? Will it give us fresh gameplay ideas and new franchises, or reinvent the old ones to the point where they feel almost unrecognizable? That will be the test for the Switch 2 in 2026 and beyond. Especially if Nintendo is going to start charging more for it, as some analysts are </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/hardware-prices-will-not-fall-industry-analysts-are-extremely-concerned-about-console-prices-wouldnt-be-shocked-if-the-nintendo-switch-2-costs-more-in-2026/"><span>currently speculating aloud</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The Switch 2 is good enough, but it still has a lot to prove. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-new-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-vr-mod-is-awesome-2000656152</link>
            <guid>1394575</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s a new way to experience Nintendo’s fantastic <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-the-kotaku-rev-1792885174">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.</em> A completely free virtual reality mod for the open-world RPG is out now, letting you hop into Hyrule like never before, and it looks amazing.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/Crementif/BotW-BetterVR"><em>BetterVR</em> is a newly released mod</a> for the Wii U-emulated version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-breath-of-the-wild-helped-me-love-food-again-1842385671"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> that lets you play through the entirety of the game through the eyes of Link himself. You’ll need a copy of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> on Wii U, a somewhat powerful PC, the Cemu emulator, and, of course, a virtual reality headset like the Meta Quest 3. But if you have all that, you can now virtually explore <em>Breath of the Wild</em> in a whole new way.</p>

  <p>This is a fully stereo-rendered VR experience with 6DOF and no alternated eye rendering. <em>BetterVR</em> also supports full hand and arm tracking, letting you chop down trees and fight monsters by flailing around. (You can also use normal button commands if you prefer, of course.) It also features customized VR controls, like reaching behind your back to grab your sword, so it should play and feel like a native VR game.</p>

 <p>I’m not surprised this VR mod is so good. The team behind it, Flat2VR, are the same folks who created the <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-2-vr-mod-alyx-pc-valve-steam-gordon-freeman-1849603782">excellent<em> Half-Life 2 VR</em> mod that is as good as Valve’s very own</a><em> Half-Life: Alyx.</em> The team has also ported other games to VR and has even developed commercially released ports of titles, like <em>Roboquest VR.</em> Even with all that experience, however, making this mod wasn’t easy, as explained in a thorough writeup on the mod’s GitHub page. They had to reverse engineer a lot of how<em> Breath of the Wild</em> worked and then translate that into something that could be rendered and played in VR. The end result is impressive as heck, and I’m almost tempted to download this mod and set up an emulator to check it out. I wasn’t a big fan of <em>Breath of the Wild,</em> but maybe this would change my mind.</p>

 <p>As for how Nintendo lawyers will react to this, who can say? The project seems confident enough that it will be fine, <a href="https://x.com/Flat2VR/status/2005107315041513621">as the team has been posting about it publicly for days</a> before it launched on Tuesday. Seeing as the mod itself contains zero <em>Breath of the Wild</em> files, I’d say <em>BetterVR</em> is probably safe, but you never know with Nintendo.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/this-new-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-vr-mod-is-awesome-2000656152]]></content:encoded>

Its new OneXSugar Wallet is reminiscent of the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/711116/onexsugar-sugar-1-hands-on-preview-transforming-dual-screen">folding OneXSugar Sugar 1 handheld</a> that launched earlier this year. But instead of two screens, the Wallet handheld unfolds to reveal just one big 8.01-inch OLED screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio, as <a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/onexsugar-wallet-is-first-android-handheld-with-a-foldable-screen/">spotted by <em>Retro Handhelds</em></a>.</p><p>The OneXSugar Wallet was <a href="https://weibo.com/7972483950/QkG4HEdwD">announced on China’s Weibo yesterday</a>, but with few details about its features and capabilities. That folding OLED screen has a resolution of 2480 x 1860 pixels, and the handheld will be powered by an unspecified “Qualcomm gaming platform flagship processor,” but its performance and emulation capabilities are unknown.</p><p>Based on <a href="https://weibo.com/7578408888/QkG3sFFlL?pagetype=profilefeed">photos and a video released by One-Netbook</a>, the OneXSugar Wallet will feature a standard set of controls including asymmetrical thumbsticks, four action buttons, and a D-pad situated on either side of the lower half of its display. There are also shoulder buttons and triggers on the back of the handheld and a pair of front-facing speakers flanking the top half of the screen. The biggest question is how much will the handheld cost? There are already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/785828/microsoft-xbox-ally-x-pricing-next-gen-consoles-report">$1,000 handheld consoles</a>, but folding screen devices like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/795298/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/phones/701076/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-7-fe-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> are priced closer to $2,000. Will gamers embrace the OneXSugar Wallet if it’s similarly expensive? Maybe it’s called the Wallet for a reason.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/851401/one-netbook-onexsugar-gaming-handheld-wallet-folding-oled-screen-android]]></content:encoded>

Smashing bugs, shooting guns, detonating explosives—forget the mysteries and sidequests, I wanted to keep playing because the sound of pistols, rifles, and lightning bolts was like candy across both games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Dispatch"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/">Dispatch</a><span> </span>(Adhoc Studios/Critical Role)</h2><p>Image via Adhoc Studio/Critical Role</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm generally leery of superhero stories that are "mature" riffs on the DC/Marvel dynamic, but Adhoc Studios won me over. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is an accomplishment for the modern game development age, a game made by a studio of talented storytellers who could only execute their vision with the help of external collaborators, fighting for their lives in a business environment skeptical about narrative-first titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They succeeded because their vision of a down-and-out superhero struggling to find himself in a chaotic world is such a wonderful fit for the medium. Player character Robert Robertson III captures the frustration of feeling like your life is unstable and you can't figure out how you fit amongst the people around you. The titular "dispatch" system isn't a gimmick—it's a nice bite-sized strategy game to give you a breather on the game's story.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's infuriating that Adhoc was put through the wringer getting this game made. May its outstanding quality be a bullhorn for the game industry: players love strong interactive stories. Help teams make great ones—stop telling themselves to hold back or compromise on what makes their stories special.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Back To The Dawn"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1735700/Back_to_the_Dawn/">Back To The Dawn</a> (Metal Head Games/Spiral Up Games)</h2><p>Image via Metal Head Games/ Spiral Up Games</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I spotted </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Back To The Dawn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a GameDiscoverCo newsletter mentioning surprise Steam hits—this one fueled by a Chinese audience. I checked it out. And it was magnificent?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Few in the Western game development world probably played this one, so I urge you to seek it out. Metal Head Games cooked up a game that blends simulation and linear narrative, as players take on the role of a journalist or undercover cop racing to escape from prison in a gritty, Zootopia-inspired world filled with a pulpy cast of characters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I admire the game not just for its structure—a fixed month-long event cycle with specific events that the player can influence—but also its tone. Prison break stories can be exploitative, either subjecting characters to horrific violence or casting prisoners as irredeemable villains. At their worst, they sand over the edges of a real-world devastating system that ruins lives and often fails to enact justice.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Back To The Dawn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is pulpy but laden with depth. Characters can switch from friendly to ferocious on a dime. It simulates violence without glorifying abuse or rewarding the player's basest instincts. It's a game where kindness and collaboration plays as much a role as subterfuge and blackmail. That's not an easy tone to strike—and that it came through even in localization speaks to how considerate the developers were about the difficulties of prison life.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Demonschool"><a target="_blank" href="https://necrosoftgames.com/demonschool/">Demonschool</a> (Necrosoft Games/Ysbyrd Games)</h2><p>Image via Necrosoft Games/Ysbyrd Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disclaimer: Necrosoft founder Brandon Sheffield is a former Game Developer contributor and friend of the site.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I want more games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Demonschool</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

Combat is often more of a puzzle than a test of skill. Save stations are (mostly) religiously enforced.

            <p>Rainbow Six Siege is still struggling today after hackers gave out "billions" in in-game currency, forcing Ubisoft to briefly "intentionally" shut down the game.</p>
<p>While Ubisoft has not shared much of the details, players reported that the hackers banned - and unbanned - thousands of players, took control of the ban feed, gave all players 2 billion credits and renown each, and unlocked every premium skin for all players without charge.</p>
<p>Hackers then banned dozens of fake accounts "so that the usernames displayed the lyrics of Michael Jackson's Billie Jean" on-screen, as seen below.</p>
<p>While Ubisoft says the issue is now resolved, the game's service page suggests issues persist right across the board.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Rainbow Six Siege was hacked, and the hackers gave players billions in in-game currency.</p><p>The hackers also banned dozens of fake accounts in a sequence so that the usernames displayed the lyrics of "Billie Jean" by Michael Jackson.<a href="https://t.co/pWPFSFbwav">pic.twitter.com/pWPFSFbwav</a></p></div>— Romulus Industries (@RomulusInd) <a href="https://twitter.com/RomulusInd/status/2005150413520339315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>After <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808">notifying</a> players of an "incident" on 27th December, the publisher "intentionally shut down" both Siege and its Marketplace "while the team focuses on resolving the issue".</p>
<p>It also confirmed that while it had rolled back erroneous transactions, "nobody will be banned for spending credits received" and reminded players that the ban ticker had been turned off in a prior update.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A rollback is currently ongoing and afterwards, extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.

<p>"An official R6 ShieldGuard ban wave did occur, but is not related to this incident," Ubisoft added. "We are working very hard to make sure this is resolved and players can play again.</p>
<p>"A rollback is currently ongoing and afterwards, extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes," the team added in a subsequent update on X/Twitter. "The team is focused on getting players back into the game as quickly as possible.</p><p>"Please know that this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed. We will provide another update as soon as we know more. Thank you all for your patience and understanding as we continue to tackle this."</p>
<p>Then, on 28th December, Ubisoft launched a "soft launch", which only opened the game to a "small number of players only" while it completed live tests. Yesterday, 29th December, tests concluded and the game opened up to all again.</p>
<p>As a consequence, however, players experienced queues whilst connecting, and while players who didn't log in during the affected period should see no changes, those who did "may temporarily lose access to some owned items. Investigations and corrections will continue over the next two weeks".</p>
<p>The Marketplace remains closed "until further notice".</p>
<p>"We appreciate your patience as we work hard to investigate the cause of these known issues and ensure the whole community can get back to playing Siege," Ubisoft said in its latest official <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005702094913671606?s=20">communication</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, however, the game's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status">service status page</a> suggests "unplanned" outages persist, with connectivity, authentication, in-game store, and matchmaking all listed as "degraded" or showing a complete "outage" across every single platform (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and last-gen systems). It's unclear why at this time. </p>
