The iconic board game, which started as a critique of unchecked capitalism, has been around for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/monopoly-hasbro-100th-anniversary-edition-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a century</a> with countless spin-offs. But Hasbro's plans involve a retooling of the original, and the official introduction of premium expansions.</p>

<h2>The <em>Monopoly</em> 2025 Roadmap</h2>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/492505/monopoly-new-version-expansions-announced" rel="nofollow">Polygon</a>, Hasbro senior vice president Brian Baker stated the changes coming to Monopoly in 2025 was to make the board game more inviting to modern players.</p>

The game will now be contained in a square box instead of its tradtional rectangle, allowing for easier storage. In addition, the play money, deed, Community Chest, and Chance cards have been revised. The metal movers, house and hotel models have also been made bigger.</p>

<p>All of these new game pieces can easily be organized and set up thanks to a new robust plastic organizer. According to Baker this was done so the game would be easier to set up and put away..</p>

<p>But the biggest change coming to <em>Monopoly</em> in 2025 is the official introduction of expansion packs. These expansions are designed to speed up the process of play.</p>

It adds a spinner to the board, allowing players to let it ride without adding money back into the in-game economy.</p>

<p>The second expansion is <em>Monopoly Go To Jail</em>. This expansion lessens the impact of going to jail with the introduction of corruption cards. Thesecards are only available to convicted felons.</p>

<p>Third is the <em>Monopoly Buy Everything Expansion</em>. As the name implies, it allows you to buy anything. Even the bank.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We don’t necessarily need to sell more Monopolys,” Baker said. “Most people already own Monopoly. What they’re looking for is a reason to play it again.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This new version of <em>Monopoly</em> and its expansions will be coming to Amazon, Target, and Wal-Mart later this year. The base game will be sold at an MSRP of $19.99. The expansions are available at an MSRP of $9.99 each.</p>

When he goes back to see if the cat is still there, he discovers it’s missing. So, he knocks on the door of a home, and its Lumon boss Ms. Cobel (Patricia Arquette). It’s in this meeting that we would have witnessed the one element that would’ve made it a very different series.</p><p>“There’s a sequence of her showing him her pet rat, who she then tortures. But, it turns out the rat is severed. So, she switches, and suddenly the rat is now snuggling her. That’s how she explains to him what severance is,” Erickson says. After this encounter, Mark returns to Cobel’s house only to see it replaced with a Porta Potty, which Mark communicates to Cobel in through some unspecified way. </p><p>Notably, that rat sequence would’ve introduced audiences to the idea that animals can not only be severed but also switched between severed and conscious states instantly. That would’ve given a bit more explanation as to why there are goats on the severed floor later in the season, a mystery that is still one of the main unsolved questions for <em>Severance </em>fans.</p><figure id="" data-id="a522df4d2487c98b012ee48366f6aafe" data-recommend-id="image://a522df4d2487c98b012ee48366f6aafe" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1601" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ms. Cobel sitting at her desk" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ms. Cobel sitting at her desk" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Apple</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a522df4d2487c98b012ee48366f6aafe" data-recommend-id="image://a522df4d2487c98b012ee48366f6aafe" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1601" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ms. Cobel sitting at her desk" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Mark’s Outie being introduced to Cobel as a Lumon employee who’s recruiting him to be severed would’ve eliminated one of the main tensions of the first season, as well as the upcoming second season. In the series as we know it, he goes through the severance process as a way to deal with the grief of his wife’s passing. It’s a major factor in the entire series, setting up the big twist that his wife is, in fact, likely not dead, because she’s the wellness counselor Ms. Casey (Dichen Lachman) on the severed floors. His Innie has this revelation, and it’s one that is the impetus for much of his awakening in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-apple-tv-news-1851713808&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-apple-tv-news-1851713808">upcoming second season</a></span>.</p><p>Another change is that the original version of the pilot script involved Mark waking up on the table at his Lumon orientation, and then being “birth[ed] out of a giant sphincter in the ceiling,” according to Erickson. The episode would’ve followed his first day at Lumon, where he’d be trained by Helly R (Britt Lower), get lost in a storage closet that never ends, and see his welcome video from his Outie. </p><p>This is drastically different from the pilot episode we’ve all come to know and love, in which it’s Helly who wakes up on the table and is trained by Mark. She doesn’t end up in an endless storage closet, but she does repeatedly run through an exit door that warps her back into the severed floor before seeing her Outie’s welcome video explaining her decision to go through the severance process. That change alone would’ve altered the dynamic of the core cast. Instead of Helly being the one willing to write a message to her Outie into her arm or attempt suicide, all in efforts to leave the severed floor, it could’ve been Mark. </p><figure id="" data-id="66c7091bb659aa8b7f17e1bfae8d2f8e" data-recommend-id="image://66c7091bb659aa8b7f17e1bfae8d2f8e" data-format="png" data-width="1374" data-height="798" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mark staring confused" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mark staring confused" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Apple</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="66c7091bb659aa8b7f17e1bfae8d2f8e" data-recommend-id="image://66c7091bb659aa8b7f17e1bfae8d2f8e" data-format="png" data-width="1374" data-height="798" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mark staring confused" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are still eight more episodes of the podcast set to be released before Season 2's January 17 premiere date. If these are the types of revelations we’re getting from just the first 20 minutes of the first episode, we may never see <em>Severance</em> the same way when we’re done listening to it all. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia has good news and bad news for people building or buying gaming PCs.</p>
<p>The good news is that three of its four new RTX 50-series GPUs are the same price or slightly cheaper than the RTX 40-series GPUs they're replacing. The RTX 5080 is $999, the same price as the RTX 4080 Super; the 5070 Ti and 5070 are launching for $749 and $549, each $50 less than the 4070 Ti Super and 4070 Super.</p>
<p>The bad news for people looking for the absolute fastest card they can get is that the company is charging $1,999 for its flagship RTX 5090 GPU, significantly more than the $1,599 MSRP of the RTX 4090. If you want Nvidia's biggest and best, it will cost at least as much as four high-end game consoles or a pair of decently specced midrange gaming PCs.</p>

<p>Nvidia also announced a new version of its upscaling algorithm, DLSS 4. As with DLSS 3 and the RTX 40-series, DLSS 4's flagship feature will be exclusive to the 50-series. It's called DLSS Multi Frame Generation, and as the name implies, it takes the Frame Generation feature from DLSS 3 and allows it to generate even more frames. It's why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang claimed that the $549 RTX 5070 performed like the $1,599 RTX 4090; it's also why those claims are a bit misleading.</p>
<p>The rollout <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-geforce-rtx-50-series-opens-new-world-of-ai-computer-graphics">will begin</a> with the RTX 5090 and 5080 on January 30. The 5070 Ti and 5070 will follow at some point in February. All cards except the 5070 Ti will come in Nvidia-designed Founders Editions as well as designs made by Nvidia's partners; the 5070 Ti isn't getting a Founders Edition.</p>

<p>The RTX 5090, based on Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, is a gigantic chip with 92 billion transistors in it. And while it is double the price of an RTX 5080, you also get double the GPU cores and double the RAM and nearly double the memory bandwidth. Even more than the 4090, it's being positioned head and shoulders above the rest of the GPUs in the family, and the 5080's performance won't come remotely close to it.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Although $1,999 is a lot to ask for a graphics card, if Nvidia can consistently make the RTX 5090 available at $2,000, it could still be an improvement over the pricing of the 4090, which <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-rtx-4090-supplies-are-dwindling-resulting-in-higher-prices-the-same-thing-that-happened-with-past-gpu-generations">regularly sold for well over $1,599</a>&nbsp;over the course of its lifetime, due in part to pandemic-fueled GPU shortages, cryptocurrency mining, and the generative AI boom. Companies and other entities buying them as AI accelerators may restrict the availability of the 5090, too, but Nvidia's highest GPU tier has been well out of the price range of most consumers for a while now.</p>
<p>Despite the higher power budget—as predicted, it's 125 W higher than the 4090 at 450 W, and Nvidia recommends a 1,000 W power supply or better—the physical size of the 5090 Founders Edition is considerably smaller than the 4090, which was large enough that it had trouble fitting into some computer cases. Thanks to a "high-density PCB" and redesigned cooling system, the 5090 Founders Edition is a dual-slot card that ought to fit into small-form-factor systems much more easily than the 4090. Of course, this won't stop most third-party 5090 GPUs from being gigantic triple-fan monstrosities, but it is apparently possible to make a reasonably sized version of the card.</p>
<p>Moving on to the 5080, it looks like more of a mild update from last year's RTX 4080 Super, with a few hundred more CUDA cores, more memory bandwidth (thanks to the use of GDDR7, since the two GPUs share the same 256-bit interface), and a slightly higher power budget of 360 W (compared to 320 W for the 4080 Super).</p>
<p>Having more cores and faster memory, in addition to whatever improvements and optimizations come with the Blackwell architecture, should help the 5080 easily beat the 4080 Super. But it's an open question as to whether it will be able to beat the 4090, at least before you consider any DLSS-related frame rate increases. The 4090 has 52 percent more GPU cores, a wider memory bus, and 8GB more memory.</p>

<p>At $749 and $549, the 5070 Ti and 5070 are slightly more within reach for someone who's trying to spend less than $2,000 on a new gaming PC. Both cards hew relatively closely to the specs of the 4070 Ti Super and 4070 Super, both of which are already solid 1440p and 4K graphics cards for many titles.</p>
<p>Like the 5080, the 5070 Ti includes a few hundred more CUDA cores, more memory bandwidth, and slightly higher power requirements compared to the 4070 Ti Super. That the card is $50 less than the 4070 Ti Super was at launch is a nice bonus—if it can come close to or beat the RTX 4080 for $250 less, it could be an appealing high-end option.</p>
<p>The RTX 5070 is alone in having fewer CUDA cores than its immediate predecessor—6,144, down from 7,168. It is an upgrade from the original 4070, which had 5,888 CUDA cores, and GDDR7 and slightly faster clock speeds may still help it outrun the 4070 Super; like the other 50-series cards, it also comes with a higher power budget. But right now this card is looking like the closest thing to a lateral move in the lineup, at least before you consider the additional frame-generation capabilities of DLSS 4.</p>

      Many of Nvidia's most ostentatious performance claims—including the one that the RTX 5070 is as fast as a 4090—factors in DLSS 4's additional AI-generated frames.

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/nvidias-399-4060-ti-comes-with-no-price-hike-but-mild-performance-improvements/">When launching new 40-series cards</a> over the last two years, it was common for Nvidia to publish a couple of different performance comparisons to last-gen cards: one with DLSS turned off and one with DLSS and the 40-series-exclusive Frame Generation feature turned on. Nvidia would then lean on the DLSS-enabled numbers when making broad proclamations about a GPU's performance, as it does in its <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-geforce-rtx-50-series-opens-new-world-of-ai-computer-graphics">official press release</a> when it says the 5090 is twice as fast as the 4090, or as Huang did during his CES keynote when he claimed that an RTX 5070 offered RTX 4090 performance for $549.</p>

<p>DLSS Frame Generation is an AI feature that builds on what DLSS is already doing. Where DLSS uses AI to fill in gaps and make a lower-resolution image look like a higher-resolution image, DLSS Frame Generation creates entirely new frames and inserts them in between the frames that your GPU is actually rendering.</p>

      DLSS 4 now generates up to three frames for every frame the GPU is actually rendering. Used in concert with DLSS image upscaling, Nvidia says that "15 out of every 16 pixels" you see on your screen are being generated by its AI models.

<p>The RTX 50-series one-ups the 40-series <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/">with DLSS 4</a>, another new revision that's exclusive to its just-launched GPUs: DLSS Multi Frame Generation. Instead of generating one extra frame for every traditionally rendered frame, DLSS 4 generates "up to three additional frames" to slide in between the ones your graphics card is actually rendering—based on Nvidia's slides, it looks like users ought to be able to control how many extra frames are being generated, just as they can control the quality settings for DLSS upscaling. Nvidia is leaning on the Blackwell architecture's faster Tensor Cores, which it says are up to 2.5 times faster than the Tensor Cores in the RTX 40-series, to do the AI processing necessary to upscale rendered frames and to generate new ones.</p>
<p>Nvidia's performance comparisons aren't indefensible; with DLSS FG enabled, the cards can put out a lot of frames per second. It's just dependent on game support (Nvidia says that 75 titles will support it at launch), and going off of our experience with the original iteration of Frame Generation, there will likely be scenarios where image quality is noticeably worse or just "off-looking" compared to actual rendered frames. DLSS FG also needed a solid base frame rate to get the best results, which may or may not be the case for Multi-FG.</p>

      Enhanced versions of older DLSS features can benefit all RTX cards, including the 20-, 30-, and 40-series. Multi-Frame Generation is restricted to the 50-series, though.

<p>Though the practice of restricting the biggest DLSS upgrades to all-new hardware is a bit frustrating, Nvidia <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/">did announce</a> that it's releasing a new transformer module for the DLSS Ray Reconstruction, Super Resolution, and Anti-Aliasing features. These are DLSS features that are available on all RTX GPUs going all the way back to the RTX 20-series, and games that are upgraded to use the newer models should benefit from improved upscaling quality even if they're using older GPUs.</p>

<p>Nvidia's laptop GPU announcements sometimes trail the desktop announcements by a few weeks or months. But the company has already announced mobile versions of the 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti, and 5070 that Nvidia says will begin shipping in laptops priced between $1,299 and $2,899 when they launch in March.</p>
<p>All of these GPUs share names, the Blackwell architecture, and DLSS 4 support with their desktop counterparts, but per usual they're significantly cut down to fit on a laptop motherboard and within a laptop's cooling capacity. The mobile version of the 5090 includes 10,496 GPU cores, less than half the number of the desktop version, and just 24GB of GDDR7 memory on a 256-bit interface instead of 32GB on a 512-bit interface. But it also can operate with a power budget between 95 and 150 W, a fraction of what the desktop 5090 needs.</p>

<p>The other three GPUs are mostly cut down in similar ways, and all of them have fewer GPU cores and lower power requirements than their desktop counterparts. The 5070 GPUs both have less RAM and narrowed memory buses, too, but the mobile RTX 5080 at least comes closer to its desktop iteration, with the same 256-bit bus width and 16GB of RAM.</p>

At least some of the remaining Private Division employees are expected to be laid off in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, which states that a currently unnamed company staffed by former Annapurna Interactive employees has reached a deal with private equity firm Haveli to take over the distribution of Private Division titles. Bloomberg reports and IGN can independently confirm that Haveli <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/private-division-sold-to-unknown-buyer">is the company that purchased Private Division from Take-Two Interactive last year for an undisclosed amount</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The portfolio includes both current and upcoming Private Division titles, such as Tales of the Shire, which releases March 25. It also includes Project Bloom, a AAA action-adventure game developed by Game Freak that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-bloom-pokemon-game-freak-private-division">announced back in 2023</a> with nothing more than a concept art teaser.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/pd-gf-projectbloom-conceptart-3840x2160-1683657401083-1736271759393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Concept art for Game Freak's Project Bloom, formerly published by Private Division.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Bloomberg reports, Haveli's purchase of Private Division included not just the portfolio, but 20 employees who remained with the label <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division">following Take-Two-implemented layoffs last spring</a>. Remaining employees have reportedly been told to explore other employment options, with the expectation that at least some of them will be laid off as part of the deal with the unnamed new publisher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Private Division was formerly Take-Two's publishing label, which the company founded back in 2017. It was intended to support independent games that were smaller than the fare typically supported by the Grand Theft Auto publisher. Over the years, Private Division produced titles such as The Outer Worlds, OlliOlli World, and Kerbal Space Program 2, but game sales repeatedly fell short of Take-Two expectations. Early last year, we reported that Take-Two was slowly shuttering operations at Private Division, first by winding down operations at its supported studios and then by selling off the label.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new owners of Private Division's portfolio are a group of former employees of Annapurna Interactive that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/annapurnas-entire-gaming-team-has-resigned">collectively resigned last year</a> following a leadership dispute at Annapurna. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-heck-has-been-going-on-at-annapurna-interactive-an-investigation">reported last fall on the messy circumstances</a>, which left Annapurna seeking to restaff an entire publishing team to cover its numerous obligations and roughly 25 individuals seeking new employment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Parkour has been an important part of the Assassin's Creed franchise from the beginning, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will be making some adjustments to the acrobatic running style. Ubisoft has already hinted that Naoe--one of Shadows' new leading characters--can Naruto run in the game. But that's just the beginning of what she can pull off while running.</p><p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4TA6gKaTvtOC1mOjZIxCZd/assassins-creed-shadows-parkour-system-overview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared an extensive breakdown</a> of Shadow's new parkour options, as well as the revised button map for the game. One of the most notable changes is that the crouch and the dodge buttons have traded places. That will allow the player to either crouch or lie in a prone position. Naoe can even kill her targets while lying prone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTuL0Ob2EnU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uTuL0Ob2EnU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Yasuke--the game's other lead character--and Naoe can both perform dodges while crouched, but only the latter can pull off a dodge in her prone stance. The other new parkour moves that Naoe can pull off include a wall-run eject and a backward dodge, which you can see below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXehGq8UkuM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WXehGq8UkuM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Some of the parkour and climbing moves can be performed by both Yasuke and Naoe, but she's more suited for those because she's light on her feet and able to pull off a recovery roll while falling.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Yq6RcLE8Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/33Yq6RcLE8Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The developers also noted that not every wall surface in the game will be climbable for either character. The grappling hook can help players overcome some of those areas, but they will also have to be on the lookout for surfaces that have physical handholds to grab.</p><p>For players who don't want to deal with romances or branching narrative paths, Shadows will have a Canon Mode, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-can-make-all-of-the-big-choices-for-you/1100-6528401/" data-ref-id="1100-6528401">will make the big story decisions for you</a>.

            <p>
While some handheld gaming PC manufacturers are busy cornering the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acer-unveils-dubiously-portable-nitro-blaze-11-handheld-gaming-pc-with-1095-inch-screen">comically large form factor market</a>, Lenovo has slipped in to announce several new - and considerably more portable - devices of its own, including the Legion Go 2 and a handheld utilising SteamOS.
</p>
<p>
Starting with the Legion Go 2, that's Lenovo's currently still-in-prototype second generation handheld gaming PC, which - alongside its built-in kickstand and ergonomically improved detachable controllers - sports an 8.8-inch OLED display with VRR support, and comes equipped with either the upcoming AMD Ryzen Z2 or Ryzen Z2 Extreme. It can also sport up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD storage, to further boost its beefy credentials.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, there's no hint of a release window or price for the Legion Go 2 just yet, with Lenovo instead choosing to focus its attention on its other newly announced handheld gaming PC: the more modest, and more imminently available, Legion Go S.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/lenovo-go-s-black.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>
The Legion Go S offers a sleeker alternative to Lenovo's existing Legion Go, doing away with the former's detachable controllers in favour of a more rounded all-in-one design. It features an 8-inch, 16:10 IPS LCD multi-touch screen (with a 120Hz variable refresh rate and 1920 x 1200 resolution), alongside hall-effect thumbsticks, a redesigned D-pad, and dual stage triggers.
</p><p>
As for the insides, Legion Go S includes either an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go or Z1 Extreme processor, and can be equipped with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD. All this lives inside a 299mm x 127.6 x 22.6 shell and weighs upwards of 730g - around 90g heavier than Steam Deck. Lenovo tells <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">The Verge</a> it's targeting two to 2.5 hours of battery life for demanding games.

</figure>
<p>
Lenovo's first Legion Go S model begins shipping this month, costing £649.99/$729.99 with the Z2 Go processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. It'll be followed in May by a slightly lower-specced £600/$599.99 variant, featuring the Z2 Go, 16GB RAM, and 1TB storage. Both machines utilise Windows 11, but Lenovo is also working on a SteamOS-powered Go S, making it the first authorised third-party handheld gaming device to utilise Valve's operating system. This is the cheapest of the bunch, costing $499.99 with the Z2 Go, 16GB RAM, and 512GB storage - and The Verge reports it should also arrive in May.
</p>
<p>
For anyone with an eye on the slightly more distant future, however, Digital Foundry has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-amd-announces-next-gen-ryzen-z2-apus-for-gaming-handhelds">taken a look</a> at AMD's newly announced trio of next-gen Ryzen Z-series APUs - the kind that'll be packed into Lenovo's second generation Legion Go 2 - if you're curious to learn more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/warframe-digital-extremes-balatro-vampire-survivors-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As we’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-1999-romance-dating-tennocon-soulframe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously established</a>, <em>Warframe </em>– originally a cooperative multiplayer shooter about space ninjas – now contains just about every system known to man. Fishing? Yep. Hoverboarding? Absolutely. A full-blown dating sim? Yes, thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr30oQoKeIo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recently-released <em>1999 </em>update</a>, <em>Warframe </em>even includes that. You might examine the game’s feature list and conclude that Digital Extremes is weeping, for there are no more worlds left to conquer. But in that regard, you’d be wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>During an interview in LA last month, I asked creative director Rebb Ford about the <em>Warframe </em>team’s pie-in-the-sky system ideas. What, I wondered, are the most off-the-wall mechanics they could plausibly implement? And where do the intimidatingly bounteous sci-fi opus’ limits lie?</p><p>"I like to think that it's usually a reflection of the things I'm actively playing," Ford told Aftermath. “And because I've played so much <em>Balatro</em>, I'm prone to say something with the cards [you use to modify equipment] beyond modding would be cool. But we do pitches. We look at, like, what if the mods in <em>Warframe </em>had a playable aspect to them? You get so close to committing, and then you're like 'Well, who's this for? And why are we doing this? So let's just focus on what people play <em>Warframe </em>for.' But yeah, the temptation is always there."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ford added that there’s a “shadow of a card game” that exists in internal documents at Digital Extremes, as well as a “shadow of a <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style thing” in design director Pablo Alonso’s build of <em>Warframe</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>"But I do feel like our responsibility as custodians of <em>Warframe </em>is to make things that the audience probably came for in the first place and take, like, one risk per update – like the dating system,” Ford said. “So measure and try, because if you stray too far, you end up making no one happy."</p><figure><blockquote><p>We look at, like, what if the mods in <em>Warframe </em>had a playable aspect to them? You get so close to committing, and then you're like 'Well, who's this for? And why are we doing this?'</p></blockquote></figure><p>As for additions that are unlikely to happen on Ford’s watch, she pointed to a regularly-requested feature: overhauled PVP.&nbsp;</p><p>"We have been tempted by redoing [PVP mode] Conclave,” said Ford. “I think true PVP, done better than we do, would be very difficult for us to commit to just because there's some things we're never going to change – like our networking architecture, dedicated servers, [etc]. We can't compete with the <em>Valorants </em>of the world, and I'd rather play <em>Valorant </em>or <em>Fortnite</em>, right? I'll just go play that and then come to <em>Warframe </em>for a totally different flavor. As heartbreaking as that might be for our Conclave community – I say this apologetically, not cavalierly – I just don't see us saying, like, 5v5 team fights are on the table.”</p><p><em>Warframe</em>’s teetering tower of systems might suggest a throw-shit-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks mentality, but maintaining the game is a careful balancing act. Some modern triple-A games boast development team sizes in the thousands, but not <em>Warframe</em>; Ford estimated that around 280 people are working on the game currently. Keeping it alive 12 years and countless updates after release requires careful planning.&nbsp;</p><p>"We typically try and have unique features with each major update we do, and if it's gonna be good and people like it and it has legs, we will push it into newer stuff,” said Ford. “We plan, but we plan to adjust. We already know all of [2025's] major updates, but what isn't started is where we have to add or remove things based on reactions to <em>Warframe: 1999</em>. … One thing we haven't accounted for is reception to [the dating sim and character interaction] feature. And if it goes over well – if, I would say, more than 80 percent of people really like it – we will need to change plans for [2025]. But if it's just a cool-enough thing that added to the world, we'll do what we have to do to make other features."</p><p>This approach, Ford believes, explains a common complaint in the <em>Warframe </em>community: Not every system in the game gets the same amount of attention, and some feel like they’ve been abandoned.</p><p>"I think abandonment is a fair perspective for some features,” she said. “It's in the eye of the beholder. Like 'Oh, they abandoned PVP.' Actually, yeah, we kind of did, because none of us at the new leadership level are playing PVP games. You don't want PVP made by me. You really don't. ... I think that's a reasonable truth to share with our players, and we do. And then the [features] that we want to come back to, we only talk about when we're sure."</p><p>“It’s a big game,” Ford added. “12 years of tech debt, and everything has to work. We do our best.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck"><h3>Too Big</h3></a><p>Unless you are a giant</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SteamOS was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">always supposed to be bigger</a> than Valve’s own Steam Deck, and 2025 is the year it finally expands. Not only will Lenovo ship <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">the first third-party SteamOS handheld</a> this May, Valve has now revealed it will let you install a working copy of SteamOS on <em>other </em>handhelds even sooner than that. </p><p>Pierre-Loup Griffais, one of the lead designers on the Steam Deck and SteamOS, tells me a beta for other handhelds “is slated to ship after March sometime,” and that you might discover the OS <em>just starts working properly</em> after that happens! </p><p>Griffais and his co-designer Lawrence Yang would not confirm which handhelds might just start working, though there are some obvious candidates: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">the company confirmed to us in August</a> that it had been adding support for the Asus ROG Ally’s controls. </p><p>Also, quite a few PC gamers have also discovered that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">Bazzite, a fork of Valve’s Steam Deck experience that I loved testing on an Ally X</a> and vastly preferred to Windows, also works wonderfully on the Lenovo Legion Go. There still aren’t that many handhelds out there at the end of the day, and I would think Valve would take advantage of work the Linux gaming community has already done on both.</p><p>Speaking of Bazzite, Valve seems to be flattered! “We have nothing against it,” says Yang. “It’s a great community project that delivers a lot of value to people that want a similar experience on devices right now,” says Griffais, adding later “In a lot of ways Bazzite is a good way to kind of get the latest and greatest of what we’ve been working on, and test it.” </p><p>But he says Bazzite isn’t yet in a state where a hardware manufacturer could preload it on a handheld, nor would Valve allow that. While users can freely download and install the SteamOS image onto their own devices, companies aren’t allowed to sell it or modify it, and must partner with Valve first.</p><p>There are some non-selfish reasons for that. Among other things, Griffais explains that the Lenovo Legion Go S will run the same SteamOS image as the Steam Deck itself, taking advantage of the same software updates and the same precached shaders that let games load and run more smoothly, just with added hardware compatibility tweaks. Valve wants to make sure SteamOS is a single platform, not a fragmented one.</p><p>“In general, we just want to make sure we have a good pathway to work together on things like firmware updates and you can get to things like the boot manager and the BIOS and things like that in a semi-standardized fashion, right?” says Griffais, regarding what Valve needs to see in a partnership that would officially ship SteamOS on other devices.</p><p>Valve isn’t currently partnered with any other companies beyond Lenovo to do that collaboration — Yang tells me the company is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337913/no-valve-isnt-working-with-gpd-to-bring-steamos-to-its-handheld"><em>not</em> working with GPD on official SteamOS support</a>, despite that manufacturer’s claim. </p><p>Valve’s also not promising that whichever Windows handheld you have will necessarily run SteamOS perfectly — in a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F593110%2Fview%2F529834914570306831">new blog post</a>, Valve only confirms that a beta will ship before Lenovo’s Legion Go S, that it “should improve the experience on other devices,” and that users “can download and test this themselves.”</p><p>As far as other form factors, like possible SteamOS living room boxes, Valve says you might have a good experience trying that. And partnerships are a possibility there too: “if someone wants to bring that to the market and preload SteamOS on it, we’d be happy to talk to them.”</p><p>Valve wouldn’t tell me anything about the rumors that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">developing its own Steam Controller 2, VR headset with wands</a>, and possibly its own living room box, but did tell me that we “might expect more Steam Input compatible controllers in the future.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lenovo has announced the Lenovo Legion Go S, the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-announces-steamos-is-available-for-third-party-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-party handheld</a> gaming PC to come with SteamOS installed instead of Windows. The announcement was made on Tuesday at CES 2025.</p>



<p>Launching in May, Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS will cost $499. The <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">handheld features</a> an eight-inch 16:10 touch display at 120Hz. Internal specs include a Lenovo-exclusive AMD Ryzen Z2 Go or AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor,16GB of memory, 512GB of storage, and a 55.5Whr battery. </p>



<p>Other features include Wi-Fi 6e support, two USB 4 ports, and a MicroSD slot for expanded storage. Regarding battery life, Lenovo says that the Legion Go S should have 2.5-3 hours on a full charge, depending on the gaming being done.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As far as what’s gone from the original Legion Go, the new device no longer features a kickstand or detachable controllers akin to the Nintendo Switch. By removing these features and making the device slightly smaller, it brings the weight of the Legion Go S down to 1.61lbs.</p>



<p>The Lenovo Legion Go S will also launch with a version that comes with Windows preinstalled for those that prefer Microsoft’s operating system. The Windows version of the device will release this month for $729.99 and include 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. As with all Windows devices, Steam can be installed as a standalone application.</p>



<p>The Windows version comes in white while the SteamOS version comes in black.</p>

                <p>Nvidia finally revealed their next-generation RTX 50-series graphics cards at CES 2025, with some big performance improvements expected thanks to the new Blackwell architecture. But since 2020 and the launch of the RTX 20 series, Nvidia has been working on and expanding its range of AI enhancements as part of its DLSS suite of exclusive features, with its latest iteration, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ray-tracing-rtx-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DLSS 4</a>, set to propel both new and older GPUs forward.</p><p>DLSS 4's biggest new feature is one that will be exclusive to the new RTX 50-series GPUs. Multi Frame Generation is the next step in the Frame Generation race that Nvidia kicked off with the RTX 40-series range. Instead of just injecting a single, AI-generated frame between two traditionally rendered one, Multi Frame Generation now offers up to four AI-generated frames to be inserted, substantially increasing a game's frame rate. Nvidia says that its new GPUs can deliver nearly eight times more performance than "brute-force" rendering, but how well each generated frame looks and how this impacts input latency has yet to be determined.</p><p>Digital Foundry was given access to an engineering sample of the RTX 5080 and limited time to test Multi Frame Generation in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and came away impressed with both the image quality and fluidity of the experience.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpzufsxtZpA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xpzufsxtZpA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Perhaps more interesting are the DLSS 4 improvements that will be supported on all of Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Nvidia has updated its transformer model that powers DLSS Super Sampling, Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA for the first time, moving away from its previous convolutional neural networks approach. What this means is that its newer model is more adept at identifying parts of a rendered image that are important and with more granularity, offering up more stable upscaling and ray-tracing quality as a result.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15853545/4423817-0726012417-nvidi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423817" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15853545/4423817-0726012417-nvidi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423817"></a><figcaption>Breakdown of DLSS 4 enhancements for various RTX GPU generations</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15853545/4423817-0726012417-nvidi.jpg"></figure><p>DLSS Super Resolution (Nvidia's AI-enhanced upscaling solution), Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA will be improving thanks to this upgrade across all RTX hardware, starting with the RTX 20 series. Nvidia is also adding the ability to switch between specific DLSS releases from within its GeForce Experience application in the near future, which previously had to be manually done for each game if you wanted to experiment with newer DLSS versions that hadn't been patched in by developers. This can potentially give some new life to older hardware, at least from an image-quality standpoint.</p><p>There's no question that the headline feature for DLSS 4 is the one that only works on Nvidia's latest and greatest hardware, which starts shipping later this month and will be supported in over 75 games and apps immediately. But unlike the update for Frame Generation with the RTX 40 series launch, there's a lot more to get excited about for the many more already on Nvidia's platform.</p>

<p>Valve has announced that SteamOS is being made available and launched for third-party devices moving forward. The announcement comes alongside the <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveal of the Lenovo Legion Go S</a> at CES 2025.</p>



<p>It also comes just months after Valve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-is-bringing-steamos-support-to-rival-handhelds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed that it was working</a> on bringing the operating system (OS) to other devices</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/529834914570306831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam’s website</a>, Valve says that the operating system was developed to “provide a seamless user experience optimized for gaming, while retaining access to the power and flexibility of a PC.” The OS isn’t available on other handheld devices yet, but Valve says the work being done for the Lenovo Legion Go S — which comes installed with SteamOS instead of Windows — will improve the operating system’s compatibility with other handheld PCs.</p>



<p>“Ahead of Legion Go S shipping, we will be shipping a beta of SteamOS which should improve the experience on other handhelds, and users can download and test this themselves,” Valve said. “And of course we’ll continue adding support and improving the experience with future releases.”</p>







<p>It’s unclear what other devices will be “powered by SteamOS” in the future, but it appears to be only a matter of time before they are announced. There’s also the recent rumors that Valve is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-pointing-to-a-new-steam-console-from-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working on bringing back Steam Machines</a>, a decade after they were first announced and released to consumers.</p>



<p>What do you think about Valve bringing SteamOS to other handheld PCs? Do you think it impacts the future of the Steam Deck in any way? Let us know down below, and join the discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

		<p>SEGA and RGG Studios has announced that it will be hosting a Like A Dragon Direct on January 9th, and the main focus of the direct will be Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. The direct will look at new features that will be present in the game. The Direct will be watchable on both YouTube and Twitch, with starting at 9am PST, 5pm GMT, and 6pm CET.</p>
<p><iframe title="RGG Like a Dragon Direct" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/viAEO_cMqfU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First washing up on Rich Island, the adventure will also take Majima to Madlantis, the secret island where criminal organisation co-exist and the home of the Pirate’s Coliseum. There’s also Nele Island, which features the holy site of Palenka, and you’ll get to revisit Hawaii and Honolulu City, which was a key location for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. The events of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii take place after the story of Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth concludes.</p>
<p>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will have ship to ship combat out in the open sea and in a large coliseum, ship boarding with combat, and ship customisation. Within the Pirate Coliseum players will take part in the Tournament of Captains, as well as other events including Quick Skirmish, Madlantis Mania, and Swashbuckler Showdown.</p>

<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio previously confirmed a new release date for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, with the game now set to be released on February 21st, 2025, bringing the release date forward by a week from the original date. It will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

			<p>Today, Marvel Games and NetEase Games officially announced the details for the first season of Marvel Rivals. The season is titled Eternal Night Falls and will be adding some familiar faces to the ever-expanding roster of heroes and villains from the Marvel universe. The first season for this new Hero-Shooter will begin on January 10 at 9 AM UTC, where the Fantastic Four will be introduced to the game as playable heroes. Thus far, the title has <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-launches-with-a-bang-thanks-to-444k-concurrent-users-on-steam/">been incredibly successful</a>.</p>
<p>The season will span over three months and will be divided into two halves. In the first half of the season, Invisible Woman and Mister Fantastic will be released. For those wanting Human Torch and The Thing, you'll have to wait until the second half of the season. Season 1 of Marvel Rivals is doing more than just adding superheroes to the game, as there will be three new maps for players to explore and learn when playing.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls, make sure to check out the trailer below to get a glimpse of some of the action you will be diving into, as well as the cosmetics you can get your mitts on.</p>
<p><iframe title="Season 1: Eternal Night Falls Official Trailer | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zATLJ6Cqt0c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to new heroes and maps, there will be some special events for players to dive into, including a new Doom Match game mode. Like many free-to-play titles with live service elements, there will be a Battle Pass for players to dive into. Compared to Season 0, this Battle Pass has over double the amount of content and rewards to get. These rewards consist of 10 costumes, sprays, and emotes to get your hands on to add some extra flair for the battleground. To purchase the Season 1 Luxury Battle Pass for Marvel Rivals, it will cost you 990 Lattice, where you will then get 600 Lattices and 600 Units as a reward for completing the Season 1 Battle Pass.</p>
<p>Compared to other games on the market right now, the team developing this title has made it so that the Luxury Battle Passes will never expire, with Tokens purchased with Lattice being retained under specific conditions. For those interested in what these terms and conditions consist of, the developers have created both a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20241225/40954_1202068.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Diary</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNiYrOSLYD4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev Vision</a>, where you can read about it or watch a video that explains it.</p>

Personally, that’s part of the appeal, having 20+ ways to play, and not all of them rely on twitch reflexes and precise aim. But still, there are folks who are going to bounce off of all 20 of those playstyles, and just have to watch their friends play and laugh and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">bitch about Jeff</a></span> from a distance. But don’t worry. It’s not like those folks are starved for options. Here’s a few options for those folks who want to make theirs Marvel, without all that pesky K/D ratio talk. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-recommend-id="image://d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel and Capcom characters are arranged in a hero image." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Marvel and Capcom characters are arranged in a hero image." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-recommend-id="image://d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel and Capcom characters are arranged in a hero image." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ll grant, this is mostly just trading one labyrinthine set of mechanics for another that’s even more likely to result in you getting pieced up in infinite combos by someone who hasn’t seen the touch of a gentle hand or the light of the day star since Obama was in office. But the magic of the <em>VS</em> titles is just how much can be had just randomly screwing around with characters and team builds, and wacky moves without ever having to take the games online. Seeing Magneto, M. Bison, and Dr. Doom get absolutely destroyed by a team composed of a Little Red Riding Hood, a Japanese schoolgirl, and The Mad Titan Thanos is just one of those innate charms that never gets old, solo or with friends. Best of all, there’s now three different flavors of experience to be had, with the announcement that some absolute maniacs have spent a preposterous amount of time and energy into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXorZjVETFQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXorZjVETFQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revamping the reviled <em>Marvel vs Capcom Infinite</em> into a respectable game</a></span>. <br></p></div><div><p>Nothing about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmarvels-midnight-suns%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmarvels-midnight-suns%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Midnight Suns</em></a></span> is my jam on paper. Card-based/deck-builder games just don’t click with my brain, <em>Balatro </em>notwithstanding, and <em>Rivals </em>aside, real talk, there’s a lot of licensed Marvel trash floating out there to be avoided at all costs. And that’s to say nothing of the fact that I was around when the <em>Midnight Sons</em> arc started back in the early 90s, trying to cash in on the dark, and edgy undercurrent running through all comics, which was the style at the time. Even being the exact age when edgy comics should’ve hit my teenage brain like a wrecking ball, these guys just didn’t do it for me.</p><p>So when I tell you that I fell head-over-heels in love with <em>Midnight Suns</em>, you know how hard that game is working to get me to care. It helps that it’s from developer Firaxis, bringing its A-game to the strategic aspects of gameplay. But there’s also some absolutely delightful deep cut Marvel lore and character work going on there between the strategy. Fighting Lillith and whatnot? Sure, I guess. Making sure Blade and Carol Danvers hook up? I will MOVE MOUNTAINS. <em>Midnight Suns</em> was apparently a huge flop for Firaxis, but it’s never too late to get more people on that deeply underrated bandwagon. </p></div><div><p>Speaking of deeply underrated. It’s hard to blame anyone for giving Crystal Dynamics’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmarvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmarvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em></a></span> game the side-eye after Square Enix’s <em>Avengers</em> debacle poisoned the well. Anyone who’s actually spent time playing it, however, knows the truth. <em>Guardians</em> is just a damn fine third-person action title that really puts in some serious work making the <em>Guardians</em> feel like a caring-but-dysfunctional family that Star-Lord has to manage. It helps, too, that Star-Lord is an infinitely more likable, thoughtful scoundrel than Chris Pratt who, even when faced with a crucial, branching choice, finds a way to keep his family together. It helps even more that he doesn’t get himself in a scenario where all he has to do is wait till the goddamn Gauntlet is off and then he can combo up Thanos all he wants but <em>nooooo, </em>he has to get his smackdown on while everybody else is trying to save the goddamn universe from being snapped, and because of him it fails, and it’s his fault, and he is scum and you know what, I may still have anger issues about that. Let me make note of that for my therapist.</p></div><div><p> It feels like all the rizz has gone out of this one since <em>Balatro</em> took its place as the de facto card game in everyone’s hearts this year. But make no mistake, the mobile card-battler is still going strong with constant updates, and is still just as fun as it’s ever been. In fact, the game’s current season includes a crossover with <em>Rivals</em>, bringing some of that game’s character art to the deck, as well as introducing Galacta into the mix. Sure, you’ll be bitching about balancing issues here too, but it’s hard to stay mad at a game you can be done with during the fifth time that accursed Wegovy commercial they keep running on a loop on Hulu plays out. <br></p></div><div><p>Of course, if you’re looking to cross enemy lines to DC, you’ve played all the <em>Arkham</em> games, and you value your time and dignity too much to play <em>Gotham Knights</em> and <em>Suicide Squad</em>, you can actually try something a little different that won’t demand much aside from time and commitment. <em>DC Universe</em> is one of the few survivors of that time when every studio wanted their own <em>World of Warcraft</em> instead of their own <em>Overwatch</em>. No game survives this long without having something going for it, and in this case, with <em>City of Heroes</em> effectively a ghost, superhero MMOs a dying breed altogether, and the price being right–as in, <em>free</em>–to fool around in a big expansive superhero universe that, while it does have the usual MMO grind problems, does understand its assignment as a DC superhero simulator.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sure, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.acer.com/gb-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-11&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.acer.com/gb-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nitro Blaze 11</a></span> has two USB-C ports, a 3.5mm audio jack, a USB- A port (nice!), and a microSD card slot. It also includes solid internal specs with an AMD Ryzen 7 8840 chip, Radeon 780M graphics, 16GB of RAM and up to 2TB of SSD storage. </p><p>But come on, <em>look </em>at that image above. This might be a powerful gaming device, but it’s not portable. I mean, I guess if your definition of portable is simply “You can technically carry it around by yourself,” then sure, the Nitro Blaze 11 counts as a portable PC. Still, I’m not sold on the idea that many people will want a Steam Deck-like device that’s bigger than a cat. It goes against one of the biggest selling points with these things: You can take them anywhere and play all your games easily. </p><p>Acer seems to understand that this is probably not a product for everyone and will also offer smaller, more Steam Deck-sized portable PCs. The Nitro Blaze 8 features similar specs but with an 8-inch screen and will be priced at $900. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.acer.com/acer-debuts-its-first-handheld-gaming-pc-the-nitro-blaze-7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.acer.com/acer-debuts-its-first-handheld-gaming-pc-the-nitro-blaze-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A slightly smaller and less powerful Blaze 7</a></span> will also be available later this year for $800. </p><p>And for those of you out there who want to lug around a desktop PC crammed into a medium-sized container, the Acer Nitro Blaze 11 and its comically massive screen will be available for $1,100. At that point, you might just want to buy an actual gaming laptop.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Rocksteady, the studio behind Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, reportedly laid off six more workers at the end of 2024.</p><p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, those who were impacted were part of Rocksteady's programming, art, and quality assurance staff. This apparent round of layoffs follows Rocksteady's first round back in September, which was also reported by Eurogamer, and saw the reduction of 33 team members down to 15 due to the poor sales of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Rocksteady did not publicly acknowledge either one.</p><p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was both a critical and commercial disappointment. Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery said that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/" data-ref-id="1100-6523301">game caused a $200 million shortfall</a>. The game also reportedly only has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-is-reportedly-getting-barebones-support-as-rocksteady-moves-on-to-new-projects/1100-6523986/" data-ref-id="1100-6523986">"barebones" support team</a> as the studio is moving on to new projects.</p><p>The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasonal-updates-ending-with-offline-mode-coming-soon/1100-6528327/" data-ref-id="1100-6528327">fourth and last season</a> started on December 10 and will conclude on January 14 with Episode 8. Rocksteady has no plans for shutting down the game's servers anytime soon, and an offline mode was added.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review-loot-world-order/1900-6418174/" data-ref-id="1900-6418174">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League review</a>, we said, "Rocksteady's first game in nearly a decade can't shake the superhero-as-a-service genre's ubiquitous feeling that it exists to keep players mindlessly engaged."</p>
