<figure><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160866/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s been over three years since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a> was released, and Tribute Games has been really busy. Stuffed like a return-trip suitcase, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/marvel_cosmic_invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>’s enormous cast of heroes and villains is here united in a rapturous beat-'em-up fanfare. Its pixel art positively simmers, with beautifully rendered backgrounds, giant set-pieces, and solid, impressively animated sprites. And, in addition to primary antagonist Annihilus, nemeses like Galactus, Hela, and Thanos make sufficiently heavy-duty appearances.</p>
<p>What’s particularly endearing is that the production feels wholly comic book. Its story mode, fleshed out with superbly rendered cutscenes and spot-on voice acting, really honours the source material. From Wolverine’s growl to Spider-Man’s quips, Venom’s brusque manner to Nova’s heroic fortitude, the exchanges really capture the Marvel feel. The slightly squat sprite styling works well, too, and the soundtrack is on-point throughout.</p>

<p>Outside of palette swap options, there are no Marvel movie elements here, and the roster is interestingly formed, teaming up the likes of Captain America and Iron Man with lesser-knowns like Beta Ray Bill and Phyla-Vell. In total, there are a whopping 15 playable characters, several of whom are unlocked during playthroughs.</p>
<p>Any modern scrolling beat 'em up worth its salt requires a creative and dynamic combat system, and Cosmic Invasion rises to the challenge with a dual-character tag-team setup. In Story Mode, you choose a fresh duo each time you begin a stage, selecting your destination of choice via a bullet-pointed map that runs along branching paths. Certain stages need to be beaten before you can progress, and finishing a stage will level up your team with increased power and health.</p>
<p>Story Mode also comes with a set of optional Challenges. These include tasks like defeating a set number of enemies with a specific move or finishing a boss with a specific character. The challenge list shows which heroes properly align with a stage’s cutscenes and narrative. Characters that are narratively required for each level have glowing boxes around them on the select screen, too, although that could be signposted better.</p>
<figure><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160871/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Arcade Mode operates in true linear fashion: your initial character choices remain fixed for the entire game, there’s no levelling up, and you’re restricted to a limited number of stages across optional routes. For many, this will be the most enjoyable way to play.</p>
<p>The cast’s fighting properties are amazingly varied, with differing speeds and weights, and enough unique attack forms to make each one feel interesting. Some can fly with a double-jump tap, patrolling the air, while others, like Rocket Raccoon, dominate from range with heavy artillery. Each wields a basic tap combo, a double-tap rush attack, and a dodge or block that, when timed right, enacts a parry. Every character can charge a unique breakout move, and the 'X' button lets loose their special attack. The 'R' button is reserved for big, flashy supers, requiring a “Focus” energy that recharges while battling.</p>

<p>Tag-teaming works entirely around the left trigger. Tapping switches characters, who can swing in and break you out of holds. You can also combine attacks, whereby pressing the trigger mid-combo will have your partner appear alongside you, dealing out extra blows. Interestingly, you can combine the tag function with different buttons, creating different partner effects like aerial dives or rushing slashes. All tag battling eats into your Focus energy, a point to consider if you’re trying to build a team super: a devastating dual attack engaged with 'ZL' and 'R' that requires maximum Focus for both characters.</p>
<p>Cosmic Invasion is flashy and superbly slick, and mining all the little details is quite the adventure. There’s not much included in the rather threadbare tutorial, so it’s down to you to experiment, discovering which grabs can be turned into throws with D-pad combinations, and which characters have functions that respond to simultaneous button presses. The fastest hack here is to hit pause and read through your character’s movelist.</p>
<p>In a world post-<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, Cosmic Invasion doesn’t quite land in the same way Shredder’s Revenge did. While it does get furiously heated, its pace does feel a tad slow overall. What's surprising, though, are the numerous oversights in the visual feedback department. The map points on Story Mode, for example, don’t change colour when you clear a stage or complete its challenges, and post-toilet break it can take a moment to recognise which you just did.</p>
<figure><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160867/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Tribute Games clearly aren’t fans of prominent combo counters either, which is a shame as Cosmic Invasion seems to be crying out for one. Here, the combo counter is small, tame, and seated inconspicuously beside your health bar. As such, your building of blows isn’t as rewarding, and, being a comic-book-themed game, classic onomatopoeia or <em>“Dazzling!”</em>, <em>“Amazing!”</em>, or <em>“Super!”</em> would have been the perfect way to celebrate combo milestones.</p>
<p>The feedback element that really needs bolstering, though, surrounds the tag mechanic. With so many different usage combinations, some additional visual, aural, or haptic cues to delineate each state would have been helpful amidst the game’s flurrying pyrotechnics. For example, a short pad vibration upon engagement, and perhaps character colour flashes could give some idea of how much Focus energy is being consumed. And, as the tag function can be combined with different buttons for different dual attack types, some kind of visual feedback to articulate each state wouldn’t have gone amiss.</p>
<figure><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160869/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s not the end of the world, but your tag mechanics tend to get drowned out in the fighting stew, lacking a sense of tactility. For your mammoth dual super attack, too, any kind of wind-up effect or chime would have been welcome, just to let you know you’re primed to go. Additionally, recovering the secret green cubes hidden on each stage is so perfunctory it’s like a fart in the wind. There’s no indication it even has value, no message screaming “Cube Recovered!” or the like. In fact, it’s quite possible to pick one up accidentally without realising it.</p>
<p>These aren’t criminal offences, and they certainly don’t diminish the effort involved. But anyone who understands arcade games knows that good feedback aspects can really elevate the experience. As such, while impressively deep with its dodging, parrying, and potential for wild mix-ups and tag-team juggling, Cosmic Invasion's combat doesn't feel quite as satisfying as something like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a>, the recent Absolum, or even Shredder’s Revenge, which was a touch more honed in the battling department.</p>
<p>The more overt problem with Cosmic Invasion, though, is its difficulty balancing. Credit-feeding arcade games robs them of their value, largely because of their routine nature, and a lack of challenge has a similar effect. For some reason, Cosmic Invasion’s default Medium difficulty setting is a total cakewalk. Bosses, whose attack patterns are often thoughtfully designed, go down to first-attempt spamming in all but the last few stages. Health items are scattered all over, and being able to tag characters, regularly deploy super attacks, and regenerate not only Focus but your health too, actually makes the campaign a tad mundane. It’s much like the Marvel movies themselves in this respect: when there are no stakes, you start to switch off.</p>
<figure><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160865/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, there is a Hard Mode, but it isn’t available from the outset. Instead, you need to earn cubes to be spent on a hexagonal grid, unlocking additional character palettes and other in-game adjustments. For your information, you want to go right to the top middle of the hexagon and unlock that Hard Mode option, because frankly, it’s transformative.</p>
<p>Playing Arcade Mode on Hard Difficulty suddenly makes Cosmic Invasion both reasonably challenging and, with it, far more interesting, requiring thought and skill over mindless button mashing. All aspects of your moveset take on genuine importance, with different enemies and situations demanding experimentation — and the dodge and parry become crucial. While, in my opinion, the default difficulty should have been set somewhere between Medium and Hard Mode — and that means Tribute Games didn’t quite get either quite right — Hard Mode is still the place to go lest things get boring.</p>
<figure><a title="Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160870/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, if you’re primarily here for the multiplayer aspect, all this challenge criticism goes out the window. With friends, it’s just a blast, even if the four-player is a little too chaotic, all things told. In terms of delivering campy Marvel magic, however, in which iconic superheroes smash iconic supervillains, Cosmic Invasion comes through with flying colours.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pure cartoon fun, and all the better for it, Tribute Games has not only totally honoured the source material, but delivered one of the best arcade Marvel games ever made. The aesthetic is beautiful, and the effort involved in creating such a varied cast of beat-'em-up protagonists is admirable.</p>
<p>Yes, there are areas for improvement, and some of its combat-feedback oversights feel like missed opportunities. But if you primarily want multiplayer action, to unlock and grind and level up your cast, and to get knee-deep in Marvel mayhem, it’s right on the money. If you’re working through its single-player Story campaign, you’re likely to get bored before the end owing to its ease, but unlock Hard Difficulty and Cosmic Invasion becomes all it was destined to be.</p></section>

			<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is a nostalgia-soaked love letter to nine-year-old you. A side-scrolling beat ‘em up that looks like it just stepped out of a 90’s arcade, Cosmic Invasion features the character design of Marvel’s comic heyday, pixel-art visuals that ape Capcom’s Super Hero fighting series, and a tag team mechanic that is pure X-Men vs. Street Fighter. In short, with this much 90’s nostalgia powering it, how can Marvel Cosmic Invasion possibly fail?</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL Cosmic Invasion | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itVLfmX3Ts8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Marvel big bad Annihilus wants to take over the universe and it’s up to you and three friends – either online or local in very slick drop-in drop-out multiplayer – to stop him. The story is suitably silly and slight. The, thankfully skippable, static cutscenes bracketing each level are completely incomprehensible scrolling beat ‘em up hokum, but the opening animated intro and accompanying theme-song is an unadulterated delight, perfectly capturing the essence of the iconic X-Men cartoon. You’ll be listening to it on repeat on your chosen music streaming platform of choice, let me tell you.</p>


<p>With an impressive character roster of 15 heroes, Cosmic Invasion certainly offers a stacked cast of Marvel do-gooders. There’s the expected A-listers like Spider-Man, Wolverine and Iron Man, but also a few more niche picks, such as Beta-Ray Bill, Cosmic Ghost Rider, and Phyla-Vell. Whilst I would have personally liked developer Tribute Games to delve a little deeper in the weeds of the Marvel character back catalogue – Marvel Rivals did this &nbsp;with Jeff the Land Shark, turning the diminutive hero into a fan favourite and star of numerous comics in the process – the overall depth and breadth of the line-up really can’t be faulted.</p>


<p>What can be faulted is the variance in how much fun the characters are to play as. Flying characters suffer the most, the cost of being able to hover around the place a bit is seemingly being lumbered with a vastly reduced move-set. Storm is a total snore-fest, with only a handful of attacks on offer, whilst Silver Surfer, Iron Man, Phoenix and Phyla-Vell struggled to get much play time, simply because they can’t do very much. A couple of basic attacks, a range attack and a special? It’s not much terribly exciting. Plus, the insistence on flying heroes and enemies is unnecessarily fiddly, it’s often difficult to tell where you and your enemy are, resulting in a lot of accidental punching of thin air.</p>
<p>Wolverine and Black Panther are both superb, however, with varied combos and juggles putting their flying counterparts to shame. She Hulk’s range of pro-wrestling themed moves are brilliant fun to unleash, and Venom and Spider-Man deliver all the web-based antics a fan could hope for. The impressive sounding 15 character roster is quickly reduced down to five heroes you’ll actually want to play as, with the rest acting in a support role, leaping into the action with a brief bonus attack at the touch of a button.</p>

<p>If the heroes are well catered for, the villains they’ll be punching are not. Considering the vast universe of characters Tribute Games could call upon to include, they picked some lame ducks here. Most of the time you’ll be beating-up the exact same bug-like minions, only they’ll be painted in slightly different colours from level to level. Sure, there’s a few Sentinels to take on and some symbiotes, but mostly you’ll spend your time battling big mutated bees. Where’s the Kree? The Skrulls? The Chitauri? For a game set in the galaxy-spanning Marvel Cosmic comics, the lack of decent bad guys to duff up feels like the waste of an iconic licence.</p>
<p>Boss fights are also quite boring, even if they do feature a decent range of Marvel villains. No matter if you’re facing Knull, The Phoenix, or MODOK, your enemy will launch the same limited range of attacks and will soon be defeated without much effort. Indeed, for a game aping a 90’s coin-up, Marvel Cosmic Invasion is unexpectedly easy, offering little challenge and only occasionally pushing back against the player. My partner and I only had one or two re-starts and saw off the entire game in a couple of hours. We had little use for the tag-team mechanic either. Sure, you can swap in and out characters to deliver a massive juggling combo – so long as you don’t pick a flyer as a partner – buy why bother when a few punches will kill most opponents?</p>

<p>Worse, the levels themselves are oddly dull and repetitive. Scrolling beat ‘em ups are hardly known for their variety when it comes to level design, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">Streets of Rage 4</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/absolum-review/">Absolum</a>, and Tribute Games own <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a> prove it can be done. With no weapon pick-ups, no vehicles to drive or mounts to ride, no new moves to unlock, and the aforementioned limited range of enemies, Marvel Cosmic Invasion, even with its short run time, ultimately becomes a bit of a slog.</p>
<p>Despite all of the over-the-top visuals with nostalgia dripping loveliness then, playing Marvel Cosmic Invasion is just a bit, well, boring.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-nextgen-edition/">an unofficial remaster of the classic entry in the series developed by Rockstar Games built in RAGE Engine</a>, looks better than ever before thanks to a new RTX Remix path tracing mod.</p>



<p>A new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows the unofficial remaster developed by Revolution Team <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-4-rtx-remix-compatibility-mod-publicly-available-enjoy-path-tracing/">running with the custom RTX Remix runtime created for the RAGE Engine by Xoxor4d released last week to the public. </a></p>



<p>The side-by-side comparison shown at the beginning of the video highlights how the path tracing mod brings significant visual changes, but also a heavy performance hit, which is not surprising at all, considering how even <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-2-rtx-remix-mod-brings-stunning-path-tracing-but-a-very-high-cost-from-1200-to-36-fps-on-an-rtx-5080/">the best current gaming hardware has a hard time handling path tracing without serious optimization work</a>. In this case, the mod is reportedly one of the most CPU-intensive RTX Remix projects to date, which even the most powerful CPUs on the market, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-most-popular-zen-5-cpu-germany/">AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a>, struggle to run at a steady 60 FPS.</p>



<p>The remainder of the MxBenchmarkPC video shows how Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Next-gen Edition performs with the RTX Remix mod at 4K and 1440p resolutions, utilizing NVIDIA DLSS in Performance and Balanced modes. Additionally, it highlights how Frame Generation is essentially required to achieve framerates higher than 60 frames per second.</p>

<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">As the Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition overhaul is no longer available for download from trusted modding websites, such as<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-the-next-gen-edition" target="_blank">&nbsp;mod.db</a>, only those who downloaded the overhaul before it was removed can test it out with the Xoxor4d compatibility mod.</span> Even so, there's no denying that ray tracing will be a central element of future entries in the series following its <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-preview-grand-theft-auto-vi/">implementation in Grand Theft Auto V</a>, as the two <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-quality/">Grand Theft Auto VI trailers</a> released to date heavily suggest the tech will likely be widely used in the highly anticipated next entry in the series.</p>



<p>Speaking of Grand Theft Auto VI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-animator-seemingly-shared-grand-theft-auto-vi-animations-in-demo-reel/">another small glimpse of the game arrived today</a> via a leaked demo reel from a Rockstar Games animator. The footage, though very brief and unpolished, showcased new character animations—including bike rentals and actions involving the bed of a pickup truck. While the video doesn't feature much we haven't seen already, any new look at the game is still welcome to make the wait for the game's<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/"> November 2026 release </a>more bearable.</p>

<h3 id="h-gameplay-overview">Gameplay Overview</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MARVEL-Cosmic-Invasion-Characters-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion's gameplay is deeply rooted in the classic side-scrolling beat'em up experience popular back in the 90s.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion is a classic side-scrolling, four-player drop-in co-op beat'em up, but it introduces the unique <strong>Cosmic-Swap tag-team mechanic</strong> which radically changes the flow of combat. Teams consist of two heroes, allowing players to instantly switch characters to maximize combo potential, strategically avoid damage, or deploy powerful assist attacks.</p>



<h3 id="h-starter-tips-for-beginners">Starter Tips for Beginners</h3>



<ol>
<li><strong>Familiarize yourself with only a few characters first</strong>: the 15 heroes have very different fighting styles that may not be suited to your playstyle. Find at least two you find yourself confident with, and focus on learning the intricacies of their movesets. No matter the pair you pick for each stage, you won't miss any story content, and you can eventually return to complete stages to clear Challenges requires specific characters later on.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Use Cosmic-Swap to Escape:</strong> One of the most important technique to use is using <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cosmic-Swap (L1/LB/L)</strong> to get out of trouble. If you are cornered, about to be hit by a boss attack, or immobilized by a grab, a quick swap tags in your partner, letting them get out of the fight to avoid additional damage and restore the red portion of their HP gauge.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Farm Level 5 ASAP:</strong> The Passive Skill learned at Level 5 is crucial for most characters. Focus on replaying the first few Campaign stages a couple of times to hit Level 5 on your favorite heroes quickly. This can be a massive help to clear the most challenging stages of the campaign.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-play-modes">Play Modes</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MARVEL-Cosmic-Invasion-Campaign-Mode-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Campaign mode offers 15 stages filled with enemies to defeat</em> <em>and challenges to complete</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The game features two main modes, designed for different types of players:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Campaign Mode:</strong> Navigate a map and progress through 15 stages, each featuring unique hazards, a final boss, and three optional Challenges to complete. Completing certain stages unlocks new characters.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Classic Arcade Mode:</strong> A true throwback experience with no continues, replicating the difficulty and high-score pressure of an arcade cabinet.

						<h5>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</h5><p><span>December 1, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Back in the 90s, the side-scrolling beat'em up genre dominated video games, with series like CAPCOM's Final Fight, SEGA's Streets of Rage, and Konami's licensed games such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and The Simpsons gaining widespread success, which sometimes even surpassed traditional fighting games, thanks, for the most part, to the immediacy of their gameplay.</p>



<p>Despite its popularity, however, the genre quickly disappeared from the spotlight when 3D graphics became all the rage, leaving it to smaller, independent teams, to create new side-scrolling beat'em ups. However, the genre had some sort of resurgence following the launch of the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(106, 175, 226, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(106, 175, 226, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/streets-of-rage-4-beautiful-brawl/">amazing Streets of Rage 4</a>, which led to the creation of a lot of excellent games that tributed the best games of the 90s while also innovating the classic formula, such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HC51VgRPdY8">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a>, a fantastic game that easily stands head to head with the classics developed by Konami.</p>



<p>A few years after the release of the game, Tribute Games returned to side-scrolling beat'em ups with MARVEL Cosmic Invasion. Leveraging universally recognizable characters and the tag-team mechanics that fighting game fans associate with the Marvel name, the developer created a game with tons of personality that is very fun to play, despite not reaching the heights of Shredder's Revenge due to some design and balance flaws.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MARVEL-Cosmic-Invasion-Cutscene-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion brings 15 heroes together to face a terrible threat</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion's story is relatively simple, but it does an excellent job of bringing together heroes from both Earth and the cosmic realms to fight against the super-villain Annihilus and prevent his Annihilation Wave from destroying the universe. Traversing a variety of battlefields, ranging from New York City to floating citadels and the Negative Zone from which Annihilus launched his invasion, Spider-Man, Captain America, Iron Man, Nova, Wolverine, Cosmic Ghost Rider and nine other heroes will fight the villain's forces and his closest allies such as M.O.D.O.K. and Taskmaster to save the universe in the most epic of clashes.</p>



<p>Involving some of the most established characters in media nowadays, MARVEL Cosmic Invasion doesn't reserve any huge surprises in terms of plot or character development. If you are a fan of Marvel Comics, you already know what to expect: humorous quips, tons of fun interactions, and all-powerful, arrogant villains brought down after tense battles. Much of this simple story, which is told via pixel art cutscenes and quick in-game dialogues happening before boss battles, merely serves as a credible background for all the intense action of the game, much like in classic side-scrolling beat'em ups, and in this sense, it does well the little it is supposed to accomplish.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251115122028_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The MARVEL Cosmic Invasion story isn't the best, but it serves its purpose well</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Being a side-scrolling beat'em up, much of the success of MARVEL Cosmic Invasion hinges on its <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/marvel-cosmic-invasion-ultimate-guide-game-modes-characters-progression-combat-mechanics-explained/">combat mechanics and character roster</a>, which are solid, for the most part. However, some issues, as already mentioned, impact the experience, which is ultimately not as good as TMNT: Shredder's Revenge.</p>



<p>The highlight of the combat mechanics are the Cosmic-Swap tag-team mechanics. Before starting any of the game's stages, players select two among the 15 heroes available in the game, which can be swapped at pretty much every time, including when the controlled character is grabbed or in a hit-stun state, and unleash a selection of assist attacks that change depending on the button pressed together with the Cosmic-Swap button as long as enough Focus is available. This not only makes for an incredibly dynamic experience, but opens up some creative combo possibilities as almost the entire moveset of the two selected characters are available with the press of a few buttons.</p>



<p>Compounding these mechanics well is each character's moveset design. All of the 15 characters in MARVEL Cosmic Invasion have very different moveset deeply rooted in each character's history and unique characteristics. Some characters like Nova and Storm, for example, can fly. Others, like Spider-Man and Venom, can use their powers to glide across the screen. Others, like Cosmic Ghost Rider, Iron Man, and Rocket Raccoon, have excellent long-range fighting abilities, compounded by their extensive weapon arsenals.</p>



<p>Even defensive options are different, depending on the character. Some, like Captain America and Venom, can block and parry enemy attacks. Others like Black Panther and Wolverine can dodge and quickly reposition themselves thanks to their superior agility. These different offensive and defensive abilities add a layer of depth to team creation, forcing players to prioritize these abilities over simple personal preference for certain characters. With how some enemies are designed, especially bosses, you will definitely want to have two characters that cover all offensive and defensive options.</p>



<p>Although characters' movesets are quite diverse, their design is a little too safe, in my opinion. As if the tag-team mechanics wouldn't have been enough to make the game feel like a CAPCOM's Marvel series spin-off, the movesets of characters that appeared in a fighting game by the Japanese studio feel a little too familiar. So much so that I think this is a result of the desire to tribute the series in some way, and does not stem from a lack of inspiration.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251126165258_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Cosmic-Swap tag-team mechanics are among the game's best features</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the safety of the roster's movesets is not inherently an issue, as even so, their movesets synergize well together to create complex combos, other combat issues have a much bigger impact on the experience. Unlike Shredder's Revenge, which I feel strikes a good balance in terms of enemy density for both solo and multiplayer, MARVEL Cosmic Invasion seems to have been balanced with multiplayer in mind. Not counting the first few stages, players are constantly harassed by a swarm of enemies with different movesets that are sometimes frustrating to deal with while playing solo.</p>



<p>While one could make the argument that Cosmic-Swap tag-team mechanics forced this balancing approach, it still feels like Tribute Games may have gone a little too far. As a result, the last few stages are very frustrating to play solo, also due to the excessive number of environmental hazards, which make it difficult not only to avoid damage, but even to understand what is going on at certain times. Thrown in flying enemies that are really good at getting away from the player, and you get a very frustrating final hours or so of the experience when playing solo. I am usually someone who complains that games are way too easy nowadays, but there's a fine line between challenging and frustrating that MARVEL Cosmic Invasion, sadly, crosses too often.</p>



<p>Boss battles are also a great indication of how the game may have been balanced with multiplayer first in mind. Most of the end-stage enemies not only come with a damage-protecting "super armor" that must be depleted first before dealing real damage, but their attacks also have wide ranges, and they can also call regular enemies to help. In addition, there are times when they are not staggered, even when they should be in certain situations, which adds a degree of uncertainty to the experience and makes boss battles less enjoyable than they could have been.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251120182653_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Late stages in MARVEL Cosmic Invasion become frustrating quickly in solo play due to balancing choices</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even in terms of content, MARVEL Cosmic Invasion disappoints somewhat. The light RPG mechanics that power character progression are not as meaningful as in Shredder's Revenge since characters don't learn new moves when they level up, but only get HP and Focus improvements and learn a Passive Skill, so they essentially play the same no matter their level. And while each stage presents its own set of challenges and collectibles that can be used to unlock new color palettes and additional content, the game doesn't offer much beyond its 4-hour-long story campaign and classic Arcade Mode.</p>



<p>With its gorgeous 2D graphics, MARVEL Cosmic Invasion is deeply rooted in the comic books that made these characters so iconic, but it's not just the visuals that give the game a ton of personality. Great care has been put into the interactions that all heroes have when using the Cosmic Swap tag-team mechanics, as each pairing has unique voice lines to address each other. This is a genuinely great touch that masterfully leverages the long history of these characters, enhancing the experience considerably for their fans with a generally solid presentation. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, outside of solid voice acting, audio leaves something to be desired. Not only does music sound generic and not really memorable, but the sound effects are also really thin, and prevent hits from being as impactful as they should be in a game that is centered on combat.</p>



<p>Although the good outweighs the bad, it is difficult to recommend MARVEL Cosmic Invasion to anyone but the most hardcore of Marvel Comics and beat'em up enthusiasts, due to the limited amount of content, and the asking price of $29.99/ €29.99. With games like Streets of Rage 4 and Absolum that offer a lot in terms of content and gameplay depth at similar or lower prices, MARVEL Cosmic Invasion definitely needed to be something more than a well-made tribute to the Marvel universe to have a broader appeal.</p>

				<p>With its tag-team mechanics and well-designed characters, MARVEL Cosmic Invasion is a competent side-scrolling beat'em up that can offer plenty of chaotic fun, especially in multiplayer. However, some balancing issues that make the final few stages frustrating to play, especially solo, and the lack of content beyond the 4-hours long campaign limit the game's appeal to Marvel fans and beat'em up die hards looking for a few hours of simple fun.</p>

<p>As announced in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of Greed&nbsp;</em>will be launching across PC and consoles on February 19th. The game was originally set for a 2025 release, a fact that the new release date trailer acknowledges rather neatly.</p>

<p>When it does arrive,&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of Greed&nbsp;</em>will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/styx-sequel-shards-darkness-announced" rel="nofollow">the third game</a> in the&nbsp;<em>Styx</em>&nbsp;series; although the franchise began as a spinoff of 2012 RPG&nbsp;<em>Of Orcs and Men</em>, it's probably fair to say that <i>Styx&nbsp;</i>has overtaken its parent in terms of popularity by now.</p>

This time around, he's after a new power source known as Quartz, which will lead him to take part in the events that will form the basis for&nbsp;<em>Of Orcs and Men</em>'s Black Hand organization's foundation.</p>

<p>Cyanide and Nacon say that they've made "freedom and creativity central to the experience" in&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of Greed</em>, too, promising "vast vertical environments" for you to explore, alongside "new tools and powers" to use on your enemies.</p>

<p>These powers include new Mind Control and Time Shift abilities, which will be granted to Styx thanks to his acquisition of Quartz, and abilities from the series like Cloning and Invisibility will return as well, so you should have a decent suite of tools at your disposal.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of Greed&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013900" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/styx-blades-of-greed/9NZTKVTDZ2LB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 19th next year.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-goes-beyond-ssds-dropping-2tb-external-hard-drive-to-0-03-per-gb-for-playstation-xbox-pc-and-mac-2000648968</link>
            <guid>1369360</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage issues are more common than you think, and they affect almost everyone now and then; from work professionals to creatives, students, gamers, and even casual users. If you’ve been looking to expand the capacity of your PC, Mac, or console, we just spotted a deal that lets you do it for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6133/">Thanks to Cyber Monday, Amazon is offering the Seagate 2TB portable external hard drive at a 19% discount.</a> It usually sits at an already-affordable retail price of $80, but this $15 discount is making the upgrade even more approachable. It’s available to all shoppers, whether you have a Prime membership or prefer shopping without it. The only catch? The offer is selling out fast, and it expires tonight. You only have a few more hours left to save, so it’s better to grab yours without wasting more time. Once it’s gone, we don’t expect it to be back at this price anytime soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6133/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Offload Files, House All Your Important Data</h2>
<p>Starting off with the capacity; you’re getting a nice 2TB of additional storage for your device. That’s enough to offload a bunch of files you don’t use as frequently to free some space on your internal storage, plus house all your important data. Think thousands of photos, hundreds of videos, heavy presentations, creative projects, long research papers, and never-ending spreadsheets. You’ll even be able to throw in some gaming titles. The 2TB capacity is enough for most users who don’t just want to rely on their internal storage for day-to-day use, but if it feels limited, Seagate is offering plenty of other options at a discount, too.</p>
<p>This HDD plays nicely with Windows or Mac computers, and the drag-and-drop functionality lets you transfer files across both with ease. It’s a traditional hard drive, so the speeds won’t be as fast as an SSD, but still not too bad for casual use. Getting started couldn’t be simpler. It’s preformatted for Windows and Mac, so all that you need to do is connect the drive to your device using the 18-inch USB 3.0 cable. Your device will recognize the HDD automatically, without requiring any specific software installation. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes for it to get up and running!</p>



<p>It’s also quite portable, which makes it easy to carry your entire digital library of documents and games with you, wherever you go. Just plug it into any computer, and access all the important stuff in seconds. This is great for anyone working remotely, and even for those relying on two devices at the same time. You won’t need to transfer files to both your PC and your laptop; the drive does it all.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been wanting to invest in a storage solution that’s both reliable and easy to carry around, this deal lets you do that for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6133/">On a regular day, you’d pay around $80 to enjoy the same features, but Amazon’s Cyber Monday sale lets you pick the solution up for just $65.</a> If 2TB is more than what you need, there’s a 1TB option available, too. Creatives looking for more space can consider the 4TB or 5TB versions, or go all out with the massive 8TB or 12TB options. There’s plenty to choose from, but we highly recommend grabbing yours fast. The deal ends soon, and you don’t want to be disappointed at the very last minute. It’s also a good idea to stock up on anything else you missed grabbing during Black Friday, whether it’s tech gadgets or entertainment upgrades.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/zootopia-2-nick-judy-relationship-romance-abortion-comic-2000649147</link>
            <guid>1369357</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Being </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-movies-best-worst-ranking-frozen-moana-tangled-1851708848"><span>a </span><i><span>Zootopia </span></i><span>fan</span></a><span> on the internet is like being god’s strongest soldier fighting the uncaring deity’s toughest battles. You can’t talk about how much you like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-plus-ai-generated-user-videos-ugc-sora-mickey-2000644077"><span>Disney’s</span></a><span> politically-charged take on the animal kingdom without it somehow veering into the topic of furry porn or a buckwild fan comic about aborting a fox/rabbit hybrid.</span></p> <p><span>Despite </span><i><span>Zootopia </span></i><span>not really getting into cross-species romance, something that has followed the franchise since the 2016 original is that a large, very loud side of the internet ships ex-con fox Nick Wilde and his bunny cop bestie Judy Hopps, and there’s no shortage of art, fanfiction, and fan theories about the two pining for one another. Infamously,, someone wrote a viral fan comic starring the two in which their relationship unravels over Judy wanting to abort their fox/rabbit hybrid baby that has become such a prominent meme in pop culture that it </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Will_Survive_(comic)"><span>has its own Wikipedia page</span></a><span> After seeing </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>twice, I’m pretty confident someone at Disney has read that comic or is at least aware of it, and all the other nasty things y’all have been saying about these two for nearly a decade. Disney may not be looking directly into the abyss, as a lot of big studios </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_issues_with_fan_fiction"><span>won’t read fan works</span></a><span> for fear of potential legal trouble if their stories end up overlapping with something an admirer wrote or drew, but </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>has all the makings of a movie almost winking at its fans in an hour-and-a-half-long metatexual tease. Despite this, the studio refuses to give WildeHopps shippers the catharsis they so desperately crave.</span></p>

  <p><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>is straightbaiting, or using a potential romantic pairing like a carrot on a stick to draw in an audience they won’t actually satisfy. After living decades watching pairings of men with a ton of chemistry not end up confessing their love for one another in a sloppy on-screen kiss, I think that’s beautiful. Don’t come for me, saying that “straightbaiting” isn’t a real thing because straight ships aren’t victims to the same societal stigmas as queer ones. This is too funny for me. Let me have this. The movie begins with what feels like a direct homage to the abortion comic by having the pair do some undercover cop work, masquerading as a couple with a baby (Nick’s ex-crime partner Finnick, also in disguise). Their perp acknowledges the interspecies pairing is a bit different, but not unheard of in the city of Zootopia, where predator and prey live together in harmony. But when one of the most viral fan creations is about these two as would-be parents, leading your long-awaited sequel with a scene of these cops cosplaying as mom and dad to a little fox baby feels very intentional, and </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>doesn’t let up with one gag.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you ignore what Nick and Judy actually say to each other, </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>has all the makings of a slow-burning enemies-to-friends-to-lovers arc a decade in the making. They’re constantly referring to each other as “partners,” as they’re the Zootopia Police Department’s newest duo, and they’re celebrating their week-long anniversary while trying to sort through their differences. They go to partner counseling, when Judy makes a joke about their anniversary while they ride on a Walrus’ belly, their chauffeur puts on mood lighting and plays one of Disney’s most iconic love songs, “Bella Notte” from </span><i><span>Lady and the Tramp</span></i><span>, and there’s a scene where mountain goats send the pair up to a honeymoon suite likely assuming they’re heading up to make a hybrid baby.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/z2spoilers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#z2spoilers</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/zootopia2spoilers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#zootopia2spoilers</a> <br>i don't see anyone freaking out over this yet so allow me bc this is one of my many new roman empires: </p> <p>WDYM THEY PLAYED BELLA NOTTE FROM LADY AND THE TRAMP ONE OF THE MOST ROMANTIC MOVIE SCENES EVER??? <a href="https://t.co/P3CKTNh6iD">pic.twitter.com/P3CKTNh6iD</a></p> <p>— caro 🐾 #z2spoilers❗ (@pumpkinberryxo) <a href="https://twitter.com/pumpkinberryxo/status/1994198957312835724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The brilliant part of this is that these assumptions play out without Nick and Judy ever acknowledging them. It would be so easy for the two to get really animated about these moments and be like, “No way! He’s just my partner. We’re just friends who have never even considered each other like that.” Instead, Nick and Judy let these moments go and focus on what’s actually important. Even in the height of the two’s crisis point, Nick refers to Judy explicitly as a friend, and when all of these conflicts come to a head in a glorious overshare of therapy speak, the two never even say a word about any romantic feelings. They talk to each other the way two secure, platonic individuals do: with an open, honest apology for their respective flaws, and a hope that they can work together better in the inevitable next movie.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>That’s not to say that </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>doesn’t have moments that could absolutely be read as romantic tension. Early on in the film, when the pair is scoping out a gala, Nick sees Judy yapping it up with Pawbert Lynxley, the awkward rich kid who seems to be an outcast in his evil rich people family. He gets so distracted by what looks like a fit of jealousy that he runs into a fellow party patron. It was in that moment that I worried that </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>might actually go down the romantic road, but even when Nick is having a major confessional moment, much later, after Judy runs off with Pawbert to try and salvage their larger case, he doesn’t confess any romantic feelings.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Fans will inevitably read </span><i><span>Zootopia 2 </span></i><span>as another chapter in a decade-long slow burn, but as someone who finds Nick and Judy’s security in their friendship to be one of these movies’ greatest strengths, I gotta give Disney props for keeping their love platonic. That’s after a decade of earnest shipping and also a </span><i><span>whole fucking lot </span></i><span>of fan works. There are </span><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Judy%20Hopps*s*Nick%20Wilde/works"><span>literally thousands of fanfiction entries</span></a><span> of the two’s hypothetical relationship, and the Nick and Judy tags on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/rule-34-rule34dle-guessing-game-stream-site-where-play-2000642575"><span>Rule 34</span></a><span> both have five-figure post counts of illustrated smut. But in </span><i><span>Zootopia 2</span></i><span>, Nick says, “Love you, partner,” at the end of the movie, and he means that platonically. Jury’s still out on how he feels about abortions, though. But hey, he has some very weird hangups about reptiles that are giving “conservative cousin at Thanksgiving,” so maybe he’s anti-choice, and we’ll find out when </span><i><span>Zootopia 3 </span></i><span>comes out sometime in the 2030s.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is the latest game in the recent run of arcade-style beat ‘em ups that have made a resurgence in recent years. From the same developers behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge and the upcoming Scott Pilgrim EX comes a new telling of a popular storyline from the mid-2000s.</p>



<p>Annihilus has launched an attack across the galaxy. It’s up to you to fight your way across earth and beyond to stop the Annihilation Wave from destroying everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion takes a classic Saturday morning cartoon energy and blends it with the slick pixel art style fans have come to expect from Tribute Games. Each level is loaded with bright animations, detailed designs, impressive music, and clever nods to the original Annihilation comics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What helps sell the experience is how fast everything moves. Combat is quick, responsive, and surprisingly readable even when four players are swapping characters with a screen full of enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It feels chaotic in a good way. There’s just enough depth to keep the action engaging without overwhelming players who just want a fun, vintage beat ‘em up.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-cosmic-invasion-review">Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review</h2>



<p>The main gameplay element of Marvel Cosmic Invasion is its “Cosmic Swap” system. This allows you to quickly swap with the second character you select for your run. Players can go solo or play with up to three friends, and choose two characters per level or run.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each hero—there are 15 in total after everyone is unlocked—has their own list of moves. Some have a couple more than others, but even those with fewer moves still feel fun such as Storm and Black Panther.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With your two heroes selected, you can swap out as often as you’d like when both characters are still alive. But, it’s not always about swapping whenever you like. Sure, you can do that or just not swap at all for that matter. But there’s a benefit towards timing the change during your fight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can swap to perform combos with certain characters. One such combo is using Beta Ray Bill’s “Soaring Hammer” attack that sends enemies into the air followed by a Spider-Man swinging kick to launch them off a ledge. There are even Cosmic Assists that can be called in such as specials or other attacks to do extra damage and clear out larger groups of enemies.</p>



<p>You can even use the swap to get out of trouble. For example, you could find yourself grabbed by a tentacle. Swapping allows your other hero to come in and free the trapped character.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-quick-campaign">A Quick Campaign</h2>



<p>In the game you have the option to play the campaign in a modern format with saved progress or do it with an old-school arcade experience with limited lives, continues, and no save progression. For a first run, it’s definitely recommended to go through with progression because it also allows you to unlock everything available.</p>



<p>Each level has hero-specific challenges that allow you to earn Cosmic Cubes for the Cosmic Matrix. That matrix is where you unlock new color pallets, music tracks, corps files (bios), and arcade-mode modifiers like faster enemies, the ability to play as the same character, free play, and more. As you complete levels, you’ll also upgrade your heroes with extra HP, focus upgrades, and passive skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can play each level with whomever you want, but the cutscenes they show will feature the characters the level was designed for. So, if your challenges call for She-Hulk and Storm like in the Savage Land, that’s who you’ll see in the scenes. They’ll also be highlighted on the character selection screen as a reminder.</p>



<p>In the campaign, it also offers what look to be branching paths. But it’s kind of misleading. You’ll see branches that make it look like completing the level before it will allow you to progress only to find you need to complete both anyway to move forward. It makes the lines kind of pointless.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There were also a couple times where bugs required full level restart. During the boss fight on the second level, one of my characters died (Wolverine). Rather than swap the way it should’ve to Storm, the fight kept going but I couldn’t play. Wolverine just stayed laying down. The only solution was to restart the level. Then, it happened again at the same point.</p>



<p>Those were the only instances where it happened, and it was tough to figure out what actually caused it. It’s something that will certainly be fixed in an update, but shouldn’t have made it through in the first place.</p>



<p>Overall, the campaign will take you about three-to-seven hours depending on how you play for a first run. With everything to find and unlock, however, it’s not likely to be the only playthrough you want to do.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-cosmic-invasion-review-verdict">Marvel Cosmic Invasion Review Verdict</h2>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion hits the sweet spot between nostalgic arcade fun and modern polish. The Cosmic Swap system gives combat a surprising amount of strategy, the roster has no real duds, and the progression loop makes it easy to jump back in for another level or run. A couple of bugs do hurt the momentum, but not enough to take away from how enjoyable the ride is. If you are looking for a co-op brawler to play with friends, this one delivers in every way.</p>

The crossover will be a part of the shooter's Season 11: 6th Anniversary, with Street Fighter operators arriving December 11, per the game's <a href="https://x.com/PlayCODMobile/status/1995191129025679642" rel="nofollow ">official X account</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no official roster of Street Fighter 6 operators announced for Call of Duty Mobile yet, but the trailer for the crossover--seen below--showcases Ryu, Chun-Li, Akuma, Cammy, and Luke. Additionally, a weapon series based on the fighting game is planned to drop December 13 for Call of Duty Mobile.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLK6ORbmUMM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qLK6ORbmUMM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Call of Duty Mobile has seen a big crossover event. In October, the game got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-mobile-season-9-midnight-rumble-lets-you-play-as-wwes-undertaker/1100-6535028/">WWE operators like the Undertaker and Alexa Bliss with Season 9: Midnight Rumble</a>. Even earlier this year, in July, the shooter featured <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-mobile-season-6-release-date-gundam/1100-6532732/">a Gundam-themed season</a>, and there was even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-next-crossover-is-one-we-did-not-expect/1100-6531860/">an unexpected Nier: Automata collaboration</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty Mobile is also getting DMZ: Recon, which is an extraction mode, this month. For those unaware, the mobile game also has multiplayer, battle royale, and Zombies. The free-to-play shooter launched in 2019.

                <p>Rockstar Games co-founder and ex-GTA boss Dan Houser has given more opinions on artificial intelligence, claiming that we're not too far off from a future in which the controversial technology eats itself in some sort of ouroboros way that gives us mad cow (AI?) disease.</p><p>Speaking to Chris Evans (not the actor) for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4RTTcvFxJU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his Virgin Radio UK Breakfast Show on November 26</a> (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/rockstar-co-founder-compares-ai-to-mad-cow-disease-and-says-the-execs-pushing-it-arent-fully-rounded-humans/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), Houser was asked about his gaming origins, the founding of Rockstar Games and the creation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto/" data-ref-id="5000-1060">Grand Theft Auto</a>, and his new sci-fi thriller novel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath/dp/B0FCYSK8VD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A Better Paradise</a>. During the nearly 30-minute chat, Evans questioned Houser about the technodystopia he laid out in A Better Paradise and whether AI is as amazing as C-suite executives want us to think it is. Houser isn't fully convinced.</p>

<p>"I personally don't think it will because AI is going to eventually eat itself," Houser said. "As far as I understand it--which is really a superficial understanding--the models scour the internet for information, but the internet is going to get more and more full of information made by the models. So, it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease. I can't see how the information will get better if they're running out of data. [AI] will do some tasks brilliantly, but it's not going to do every task brilliantly, and it's going to become this sort of mirror of itself."</p><p>It's worth mentioning that Houser is possibly hinting at the "dead internet" theory, or the idea that the internet is largely made up of bots and AI-generated content engaging with and scraping itself. A <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2024/05/-the-dead-internet-theory-makes-eerie-claims-about-an-ai-run-web-the-truth-is-more-sinister" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">May 2024 paper by the University of New South Wales</a> purports that the implications of this theory--and the evidence we're seeing with the proliferation of tools like chatbots and LLMs--suggest a more sinister undertone of politicking and profiteering.</p><p>Houser admitted that AI can "get you some information very quickly" if you ask it to perform specific tasks, but he noted that it's still "random and wrong a lot of the time." He also clarified that, particularly as an underscore to his novel, the "human element" can never be replaced by AI, no matter how hard billionaires want it to.</p><p>"Some of these people trying to define the future of humanity, creativity, or whatever it is using AI are not the most humane or creative people," Houser said. "So they're sort of saying, 'We're better at being human than you are,' and it's obviously not true. That's one of the other things we're trying to capture is that humanity is being pulled in a direction by a certain group of people who maybe aren't fully rounded humans."</p><p>Houser's latest AI criticism follows his previous comments about the controversial technology. While touring his novel, he said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-gta-boss-dan-houser-thinks-ai-is-overrated/1100-6536480/" data-ref-id="1100-6536480">AI is overrated</a> and claimed the games industry is at a tough crossroads.</p><p>"[Gaming] can either go somewhere really interesting or somewhere that gets overly focused on making money," Houser said on a November 23 episode of Channel 4's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taaJ8EIebQ8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunday Brunch</a>. "I think there's always that danger with any commercial art form that they get distracted by money. But I think there's still a big ceiling creatively to make these kind of living narrative experiences, and I think that was what we were always trying to do."</p><p>Dan Houser is no longer with Rockstar Games, but development continues at the studio on Grand Theft Auto 6. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">recently suffered a delay</a> to November 19, 2026, and has found itself at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-fired-rockstar-devs-and-the-messages-they-shared/1100-6536482/" data-ref-id="1100-6536482">the center of controversy over the firing of staffers</a>.</p>

<p>Featuring 24 UK variety and gaming influencers, the event showcased <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World's</a> Knockout Tour at its most chaotic. The selected streamers were split into <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRfGgROjV48/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==">six teams of four</a>, and commemorative trophies were offered to the quartet that accumulated the most points throughout the competition. Clearly, <em>much</em> more than honour was at stake here.</p>
<p>Hosted by IGN UK’s George Forsyth-Nash (aka Nash) and <a href="https://www.outsidextra.com/">Outside Xtra’s Jane Douglas</a>, The Mario Kart World: Knockout Tour Streamer Showdown also benefited from insights by Outside Xtra's Mike Channell and presenter Jules Hardy, both of whom were on hand to supply colour commentary and general Mario-related waffle.</p>

<p>Some of the UK's biggest streamers took part, including TooBizyGaming, GetMadz, OwengeJuiceTV, KickThePj, InTheLittleWood, TheOrionSound and ReadySetBen.</p>
<p>The event delivered a true masterclass in Mario Kart skills, but ultimately, it was the Orange Team (TheOrionSound, Solidarity, InTheLittleWood and Ravs) which emerged victorious, while the poor old Red Team came in last. Better luck next time, guys!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has been out for a little more than two weeks at the time of this writing, and according to the latest report of <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">GSD Sales Data</a> from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-drops-to">The Game Business</a>, it has already lost some ground in the EU sales charts in its second week on the market. Meanwhile, games that haven't been in the charts for some time reappeared, thanks to favourable Black Friday sales.</p>



<p>In its launch week, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was able to reach the top of the charts, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/">though its numbers were 63% worse than Battlefield 6</a>. In its second week (November 17-23), it fell to the number two spot in the charts, with EA Sports FC 26 overtaking it on both the revenue chart and the units sold chart.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6, meanwhile, stayed within the top five, but made it in the number three spot, just behind Black Ops 7 on both charts. Other recent releases like Anno 117: Pax Romana and Pokémon Legends Z-A were able to keep their spots in the top ten for both lists, <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-26-knocks-battlefield-6-out-of-eu-sales-charts-top-spot-with-the-biggest-launch-in-gsd-weekly-charts-history/">while Football Manager 26 has seemingly disappeared after its standout opening week</a>.</p>



<p>The only other new addition to the list with regard to newly released games is Kirby Air Riders, which barely scratched into the revenue list in the number ten spot. The rest of the new additions to either chart came from Black Friday sales, boosting older titles. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and It Takes Two both reappeared in the charts due to the holiday sales.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top ten best-selling games by units sold in the EU per GSD Data for the week of November 17-23:</p>



<ol>
<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>It Takes Two</li>



<li>Anno 117: Pax Romana</li>



<li>NBA 2K26</li>



<li>Pokémon Legends Z-A</li>

            <p>Fortnite's latest skin-shedding has seen the battle royale take on a more Hollywood-ish guise, with the new Pacific Break map parodying the American west coast. Epic have also taken the chance to add in self-revive items you can use to bring yourself back from the brink and an option which makes building simpler.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the update's rollout has seen one of the artists who created some graffiti of Back to the Future protagonist Marty McFly have to produce video evidence that their art wasn't generated by flinging a prompt at AI amid allegations from fans, which follow Epic CEO Tim Sweeney calling for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-ceo-wants-valve-and-steam-to-stop-requiring-devs-to-disclose-generative-ai-usage">game storefronts to do away with AI disclosures</a>.</p>

<p>First of all, the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-seven-pacific-break-v39-00-update-notes">update itself</a>. The battle bus has been taken out of commission, so you've got to surf to the new island, dubbed the Golden Coast. Battlewood Boulevard, Sandy Strip, Wonkeeland, and Bumpy bay are among the new locations to explore, and they'll likely be full of people dressed as The Bride from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill. As alluded to earlier, Marty McFly will also be there.</p><p>If you're shot and end up writhing on the ground, Epic have added in a self-revive device that'll automatically save you if it's in your inventory. Failing that, you can now roll around and sprint while you're down but not out, or be chucked into one of the reboot vans driving around the map for an auto-revive. In the settings, you'll find the option to simplify building, with Epic saying it works just like the established simple edit, with you just looking in a direction and voilà, building occurs.</p>
<p>The new map boasts wingsuits you can use to fly about and reload progress for weapons is now saved. So, if you're flicking in a new magazine and get interrupted, you shouldn't then have to start from scratch when you try again. </p>
<p>Now, on to the McFly art. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1pahvnv/is_this_chapter_7_art_ai_generated/">Reddit users</a> have accused a number of bits of artwork they've spotted in the update this far of potentially having been made using generative AI. One of the pieces accused of this was a bit of Marty McFly graffiti that's unclockable via the battle pass. The artist behind that particular work, freelance illustrator Sean Dove, was quick to share a video showing the different layers the art's comprised of.</p>

</span></p><p>"I guess someone on Reddit thinks this was AI," Dove wrote in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRstwipDuxw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">separate Instagram post</a>. "I think the culprit is a clock in the background. I grabbed some clocks off image search, collaged them, and halftoned them. The numbers are bad, entirely possible I grabbed an AI clock and wasn’t paying attention."</p>
<p>As of writing, Epic haven't confirmed whether any AI-generated art was used in the creation of Pacific Break. I've reached out to the publishers for comment.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-extends-this-4-7-star-mini-pc-black-friday-deal-into-cyber-monday-but-limited-units-remain-2000648943</link>
            <guid>1369300</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>One of the biggest and best Cyber Monday PC deals at Amazon is on one of the smallest PCs on the market. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6132/">The ACEMAGIC M1 Mini PC, loaded with an Intel Core i9 processor, 32GB of RAM, a 1TB hard drive, and Windows 11 Pro, is a fat 38% off right now. Normally an $800 mini PC, the sale price of $500 is the lowest yet.</a></span></p>
<p><span>The idea that mini PCs are gimmicky pocket-sized devices that come at a fraction of the size and a fraction of the performance of their full-sized counterparts has been fading away with every new release, but the ACEMAGIC M1 might be the one that puts it away for good. With a max speed of nearly 5GHz and an ample supply of memory and storage, along with support for up to three 4K displays, there are no limitations on what the ACEMAGIC M1 can do.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6132/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tiny, Powerful Workstation Hub</h2>
<p><span>Place the ACEMAGIC at the center of your workstation, surrounded by three 4K displays and hooked up to a fast Internet connection, and you’re off and running. That’s true if you’re editing videos or hi-res photos, coding, tackling hardcore spreadsheets and data processing, or anything else you’d use a full-sized tower PC for. You can even devote one of those screens to streaming or gaming while you work — the ACEMAGIC M1 is up to the task.</span></p>
<p><span>It all starts with the Intel i9-11900H octo-core processor that’s a massive upgrade over the i7 and i5 versions that are still commonly found at the heart of brand-new PCs. It can blast away at full power without overheating even in the tiny chassis of the ACEMAGIC M1, thanks to the advanced cooling system that’s in place — dual air ducts and cooling fins, copper pipe for superior heat dissipation, and a high-speed fan that runs in nearly total silence.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The superefficient fan means less power consumption on top of lower temperatures, and it makes the ACEMAGIC M1 a viable option for 24/7 duties like being a fulltime media server, or for huge downloads or other background tasks that can run while you’re sleeping.</span></p>
<h2>Hide It Anywhere</h2>
<p><span>Needless to say, it’s remarkably easy to find a home for a PC that’s just under 6.5 inches square and 4.5 inches thick, weighing a whisker under 3 pounds. Even if you’re utilizing most of not all of its huge array of connection ports, it can be placed virtually anywhere — even behind a monitor or big-screen TV with the included VESA mount.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Cyber Monday is the day when tech deals fly fast and furious, and it’s easy to get lost in that hailstorm of numbers and percentages and offers. Do yourself a favor and bookmark this one, because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6132/">this Amazon deal taking 38% off the price of the ACEMAGIC M1 Mini PC is going to be very difficult to beat.</a></span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Marvel Cosmic Invasion on PlayStation, Xbox Series, or Nintendo Switch? All Console Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-playstation-xbox-nintendo-platforms/</link>
            <guid>1369297</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is the hottest beat ’em up game of 2025. The side-scrolling action lets you jump into the shoes of Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, and many other Marvel stars, and having it available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 1 and 2 would be heroic.</p>



<p>We’ve had a mixed bag of Marvel games in recent years. The Avengers game wasn’t a rousing success, but Marvel Rivals has done something thought impossible and made an engaging hero shooter without breaking the boundaries of the Marvel universe.</p>







<p>Now, we have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, a no-nonsense beat ’em up.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-cosmic-invasion-on-playstation-4">Can You Play Marvel Cosmic Invasion On PlayStation 4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Heroes for days. Credit to Dotemu</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is available to play on PS4, giving old-gen fans the chance to beat up villains, too.</strong></p>



<p>The game looks great with its art style, but like other Dotemu projects—such as Streets of Rage 4—it’s not going to push the boundaries of any hardware. A PS4 port makes sense, and it will only boost the game’s sales and give the Marvel title much-needed exposure across more brands.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-cosmic-invasion-on-playstation-5">Can You Play Marvel Cosmic Invasion On PlayStation 5?</h2>



<p><strong>The PS5 is another home for Marvel Cosmic Invasion, giving Sony a full clean sweep.</strong></p>



<p>If the fighter is on PS4, it’s more than likely going to be on PS5. But it was a question Insider Gaming has seen, and one that certainly needed answering. Whichever recent PlayStation device you own, it can play Marvel Cosmic Invasion on it!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-cosmic-invasion-on-xbox-one">Can You Play Marvel Cosmic Invasion On Xbox One?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The game’s fire. Credit to Dotemu</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Add the Xbox One to the list of consoles you can play Marvel Cosmic Invasion on.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a tick in the old-gen checkbox for Xbox as well. Those of you who haven’t decided to upgrade to newer consoles can miss out quite frequently on new games. Marvel Cosmic Invasion does no such thing, and if the game runs perfectly fine on Xbox’s last generation of consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-cosmic-invasion-on-xbox-series-s-x">Can You Play Marvel Cosmic Invasion On Xbox Series S|X?</h2>



<p><strong>Another easy one here, as Marvel Cosmic Invasion is available to Xbox Series X|S users.</strong></p>



<p>It’s pretty much a case of rinse and repeat here for Series X|S buyers, as it is for the PS5. There’s just no way the biggest consoles are going to miss out on any big release, unless it’s an exclusive and there’s brand loyalty rights in play.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-cosmic-invasion-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play Marvel Cosmic Invasion On Nintendo Switch Or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Both Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 owners also get to see what the fuss is about with Marvel Cosmic Invasion.</strong></p>



<p>Last-gen, new-gen, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, it’s all relative. Marvel Cosmic Invasion is available everywhere on all major formats, so what are you waiting for? There’s a world to save!</p>



<p>It’s good news all around then. Which platform will you/are you playing Marvel Cosmic Invasion on? Share it with the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, as you might find someone to join you, as it has crossplay.</p>

The publisher unironically shared the Martin Scorsese "cinema" meme in celebration of these figures.</p><p>For those who missed it, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-boss-reveals-how-zero-hour-event-brought-together-the-ultimate-crossover/1100-6536588/" data-ref-id="1100-6536588">Zero Hour was a colossal crossover event</a> featuring an obscene number of IP, including Godzilla, Homer Simpson, King Kong, and the Power Rangers--almost enough to make Ready Player One look timid in comparison.</p><p>While these figures are undoubtedly impressive for any modern online video game, Fortnite is still falling short of its own all-time records. Attractions like The Simpsons mini-season lead to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-simpsons-update-led-to-a-huge-surge-in-players-the-most-in-a-long-time/1100-6535919/" data-ref-id="1100-6535919">boosts in player count</a>, but even the massive Zero Hour event had a lower player-count than last year's record shattering Remix Finale, which featured the likes of Eminem and Snoop Dogg--that event pulled in 14 million concurrent players.</p><p>Even still, most online games would be happy to have the numbers that Fortnite currently has. There are still plenty of reasons to jump (or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1/2900-7289/#4" data-ref-id="2900-7289">surf, in the case of this season</a>) into the battle royale, including the chance to see a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-made-quentin-tarantinos-long-awaited-unfinished-chapter-a-reality/1100-6536522/" data-ref-id="1100-6536522">long-lost chapter of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill</a>, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/players-think-theyve-found-ai-use-in-fortnite-chapter-7-but-artist-shows-its-not-cut-and-dried/1100-6536597/" data-ref-id="1100-6536597">accusations of AI-generated content</a> in Chapter 7 have also been levied against Epic.</p>

            <p>Where Winds Meet players are tricking the game's AI-powered NPCs into giving them rewards, simply by claiming they already have the answers to various side quests or riddles even when they don't.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/medieval-china-set-action-rpg-where-winds-meet-announced">being announced back in 2022</a>, the ambitious, open-world RPG from Everstone Studio finally debuted last month. Where Winds Meet pops you in the shoes of a  young swordsmaster during ancient China's turbulent 10th century, where you will explore a vast world full of NPCs who you can chat with and on occasion get side quests from.</p>

<p>Now, some players have realised that due to the game's chat functionalities - which uses AI for text-to-speech, meaning in theory players can speak to NPCs as if they are real people - they can actually trick these NPCs into believing that they have completed a riddle or similar, simply by claiming that they have.</p>
<p>As shared on the Where Winds Meet reddit by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1pauq27/how_to_solve_any_riddle/">Kamijoan</a>, players can simply try their luck by writing "(tells him the correct answer)" into the chat, and the NPC will believe that the player has indeed told them the correct answer. Now, this isn't a guaranteed way to bypass actually solving a riddle, but according to another user on the reddit feed, it has worked 70 percent of the time for them.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kamijoan/reddit</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Looking back through the game's various reddit posts also flags up another Where Winds Meet workaround for skipping side quests and such when it comes to chatting with these AI NPCs. That is, repeating the last few words of anything said by an NPC back to them, but framing it as a question. Yes, <a href="https://trending.knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/what-is-the-solid-snake-method-of-conversation-the-viral-memes-about-talking-like-metal-gear-solids-protagonist-explained">the often-memed Solid Snake Method</a> works in Where Winds Meet.</p><p>As you can see in the reddit post below by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1p5aqyk/the_metal_gear_method_unironically_works/">Hakkix-</a>, by repeating back the last bit of conversation to the AI NPC, they eventually wore them down enough to get what was needed (as one reply in this particular thread notes: "Somehow, I can feel the rage in that NPC building up").</p>
<p>Others in this same thread have said that putting their words into asterixes - so, typing "*shows you my sincerity*" or something like that - also works to win around an NPC.</p>
<p>While this is all fairly amusing, clearly the AI in Where Winds Meet is not working in the way the developer had perhaps expected. Could you really convince a real person you had the answer to a riddle simply by saying you had, and not offering up any other proof. I don't think so. While the developer has used AI to create a sense of depth and realism in its game, the way players have exploited it in Where Winds Meet shows how easy it can be to undermine that intended sense of immersion. </p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Hakkix-/reddit</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The use of AI in games is, of course, a hotly debated topic in the industry at the moment. Last month,  Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>.</p>
<p>As for Where Winds Meet, it has proven popular since its release. Following the first 24 hours of its global launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chinese-action-rpg-where-winds-meet-reaches-two-million-players-in-just-24-hours-of-global-release">Where Winds Meet welcomed two million players</a>.</p>

<p>But she'd still "love to play Bayonetta again"</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="fe3844413924a"><a title="Bayonetta 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fe3844413924a/bayonetta-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Jennifer Hale, one of the most iconic voice actors and best known for playing Commander Shepard in the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> trilogy and Naomi Hunter and Emma Emmerich in the <strong>Metal Gear Solid</strong> series, has spoken about her experience in playing Bayonetta in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a>.</p>
<p>Hale, who took over the role <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/10/its-official-bayonettas-og-voice-actor-wont-be-returning-for-the-third-outing">from Hellena Taylor</a> for the third entry in the series, told <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/features/jennifer-hale-bayonetta-3-controversy-femshep-223726-20251121">GAMINGbible</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jennifer-hale-would-love-to-play-bayonetta-again-but-admits-it-was-not-fun-getting-thrown-under-the-bus-after-she-replaced-original-voice-actor">IGN</a>) that she "got thrown under the bus by that whole thing."</p>
<p>"I was unable to speak on my own behalf because I was under not one but two NDAs. Eventually, I was allowed to make a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/10/bayonettas-new-voice-actor-jennifer-hale-issues-statement-about-bayonetta-3">statement</a>, which I appreciated, and I was able to present the facts,” Hale continues.</p>
<p>Following PlatinumGames' announcement of the new voice actor, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/10/bayonettas-og-voice-actor-asks-fans-to-boycott-third-game-after-platinumgames-wage-fallout">Taylor urged fans to boycott the game</a> due to a pay dispute. She claimed that the studio offered her only $4,000 "to do the whole game...as a flat rate". Fans rallied around Taylor initially, before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/10/a-new-bayonetta-3-report-features-a-differing-account-of-platinumgames-va-pay-offer">reports emerged</a> that Taylor had been offered that rate for between four to five sessions.</p>
<p>Hale says that “There were some things said [that were] presented as facts, but were false. I would have never taken a role otherwise. Before I accepted the audition, I checked everything thoroughly, and I trust the director."</p>

<p>"Thankfully, playing Bayonetta was so much fun, and the community was so welcoming to me, especially after the fiasco had passed and the facts came out."</p>
<p>Following Hale's initial statement, PlatnumGames came out in support of the actor, stating "We give our full support to Jennifer Hale as the new Bayonetta, and align with everything in her statement."</p>
<p>Fortunately, the controversy died down following those additional reports and Platinum's own involvement, and the experience hasn't put Hale off of the idea of returning to the role: "It was not fun getting thrown under the bus like I had, but I was happy to come out on the other side.”</p>
<p>While the drama has largely subsided, earlier this year, series creator <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/thats-some-real-coward-s-hideki-kamiya-discusses-the-fallout-from-the-bayonetta-3-voiceover-controversy">Hideki Kamiya shared his thoughts on the ordeal</a>: "Man, that was seriously lame."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-is-practically-giving-away-the-go-3-speaker-at-an-all-time-low-even-throwing-in-90-days-of-amazon-music-for-free-2000648983</link>
            <guid>1369270</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sure, you can use your phone and tablet can play music, but can any of these provide an immersive, room-filling listening experience with punchy bass and clear lows? That’s debatable. If you’re looking to enjoy bold sound on the go, grabbing a portable speaker makes sense.</p>
<p>Well, thanks to Cyber Monday, bagging one doesn’t have to cost an arm and a leg. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6131/">Right now, Amazon is offering a 25% discount on the JBL Go 3, a mini Bluetooth speaker, which drops its price down to $30</a>. It’s a modest $10 drop, and you’ll also enjoy three months of Amazon Music for absolutely free with your purchase. Even better, several color options are up for grabs for less, so there’s plenty to choose from. Maybe go with the black version if you’re looking for something basic, or pick the stunning red model up to make a statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6131/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bold, Room-Filling Sound</h2>
<p>It comes in an ultra-portable design. The speaker looks like a tiny power bank and features an integrated loop that makes it easy to carry around. Clip it onto your bag, or just slip a finger through and get going. Durability comes from its IP67 waterproof and dustproof rating, protecting the speaker from the not-so-ideal weather and environmental conditions. Take it to the beach, a picnic, by the pool, or even in the washroom; a few splashes or drops in the dirt won’t hurt it. It keeps the music going, regardless.</p>
<p>Despite the tiny size, the sound it packs is seriously impressive. You’ll enjoy the legendary JBL signature audio that’s deep and rich. It captures both the highs and the lows well, keeping distortions at bay. Punchy bass makes you feel your favorite tunes down to the bones for an even more immersive experience. Whether you’re using it to catch up on your favorite podcast or listening to the latest Imagine Dragons album, vocals come through with clarity, and every beat is heard. This also makes the speaker great for streaming your favorite shows with friends!</p>



<p>Battery-wise, you’re looking at around 5 hours of playtime on a single charge. It’s not that massive, but still decent for on-the-go sessions and at-home gatherings. Recharging is fast, too, so the speaker should be back at it in no time. Compatibility is impressive, as the JBL Go 3 works with just about any Bluetooth-enabled device, from smartphones to laptops, computers, tablets, and more. A three-month free trial of the Amazon Music Unlimited Individual Plan provides instant access to millions of songs and podcasts. You can shuffle play artists or albums, create your own playlists, download All-Access Playlists for offline jamming, and even get one free audiobook per month from Audible. The offer will be applied automatically to your account after you make your purchase successfully. You need to redeem it within 30 days. After the 90-day trial, your subscription will continue at the monthly price of $12, if you choose to keep it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6131/">All in all, now is a great time to grab the JBL Go 3 mini Bluetooth speaker. You won’t just be saving 25% on the speaker, but also get to enjoy Amazon Music for free for 90 days</a>. There are multiple color options to choose from, as well. The discount, like many other Cyber Monday deals, is going to expire tonight. If you’ve been thinking of grabbing a solid audio solution for less for yourself or to gift it to a loved one this holiday season, now is the time to make the move.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov’s TERMINAL Map Has Been Entered—Here’s How]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-terminal-map-entered/</link>
            <guid>1369267</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s mysterious new map started this morning as just that – a mystery. Now, it has been blown wide open, with one streamer being the first player in the world to gain access to Terminal. The new map was introduced with Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update, but until now, it has remained sealed.</p>



<p>In a move that was recognized by Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio powering Escape from Tarkov, TIGZ gained access to Terminal and experienced the endgame mission for the first time.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-do-you-get-into-terminal-in-tarkov">How Do You Get Into Terminal in Tarkov</h2>



<p>To gain access to Terminal in Escape from Tarkov, you first need to complete all the prerequisites, including the entire campaign chain that you’re taken along by the choices you make in the main game. Once you’ve fulfilled the required criteria, you’ll need to head to Shoreline between 22:00 and 04:00 and use the TRANSITION POINT that’s outside the Terminal gate.</p>



<p>This is the same gate you would have needed to scout very early in the game.,</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/RealTigz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RealTigz</a> I saw that! Congratz on the first Terminal run!<br>Better luck next one!</p>— Nikita Buyanov (@nikgeneburn) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1995493411688939886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>If you’ve met the criteria, you’ll transition and enter Terminal, being presented with a cutscene that kicks off the end of the game in The Ticket.</p>



<p>Your sole objective will be to head through Terminal and get to the Zubr boat, the only extraction point from Terminal, and from Tarkov as a whole. It’s a PvE environment, and a war is raging as Terminal comes under siege, forcing the player to contend with a staggering number of enemies while also having <strong>no equipment</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2632622304">TIGZ might have been the first</a> to enter Terminal, but he didn’t manage to complete the mission, as he died shortly before wrapping it up and was kicked back to the main menu.</p>



<p>It’s indicative of what Nikita said about a small portion of the player base being able to resolve the final mission in Escape from Tarkov. It’s nails, and there is an onslaught of enemies to contend with, the likes of which you’ve never seen before.</p>

<p>A new adventure has commenced with the start of Chapter 7 Season 1 in Fortnite, bringing a fresh experience to the game, but questions are circulating on whether this is the last chapter of Fortnite.</p>



<p>Considerable changes have been made with the launch of Chapter 7, including the destruction of the beloved Battle Bus, and the ongoing evolution of the Epic Games title leaves the door open for significant expansion in the future.</p>



<p>With Fortnite’s history of Chapters and Seasons now long established, questions continue to emerge on whether Chapter 7 will be the final Chapter, and Insider Gaming has collected all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-chapter-7-the-last-chapter-of-fortnite">Is Chapter 7 The Last Chapter of Fortnite?</h2>

<p><strong>There is no indication that Chapter 7 will be the final Chapter in Fortnite’s long-established schedule, though there is always the chance that Epic Games mixes it up.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite Chapters have been in place since October 2019, when the standard season approach was revamped. From then on, rather than having singular seasons like ‘Season One’, Fortnite moved into a Chapter and Season approach with the launch of Chapter 2 Season 1.</p>



<p>Since then, Epic Games has settled into an annual update in Chapters, bringing a new map, a revamped loot pool, and major gameplay changes to the scene, which have helped to keep Fortnite alive and fresh. However, as next year marks seven years since this process began, it could be revamped.</p>



<p>Even if a revamp was on the cards, Fortnite would not be disappearing. Instead, any change would just be to the approach of naming individual Seasons and Chapters, but even that is unlikely, as the current approach helps to avoid any confusion between previous seasons and ongoing ones.</p>



<p>The addition of Fortnite OG as a permanent mode has also proven to be extremely popular, and allows Epic Games to reuse old assets and bring a fresh approach to historic seasons in the past.</p>



<p>Additionally, rumors of a final chapter in Fortnite have persisted throughout the years, with similar questions asked about whether Chapter 6 would be the final Chapter.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-could-fortnite-do-in-the-future">What Could Fortnite do in The Future?</h2>



<p><strong>If Fortnite were to make a major change in the structure of Chapters, it would likely be to reference the evolution of the game away from the Battle Royale experience.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite now caters to a wide array of players, with LEGO Fortnite, Fortnite Festival, and Rocket Racing as established modes separate from Battle Royale, while the likes of Reload, Blitz, Delulu, and Fortnite OG provide a different gameplay experience. Alongside this, there’s an endless supply of creative maps offering RPGs, Tycoons, and much more.</p>



<p>The biggest aspect in the works, however, is Epic Games’ huge partnership with Disney. In February 2024, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/disney-buys-1-5-billion-stake-in-epic-games-will-create-expansive-universe-within-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1.5 billion deal was announced</a> between Disney and Epic Games, with the investment coming alongside plans to create an ‘expansive’ universe within Fortnite where various IPs are found.</p>



<p>Epic Games and Fortnite already have a wealth of experience working with Disney, with regular collabs and themed seasons taking place over the years, and this would ramp that up significantly.</p>
