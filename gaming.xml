            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/opinions/top-10-threats-in-finsters-monster-matic-cookbook<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My fellow dice goblins, the latest <em>Power Rangers</em> Essence20 RPG sourcebook, <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>, has been out for a while.</p>

<p>It is the closest thing to a full on <em>Monster Manuel</em> the Essence20 system has received so far, containing tons of interesting tokusatsu threats as well as more tailored threat creation rules for GMs.</p>

<p>And for Essence20 GMs out there, I do highly recommend this book. Not just for how it translates various fan favorite monsters to the system, as well as repurpose characters and elements seen in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/power-rangers-heroes-of-grid-review"><em>Heroes of the Grid</em></a>, but for the wellspring of inspiration those monsters' unique Perks and Powers can spark.</p>

<p>While there is plenty of creativity found in this 303 page book, ten of those threats personally stood head and shoulders over the rest.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-craterite-artwork.jpg?itok=9Ke2ctwY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-craterite-artwork.jpg?itok=3Dvqdb-P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is what happens when the holodeck fails</figcaption></figure><h2>10. The Craterites</h2>

<p>The Craterites are a somewhat obscure monster from <em>Power Rangers in Space</em>. They are essentially hardlight projections of a training program gone horribly wrong. They are also the first monster in the series to be made up of several smaller versions of itself.</p>

<p>This is reflected in their respective statblocks. A group of Craterites has a Leader among their ranks. At any point in a fight, this Leader can command the swarm to form on them and combine.</p>

<p>Once all the Craterites reach the leader, they turn into a gigantic Craterite Conglomerate.This conglomerate gets various bonuses and extra health based on how many minions make it up.</p>

<p>Not only is it a novel take on a monster of the week, it adds some new dynamics to handling minions and navigating a scene.</p>

<p>Plus, it might just inspire similar hivemind monsters at your own table.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-death-revenant-artwork.jpg?itok=FviEltSA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-death-revenant-artwork.jpg?itok=wRKypWxn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kill it with fire.</figcaption></figure><h2>9. The Death Revenants</h2>

<p>A Threat from the Boom! Studios comic continuity, the Death Revenants are reanimated dead, made to serve a dark master like the Death Ranger or Necrolai.</p>

<p>They are also the perfect template for having zombies in your campaign. With some reflavoring, they are perfect cannon fodder for Halloween or horror-themed one-shot adventures.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-rinshi-warrior-artwork.jpg?itok=pdVhzr7t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-rinshi-warrior-artwork.jpg?itok=sl-eF6QQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It might turn into a toad monster or a scorpion. Really.</figcaption></figure><h2>8. The Rinshi Warriors</h2>

<p>The elite footsoldiers of Dai Shi from <em>Power Rangers Jungle Fury</em>, the Rinshi Warriors are another minion with a really novel spin.</p>

<p>In addition to a Perk that gives them Edge against targets suffering certain conditions, the Rinshi Warriors can transform into a different Threat once they hit a certain amount of health.</p>

<p>These different forms are also in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>. There is even a handy chart for GMs to roll.</p>

<p>And with some extra work, it's a wonderful framework for GMs that want to spice up late game encounters against minions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-blobgoblin-artwork.jpg?itok=13sBSOYx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-blobgoblin-artwork.jpg?itok=dwXx_SeR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>My favorite kind of monster. Silly looking but secretly dangerous.</figcaption></figure><h2>7. Blobgoblin</h2>

<p>Blobgoblin is a great early threat for GMs that want to lean more into playful mischief. His whole gimmick isn't being a direct powerhouse, but being an amorphous blob that can take over electronics, vehicles, and even Zords if given enough time. Like a superhero take on <em>Poltergeist</em>.</p>

<p>It's just the right level of impish and fun that can spice up any table.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-dramole-artwork.jpg?itok=M7cGnPPf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-dramole-artwork.jpg?itok=jfHO66cX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He has a perk called Surprise. Guess why?</figcaption></figure><h2>6. Dramole</h2>

<p>Dramole is a classic <em>Mighty Morphin'</em> monster, one that is great to throw at early to mid game players that might lean too hard on combat stats.</p>

<p>Not only can Dramole burrow through the ground and turn out the lights, he has various attacks and powers that target Willpower Defense. Those same attacks and powers can mesmerize or disorient the team, forcing them to rethink their battle strategy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-gravezord.jpg?itok=t2yqBtSG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-gravezord.jpg?itok=8xrvJlu- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What happens when the villains repurpose destroyed Zords?</figcaption></figure><h2>5. The Gravezord</h2>

<p>Another Boom! Studios original, the Gravezord is exactly what it sounds like. A Frankenstein's monster of various Zord parts cobbled together into a war machine.</p>

<p>Not only is it a powerful mid game threat, it is the perfect template for an evil mech piloted by the bad guys. High defense, solid damage, and it even has some creative hang-ups to help players think outside the box.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-kamdor-artwork.jpg?itok=s84hqH9J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-kamdor-artwork.jpg?itok=eyoaiuCA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He'll honor a one on one duel, but treat you like a dog.</figcaption></figure><h2>4. Kamdor, Master of Miratrix</h2>

<p><em>Operation Overdrive's</em> Kamdor is a peak example of the “dark knight” monster in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>. An extremely powerful general to the big bad that is characterized by some sort of warrior code of honor.</p>

<p>This nobility can add a lot of character to the usual menagerie of mindless monsters and maniacal despots.</p>

<p>Plus, his Hang-Ups give him just the right level of arrogance to make him novel to face. Whether you use him as is or as a template, Kamdor is a standout.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-lord-drakkon.jpg?itok=c_sLjpfS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-lord-drakkon.jpg?itok=glt5EnqK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The face of a man that lead a war against multiple dimensions</figcaption></figure><h2>3. Lord Drakkon and His Forces</h2>

<p>Taking number three in this list is the iconic Lord Drakkon from the Boom! Studios comic crossover event, <em>Shattered Grid</em>.</p>

<p>As an endgame Threat, Drakkon is a beast. Not only does he have defenses over 20 across the board, he is more than capable of downing an entire team with just a few attacks.</p>

<p>On top of that, he has his own Personal Power pool, allowing him to mind control teammates and even shut down characters from using their own Personal Power pools.</p>

<p>But Lord Drakkon isn't alone in this book. Every one of his generals and soldiers are also in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>. The Ranger Slayer, Black Dragon, nine different types of Ranger Sentry, and even some of his war zords all have statblocks.</p>

<p>And since Drakkon is an interdimensional threat, this means you could have his attempt to conquer the world the focus of an entire campaign arc. It's all here, in this book, ready to go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-rita-repulsa-artwork.jpg?itok=zfmud7ov 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-rita-repulsa-artwork.jpg?itok=mUSnQ03B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What spell is she conjuring now? Seriously, I don't know.</figcaption></figure><h2>2. Rita Repulsa &amp; Lord Zedd</h2>

<p>The absence of the most iconic evil power couple in the franchise from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/power-rangers-roleplaying-game-review"><em>Power Rangers Core Rulebook</em></a> has finally been corrected in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>. And it was worth the wait.</p>

<p>What makes both of them the stuff of legend as endgame Threats are how they showcase this supplement's brand new Sorcerous Magic system. This point-buy system lets you make surprisingly tailored spells, powers, and attacks with the trade-off of some skill tests costing the caster some health.</p>

<p>Rita and Zedd embody this magical cruelty. Massive area of effect blasts. Ongoing auras that inflict conditions and sap Personal Power. And, of course, the ability to instantly make themselves or an ally grow to gigantic size and escalate the battle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-finster-and-psycho-rangers.jpg?itok=5lqBTsWZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/finsters-monster-matic-cookbook-finster-and-psycho-rangers.jpg?itok=p4FQJiWD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Let's see, how can I make them more bloodthirsty?</figcaption></figure><h2>1. The Psycho Rangers</h2>

<p>If you are familiar with the Essence20 supplements released for <em>Power Rangers</em> so far, The Psycho Rangers appearing in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em> might surprise you.</p>

<p>The Psycho Rangers already have statblocks. They were introduced in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/power-rangers-across-stars-review"><em>Across The Stars</em></a> supplement. In fact, those statblocks were perfect in portraying them in the game.</p>

<p>Well, in <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em>, there are rules for making your own Psycho Rangers. All six Psychos have their own Player Roles in this book, all themed around different forms of antisocial or psychotic behavior.</p>

<p>Not only are these rules great for making darker, alternative ranger PCs, it is also a great way to make bespoke GM-controlled PCs as Threats. Want a dark counterpart to the group's outgoing extrovert? The Path of Stone's emotionally dead bruiser is right there. Want to contrast with the empathic caregiver in the group? The Path of Cruelty's sadistic streak works just fine.</p>

<p>The new Psycho Ranger Roles are one of the biggest additions <em>Finster's Monster-Matic Cookbook</em> brings to the game, giving not just the GM options for threats, but players options to embrace their dark side as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24167967/life-eater-strange-scaffold-stalking-horror-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="EVofsr">Most games’ protagonists are heroes, gunning down bad guys or trying to save the princess. You could argue the protagonist of <em>Life Eater</em> is kind of like a hero. Sure, he stalks people relentlessly before murdering them in the service of a dark god. But if he didn’t do that, the world would end. So really, when you think about it, this is a noble mission — and by enacting Zimforth’s will, I’m saving the world.</p>
<p id="3Z41vf"><em>Life Eater</em> is a weird little game that is unlike anything I’ve ever played before. When I first played it upon its release in April, I noticed the striking visuals and audio effects, and the short cutscenes between campaign chapters sent chills down my spine, but I found the actual meat and potatoes of the game to be fairly minimal. </p>
<p id="wicyLB">Here’s how it works: I get presented with targets, each of whom has their own schedule. Each victim’s personal timetable starts out blank; I have to uncover the details of my victim’s life by poking and prodding at them. For instance, I can discover that my target has breakfast at around 9 a.m. by leisurely rattling their doorknob and then scampering away. Hacking into their computer gives me a hint as to their weekend habits, and hiding in the bushes is a good way to learn whether they commute or not. It’s only when I truly understand the victim and their schedule that I can strike, sacrificing them in the dark to buy our world another year of peace.</p>

<p id="IQOP9N">At first, I bounced off <em>Life Eater</em> hard. The ending ritual to sacrifice the victim would always be the same — remove <em>this</em> organ if they have a commute, and break <em>this</em> rib if they slept a certain number of hours per day. It took a lot of the joy out of poring over a victim’s life, because I always knew the exact facts I needed to gather, so I had little curiosity to do anything else. The campaign also introduces multiple targets early on, but some of them are innocent and must not be touched. I had a hard time ascertaining which person was the “right” sacrifice, and eventually I grew frustrated with the game and put it down, thinking it was ambitious and admirable but not for me.</p>
<p id="EIVmjr">A recent update from developer Strange Scaffold has changed things. The ending sacrifice is now much more varied, and now I want to go into the ritual with as much information as I can possibly glean. Furthermore, a new Endless Mode has been added to the game, and I found this to be a good way to practice my stalking skills. After a few rounds of Endless Mode, I felt like I could tackle the campaign, and the narrative weight of the story finally got its claws into me. </p>

<p id="LGqixG">The trick to <em>Life Eater</em> is that every action takes time, which is a finite resource, of course. Furthermore, a failed action raises suspicion — if I try to break into someone’s house and they catch me, I’m at risk of being discovered and possibly stopped by the police. I can ease suspicion by doing any number of non-stalker actions, like going to work, sleeping, or socializing… but that burns into my time, and if the clock hits zero without me performing the necessary sacrifice(s), the world ends.</p>
<p id="Lgu4rq">The minimal style of the game pays dividends here, because each one of the procedurally generated victims can end up being relatively complex. The game never straight up <em>tells</em> you if someone lives alone — but I can review the information I’ve uncovered and see the blocks of time where the victim is alone and figure out whether they have company at any given hour of the day. And sometimes I find some truly grisly secrets, like a Saturday ritual where my target goes to the woods to drink blood with their buddies. It’s a game that actually makes me <em>feel</em> like a stalker, which is a truly novel horror experience. </p>

<p>While initial plans placed Marvel Rivals firmly in the PC camp, it appears that’s about to change with an upcoming announcement. The word around town is that Marvel Rivals is coming to consoles, including PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. So, when can we play Marvel Rivals on Xbox?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-rivals-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Marvel Rivals on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>Following various leaks on social media and mysterious code appearing on the game’s official website, it seems Marvel Rivals on Xbox Series X|S isn’t a pipedream. It’s happening; it’s just a matter of when.</p>



<p>Throughout the next few weeks, we have numerous upcoming gaming events, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-playstation-showcase-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-xbox-showcase-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. These events, along with Summer Game Fest, would provide the perfect stage for developer NetEase Games to announce console versions of Marvel Rivals. </p>







<h2 id="h-does-marvel-rivals-support-cross-platform-play">Does Marvel Rivals Support Cross-Platform Play?</h2>



<p>While we’re pretty sure of the upcoming console versions of Marvel Rivals, there’s no official word from the developer yet. As such, there is no official cross-platform support for Marvel Rivals, but it’s coming. There’s code within the PC version indicating crossplay and cross-platform functionality between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Since the basis is already in place, this functionality will likely become activated when the game officially launches on all three systems. In this case, I don’t suspect we’ll have to wait for a post-launch update.</p>

<p>It’s always fun to see a highly anticipated title expand its reach. Previously, developer NetEase Games planned Marvel Rivals as a PC-only title. But that’s changing. There’s new information surrounding the hero-based shooter that points towards a console release. So, is Marvel Rivals on PS5? Is it coming soon?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marvel-rivals-on-ps5">Can You Play Marvel Rivals on PS5?</h2>



<p>While you can’t play Marvel Rivals on PS5 yet, it’s happening. A recent code revealed on the game’s website indicates the superhero shooter is coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S alongside the PC version. </p>



<p>Anyone on a console who was hoping for a chance to rampage through an arena as Hulk or Iron Man will soon have their chance. However, there is no console release date for Marvel Rivals. With so many upcoming events, like the PlayStation State of Play and Summer Game Fest, we’ll likely see a reveal soon enough, though!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-crossplay">Is Marvel Rivals Crossplay?</h2>



<p>While Marvel Rivals isn’t yet available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, supposedly, code within the current build indicates full crossplay infrastructure is ready for launch day.</p>



<p>However, whether or not we’ll see some restrictions in place remains to be seen. It’s not uncommon for a game to offer cross-platform or crossplay support but lock the feature to PC and Xbox Series X|S, like with No Man’s Sky. But if Marvel Rivals features genuine crossplay support, we’ll see lobbies full of superheroes across all supported systems.</p>



<p>Let’s hope the studio can balance heroes well enough to prevent any one system from having an unfair advantage!</p>

The first is a documentary created by award-winning Canadian filmmaker Rob McCallum, and the second is a scripted drama series about the life and storied career of video gaming's original rock star.</p><p>Naomi Harvey, executive producer of both projects under her Golden Possum Productions banner, said, "John's story is incredibly powerful—not just the part about the revolutionary games he created, but his profound impact on those around him. His story is one of triumph over trauma, filled with compassion and inspiration."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's an unbelievable rock n' roll,&nbsp;boundary-shattering,&nbsp;thrill ride.</p></div><p>McCallum added: "Romero's journey is the missing antidote for all of us misfit toys looking for hope and kindred spirits in the darkness of the world. It's an unbelievable rock n' roll, boundary-shattering, thrill ride grounded in humanity, integrity, patience, and clever chess moves slathered in innocence, tenacity and pure coolness."</p><p>Romero is considered by many as the godfather of the first-person shooter, having co-founded id Software and designed their early games, popularizing the genre. He was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/john-romero-mabel-addis-game-developers-choice-awards-2023">honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award</a> at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in 2023 for his outstanding contribution to the video game industry.</p><p>His autobiography, published in July 2023, chronicles a "difficult childhood and storied career, beginning with his early days submitting Apple II game code to computer magazines and sneaking computers out the back door of his day job to write code at night," according to the book's blurb, which calls it an "inspiring" tale.</p><p>"Talking with both Rob [McCallum] and Naomi [Harvey], I knew they were the perfect team to bring Doom Guy to life," Romero said of the adaptations. "Our backgrounds and aspirations have uncanny similarities, and I trust them to tell the story."</p><p><em>Adele Ankers-Range is a freelance entertainment writer for IGN.

Zero</u></a>. Much like <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-official-master-and-apprentice-trailer"><u>past themed character trailers</u></a>, this one centered on the mega-popular shonen series’ smorgasbord of fusion characters. </p><p>First up is Goku and Vegeta’s rambunctious Saiyan kids, Goten and Trunks. The pair premiered in Dragon Ball Z’s Buu arc, where the pair fused, forming the formidable Gotenks. Unlike most Saiyans, their move set is pretty unorthodox.</p><p>Key among them is the Super Donut, an ability that turns enemies into a volleyball, and Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack, which, as its name suggests, spews explosive ghost clones from their mouth.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Kale and Caulifla, Saiyans from Universe 6, were first introduced in the Tournament of Power arc in Dragon Ball Super. Caulifa serves as the de facto Saiyan leader of Universe 6 whereas Kale, for all intents and purposes, exists as Universe 6’s Broly.</p><p>Unlike Goku and company, Kale and Caulifla quickly mastered transforming into Super Saiyans. Their fusion, Kefla, also exists as one of the strongest fusions in the series, putting Goku on the backfoot until he unlocked his newly minted Ultra Instinct form.</p><p>Moving right along are Gogeta and Vegito, two fusion forms of Goku and Vegeta using the fusion dance and potara earrings, respectively. Keeping in spirit with the energy of Dragon Ball Z fandom debates, the trailer leaned into the discourse over which Saiyan combo is the best—going so far as to have Vegito trash talk Gogeta’s fusion dance poses—before cutting away from their beam struggle.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/30/thumbnail-fourth-character-revea-1717083231223.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Sparking! Zero's roster is filling up.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Fused Zamazu, a villainous potara fusion between Goku Black and Zamasu in Dragon Ball Super, also got some play in today’s fusion-centric trailer. </p><p>Sparking! Zero's roster has now increased to a whopping 82 characters, though most of the roster is occupied by a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goes-super-saiyan-heavy-with-reveal-of-first-24-characters">swarm of Goku and Vegetas in various Super Saiyan forms</a>.</p><p>Based on Bandai Namco’s trend of releasing character trailers a month apart, we’re likely to receive yet another character trailer sometime toward the end of June 2024. WheneverDragon Ball: Sparking! Zero gets around to revealing its officiial release date, players can look forward to its inevitable launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. </p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

  <p id="mBjVTl">Let’s face it: A lot of sports movies, especially the most famous ones, are pretty bad. Often corny, schlocky, and with only a mediocre understanding of the sports they depict at best, sports-loving movie audiences have long been disappointed by adaptations of the games they love on the big screen.</p>
<p id="zWREi3">That’s why we’re here — to separate the wheat from the chaff and hone in on the sports movies that are actually good. </p>
<p id="Cnhiib">Here are some sports movies we quite like, and we hope you do as well. They are organized by sport. Our latest update added <em>Bull Durham</em>, <em>Challengers</em>, <em>Ferrari</em>, <em>The French</em>, <em>O.J.: Made in America</em>, <em>Rocky</em>, and <em>Throw Down</em>.</p>

<p id="YzQUtF"><strong>The sport:</strong> Baseball, or rather, baseball statistics</p>
<p id="QDOVem"><strong>The movie:</strong> Adapted from a nonfiction book, this low-key but compelling real-life baseball drama from 2011 tells the story of manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and his attempt to turn around the struggling Oakland Athletics team. Beane goes against the headwinds of the sport (as you must do in all sports movies) by disregarding the received wisdom of scouting and assembling a team of overlooked players based on statistical analysis compiled by the nerdy Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). </p>
<p id="KGVRlm"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> This is perhaps the only sports drama where the bean-counter is the hero, which gives it novelty value. The topic sounds dry, and it kind of is, but master screenwriters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin know just how to spell it out and sell it, the filmmaking craft is impeccable, and you get treated to a supporting turn from the legendary Philip Seymour Hoffman. Bizarrely, there’s also a cameo from former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, who plays the team’s owner. —<em>Oli Welsh</em></p>

<p id="jwzK8u"><strong>The sport:</strong> Basketball</p>
<p id="oxfUnm"><strong>The movie:</strong> Steven Soderbergh’s second movie shot on an iPhone (after <em>Unsane</em>), <em>High Flying Bird </em>follows sports agent Ray Burke (André Holland), who looks to fight back against some of the power imbalances in sport by finding an opportunity for a rookie client (Melvin Gregg) during a labor dispute.</p>
<p id="gmY9fl"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> <em>High Flying Bird </em>digs into some of the complicated dynamics on the business side of sports, and Soderbergh’s iPhone direction is paired well with a sharp script from Tarell Alvin McCraney (<em>Moonlight</em>) and a magnetic lead performance by Holland. <em>—PV</em></p>

<p id="xPJaNE"><strong>The sport:</strong> Boxing</p>
<p id="1mBdMw"><strong>The movie:</strong> A 1980 biography of Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro), a champion middleweight boxer of the 1940s and ’50s. Adapted from LaMotta’s own memoir, <em>Raging Bull </em>takes the viewer on a brutalizing tour through his sporting and private life. It spares us neither the savagery of the ring nor the dysfunction and violence at home, and shows LaMotta both in his prime and in a sad, post-boxing life.</p>
<p id="fmRw7o"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> Because, <a href="https://www.afi.com/afis-100-years-100-movies-10th-anniversary-edition/">according to the American Film Institute</a>, it’s the fourth-greatest American film of all time. Because it’s one of De Niro’s greatest performances, with a terrifying physicality. Because it’s a searing, tragic deconstruction of toxic masculinity. And because Scorsese’s filmmaking, powered by Michael Chapman’s black-and-white photography and Thelma Schoonmaker’s impressionistic editing, reaches a delirious intensity that will take your breath away, especially in the dumbfounding boxing scenes. —<em>OW</em></p>

<p id="rIPvtF"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> It’s <em>Rocky</em>! No list of sports movies would be complete without it — it’s one of the main reasons underdog stories are so popular in the genre. Yes, it’s schmaltzy, but that’s the charm of the movie. Sylvester Stallone is among the most earnest pop artists of the 20th century, and nowhere is that clearer than in <em>Rocky</em>. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="Qxvr6p"><strong>The sport:</strong> Football</p>
<p id="TnaRuL"><strong>The movie:</strong> Harold Lloyd’s classic 1925 comedy follows his fresh-faced new student Harold Lamb, who wants nothing more than to be cool. How do you be cool? A great question that has baffled scientists for millennia. For Harold, however, the answer was joining the football team.</p>
<p id="uCL6NW"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> A hilarious movie filled with some gags that don’t translate to the modern day and some that truly do (there’s a whistle-based gag in the football game that could still very much happen in real life), <em>The Freshman </em>is an early example of a sports movie and a standout movie from one of silent cinema’s great comedians. <em>—PV</em></p>

<p id="B8gmom"><strong>The sport:</strong> Motorsport</p>
<p id="w0WoYI"><strong>The movie:</strong> Michael Mann takes on the legacy of Enzo Ferrari (Adam Driver), the founder of the luxury car brand and racing team and more than a bit of an asshole. The movie charts his later years as he deals with his struggling race team, hiding his secret second family from his wife, and public scrutiny.</p>
<p id="R0dbm9"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> An exemplary anti-great man biopic, <em>Ferrari </em>was one of my favorite movies of 2023. It’s a terrific character study led by incredible leading performances by Driver and Penélope Cruz (the biggest Oscar snub of the year, in my humble opinion). Also, it’s a Michael Mann movie, so you know the action sequences are excellent (in this case, the racing sequences).<em>—PV</em></p>

<p id="lbeMez"><strong>The sport:</strong> Formula One</p>
<p id="eHpuoB"><strong>The movie:</strong> Ron Howard’s <em>Rush </em>brings to life one of the great rivalries in Formula One history, showing the battle between playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and disciplined racing mastermind Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) for the 1976 World Championship.</p>
<p id="oQiQ1l"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> Hemsworth and Brühl are pitch perfect in their respective roles, and the racing scenes are terrific. Few movies better get across the kind of distinct personalities that exist within the sporting world, and what happens when they clash. <em>—PV</em></p>

<p id="P5ZdAk"><strong>The sport:</strong> Judo</p>
<p id="bctgqI"><strong>The movie:</strong> Three people in the Hong Kong nightlife — a singer (Cherrie Ying), a former judo champion who runs a bar (Louis Koo), and an aspiring judoka who wants to take on anyone he can (Aaron Kwok) — intertwine in a powerful and touching movie about friendship and the search for the self.</p>
<p id="Tw3nbk"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> It only makes sense to follow up <em>Sanshiro Sugata </em>with <em>Throw Down</em> — Johnnie To dedicated the movie to Kurosawa, and while it’s not a remake, there are many similarities between the two. It’s a gorgeous, sentimental martial arts movie directed by one of the very best in the business. <em>—PV</em></p>

<p id="4jvnDt"><strong>The sport:</strong> Tennis</p>
<p id="wUy1SQ"><strong>The movie:</strong> Three youth tennis stars (Josh O’Connor, Mike Faist, and Zendaya) find themselves in a love triangle that mixes personal feelings and competitive spirit. After an injury sidelines the most promising of the three, it seems the relationship drama sorts itself out. But when the trio run into each other on the competitive circuit years later, it seems old rivalries and passions are still just as hot as ever.</p>
<p id="7RNDe6"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> Sports, at their very best, are really just a vehicle for drama, and <em>Challengers </em>understands that perfectly. The movie is framed around one central tennis match, the championship at a tiny, meaningless tournament, which we cut back and forth to between intersections of tense romantic drama. The tennis in this movie is shot the way other movies might approach a fistfight: It’s violent, kinetic, and personal, and every single hit has an emotional winner. All this makes both the tennis and the romance hit harder each time they come back up, leading to an inevitable conclusion that feels absolutely perfect. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="IXuxVi"><strong>The sport: </strong>Tennis</p>
<p id="IZWhrr"><strong>The movie: </strong>William Klein’s cinéma vérité documentary about the 1981 French Open had unprecedented access from the French Tennis Federation, allowing Klein to get behind the scenes with one of the most fascinating periods in tennis history. It’s a favorite of Wes Anderson’s, who presented the movie at the Metrograph.</p>
<p id="R7oyRh"><strong>Why you should watch: </strong>The movie is filled with intimate looks at the fascinating stars of that era — Björn Borg, John McEnroe, Yannick Noah, Chris Evert — and is a completely immersive portrait of a grand sporting event. Klein spends as much time embedding you in the sights and sounds of the crowd as he does in the tennis matches themselves, and the result is one of the greatest sports documentaries ever made. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="tCpB86"><strong>The sport:</strong> Ice hockey</p>
<p id="eQxvVH"><strong>The movie:</strong> Many sports have specialized roles, but hockey is unique — many teams have enforcers, aka “goons,” who are basically there to strategically get into fights with opposing players. <em>Goon </em>tells the story of one such enforcer, Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott), a very sweet but not very bright young man who gets signed by a team after attending a game as a fan and winning a fight against a homophobic player who climbed into the stands. The movie is based on the book <em>Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey into Minor League Hockey</em>, written by Adam Frattasio and Doug Smith (who the Glatt character is based on).</p>
<p id="ldjSEe"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> Scott’s affecting performance brings a lot of heart to what could have otherwise been a pretty flat character, and <em>Goon </em>hits a great balance of sports comedy and sports drama. <em>—PV</em></p>

<p id="aEqRX6"><strong>The sport:</strong> Figure skating</p>
<p id="ogHsFT"><strong>The movie:</strong> 2017’s <em>I, Tonya</em> tells the true — and at the time, notorious — story of Tonya Harding, an ice skating prodigy from the wrong side of the tracks who became a tabloid sensation when she was implicated in a physical assault on her rival Nancy Kerrigan in the lead-up to the 1994 Winter Olympics.</p>
<p id="uugVEN"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> Director Craig Gillespie walks a tonal tightrope in <em>I, Tonya</em>, blending biopic, mockumentary, tabloid sauce, broad comedy, and <em>Fargo</em>-esque crime satire and threading it through with clearly unreliable narration from Harding (a fantastic Margot Robbie). It’s a fun, wild ride, but it’s secretly dead serious and compassionate about the fact that white trash like Harding, surrounded by idiots and snobs and bullied by her single mom (Allison Janney, also great), never had a chance in the first place. —<em>Oli Welsh</em></p>

<p id="yb2wHM"><strong>The movie:</strong> In 1893, a small Indian village is being exploited and mistreated by a British army captain, who raises taxes on them in the midst of a drought. When the villagers organize a protest, the captain challenges them to a game of high-stakes cricket to solve the dispute.</p>

<p id="IBiJE7"><strong>The sport:</strong> Soccer and Shaolin kung fu</p>
<p id="2jhxMc"><strong>The movie:</strong> Stephen Chow directs and stars in his 2001 Hong Kong sports comedy as a itinerant shaolin kung fu student who, after crossing paths with a disgraced ex-soccer player (Ng Man-tat), reconciles with his former fellow students to compete in a soccer tournament and spread the good word of Shaolin kung fu. The team eventually face off with Team Evil, a rival soccer team with their own formidable abilities, in an explosive, climactic match for the championship. —<em>Toussaint Egan</em></p>
<p id="I8qBo8"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> Chow is a master of over-the-top theatrics, slapstick physical humor, and fist-pumping action. It’s nearly impossible to go five minutes throughout its one-and-a-half-hour run time without being struck by a moment of ingenious non-sequitur comedy, be it impromptu Shaolin-themed karaoke cabaret, hilarious sight gags, or exhilarating action scenes. <em>Shaolin Soccer</em> marries the thrill of watching an underdog sports drama with the unrestrained frivolity and anything-goes chaos of a Looney Tunes cartoon.</p>

<p id="0OMIti"><strong>The sport:</strong> Ballroom dancing</p>
<p id="3bdrw0"><strong>The movie:</strong> Scott (Paul Mercurio) is the son of a ballroom dancing family and has been training for glory on the Australian scene since he was 6, but his flashy improvisations get the better of him, and he loses his partner. Shy Fran (Tara Morice) offers to replace her, and together they find something special — but the despotic conservatism of local ballroom impresario Barry Fife (Bill Hunter) stands in the way of their self-expression.</p>
<p id="7gJuaR"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> Baz Luhrmann’s 1992 debut film is a dazzling, full-hearted crowd-pleaser, somehow blending the grotesque countercultural stylings of John Waters with classical upbeat sports drama and sequined pop spectacle. Luhrmann’s fairy dust turns caricatures into real people and finds the glamour in the disreputable, poor, and weird fringes of Australian society — and, of course, the dancing rules. —<em>OW</em></p>

<p id="WOh7J1"><strong>The sport:</strong> Professional wrestling</p>
<p id="ARNuxE"><strong>The movie:</strong> A bittersweet 2008 tale of washed-up wrestler Randy “The Ram” Robinson (Mickey Rourke), who’s well past his hair-metal 1980s heyday but still wrestling in small promotions on the weekends while he scrabbles out a lonely trailer-park life. He courts a stripper called Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), seeks reconnection with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood), and contemplates one last big match-up with his old nemesis, The Ayatollah, before his body fails him completely.</p>
<p id="Z2WtJq"><strong>Why you should watch:</strong> <em>The Wrestler </em>is a shabby, tender, and uncharacteristically naturalistic film from director Darren Aronofsky (<em>Requiem for a Dream, Mother!</em>). The reason to watch it is Mickey Rourke, himself an ’80s heartthrob who went off the rails, who’s poignantly cast as the “broken-down piece of meat” Randy. It’s a moving performance that takes the film to places you both do and don’t expect, right up to its moving yet ambivalent final frames. —<em>OW </em></p>

<p data-characters="323" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">For as long as I can remember, I’ve been a fan of <em>Doctor Who</em>. It was a staple of Saturday nights growing up, when I’d be on the edge of my seat taking in old reruns, and I have been watching the latest generation since it began in 2005. However, season 14 feels alien, and not in the usual <em>Doctor Who</em> kind of way.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">It’s not because of Ncuti Gatwa or Millie Gibson, that much I can be certain of. They are both undeniably talented actors in their own right, and they’re doing the best they can with what they’ve been given. Even in “73 Yards,” Gibson shines in her role as a companion who has lost their Doctor and must face strange goings on alone.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">It’s not because I’m in the UK and forced to wait until midnight to see a new episode either, although I definitely felt a little put out when that was first revealed to be the case. Like most <em>Doctor Who</em> fans here in the UK, I adapted to watch the latest episode with breakfast every Saturday while avoiding social media, for fear of spoilers from those who got to see it before me.</p> <h2 id="h-keeping-the-pace" data-injectable="false">Keeping the pace</h2> <p data-characters="527" data-current-count="913" data-injectable="true">The first, and possibly most damaging reason that season fourteen feels strange is the pacing. Historically, <em>Doctor Who</em> has had between 12 to 14 episodes per season, not including Christmas or other specials, with an average run time per episode of around 50 minutes. Season 14, and I’m unsure who thought this would be a good idea, has been cut down to 8 episodes. Where we’d usually be barely over a quarter of the way through a season by this point, we’re now halfway through, and not much has actually happened.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">Some things in <em>Doctor Who</em> are bound to change. There’s been a constant turnover of showrunners and we are, of course, on the fifteenth iteration of the Doctor (as long as you don’t count the outliers like the Fugitive Doctor or Doctor Donna), so viewers are absolutely used to change. What we aren’t used to is the Doctor seeming so unlike himself, and the major overarching story feeling overlooked in favor of standalone tales which don’t add to anything in the grand scheme.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">Why isn’t the Doctor acting like himself? His Sonic device appears to have been forgotten, feeling like just a weight in his pocket at this point. Across the four episodes of this season so far, we’ve seen it used twice – once in “Space Babies” to recalibrate the ship, and again in “The Devil’s Chord” to seemingly mute Maestro’s tuning fork.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="651" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true">It was nowhere to be seen when the Doctor sprinted onto an unknown, war-torn planet, not even to scan the surroundings for danger, and it didn’t even seem like a fleeting thought when he was trapped on a landmine. It’s not as if he had to use it himself, which would make sense considering how sensitive the landmine was to the smallest of changes. We’ve seen former companions use the Sonic Screwdriver, such as when Dan used it to bring the train to a halt in “The Power of the Doctor.” On top of this, I don’t even remember what the inside of the TARDIS looks like at this point, because we only ever get to see the doors.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">My second gripe, which I already know will prove to upset some people, is the writing. I know that both Russell T Davies and Steven Moffat have become synonymous with <em>Doctor Who</em> at this point and, in the past, I have loved their writing. Moffat is responsible for the Weeping Angels and Russell T Davies was showrunner during the David Tennant era of the Doctor. However, I’m wondering what his plan is here.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-finding-a-bearing" data-injectable="false">Finding a bearing</h2> <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="824" data-injectable="true">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/dot-and-bubble-doctor-who-first-look-newsupdate/">Radio Times</a>, Davies described “Dot and Bubble,” the next episode set to be released on May 31, as the “most Black Mirror-like episode yet.” However, he goes on to say that it is still quintessentially Doctor Who, his comment worries me. Black Mirror is an anthology series, consisting of entirely separated stories with little overarching plot to explain. If Davies draws inspiration from the well of Charlie Brooker, that may explain why things feel a little disjointed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">My thoughts are echoed by the viewing figures for this season. I only have the statistics for UK viewers, either live on BBC One or through BBC iPlayer to go off, but currently the most viewed episode of the season, “Space Babies,” had 4.01 million viewers. This number is steadily declining and, when compared with the 7.49 million viewers who tuned in for “The Church on Ruby Road,” it’s a worrying trend even without comparing to previous seasons.</p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Without any resolution, fans have begun to look for answers in the strangest of places. There are dozens of fan theories out there and, admittedly, a lot of them would make sense. One theory suggests that Ruby may be the <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGe4tTLre/">daughter of River Song</a>. Another suggests that the Doctor is actually <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@punishedvenomcasey/video/7369637307193888043?_r=1&amp;_t=8mixvv6k46M">part of the Pantheon</a>, alongside The Toymaker and Maestro. At first glance these seem like whacky theories, but fans are clinging to them, desperate for any kind of answers.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="762" data-injectable="true">You might be asking yourself why I’m still watching if I’m not enjoying the current season. Honestly? I’ve asked myself the same question and the answer is 75% hope, 25% sunk cost fallacy. I’m clinging to the possibility of things coming together, though I’m expecting to have to wait until the Christmas special for any kind of resolution, with Ruby being a Christmas baby. Besides, if I give up now, the answers might come and I’ll miss them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">On top of everything, I’m hoping that I’m wrong. I would love for this article to be entirely irrelevant in three weeks time, with questions having been answered and loose ends tied up. I want the story to progress to a point where things start to make sense. The one thing we do know about the overarching story is the involvement of the Pantheon of Discord, which is where a lot of my hope is coming from.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via BBC</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true">The Pantheon has four currently known members – Toymaker, Maestro, The Trickster, and Hecuba. The Toymaker plays games, Maestro messes with music, The Trickster can bend reality, and Hecuba can bend time at will. All of these characters, together, could provide the answers to so many questions that are currently left without resolution. </p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Without that, though, I fear that <em>Doctor Who</em> will end the same way that Space Babies did – flying off into space as a giant fart that viewers can’t wait to forget.&nbsp;I’m waiting for the twist at the end, and I really hope it proves me wrong.</p>

<p data-characters="279" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em> is an RPG-lite. It includes leveling, but each time you hit a new level, you are given the choice of three stats to upgrade. That’s still quite the commitment with huge consequences. So, which ones should you pick for maximum efficiency?</p> <p data-characters="33" data-current-count="33" data-injectable="false">For clarity, the three stats are:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="153" data-injectable="false"> <li>HP: Health points for how much damage you can take.</li> <li>FP: Flower points used for abilities</li> <li>BP: Badge points used for equipping badges.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="81" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">FP and HP rise 5 points, while BP rises 3 points when selected during a level-up.</p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">For obvious reasons, you need FP. Unless you are just going to keep on downing honey to use your skills, you’ll want some sort of stockpile. You might think that HP is also important, but probably not as much as you think. That’s because, in truth, <strong>BP gives you the most flexibility</strong>.</p>
 <p data-characters="404" data-current-count="404" data-injectable="true">Backing up for a moment, the first three times you level up, you don’t have many options for badges. The most helpful ones come a little bit later in the game. An early investment in BP isn’t the worst idea, but it would be better spent elsewhere. To be more specific, <strong>I’d advise spending one or two levels upgrading your FP</strong>. The amount you start with doesn’t allow for the use of many abilities.</p>
 <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">However, once you get up there in levels, BP is the best place to focus your points. Keep in mind that your attack power and skills don’t increase with each level. Beyond getting new shoes and an updated hammer, <strong>badges are the only way to increase your damage output</strong>. It’s also the best way to improve your defense. You can even double-up badges to further increase their effectiveness. You can also get more badges by using Ms. Mowz to steal them from enemies who are holding items in battle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">While badges are important, you probably don’t want to entirely neglect your HP and FP. Some players recommend doing an alternating pattern of HP, BP, FP, BP, HP, BP, and so on. However, <strong>I found that once I hit around 25 or 30 points in HP and FP, that was enough for most of the game</strong>. Everything else I mostly put into BP.</p> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">Then, it’s a matter of finding the best badges and equipping them. There are plenty of both attack and defense badges (Power Plus and Defend Plus), and you can stack ability badges on top of each other to increase their strength. The important thing is that you have enough Badge Points to hold them, so that’s why investing in BP is so useful. It lets you adapt more readily.</p>
 <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="false">If you find your build isn’t working well (or if you discovered this guide several levels in and it makes sense to you), then you can <strong>talk to Chet Rippo after Chapter 5 to re-allocate your points</strong>. He’s found beneath Rogueport. Take the pipe down from in front of Professor Frankly’s house and use Bobbery to blow open the cracked wall. Go down that pipe and talk to Chet Rippo. He’ll reallocate points for 39 coins each.</p>

            <p>Bethesda's Todd Howard has called Fallout's recent renaissance "beyond anything [he's] ever seen in [his] 30 years of doing this".</p>
<p>This renewed interest in the series all came about thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-the-essence-of-fallout-and-does-the-tv-show-live-up-to-it">Amazon's Fallout adaptation</a>. The show's success - which saw<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks"> 65 million viewers</a> tuning in in its first 16 days of release - led to droves of players venturing into one or many of Fallout's wastelands, to find out what delights were in store.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-currently-europes-best-selling-game-almost-a-decade-after-release">Fallout 4 actually became the best selling game in Europe</a> at one point in April, despite having been out for almost a decade. Meanwhile, earlier today, it was announced that Fallout 76 has now welcomed 20 million total players, several years after its initial release.</p>

<p>"Depending on the Fallout game, you're looking at a 4-6x increase in daily players," Howard said to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/fallout-76-20-million-players-tv-series-new-games-bethesda-studios-1236018945/">Variety</a>, reflecting on this latest number. "Having an event that brings that many people into games that you have and who have never played your games before, that's a big thing. New players who have never played a game or never played one of our games.</p>
<p>"It's a really, really unique moment."</p> <div>

<p>Meanwhile, on the newly-minted TV side of the franchise, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">Amazon's Fallout was officially announced to be getting a second season</a> soon after series one made its debut. At this time, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy - who executive produce the show via Kilter Films - said they "can't wait to blow up the world all over again".</p>
<p>Speaking on this upcoming second season, Howard confirmed the current plan is to follow the same characters we met in season one. "The one thing about TV that Jonah told me from Day One is it's about finding the characters. And I think it's really awesome how these characters have resonated with the audience," Howard said.</p>
<p>"And so I think there's still stories to tell there. There's so many great characters - I love Norm and Chet, I love the two of them in every scene. And obviously we have the Ghoul and Lucy and Maximus. But there's so many great characters that have a lot of stories left to tell."</p>
<p>If you are still itching to know more, Fallout's showrunners recently gave us all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-showrunners-discuss-season-two-location-and-why-the-series-doesnt-need-to-follow-a-canon-ending">briefest of teasers</a> for what's coming in season two.</p>

  <p id="fVzhKS">For a story about someone who can cheat time, the timing of <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> could not be more unfortunate.</p>
<p id="bjdIR9">Amid the release of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24033589/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft-switch"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em></a> in January of this year, as well as the much more recent surprise launch of roguelite phenomenon <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24147392/hades-2-early-access-release-date-how-to-play"><em>Hades 2</em></a> in Steam Early Access — the latter of which actually resulted in developer Evil Empire <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153672/rogue-prince-of-persia-hades-2-release-date-delay">delaying</a> this game’s original May 14 release — <em>Rogue</em> finds itself on uneven ground. What could have been a fresh and promising spinoff for a franchise that had been dormant for years now has to unfairly share the spotlight, facing sky-high expectations and inevitable comparisons to not only its surrounding peers, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24126419/rogue-prince-of-persia-dead-cells-evil-empire-reveal">the studio’s own legacy</a> as the support team for <em>Dead Cells</em>.</p>
<p id="5BmKVf">Released in Steam Early Access on May 27, <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> marries Ubisoft’s popular franchise with the institutional knowledge of Evil Empire around the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/23313023/best-roguelikes-on-nintendo-switch-steam-playstation-xbox-pc">roguelite</a> genre. In the 2D roguelite, Persia is attacked by a Hun army, a nomadic group wielding dark magic. Thanks to an artifact in his possession, the Prince can travel back in time whenever he’s about to meet his demise, ready to dash through another attempt to stop the invasion.</p>

<p id="4QuoNv">During the tutorial, it doesn’t take long to see how Evil Empire is sprinkling Prince of Persia flair into a scaled-down action platformer. As you navigate a series of procedurally generated 2D biomes, you’re free to wall-run horizontally and vertically on any suitable structure in the background. You can also vault over enemies (yes, this was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=427GbpLiNoY">inspired</a> by <em>The</em> <em>Sands of Time</em>), perform a kick, and do a dive attack from midair — which isn’t as aggressively snappy as <em>Dead Cells</em>’ ground pound, but it still feels quite satisfactory.</p>
<p id="I7qQ3F">Each of these actions has a simple mechanical purpose with some additional benefits if used in the right scenario. The kick is great for interrupting attacks or just throwing somebody toward the nearest trap or cliff. It can also stun enemies if they hit a wall or a fellow Hun, producing a ripple effect. If the second target has a shield and gets hit, this action automatically removes that shield; the same can be accomplished with the dive attack. Once you get used to the Prince’s acrobatic actions, getting from point A to B in a biome feels like speedrunning an obstacle course.</p>
<p id="hotUjE">It’s unfortunate, then, that <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> doesn’t offer much of a challenge once you’ve mastered these movements. There are platforming sections reminiscent of the franchise’s roots, but they don’t require perfect precision. Enemies seem often at a disadvantage around the Prince’s traversal. Toward the end of my playthrough of the current build, I was able to remain untouched for almost the entirety of a run. Getting to this point does feel rewarding. The current early access build, however, makes that thrill short-lived.</p>

<p id="K4ao8M">During the first week of release, there are six biomes and two bosses available. It took me six hours to reach the “end” of the current build, and everything basically stopped in its tracks once I did. The oasis to which the Prince returns after each death serves as a hub to unlock items for subsequent runs, as well as the occasional chat with characters. Once I defeated the second boss, they all ceased offering conversations. There’s a so-called Mind Map that registers key story details, gradually mapping a detective board of sorts. First impressions of this mechanic seem promising, especially when a “clue” leads you to take a different route just to talk to a specific NPC and unlock an item to progress — an interesting method of providing story-led structure to a roguelite. But with only a few events available at the moment, it still feels like a first draft.</p>
<p id="5jQUvo">The same sentiment encapsulates my experience with <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> as a whole. Even Evil Empire has acknowledged this within 24 hours of the launch, in response to the community’s feedback. “We’re not here to do a final sense check on a 90% finished game and replace some placeholder art,” reads a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2717880/eventcomments/4335356696603111755">Steam post</a> by the studio, “nor are we a finished game with years of post-1.0 support. Our plan is to at least double the amount of content in the game, by providing weekly content updates where we work closely with the community.”</p>
<p id="zAhOWo">When I reviewed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371980/No_Rest_for_the_Wicked/"><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em></a> earlier this year, I was surprised at what is considered a “work in progress” in Steam Early Access, as the build was big enough to be its own thing already. <em>Rogue</em> is much smaller in scope and had a significantly shorter development time. But the foundation is there already. I just can’t help but wonder if, aside from the model it’s being built around, <em>Rogue</em> was released earlier than it should have been. I don’t see how churning out weekly updates, which Evil Empire sees as an “experiment,” is the answer to keep up with expectations.</p>

<p id="MzAQme">The second Prince of Persia spinoff of 2024 is riddled with phantoms. In an interview with Edge Magazine, reposted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/the-prince-of-persia-roguelike-had-to-change-its-story-because-of-the-prince-of-persia-metroidvania-and-was-forbidden-from-using-an-iconic-weapon/">GamesRadar</a>, game director Lucie Dewagnier said Evil Empire “needed to change things” due to <em>The Lost Crown</em>. According to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/04/10/we-played-the-rogue-lite-prince-of-persia-from-the-co-developer-of-dead-cells">Game Informer</a>, both teams were in touch from the beginning to avoid “making the same decision and making the same game” along the course of development.</p>
<p id="qNsTqd">Despite that open line of communication between the teams, there are still some undeniable similarities between <em>Rogue</em> and <em>The Lost Crown</em>. Both games shared the same conceptual mission — a spinoff that would awaken the Prince of Persia name from slumber, especially with the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23736045/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-reboot"><em>Sands of Time</em> remake</a> still MIA. They also happen to be 2D action platformers in a year that has a glut of them (<em>Ultros</em>,<em> Pepper Grinder</em>, <em>Nine Sols</em>, and more). It’s a different scenario than the one surrounding <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/6/13/18677696/cadence-of-hyrule-review-zelda-necrodancer"><em>Cadence of Hyrule</em></a>, for example, a spinoff by the <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em> studio that still managed to stand out and have a spotlight period before <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/9/19/20870437/zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em></a> was released three months later.</p>
<p id="q3XiyV">Likewise, pitting <em>Rogue </em>against <em>Hades 2</em> — a sequel that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hades-2s-surprise-early-access-release-already-has-more-stuff-in-it-than-the-first-game/">already</a> has more environments, enemies, and voiced characters in early access than the full version of the first game did when its 1.0 version launched — is an uneven comparison, to say the least. And yet Evil Empire delayed its game in the light of <em>Hades 2</em>’s release. </p>

<p id="SCC8Ge">Then there’s Evil Empire’s legacy as a studio. Few people will remember the start of <em>Dead Cells</em> in early access back in 2017, with only a handful of biomes and mechanics still in the conception phase. Instead, the expectations for <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia </em>are clouded by the present, with <em>Dead Cells</em> fans picturing the fully formed roguelite hit that sold over <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/dead-cells-has-topped-10-million-sales-worldwide">10 million copies</a>. Seven years later, the roguelite genre as a whole seems to be at a saturation point, which doesn’t help. Three Sony first-party games — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22408761/returnal-review-ps5-housemarque"><em>Returnal</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24001843/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-review-roguelite-free-dlc"><em>God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24036476/the-last-of-us-part-2s-roguelike-mode"><em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</em></a> — did their own spin on the genre, while an increasing number of studios are betting on sequels (see <em>Slay the Spire</em>,<em> Darkest Dungeon</em>, and <em>Spelunky</em>, to name a few) rather than new games altogether.</p>
<p id="ZS1pbX">Saying that Evil Empire is dealing with unfavorable odds would be an understatement. After my short time with its new roguelite, however, I still can’t wait to see where <em>Rogue</em> goes from here. I’m intrigued to see how its promising ideas are developed, regardless of how many more of its genre come out prior to the release of its 1.0 version. Let’s just hope Ubisoft doesn’t launch another Prince of Persia game that same year. </p>

<p data-characters="153" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Having a clear idea about the best <em>EA FC 24</em> playstyles is incredibly beneficial for any player, irrespective of the game mode you’re planning for. </p> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">Playstyles were introduced with <em>EA FC 24</em> and have become a fan-favorite feature. EA Sports removed the older traits system and iterated on it with this new system that impacts how a footballer behaves. Naturally, every position has certain playstyles that work better; knowing them will help you dominate the in-game meta and win more matches.</p> <h2 id="h-top-3-ea-fc-24-playstyles-for-every-position" data-injectable="false">Top 3 <em>EA FC 24 </em>playstyles for every position</h2> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">Ideally, some positions do have more than three great choices when it comes to <em>EA FC 24</em> playstyles. However, I have narrowed them down to the top three options. Do note that goalkeepers don’t have playstyle+, so I have ignored them. Playstyles on a goalkeeper seem pretty redundant (only EA Sports knows why it’s like that).</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"> <li>RB/LB: Jockey, Whipped Pass, Intercept/Anticipate</li> <li>CB: Anticipate, Intercept, Jockey (Aerial in Div.1 or higher)</li> <li>RWB/LWB: Whipped Pass, Jockey, Rapid</li> <li>CDM: Anticipate, Intercept, Pinged Pass (Tiki Taka if the midfielder has H/H work rates)</li> <li>CM: Pinged Pass, Long Ball Pass, Tiki Taka/Incisive Pass</li> <li>RM/LM: Rapid/Quick Step, Pinged Pass, Technical</li> <li>RW/LW: Rapid/Quick Step, Finesse Shot, Technical</li> <li>CAM: Incisive Pass, Finesse Shot, Technical</li> <li>ST/CF: Finesse Shot, Technical, First Touch</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Now, there are some exceptions to this list of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-do-power-shot-in-ea-fc-24/">EA FC 24</a></em> playstyles. In the current meta, a lot of goals are being scored from headers. Suddenly, the Power Header and Aerial have become a hot favorite of the community. However, only use cards with these playstyles if you want to play with crosses and aerial long balls. The Long Ball Pass playstyle is also very useful in this particular meta.</p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true">When it comes to <em>EA FC 24</em> Playstyles, Trivela, Trickster, and Power Shot can be pretty unique choices. As helpful as these playstyles are, not everyone can use them efficiently. The Trivela playstyle, in particular, is more important than ever if you want to score from shots with the outside foot.</p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">Almost all new cards coming to Ultimate Team now have triple <em>EA FC 24</em> Playstyles. Some of those include the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-henrikh-mkhitaryan-tots-sbc-solutions-tasks/">Henrikh Mkhitaryan Serie A TOTS SBC</a>, or you can opt for the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-trinity-rodman-tots-sbc-cheapest-solutions/">Trinity Rodman TOTS</a> (much more meta).</p>

            <p>A Just Cause movie is in on the way.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/just-cause-movie-in-the-works-1235910913/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the movie – based on Square Enix and Avalanche Studios' action series – will be led by Blue Bettle director Ángel Manuel Soto, and produced by Kelly McCormick and David Leitch, who also produced The Fall Guy.</p>

<p>Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg, and Timothy I. Stevenson – who also worked on the movie adaptations of Tomb Raider and Sonic the Hedgehog – are also on board. Dan Jevons joins the project as executive producer.</p>
<p>THR says Universal "jumped at the chance for the adaptation", as "the studio sees the title as part of the rising wave of video game adaptations that seem to be supplanting the superhero genre at the box office", pointing out that the studio's The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Five Nights at Freddy’s movies grossed over $1.4 billion and $290 million respectively in the global box office.</p>
<p>Sadly, there's no further information on who will write the movie or star in it, but as always, we'll keep you posted. Hopefully this project will fare better that prior attempts to bring Just Cause to the big screen; as noted by THR, Constantin Film "spent the better part of a decade" trying to get a movie made "before the rights eventually lapsed".

<p>Sony Motion Pictures Group chair Tom Rothman recently stressed the importance of "big IP movies" for the company, asserting that "The Legend of Zelda is going to be huge for us".</p>

            <p>Did I ever tell you about the time I was smuggling pears and USB-C cords through the Spanish Main? Was during the great USB-C shortage of 1687, you see. Apple had just released their new electric barnacle scrubber, and sailors everywhere were trading sacks of freshly minted coins just for a solitary sweet sniff at one of the delightfully compact and sleekly designed charger cables. Of course, too-many-toes Jackson and myself had seen tell of this upcoming gold rush, written in crab trails on the sand, which is what we had instead of the stock market in them days.</p>

<p>Sensing a gold opportunity to opportunistically make some gold - which, as pirates, we were quite fond of - we stocked up on those tangly devils like they were going out of fashion. Which, of course, they had been for a bit. But, as the crabs foretold, the new-fangled USB-D failed to catch on, and the age of the C’s was back in full swing. There was seven prototype designs back then. The seven Cs, we called ‘em. Anyway, we grabbed 'em all. Also, we grabbed some pears, in case we got hungry.</p>
<p>We were just sailing into port to offload our haul, when we began to realise we were sinking right into the Spanish Main. We probably could have saved the cargo, but we spent quite a long time trying to Google to see whether the Spanish Main was actually technically a body of water. I still don’t know, and I don’t care. Weren’t you listening? We were sinking! We just managed to get to shore when we realised what the problem was. In our haste to leave harbour, we’d made a classic mistake. A mistake that has spelt disaster for many before and many to come...</p>
<p>Forgot to check for leaks, didn't we? 
</p>
<p>Anyway, the moral of this story is to make sure your game's anticipated DLC isn't playable days before official launch. The extra, bonus moral is that there’s only so many news stories I can write in one day before devolving into absolute bollocks. PSA, then: don’t go online for a few days if you’re sensitive to spoilers for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>’s The Final Shape expansion. Some PS5 players have been able to access the DLC early through Sony’s cloud gaming, and they’ve gone and bloody posted it everywhere. Do keep checking RPS though, natch.</p>

			<p>Today, Bethesda Game Studios <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1796200603347009880" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Fallout 76 reached 20 million players who've entered Appalachia since the November 2018 launch, gaining three months over December 2023's 17 million count. Last we heard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-grew-to-13-5-million-players-in-2022-up-2-5-million-yoy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in late 2022</a>, the game was up to 13.5 million players. The studio shared a brief video message in which Creative Director Jonathan Rush thanked fans alongside several other team members.</p>
<p>Director and Executive Producer Todd Howard also discussed the milestone <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/fallout-76-20-million-players-tv-series-new-games-bethesda-studios-1236018945/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an interview with Variety</a>:</p>
<p><em>Fallout 76 has kind of been sneaky popular for a while — but not to this level, and it’s just been really great for the whole studio.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Fallout 76 surged back to #8 on April's US sales chart <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-helldivers-2-npd-circana-april-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted yesterday by Circana</a>, while Fallout 4 ranked #5. The whole franchise benefited from Amazon's Prime Video show. Howard said on the topic:</p>
<p><em>Depending on the Fallout game, you’re looking at a 4-6x increase in daily players, which is beyond anything I’ve ever seen in my 30 years of doing this. Having an event that brings that many people into games that you have and who have never played your games before, that’s a big thing. New players who have never played a game or never played one of our games. It’s a really, really unique moment.</em></p>
<p>Todd Howard then highlighted that the show's success largely rested on the well-made characters.</p>
<p><em>The one thing about TV that Jonah told me from Day One is it’s about finding the characters. And I think it’s really awesome how these characters have resonated with the audience. And so I think there’s still stories to tell there. There’s so many great characters — I love Norm and Chet, I love the two of them in every scene. And obviously, we have the Ghoul and Lucy and Maximus. But there’s so many great characters that have a lot of stories left to tell.</em></p>
<p>What about new Fallout games? We've reported on the rumors of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-might-be-here-sooner-than-we-thought-at-microsofts-behest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft fast-tracking a new mainline installment</a>. In today's interview, Howard just says they're making plans for future games.</p>
<p><em>The TV show, I feel like it took us 15 years from when I first started talking about it — but it was five years since Jonah and I first talked. And games take a good five-ish years. So we’re in plans for future games in this series and nothing to talk about right now, but we’re always planning.</em></p>
<p>Fallout 76 is soon getting a free map expansion with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-map-is-getting-bigger-thanks-to-the-addition-of-skyline-valley-shenandoah-national-park/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyline Valley update</a> currently on the Public Test Server. The patch will also rebalance combat encounters against certain creatures (Angler, Cave Cricket, Floaters, Gulper, Mutant Hound, and Protectron) while improving the falloff for weapon damage at range.</p>

As you progress higher through the Skill Tree, the unlocks become increasingly more impactful.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>To help you get a better idea of what upgrades await, let’s look at a couple of unlocks from each of the six ranks of Community Standing.</p><ul><li><strong>Rank 1</strong><ul><li><strong>Treat Yourself:</strong> Cosmetics near your location appear on your Map and Compass.</li><li><strong>I’m In:</strong> Turrets and Tripwires take 50% less time to Hack.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Rank 2</strong><ul><li><strong>The Rest of the Story:</strong> Grave Locks near your location appear on your Map and Compass.</li><li><strong>Ammo Dump:</strong> Human enemies drop more ammo on death.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Rank 3</strong><ul><li><strong>Well <a title="Games > Grounded [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a>:</strong> Take 50% less damage from Rook Storm lightning strikes.</li><li><strong>Castle Doctrine:</strong> Unlocked Safehouse defense now includes some Friendly Turrets.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Rank 4</strong><ul><li><strong>Family Heirlooms:</strong> Anglers, Shrouds, and Siphons drop better rewards on death.</li><li><strong>Homeopathic Remedy:</strong> Using a Medical Supply has a 40% chance to not consume the item.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Rank 5</strong><ul><li><strong>Crystal Ball:</strong> Each Psychic Residue Orb collected has a 40% chance to give you significantly more Psychic Residue.</li><li><strong>Last Laugh:</strong> When destroyed, Friendly Turrets will electrocute enemies within 20 meters. Does not affect enemies immune to electrocution.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Rank 6</strong><ul><li><strong>High Roller:</strong> Unrivaled items appear much more frequently in loot.</li><li><strong>Escape Plan:</strong> Activate a salvaged Bellwether cloak for 10 seconds upon reaching critical health levels. Attacking will deactivate. Can only occur once every 10 minutes.</li></ul></li></ul><p>All the upgrades from the Community Standing Skill Tree are meant to provide you with a mixture of QoL and gameplay benefits. A few of the traits will even help collectors finish out their hunt for cosmetics and Grave Locks.</p><p><strong>Nest Revamp: Elder Nest</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Redfall-Update_05-30-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>Also arriving with Game Update 4 are Elder Nests. These new Boss-focused Nests will challenge you to destroy dangerously modified special Vampires to free Redfall from their influence.</p><p>Portals to the Elder Nest will appear around Redfall much like their Heart Nest siblings. But these new psychic spaces can be distinguished by their purple glow over the areas where their influence reaches.</p><p>Once you’ve accepted the challenge and entered the Elder Nest, your objective is to find the Vampire boss buried deep within and destroy them, freeing the Heart inside, grabbing your rewards, and escaping.</p><p>After successfully clearing the Elder Nest, you (and your teammates) will be granted a temporary buff called a Heart Shard. The duration of the Heart Shard scales to the campaign difficulty; granting a longer buff at each higher difficulty.</p><p>Here are just a few of the Heart Shards that could be granted after completing an Elder Nest:</p><ul><li><strong>Ammo Synthesis:</strong> Holstered weapons regenerate ammo and reload when not in use.</li><li><strong>UV Healing:</strong> A player gains health when hit by UV.</li><li><strong>Light in Darkness:</strong> The expanding aura around the Nest weakens vampires inside it, instead of the usual strengthening effect.</li></ul><p>There’s one more major change coming to all Nests with this update. Failing to escape a Nest during its destabilization phase will now result in you not obtaining the Major Remanent. Any loot that you pick up will still be yours, but the Major Remanent is now rewarded after you successfully exit the collapsing Nest.</p><p><strong>Quality of Life</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Offline Mode</strong> – With the release of Game Update 4, you will be given the option to play <em>Redfall</em> while disconnected from the internet. You will also be able to continue playing if you’re disconnected from the Internet in the middle of a solo session. When playing cooperatively, the host will be dropped into a solo offline session.</li><li><strong>Single-Player Pausing</strong> – Another new feature we’re happy to introduce is Single-Player Pausing. Now if you need some time to adjust your kit, or you just need to step away for a minute, the world of <em>Redfall</em> will wait with you.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Redfall</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,391 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,186 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1294810/Redfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/redfall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/redfall/9ng8s82n9f4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Store</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each includes six games, though both cabinets are also compatible with existing Evercade cartridges, allowing you to play over 500 titles using the dual cartridge slots on the front of the machine. The cabinet is designed for solo play, with competition-grade controls for a single player. For multiplayer, you'll find two USB ports that support a variety of controllers, including Evercade VS gamepads and third-party controllers.</p>                      </div><p>Other notable features include a vibrant 8-inch display, stereo speakers, headphone jack, and Wi-Fi support for updates.

Here's a look at what you'll find on each. Most of these games have never been available for Evercade.

<p dir="ltr">However, well-known leaker Dusk Golem has poured some cold water on these listings <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1796184775507558874" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), advising people not to "put much stock into" them. Dusk Golem was also the one behind the Resident Evil Zero and Code Veronica remake rumblings earlier this week.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-is-remaking-more-resident-evil-games/1100-6519619/" data-ref-id="1100-6519619">Capcom has confirmed it's remaking more Resident Evil games</a>, but the company hasn't detailed which entry will be next. Additionally, while it's strongly believed Resident Evil 9 is in development, Capcom hasn't officially announced the title. The Revenant Shadows subtitle is new to the Play-Asia listing.</p><p dir="ltr">In March, Dusk Golem <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-could-be-an-open-world-game-report/1100-6522123/" data-ref-id="1100-6522123">reported that Resident Evil 9 could be an open-world game</a>, utilizing the RE Engine. It's thought the game won't come out until late 2025 at the earliest.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-good-within-designing-a-memorable-horror-game-protagonist<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to escaping harsh realities, many would agree that video games have people covered.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not only can they provide hours of interactive entertainment that puts folks in control of the experience, but they also offer a little something that may sharply contrast with the feeling of powerlessness all souls experience at some point in their lives. That little something is the power fantasy, ranging from blasting hordes of baddies in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Trepang2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(2023) to stealthily dispatching foes with supernatural efficiency in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dishonored </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(2012).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But what if the game in question is loath to grant you a license to liberally make short work of challenges? What if it puts your player character at a greater disadvantage with regard to how powerful they and their enemies are?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In that case, the world of trouble you'd find yourself in would most likely be a house of horrors—literally and figuratively—in which to survive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whether you're infiltrating an abandoned research facility as the plucky Regina in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dino Crisis </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">series or investigating a dilapidated amusement park as Mara Forest in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crow Country</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the survival horror genre has no shortage of leads who share the player's eagerness to go through hell and back to achieve their goal of living to see another day—even if they lack the necessary firepower for easily sidestepping an early demise at the hands of daunting adversaries.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, just because they find themselves in uncharted territory where their deaths may go unnoticed in civilization's eyes doesn't mean they can't be made indelible in players' peepers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Be it their personality, gameplay abilities, story arc, or a blend of all three, horror game protagonists bear all kinds of facets that players may come to appreciate should designers think long and hard about how to make their title's leading star a force to be reckoned with. Not necessarily with regard to their ability to overcome obstacles, but more so with winning gamers' hearts through their words and deeds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Besides, someone's got to feel heroic enough to brave the horrors awaiting them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>NOTE: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The tips&nbsp;in this article&nbsp;may or&nbsp;may not be compatible with every game depending on the designer's vision, but they serve as general tenets that can benefit the experience when well implemented. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spoilers abound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> since details about the protagonists shall be discussed.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Give them a personal goal that'll put them through their paces"><span>Give them a personal goal that'll put them through their paces</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As with ordinary folks, horror game protagonists embody hopes and dreams that prompt them to take action and weather the hurdles they may encounter. After all, Kurt Vonnegut once stated that every character should want something—even if it is only a glass of water.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, unless done for comedic purposes, a glass of H2O won't convince a determined soul to put themselves in harm's way and lay themselves bare.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead, it would be wiser to have that same soul bear a personal goal—so personal that the comfy world as they know it would come to an end should they fail on their quest. The reason designers should go the extra mile in that respect is that it'll force the lead to give it their all by showcasing the whole range of actions they take and the words they say to see things through.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SIGNALIS</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s Elster is any indication, then, it's that having a loved one in desperate need of being rescued is an appropriate way to drive the action.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From the moment she awakens from her slumber and steps into the nightmarish world of Leng, Elster acknowledges that her partner can't be merely picked up at the lost and found office. Going down that route is more likely to reward our heroine with a monster or two looking to dismantle their prey one limb at a time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As players make their way further down the symbolism-heavy rabbit hole and take on its many terrors, they'll gradually understand that whoever Elster is after isn't just one of many folks dear to her. In fact, she and her long-lost lover are the only true sources of comfort and belonging they've ever had. To let go, then, would be akin to dying—hence Elster's willingness to take on cosmic horrors and even a godlike figure if it means reuniting with the one who makes her forget about the harsh universe they're in and the cruel circumstances they ended up in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While it is true that featuring an alien setting is vital to begetting a fittingly unsettling horror experience, it's also true that the protagonist can feel especially tense when they stumble upon something/one that reminds them of what they had and dealt with before setting foot in the lion's den.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This sharp contrast between the foreignness of their newfound environment and the familiarity of items/people can add a tangible layer of confusion and disorientation to the protagonist's journey.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Simply put, they may begin questioning their grasp of the situation and even reality. What are their harrowing surroundings trying to say? Is there something the protagonist does(n't) know that ties them to the space they're exploring?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the one hand, such eerie details may give the lead many reasons to hightail it out of there since they may want to deny any associations with something they'd hardly call home (especially if said details are tragic). On the other hand, though, it may also inspire the protagonist to push ahead, make sense of what they're witnessing, and hopefully seek closure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In that respect, Jennifer from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rule of Rose </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">stands as a great example—her story leading up to a sudden realization that recontextualizes the space she explores.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At first, it appears that the locations she finds herself in—such as the airship and orphanage—are all part of an unfortunate series of events that Jennifer got abruptly pulled into. It also doesn't help that her being at the mercy of a ruthless club dubbed the Red Rose Aristocracy makes Jennifer feel increasingly powerless and disoriented. Only her canine companion Brown is eager to be at her side and assist her in negotiating her surroundings and dealing with their obstacles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, as the story progresses and Jennifer starts witnessing events as her younger self, it becomes clear that the locales she trekked across and the personalities she interacted with are byproducts of her distorted memories of her girlhood. In other words, the game goes from feeling like something out of a Lewis Carroll tale to being more akin to a morbid trip down memory lane with thematic oomph.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Therefore, Jennifer's surroundings are the way they are because she's trying to deal with her survivor guilt and make peace with the fact that the many tragedies she witnessed as a kid were beyond her control. Not only did she conquer her fears, then, but she did so on their turf. So much for home advantage.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Stack the odds against them, but give them a fighting chance"><span>Stack the odds against them, but give them a fighting chance</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As overwhelming as the forces a horror protagonist faces should be, that's not to say that player characters shouldn't at least have some way to buy themselves time or even things out in the tug-of-war between them and the opposition.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While scares can come from facing obstacles that can make short work of the avatar, they can also stem from the risks that come with the player trying to fight back or give their foes the slip. Besides, all tension evaporates when one can predictably run away from their pursuers and succeed if they follow the game's rules and read the literal room to a tee. Being able to take on their hunters while knowing that they might sustain damage or die at worst? Here's where things get (and stay) unpredictable, something all horror experiences can benefit from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key, then, lies in taking into account the fact that horror protagonists—just like real folks—have fight-or-flight instincts in dangerous situations. Ergo, protagonists shouldn't act as if they must flee or overpower their enemies all the time. Giving them both options and letting them choose between the two in any situation can help the protagonist feel resourceful and prudent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those last two adjectives fittingly describe photojournalist Frank West from the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Rising </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">series. Sure, he's more of an everyman than the kind of hero you play as in a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">title, and the hordes of zombies he must contend with may compel him (and players) to give them a wide berth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet just like how he hunts down opportunities to take quality pics of his surroundings, Frank's never afraid to look for ways to get from Point A to B in crimson fashion should he feel bold enough (and have enough HP on his person). And given that players are incentivized to rescue any survivor they come across, Frank must frequently be a hero in a place regular folks wouldn't dare go to on a Black Friday. That said, the presence of zombified masses still means that Frank must think and plan carefully with regard to his choice of tactics and gear.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of gear, the fact that it can be as innocuous as a children's toy or hockey mask suggests that Frank's potential decision to equip them stems from his need to improvise to survive in a world that wants to feast on his innards. Seeing as horror games can deprive players of resources, a protagonist who fashions a weapon or armor from shopping mall staples is one that shows a blend of strength and vulnerability—further humanizing them in the process.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Highlight their flaws and growth via major sequences"><span>Highlight their flaws and growth via major sequences</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is a truism out there that states that folks tend to show their rawest and innermost selves whenever they find themselves in times of crisis. Gone are the social masks they don to get along (and get their way) with others, allowing observers to witness the lengths to which people will go to reassert control over an unwieldy situation and have everything go back to normal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The above paragraph is perfectly suited for horror titles because it can put lead characters on the spot whenever they interact with fellow survivors and are about to take decisive and irreversible action. More specifically, a protagonist's flaws can be exposed in such scenarios—providing them with a chance to see the consequences of their lesser endeavors and potentially take the necessary steps towards becoming a better survivor and individual.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The great part about this criterion is that the maturing protagonist can even cause other characters (if there are any) to go through their own metamorphosis, which can give birth to new forms of interactions that keep interpersonal dynamics fresh and may lead to defining moments in one's story arc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One title that comes to mind is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last of Us</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with Joel and Ellie serving as lead characters who grow together as they make their way from east to west. Initially, Joel's being haunted by the death of his daughter Sarah means that he has a hard time seeing the bright side of life. At the same time, Ellie expresses frustration at being escorted by someone who's unapproachable and unwilling to let her handle herself—let alone a firearm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From the get-go, parental trauma and teenage frustration contextualize the duo's inner struggles. As they get closer to their destination, however, the two start warming up to one another—Joel becoming more receptive to having his traveling companion defend herself and Ellie going the extra mile to nurse a gravely wounded Joel back to health. All the time they have spent together has allowed both protagonists to see the good in each other, resulting in them making tough choices in the name of mutual survival.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ellie's hacking away at a cannibal with a machete, Joel's decision to save Ellie instead of letting her die in the name of producing a vaccine... None of these would've occurred had it not been for character growth, something facilitated by the horrors they had to overcome to survive physically and mentally as a team.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Show the physical/mental effects their travails have on them"><span>Show the physical/mental effects their travails have on them</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As horror titles generally drop players in uninviting environments aiming to chip away at their avatar's HP and sanity, it's safe to assume that the player character will take some form of damage along the way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not just the kind of damage that'd have one open their inventory and down some green herbs for good measure, but also the sort that the protagonist shows on their person and in their mien for the remainder of the experience as if it were a badge of honor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Designers may choose to depict such audiovisual and behavioral details for two reasons: First, it reinforces the idea that the protagonist is a vulnerable being who must exercise caution and never lose hope if they wish to emerge victorious (and preferably in one piece). Second, it can act as an indicator of narrative progress that highlights the fact that our hero(ine) has reached the point of no return.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To put things euphemistically, they're about to find out if they will be separated from either the wheat or the chaff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Such is the situation that Leon Kennedy from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shall find himself in as he ventures further into the bowels of Raccoon City. Early on, Leon is likely to get chewed on by various mutated and zombified critters. This can result in him losing HP and limping about the virtual space, but it's nothing some health items can't patch up—hence the lack of change to his in-game model.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That is, until he gets shot while trying to get Ada Wong out of harm's way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following that impromptu act of heroism, Leon dons a bandage on the upper half of his body for the rest of the game. No amount of healing can reverse that texture change: Mr. Kennedy will be forced to show everyone he meets that plot armor can only go so far in shielding him from all kinds of nasty blows.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The bandage might be a simple detail in and of itself, but it does achieve one of the goals a designer has in mind when portraying the protagonist's struggles: It shows that no matter who you are, any reckless action you take—even with the best of intentions—will have the baleful environment leave its mark on you in painful fashion. Given that horror games can come with increasingly high stakes, having the lead character display the consequences of taking on the unknown can be a potent reminder of their fragility and the need to potentially change tactics if they want to make it back to the ordinary world as a wiser individual.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lend them quirks that shape their behavior and gameplay chops"><span>Lend them quirks that shape their behavior and gameplay chops</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As with all characters in works of fiction, horror game protagonists don't necessarily need to be "normal" for players to easily relate to—especially if one considers that games provide escapism that lets folks control characters with noteworthy and attractive facets. Given the genre's reliance on tough-as-nails circumstances to inspire gamers to play cautiously, said facets shouldn't equate to granting the lead character anything that's more at home in power fantasies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the case of horror gaming, any quirks or special features the protagonist embodies should be related to a couple of things: First, they may add a touch of personality to the character that makes their interactions with their environment noteworthy in terms of how well they spot details and how unique their observations are. Second, they may serve as a way for the protagonist to effectively read and, in some cases, shape their surroundings to better negotiate them (while still keeping the odds stacked against our lead character).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The upshot, then, is that the protagonist's facets will make them a more interesting personality and someone who's trying to actively cope with and make sense of a menacing situation. Chalk it up to the fear of the unknown.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is exemplified via the titular wordsmith from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alan Wake 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As an everyman trapped in a supernatural alternate dimension dubbed The Dark Place, Mr. Wake knows that even if he somehow trained himself to become a firearms meister, chances are he's still unlikely to fight his way out through exclusively conventional means. Instead, he has to leverage his skills as a word wrangler to get out of Dodge. Ergo, he can't keep suffering from writer's block.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thankfully for him, the Dark Place is a surprisingly flexible canvas for Alan's reality-shifting writings. With the help of his trusty Writer's Room (and some good ol' writing prompts to get the literary brain going), Mr. Wake can change his story (i.e., the Dark Place) and grant himself access to new areas that'll hopefully get him closer to freedom. Whether it's turning a subway tunnel into the site of a bloody ritual or creating a blood trail to follow by writing about a wounded detective, Alan can partake in a tug-of-war with his surroundings that helps make his character idiosyncratic and the way he tackles obstacles novel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sometimes, the typewriter can be mightier than the gun—making Alan Wake a remarkably ingenious figure who knows that outsmarting horror baddies can oftentimes be more effective than simply pumping them full of lead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let me know what you think of my post in the comments section, and feel free to ask questions and share the article.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Twitter:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Watfen64">https://twitter.com/Watfen64</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Email:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#14797d777c71786775767675737c262424275479677a3a777b79"><span data-cfemail="83eeeae0ebe6eff0e2e1e1e2e4ebb1b3b3b0c3eef0edade0ecee">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mastodon:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@mitchformer">https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@mitchformer</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="316" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">For the first time in 2024, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> is releasing a free Summer update introducing new and returning features. With items like the Onyx Hippogriff, Felix Felicis potion, and the Haunted Hogsmeade Shop questline coming to the game for all platforms, the highlight of this update is the addition of photo mode. </p> <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">As the official <a href="https://x.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/1796164665917186386" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement post</a> details, you can take cinematic pictures of your character and the surrounding environment using the newly added photo mode starting June 6, 2024. Although the game featured options to disable your GUI, this is its first time introducing a proper photo mode for picture-taking. The update also includes new and returning cosmetics that were previously only available during the game’s pre-order period, such as the Azkaban Prisoner’s outfit, The Glasses That Lived, and the Lavender Borealis Broom. </p>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">The update also features the Haunted Hogsmeade Shop quest that initially launched as a PlayStation-exclusive storyline, the Felix Felicis potion that reveals chest locations around the map, and a talent point reset feature if you want to try a different build in future playthroughs. </p> <figure data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Avalanche Software</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">Currently, <em>Hogwarts Legacy’s</em> Summer update will only include these main features, with no new information on DLC or New Game+ plans. While these would have been interesting additions to surprise the community, they won’t be coming this time. There’s no specific timeline for when or if we can expect these to appear.</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="false">As a silver lining, anyone who didn’t get the chance to pre-order <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and obtain these items will have an opportunity to experience them. For those who pre-ordered and have these features already, you’ll have photo mode to experiment with as the primary new feature of this update. </p>

<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">To celebrate the end of May, <em>The Sims 4 </em>is introducing weekly events for the first time. While the game has similar features like Sims Delivery Express and scenarios, this weekly event, the Happy at Home Login Event, allows you to claim exclusive rewards with just a few button presses. </p> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">Starting May 30, you can claim free rewards during the Happy at Home Login Event after downloading a quick update and booting up <em>The Sims 4</em>. As the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-sims-4-events" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official announcement post </a>outlines, you can claim four weeks of prizes, ranging from a dartboard and necklace to athletic wear and a vending machine in later weeks. Most of the rewards you’ll find include Build Mode furniture items and Create-a-Sim cosmetic items, with the third week introducing the Practice Makes Perfect trait.</p>

The announcement also reveals new events will likely come out throughout the year for even more reward opportunities. However, there are no exact details on when the next event will appear, so for now, we’ll have to focus on this ongoing one.</p>
 <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false"><em>The Sims 4’s </em>Happy at Home Login Event is already out now, starting May 30, on all platforms.

There are eight items total you can claim during the next 35 days, giving you plenty of time to log in if you miss a few days here and there.</p>
