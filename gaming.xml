            <p>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft will debut on Netflix on 10th October, 2024.</p>
<p>The streaming giant confirmed the news earlier today with an all-too-brief teaser – I'm afraid it's less than a minute long – which you can see embedded below:</p>

<p>The animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft "picks up after the events of the highly successful Tomb Raider video game Survivor trilogy (Tomb Raider; Rise of the Tomb Raider; Shadow of the Tomb Raider), and will chart the globetrotting heroine’s next chapter as the iconic adventurer", Netflix explains.</p>
<p>Hayley Atwell – better known as Peggy Carter in numerous Marvel projects – will star as Lara Croft. Atwell is joined by Earl Baylon, who is reprising his role as Jonah Maiava from the reboot trilogy, and Allen Maldonado (Black-ish, The Last OG) as tech expert Zip.</p>
<p>"More than 25 years after her first appearance, Lara Croft (voiced by Hayley Atwell) continues to explore ancient mysteries and uncover lost truths across breathtaking and dangerous destinations," Netflix teases.</p>
<p>In related news, writer Megan McDonnell – who has previously worked on Marvel projects WandaVision and The Marvels – has joined the team working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-project-adds-wandavision-writer-to-its-team">Amazon's Tomb Raider TV series</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-acolyte-how-the-series-was-inspired-by-star-wars-games.887343/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-acolyte-how-the-series-was-inspired-by-star-wars-games/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-acolyte-how-the-series-was-inspired-by-star-wars-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="457" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the third and final season of <em>Star Wars: The Bad Batch</em> and the miniseries <em>Tales of the Empire</em> now firmly in the rearview mirror, the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise is revving up for yet another new addition. The first live-action series in some time, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-release-date-poster-cast-and-more/">Star Wars: The Acolyte</a> </em>aims to take viewers back in time. Long before the Empire, long before the Clone Wars, there was the Jedi Order, the Republic, and a mysterious, powerful force seeking to destroy them both.</p> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false"><em>The Acolyte</em> takes audiences a century ahead of <em>Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace</em> as a group of Jedi attempt to sort out a criminal conspiracy. Jedi are being killed left and right and no one knows who is responsible. This intriguing tale comes from series creator and showrunner Leslye Headland, who’s no stranger to the Star Wars galaxy.</p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="727" data-injectable="true">In fact, Headland herself shared that her love of <em>Star Wars</em> helped her create <em>The Acolyte</em>. More specifically, her love and knowledge of <em>Star Wars</em> RPGs and the Expanded Universe influenced her creative direction. “I was coming at it as a fan who was much more into the RPG that the Extended Universe feeds on,” Headland said in an interview with <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com./hollywood/2022/05/the-acolyte-star-wars-series">Vanity Fair</a>.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Lucasfilm</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">Continuing, Headland mentioned that <em>Star Wars</em> RPGs went a long way in helping her creativity come out as a kid. She didn’t feel the need to adhere strictly to what the films had to offer narratively, instead making her own fun in George Lucas’ massive sandbox. She brought that mentality to <em>The Acolyte</em>, affording her the chance to push the boundaries of <em>Star Wars</em> itself.</p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">“I was able to escape into that world with my friends, to pretend that I was part of that world. It was not like, ‘And now you have to do a scene from the original movie,’” she added, noting that, in her mind, there’s far more to <em>Star Wars</em> storytelling than strictly rehashing the core story elements, character arcs, and the like of the now-nine movie-long Skywalker saga.</p> <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="822" data-injectable="true">Though Headland didn’t name any specific <em>Star Wars</em> games in her Vanity Fair interview, she did indirectly mention one game that helped lay the foundation of her <em>Acolyte</em> vision elsewhere. She told <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/star-wars-the-acolyte-shows-us-a-side-of-the-sith-weve-never-seen-before/">Den of Geek</a>, “Darth Traya really stuck out to me as an inspiration.” Traya (Sara Kestelman), formerly the Jedi Kreia, is a major player in the 2004 hit RPG <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/better-with-age-knights-of-the-old-republic-2/">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords</a></em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, fans don’t have to wait too long to see where specifically Headland’s enduring love for <em>Star Wars</em> RPGs manifests in her show. <em>The Acolyte</em> premieres on June 4 exclusively on Disney+.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doctor-who-all-new-generation-doctors-ranked.887331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/doctor-who-all-new-generation-doctors-ranked/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=doctor-who-all-new-generation-doctors-ranked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="224" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Since 2005, when<em> Doctor Who</em> was revived after 16 years off screen, there have been six faces who have picked up the mantle to play the Doctor, in an official sense. However, they’re not the only Doctors we’ve seen.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">There are a whole string of Doctors and Doctor-adjacent characters, such as Jackson Lake, who briefly believed himself to be an incarnation of the Doctor after having his memories altered by a Cyberman, who appear throughout the series. While I haven’t mentioned all of them here, I’ve taken what I consider to be the man faces and ranked them.</p> <h2 id="h-10-the-14th-doctor-ncuti-gatwa" data-injectable="false"><strong>10 The 14th Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">I know that he’s only been the Doctor for four episodes, and I truly wish I could place Ncuti Gatwa higher up on this list because, as an actor, he has some serious talent. However, the storyline is severely lacking and there are so many questions left unanswered that I can’t even fathom him being anywhere other than here on this list.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="true">That said, the one episode of season 14 that I would consider a ‘proper <em>Doctor Who</em>’ episode, The Devil’s Chord, does display that he can play the role well and perhaps in future I’ll have reason to switch this list around a little.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-9-master-doctor" data-injectable="false"><strong>9 Master Doctor&nbsp;</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">Imagine waiting countless years to become the Doctor, finally achieving it via forced regeneration and then screwing it up by being, for lack of a better word, an idiot. Not that anyone expected any differently.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true">There’s something truly incredible about witnessing the Master in the now familiar clothing of Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor, complete with delicate ear chain, while he prances around feeling proud of himself. Then, wearing what can only be described as his attempts to don clothing from every era, he gets marooned on a planet which only exists where it does because he has ambitions that are far too big.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="108" data-current-count="108" data-injectable="false">We love to hate him, but the Master Doctor was a truly bizarre moment in time that deserves a mention.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-8-war-doctor" data-injectable="false"><strong>8 War Doctor</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">The ninth known iteration of the Doctor, and the only one ever to have put down the Sonic and picked up a gun. After using the Moment to try and bring about the end of the war between the Daleks and the Timelords, the War Doctor is offered a glimpse of his future and sets to work with his future incarnations to end the genocide of both races.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true">Sadly, thanks to some timey-wimey nonsense, the Doctor doesn’t remember his time as the War Doctor, and is led to believe that they destroyed Gallifrey instead of saving it. It’s a hard to watch moment in <em>Doctor Who</em> history, but the War Doctor deserves a place here as much as any other.</p>
 <h2 id="h-7-the-9th-doctor-christopher-eccleston" data-injectable="false"><strong>7 The 9th Doctor (Christopher Eccleston)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">The first face of the Doctor when the show’s revival happened in 2005, Christopher Eccleston brought in an impressive 10.81 million viewers during this first episode. He was only the Doctor for one season, which I would say is a shame but it did bring David Tennant into the starring role.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">However, Eccleston’s episodes do cement his place as a part of history and I will never stop loving the entire Bad Wolf storyline. What really shines from his era, though, is Rose, who went on to star alongside David Tennant and is still a beloved companion.</p> <h2 id="h-6-the-13th-doctor-jodie-whittaker" data-injectable="false"><strong>6 The 13th Doctor (Jodie Whittaker)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor is close to my heart, mostly for the fact that she proved women could play the part too, but also because of some specific episodes. The six episodes which make up the Flux story are all-time favorites for me, not to mention her jaunt into the Pendle Witch Trials and, although he didn’t show up for very long, John Bishop made one hell of a companion in the shape of Dan.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-5-fugitive-doctor" data-injectable="false"><strong>5 Fugitive Doctor</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">Although not considered an official Doctor, we discovered during Jodie Whittaker’s time that the Fugitive Doctor is indeed one of the Doctor’s iterations that had been forgotten due to memories being erased and kept by Division.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">Every time the Fugitive Doctor appears on screen, you just know that things are about to get both badass, and a little confusing. Although she’s halfway down this list, she remains one of my favorite Doctors purely because of her no-punches attitude and lack of time for tomfoolery.</p> <h2 id="h-4-the-12th-doctor-peter-capaldi" data-injectable="false"><strong>4 The 12th Doctor (Peter Capaldi)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true">With Stephen Moffat as showrunner, Peter Capaldi’s Doctor had some truly amazing storylines. From his one-man battle inside the time prison, to the introduction of everybody’s favorite Sontaran Strax and the reptilian detective Vastra. All of this isn’t even touching on the heartbreak of Clara’s story, ending with her taking a TARDIS back to Galiffrey to fix her own timeline after the Doctor loses all memories of her as his companion.</p>
 <h2 id="h-3-doctor-donna" data-injectable="false"><strong>3 Doctor Donna</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true">Part Timelord, Part Human. While she may not be an ‘official’ iteration of the Doctor, I can’t write this list without including Doctor Donna. She absorbed the knowledge of the Timelords in order to save the Doctor, turned into an all round badass and as a viewer, isn’t that the dream? To know everything the Doctor does and be able to use it for good?&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-2-the-11th-doctor-matt-smith" data-injectable="false"><strong>2 The 11th Doctor (Matt Smith)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true">Matt Smith’s Doctor is the reason we have the rather disgusting pairing of Fish Fingers and Custard, and his adventures brought in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_episodes_(2005%E2%80%93present)#Series_6_(2011)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7.5 million viewers per week</a> on average. The 11th Doctor had arguably the best companion story, with Amy and Rory Pond along on his adventures. The whole plot of Amy being the mother of River Song is a head-twisting, timey-wimey joy ride.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-1-the-10th-and-14th-doctor-david-tennant" data-injectable="false"><strong>1 The 10th and 14th Doctor (David Tennant)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">The 10th Doctor, who was so good and so beloved that they brought him back to be the 14th as well. David Tennant’s Doctor lives on in other timelines not once, but twice – once with Rose and once with Donna and her family after the first ever bi-regeneration.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">When David Tennant was the face of the Doctor, viewing figures hit an all time high of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_of_the_Damned_(Doctor_Who)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">13.31 million viewers</a> and the promise of Tennant’s return in The Power of the Doctor and the three 60th anniversary special episodes in 2023 dragged old fans back in, boosting view counts by over four million over the previous episode. That speaks for itself, really.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24169416/tianas-bayou-adventure-pov-video-4k-ride-through<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="iAXjJm">Tiana’s Bayou Adventure has finally replaced Splash Mountain at Disney World. The Disney Parks YouTube account is celebrating the completion of this unprecedented transformation with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLmhNWq5kT0">nearly 10-minute, 4K ride-through</a>. </p>
<p id="IhPtES">Our first impression? Holy moly, they <em>actually</em> pulled this off!</p>
<p id="YfdzXf">The ride’s designers had to walk a tightrope while reimagining — in terms of scale and popularity — one of the biggest rides at Disney’s theme parks. They would need to maintain (or improve upon) Splash Mountain’s abundance of animatronic characters, representing the classic approach to Disney’s most iconic rides. But they’d also have to incorporate modern technology (ultra high-resolution screens, custom 3D animation) for Bayou Adventure to fit alongside the parks’ other new “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_ticket">E-ticket attractions</a>,” like Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance and Mickey’s Runaway Railroad.</p>
<p id="VWzHTa">In a decision that will please the most nostalgic among us, the design team favored the old-school approach, stuffing the ride with an astonishing number of animatronic characters. They used screens to supplement the experience, like the powdered sugar on a delicious beignet. </p>

<p id="vO0HpG">As with Splash Mountain, the ride has a relaxed start. On a log flume, the guests take a leisurely tour of Tiana’s garden and the nearby bayou, before collecting animal instrumentalists to play a tune at the Disney Princess’s restaurant.  First, the riders meet a zydeco band featuring possums, beavers, bears, and wolves. Then, the voodoo priestess Mama Odie shrinks the riders to the size of a frog so they can tour a mini-version of the bayou and befriend some musically gifted bugs and amphibian friends.</p>
<p id="yEAWWV">The ride culminates, as promised by its premise, with a performance by Tiana at her restaurant, accompanied by her animal orchestra. By our count, this humongous space features no fewer than 15 animatronics, a recreation of Tiana’s restaurant, and a wealth of high-res screens featuring additional characters from the film, reimagined from 2D into 3D.</p>

<p id="Qyn3jx">Splash Mountain, based on the 1946 film <em>Song of the South</em>, opened in 1992, despite Disney having never released the film in the United States on home video due to its racist portrayal of life on a plantation in the Southern United States. In 2023, Scout Tafoya wrote about Disney’s long history of attempting to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/century-of-disney/23649353/song-south-disney-splash-mountain-racist-controversy">alter or erase the history of <em>Song of the South</em></a>,  treating the film like a cultural artifact that has become toxic with changing sensibilities. “But even in its day,” Tafoya writes, “<em>Song of the South</em> was <a href="https://picturethis.museumca.org/pictures/song-south-protest">derided as racist pandering</a>, and it faced a nationwide attempt at a boycott.</p>
<p id="qPHmHM">In 2020, Disney Parks announced <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/25/21303221/splash-mountain-disney-revamp-princess-and-the-frog-song-of-the-south">Splash Mountain would be replaced</a> by a ride inspired by 2009’s <em>Princess and the Frog</em>.</p>

<p data-characters="360" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of the most beautiful parts of building a new LEGO set is tackling it alongside someone else. If that person happens to be your significant other, it can even double as a wonderful date night or bonding experience. These 10 LEGO sets, in particular, are the best when it comes to offering ideas, themes, difficulty, or projects couples can enjoy together. </p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via LEGO</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-tranquil-garden" data-injectable="false">Tranquil Garden</h2> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Price:</strong> $109.99</li> <li><strong>Pieces:</strong> 1363</li> </ul> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true">This particular LEGO <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/tranquil-garden-10315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set</a> is like a little glimpse of a tranquil Japanese garden in a corner of your home. The completed set looks great with the various cherry blossom trees and stunning a bridge. This is one of the most relaxing LEGO sets in existence, especially with the surprisingly great water pieces. Plus, there are other sets that pair nicely with it. </p>

It only has a handful of pieces compared to others, so it shouldn’t take long to make. However, the end result is an extravagant heart-shaped ornament with pink and red flowers throughout. This doubles as a great set to build together and a decoration for your home. </p>

But the one set I like the most for couples is the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/nook-s-cranny-rosie-s-house-77050?ef_id=CjwKCAjwx-CyBhAqEiwAeOcTddUudAGox-YyjLG5YqyRwm5Y0X010aLN1_VWFCeqd4oMu_ndSC7_wBoCzWYQAvD_BwE%3AG%3As&amp;s_kwcid=AL%21790%213%21%21%21%21x%21%21%2119930801640%21&amp;cmp=KAC-INI-GOOGUS-GO-US_GL-EN-RE-SP-BUY-CREATE-MB_ALWAYS_ON-SHOP-BP-PMAX-ALL-CIDNA00000-PMAX-HIGH_PRIORITY&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADESMXKrfpev75Co9J2lkOP25Nq_0&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwx-CyBhAqEiwAeOcTddUudAGox-YyjLG5YqyRwm5Y0X010aLN1_VWFCeqd4oMu_ndSC7_wBoCzWYQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nook’s Crannie &amp; Rosie’s House</a> one. This particular build lets you craft Tom Nook’s signature shop plus one of the most popular villager’s houses with Rosie. One person could tackle one building while the other completes the other, or you can work on it together.</p>

These birds are in love with one another, noted by the neat heart-shaped accessory between them. The little subtle details like the tiny hearts on the base of the set add a nice touch, plus it is one of the more affordable sets out there for couples to build together. </p>

While you can certainly build this particular set together as a couple, it would be sweet to present the already completed <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/flower-bouquet-10280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bouquet</a> to your partner — perhaps even with a vase to stick it in. </p>

The stunning cabin is a great centerpiece, giving off the perfect lakeside vacation vibes. It even comes with some autumn-themed trees in the background and a canoe boat to set the scene perfectly. This gets even better if you can build this in front of a fireplace with the mood just right. </p>

But the set doesn’t stop with just the ship. In fact, you take that ship and place it within the included bottle accessory once done. This doubles as a solid decoration for your home. You can even add your own spin on it like including a hidden message inside the bottle for someone to find someday.</p>

As one of the sets on this list with the least amount of pieces, it can make for a fun activity to do outdoors while on an actual picnic date. </p>

            <p>Curious about Destiny 2's final expansion but aren't sure where to start? One of Destiny's most dedicated fans, My name is Byf, has put together a 10-hour video to bring new players (and - let's face it - existing ones, too) up to date with the sci-fi shooter's complex storyline.</p>
<p>The video is particularly good timing given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-giving-all-playstation-and-pc-players-free-access-to-three-expansions-ahead-of-the-final-shape">Sony is giving all Playstation and PC players limited-time access to three Destiny 2 expansions</a> – The Witch Queen, Beyond Light, and Shadowkeep – ahead of The Final Shape's arrival next week. Additionally, Destiny 2's current expansion, Lightfall, is available to PlayStation Plus subscribers.</p>

<p>Byf says the video details the "complete story of Destiny", from the origins of The Witness, and includes the full timeline of major events to happen in the game, as well as additional lore and backstories.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-the-final-shape-will-be-down-for-25-hours-before-launch">Destiny 2 will go offline for 25 hours</a> ahead of the launch of its final expansion, The Final Shape.</p>
<p>The downtime – which is scheduled to kick off at 5pm UK time on 3rd June (that's 9am PT, 12pm ET) and end at 7pm on 4th June – is required to prep for the new expansion, which is estimated to take up at least 129GB of free space on every platform, and almost 300GB on Steam.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/huge-destiny-2-the-final-shape-spoilers-leak-online-as-players-get-accidental-early-access">The Final Shape DLC has leaked online after the expansion was temporarily available</a> on PS5 earlier this week. Developer Bungie did eventually "kill" the servers, but not before spoilers about the story, raid, trophies, loot, and more – much, much more – swamped social media.</p>
<p>Bungie later acknowledged spoilers were shared online, and that a "small group of players" were able to access the campaign, Collections, Echoes, and "other reward info". It advised players who don't want the experience spoiled to "be very careful" on social media in the lead up to The Final Shape's release next week, and asked those who have seen the spoilers to "please be considerate of others".</p>

  <p id="TdYGWR"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23891556/netflix-tomb-raider-lara-croft-animated-series-release-date">Netflix’s new Tomb Raider animated series</a> will debut this October, the streaming company announced Saturday with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pF3ZbZRnRU">a new trailer for <em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em></a>. That trailer also teases what Lara’s new post-Survivor trilogy story will be about: a globetrotting adventure in search of a stolen artifact, naturally.</p>
<p id="S57eBx">According to Netflix’s official synopsis for the animated series, Lara Croft “has abandoned her friends to embark on increasingly more perilous solo adventures. But she must return home when a dangerous and powerful Chinese artifact is stolen from Croft Manor by a thief with an uncanny personal connection.” On her journey, Lara will “confront her true self, and decide just what kind of hero she wants to become” in <em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em>.</p>
<p id="vxt1Cr">The new series is set after the events of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/9/10/17838346/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review-xbox-one-ps4-pc"><em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em></a>, the final chapter in Crystal Dynamics’ Survivor video game trilogy — and seemingly before the events of Lara Croft’s next Tomb Raider game.</p>
<p id="cwVEPa">Powerhouse Animation, the studio behind Netflix’s <em>Castlevania</em> and <em>Master of the Universe: Revelation</em>, is producing <em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22671548/netflix-tomb-raider-cast-hayley-atwell-lara-croft-voice">Hayley Atwell</a> (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23779999/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-review-part-1-tom-cruise-never-boring"><em>Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning</em></a>, <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em>) will voice Lara Croft in the new series. Atwell will be joined by Allen Maldonado (<em>The Wonder Years</em>) as Zip and Earl Baylon, who reprises his role as Jonah Maiava from the Tomb Raider video games.</p>
<p id="3mirGR">In addition to Netflix’s new animated series, Amazon is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/27/23574923/amazon-tomb-raider-tv-series-phoebe-waller-bridge">developing a live-action Tomb Raider series</a> with the help of writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge (<em>Fleabag</em>, <em>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</em>). The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23011809/tomb-raider-new-game-unreal-engine-5">next Tomb Raider video game</a> is in development at Crystal Dynamics, and will be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23510939/tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics-amazon-games">published by Amazon</a> and run on Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p id="fC8Q6Q"><em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em> premieres on Netflix on Oct. 10.</p>

<p data-characters="303" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Rivers of London</em> was written by author Ben Aaronovitch and is a masterful series set mostly around the city of London in the UK that blends grounded police policies, a fantastical world within our own, and Aaronovitch’s own excruciatingly precise memory for the details of London’s streets. </p> <p data-characters="507" data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true">When I first picked this series up, I thought I’d be reading a murder mystery novel set in London that was grounded and offered a good twist ending. That’s not what I got, but I’m so glad it wasn’t because the <em>Rivers of London</em> series is so much better. The series has grown over time and now encompasses smaller novellas, meaning it can be difficult to understand what order to read them all. But don’t worry because I’ve got you covered with the definitive reading list.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-definitive-rivers-of-london-reading-order" data-injectable="false">The definitive <em>Rivers of London</em> reading order</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true">The definitive <em>Rivers of London</em> reading order outlined below veers away from the published order and looks more at where the books fit in the overarching timeline. As such, you’ll be reading books out of published order, so you get all the information filled in before you move on.</p>
 <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="378" data-injectable="false">I think this order works because each book is approachable without necessarily having read any of the others that came before. While the novellas fill in gaps in time, they’re also better to read as you go through the series rather than waiting to go back in time because you’ll have all the information to reference what’s going on much fresher in your mind. </p> <ul data-found-items="34" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="1738" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0"><strong><em>Foxes for Christmas </em>(2021)</strong> This book is actually an ebook that was released for free and can be read <a href="https://mailchi.mp/e646f1b0a7d4/ben-aaronovitch-newsletters-950322?e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </li> <li data-index="1"><strong><em>Nightingale: London 1966 – Tales From the Folly Short Story Collection</em> (2020)</strong></li> <li><strong><em>A dedicated Follower of Fashion – Tales From the Folly Short Story Collection</em> (2020)</strong> <ul> <li data-index="2"><strong>Graphic novel #7: <em>Action at a Distance</em> (2019)</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li data-index="3"><strong><em>Rivers of London</em> (2011)</strong></li> <li data-index="4"><strong><em>The Home Crowd Advantage – Tales From the Folly Short Story Collection</em> (2020)</strong></li> <li data-index="5"><strong><em>Tobias Winter – Meckenheim 2012 – Tales From the Folly Short Story Collection</em> (2020)</strong></li> <li data-index="6"><strong><em>Moon Over Soho</em> (2011)</strong></li> <li data-index="7"><strong><em>The Domestic – Tales From the Folly Short Story Collection</em> (2020)</strong></li> <li data-index="8"><strong><em>Whispers Under Ground</em> (2012)</strong></li> <li data-index="9" data-injectable="true"><strong><em>The Cockpit – Tales From the Folly Short Story Collection</em> (2020)</strong></li>

 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">While I’ve included the exact stories from <strong><em>Tales From the Folly Short Story Collection</em> (2020)</strong> where they fit into the definitive timeline above, this series is always growing. You could definitely save that entire book for the very end, and read the above list in order without those short stories to make everything much simpler. </p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">Note that the graphic novels, which are indented above, can be read within this order, but because they’re not the same format as the novels I don’t consider them essential. If you want to include them in your reading order, then do so where suggested as you work through the series. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Should you read the <em>Rivers of London</em> series in publication order or chronological order?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">Whether you read the <em>Rivers of London</em> series in publication or chronological order is up to you. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the chronological order, which is the one listed above, but I do enjoy reading a series in publication order.</p>
 <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">This is because the author has grown the world over the course of each book as they were released. So, if you read a series like<em> Rivers of London</em> in Chronological order, you could be missing out on the author’s knowledge of what’s to come or has already been, depending on where the books lie. </p> <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">That’s just how I prefer to read, though, and with <em>Rivers of London</em>, I’m confident Aaronovitch has presented his stories in a way that actually works incredibly well when read chronologically. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Do you have to read the <em>Rivers of London</em> graphic novels to understand the story?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">The <em>Rivers of London</em> graphic novels closely follow the main story from the books, though there are some short stories that you don’t get in the major series of books. However, they’re not essential to the reading order unless you’re a diehard fan, especially because they’re a slightly different format not everyone is looking for. </p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">I like to think of these as accompaniments to the main series, which is why they’re offset in the reading list above. If graphic novels aren’t your thing, don’t ruin the series for yourself by forcing your way through them. Instead, read them if you know you’ll enjoy what they add to the series or just need an excuse for more graphic novels in your life. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168126/in-a-violent-nature-horror-movie-gory-moment-spine-gross-but-good<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ycUD0J">I watch a good amount of horror — I’m not as devoted <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24090384/best-horror-movies-2024-how-scary">as some of my colleagues</a>, but I consider myself relatively well versed in the genre, and conditioned to the depths of depravity it occasionally explores.</p>
<p id="or3ogj">I’ve also been known to enjoy gory movies, even outside of horror. I’m <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23602798/project-wolf-hunting-gory-action-horror-movie">well documented on this particular subject</a>, especially when it comes to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24022711/mayhem-review-action-movie-farang-xavier-gens">action</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163417/kill-action-movie-thriller-indian-lakshya-train">movies</a>, where full-on gore is rare but can add extra stakes and pops of surprise to a particularly intense fight. But nothing has come close to the visceral reaction I had in response to one particularly brutal moment in the new experimental slasher movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24051853/in-violent-nature-review-sundance-horror-movie-slasher-villain"><em>In a Violent Nature</em></a>. The scene, and my reaction to it, shocked me.</p>
<p id="sG8bdz">From Canadian writer-director Chris Nash (<em>ABCs of Death 2</em>’s “Z Is for Zygote” segment), <em>In a Violent Nature </em>combines a slasher in the vein of <em>Friday the 13th</em> with the slow cinema of directors like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/20/18631794/a-hidden-life-review-terrence-malick-cannes-2019">Terrence Malick</a>. The 94-minute movie, which premiered at Sundance this January and opened in theaters on May 31, follows the point of view of its silent killer. The movie is filled with long, unbroken shots behind the killer’s shoulder as he walks through tranquil forests and fields, stalking his prey. There is no musical score. It’s a deconstruction and reinvention of the slasher genre, which largely works very well. It’s moody and atmospheric. The deliberate pacing makes the pops of gore hit even harder.</p>
<p id="keGA4B">Then we get to the scene that surprised me. I must again warn you before continuing: If you are at all squeamish, or just want to experience the gory details for yourself by watching the movie, please stop reading here. I will not judge you.</p>

<p id="LMEyfj">As the killer corners one of his victims, a young woman, near a cliff’s edge, the scene seems to be setting up a moment where she jumps to her death, or he pushes her off. Instead, the killer lodges a hook in her skull and uses the hook to pull her head down through her own stomach and out through her back. It’s extremely vivid — I get queasy just thinking about it — especially with the tremendous foley and effects work on her spine, which turns blue as the bones pop like tiny, gruesome fireworks under the strain.</p>
<p id="j4NC9s">On paper, that might sound like a cartoonish Mortal Kombat fatality. In practice, it’s startlingly real and upsetting. The combination of the contortions of the victim’s spine and the squelching and scraping noises as those bones break will continue to haunt me, which is a great credit to Nash and the entire team. </p>
<p id="rstjl3">There have been <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1578429/in-a-violent-nature-made-audience-ill/">reports of people throwing up in theaters</a> when they saw this moment, and I don’t blame them. Nash, for his part, isn’t sure whether that’s true, but he <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/in-a-violent-nature-director-audience-member-vomiting-reaction-2749600/">told Dexerto</a>, “I can’t take any pride in it, although I’m also not concerned.” If I hadn’t watched <em>In a Violent Nature</em> at home in the comfort of my couch, I could easily imagine myself joining their queasy ranks. The theater-watching experience is much more immersive, for better and for worse, depending on the movie and the audience. I could easily see this scene being overwhelming in that environment.</p>
<p id="Sj08Gr">Gore isn’t a guarantee for success in horror. It’s simply one of many tools filmmakers can use in the genre to aid a movie. But when used well, it can create unforgettable moments that permanently lodge themselves in your brain. One of the reasons I watch movies is to provoke visceral reactions. On that rubric, no movie I’ve watched in 2024 (other than <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166500/i-saw-the-tv-glow-ending-interpretations-hope-jane-schoenbrun"><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em></a>) has scored higher than <em>In a Violent Nature</em>. It’s an impressive feat for one of the year’s most fascinating movies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Like grabbing a hot drink and unwinding with a good book, Disney Dreamlight Valley makes the hours pleasantly fly by. With two beefy maps to unlock and explore, more than 30 Disney characters to befriend, and a plethora of quests to complete, this Disney-infused cozy life simulator kept me blissfully entertained for dozens of hours – even having already played a whole bunch of it during its Early Access over a year ago. But despite hitting 1.0, Dreamlight Valley still feels as unfinished as it ever has in some ways thanks to persistent bugs, a newer storyline that ends on another unsatisfying cliffhanger, and a merciless grind that not even the wonderful cast of characters can entirely compensate for. That means it still has plenty more room to grow, but this effortlessly charming town game can still feel like stepping into a therapeutic hot spring all the same.</p><p>Despite a whole lot being added since <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-review-early-access">my initial Early Access review</a>, very little has changed about the heart of Dreamlight Valley – it shrewdly puts building social links with its iconic Disney characters front and center, then places you on a nigh-endless treadmill of relaxing fetch quests to take on (preferably while covered in a pile of blankets). It doesn’t necessarily stand up to its peers in most other regards, whether that’s its village decorating, its crafting system, or the resource gathering minigames like fishing and farming, all of which are overly simplistic and occasionally monotonous on their own. But what Dreamlight Valley continues to get right is how it makes you happy to tackle those chores when you’re doing so alongside quintessential characters from your childhood, all of whom are perfectly realized and extremely well-written.</p><p>Like a Disney-laced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-for-switch">Animal Crossing</a>, you’ll walk around town catching fish with Scar, tending to your garden with Mickey Mouse, and upgrading both your home and the village shops by giving big sacks of gold to the ever-greedy Scrooge McDuck in lieu of Tom Nook. You’ll also buy and craft furniture to decorate your abode, and build houses for your growing roster of villagers to settle down in once you’ve completed a quest to unlock each one. But unlike Animal Crossing, Dreamlight Valley focuses a lot less on completing daily rituals to earn money and much more on running quests and telling stories with its memorable cast of characters, who may ask you to deliver flowers to their love interests or investigate the dark presence that’s corrupting the valley. Even if many of those quests require grinding out resources through mining ore or picking fruit from trees, the payoff is often worth it, and adding new pals to the village and leveling up your friendship level with them through questing is very rewarding.</p><p>There’s a whole heck of a lot of characters to recruit and build bonds with, from Rapunzel, whose giddy and erratic animations are just the best, to Woody, who will sometimes hilariously decide to play dead in the middle of the level like he’s waiting for Andy to leave. My current favorite is Gaston, who is probably the best written cast member so far. Egotistical, chauvinistic, and lacking the sense God promised a goat, this guy is just the worst… so obviously I had a blast spending a bunch of time hanging out with the dim knucklehead.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Adding new Disney pals to the village through questing is very rewarding.</p></div><p>Others aren’t quite as exciting, like WALL-E and EVE, who are mostly non-speaking characters that don't make for riveting company. Similarly, The Fairy Godmother and Merlin are both wise, old magicians who play very similar parental roles in the community, and I don’t know that we needed to pad out the roster with two zany fowls by including both Donald and Daisy Duck. Jack Skellington from The Nightmare Before Christmas, Vannelope from Wreck-It Ralph, and even the old school legend Oswald (who was just added to the mix recently) are all much more interesting, but with so many great options to pick from, it’s odd how many of the additions feel like repeats of one another.</p><p>So far Disney Dreamlight has two major areas to explore: Dreamlight Valley itself, and the more recently added Eternity Isle that’s available as a paid DLC. Both feature the same progression system of doing village activities like cooking and gardening to get a special material that lets you unlock new areas of the map that have more characters to recruit, all while completing quests to improve your social links with said characters and progressing through each area’s self-contained stories. In the non-DLC map, that grind is mostly paced out well, with new areas and characters unlocking just as things start to get monotonous – but in Eternity Isle, it really gets dialed up to 11, with each of the three areas on the island being divided into tiny slices of space that require <em>tons </em>of a currency called Mist to unlock. Even worse, you mostly get Mist by using an item called the Royal Hourglass to play a minigame where you essentially follow a compass to find an invisible point on the map. It’s not a very compelling way to spend your time, but it at least makes for a decent distraction from watering dried out plants.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Dreamlight Valley’s main story, which has you chasing down the physical embodiment of your childhood memories called The Forgetting, can now be completed in its entirety (having previously been drip fed via impressively meaty updates over its Early Access period), and deals with teenage anxiety and the joy of rediscovering childhood fancies in surprisingly poignant ways. It moves a bit slow as you go back to the grind between each major plot development, but the campaign, which took me well over 30 hours to complete, still ends up delivering a memorable tale that covers some serious topics without ever losing those essential, feel-good vibes. </p><p>Meanwhile, Eternity Isles has you repairing a ruined kingdom for a holographic Jafar who totally isn’t very clearly planning to betray you the entire time, but its story currently ends on an underwhelming cliffhanger that will presumably be wrapped up in due time like the original’s was. Where that main plot kept me interested with a central mystery that slowly revealed itself, so far Eternity Isles has played out like one of those super cliche stories where the obvious villain (who, in this case, is also literally a very recognizable villain from a Disney movie) tricks you into helping him obtain power, and I just don’t know if it’ll ever be able to pay off super well. But for right now it’s just an annoying dangling thread after hours of grinding, and at least that grinding is still as fun as it was on the mainland.</p><p>Aside from completing quests, hanging with characters, and unlocking or exploring new parts of these ever-expanding maps, you’ll also be able to visit the worlds of your real-life friends via multiplayer. While I hoped multiplayer functionality would offer a whole new way to enjoy Dreamlight Valley, it’s pretty limited in practice. You can only do very minor things while visiting, like steal your buddy’s vegetables or buy items from their shops, which might differ from your world. Having visitors or visiting someone else locks everyone’s ability to progress in the story or interact with NPCs, so the most important activities are completely gutted when you’re with a friend. For this reason, my friends and I mostly just hung out in the same Discord chat and played asynchronously, which is a bit of a bummer. It’s great that they included multiplayer at all, but its current implementation is mostly a wash.</p><p>On the other hand, a diversion that works out a little better is Scramblecoin, a board game you can play with any of the valley’s NPC residents. By placing miniatures of Disney characters onto a board and competing to see which player can gobble up the most coins, you get to wind down with a nice, little strategy game that serves as an excellent change of pace. And by accruing victories, you unlock new character pieces, each of which has its own movement patterns and special abilities with pros and cons to consider. It might not be the most challenging or sophisticated minigame, but it’s nice to be able to take a break from mindlessly fishing salmon out of the river to give your brain some exercise.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>TieGuyTravis' Favorite Cozy Games</h3><p>If you're looking for a game that pairs well with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea, look no further than these TieGuyTravis-approved recommendations.</p></div><p>With how solid Disney Dreamlight Valley has shaped up to be in 2024, one thing that’s a little surprising is how many bugs I ran into after returning to it. It’s certainly not as bad as it was during the Early Access period, but I still stumbled into quite a few, whether it was buildings and furniture curiously disappearing during extended play periods, menus locking up until I backed out and reloaded, or even the occasional hard crash on Xbox. This still isn’t The Stablest Place on Earth™, but it’s not so bad that it ever actively knocked me out of that good vibe groove.</p><p>To that end, developer Gameloft Montreal has been steadfastly committed to supporting Dreamlight Valley with seasonal updates, regular patches and improvements, and new content (including characters) that continue to give me reasons to return to my beloved valley. They’ve teased both Mulan characters and Tiana from The Princess and the Frog in upcoming drops, and even while I was working on this review, added Mickey’s brother Oswald. They’ve also said that Eternity Isle’s currently incomplete story will get its finale sometime this summer, so it’ll be nice to hopefully get some payoff there.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>After more than a year since its original debut, Disney Dreamlight Valley is still pretty great, with cartoonish and colorful areas to explore and loads of charming characters to meet. Hanging out with a growing roster of Disney icons is a remarkably good time, and some of the recent additions, like Gaston, made my return to the valley an even more worthwhile venture. But a lot of the shortcomings from the Early Access days haven’t necessarily improved much either, including its habit of leaving stories on a cliffhanger ending, a monstrous grind that just don’t quit, and bugs that continue to plague an otherwise good time. Still, there’s something undeniably riveting about chilling with the goofy oddballs and loveable toons from Disney’s impressive catalog, and returning to this zen-like simulator washed my troubles away like few cozy games can.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/what-quirks-does-izuku-midoriya-possess-in-my-hero-academia/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-quirks-does-izuku-midoriya-possess-in-my-hero-academia<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="384" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>My Hero Academia</em>‘s pitch is quite simple. It tells the story of a young powerless boy who aspires to be a superhero. Despite the numerous twists and turns, the series remains loyal to that idea. Izuku Midoriya’s hero journey started when All Might chose him to inherit One For All — the very same Quirk that allowed a Quirkless All Might to become the symbol of justice.</p> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">Initially, One For All is thought to only grant immense strength. As such, the user’s body must be strong enough to endure the strain of releasing that much explosive power. But as the story progressed, the mysteries involving One For All slowly unraveled. It turned out that One For All not only passes superstrength from one user to another but also the Quirks the previous users wielded.</p> <figure data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-what-quirks-does-deku-have" data-injectable="false">What Quirks does Deku have?</h2> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">Being the ninth user of One For All, Midoriya, also known by his hero alias Deku, inherited the Quirks of the previous eight users. Given that both he and All Might were Quirkless before inheriting One For All, Midoriya only has seven Quirks in possession. The Quirks he has are <strong>One For All</strong>, <strong>Gearshift</strong>, <strong>Fa Jin</strong>, <strong>Danger Sense</strong>, <strong>Blackwhip</strong>, <strong>Smokescreen</strong>, and <strong>Float</strong>.</p> <p data-characters="532" data-current-count="891" data-injectable="true">One For All, obviously, has a complex history. It all started with All For One handing a stockpiling Quirk to his supposed Quirkless younger brother, Yoichi Shigaraki. That same stockpiling Quirk can also exponentially boost the user’s physical abilities, from strength to endurance. But unbeknownst to everyone at the time, Yoichi wasn’t actually Quirkless. He did possess a Quirk that allowed him to pass it from one user to another. This Quirk merged with the stockpiling Quirk, ultimately giving rise to One For All.</p>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Kudo, the second wielder of One For All, has a Quirk called Gearshift. As its name suggests, it allows the user to change the speed and/or velocity of its target. The user can use it on themselves or anything they touch. Fa Jin, the third user Bruce’s Quirk, also works in a simple manner. Fa Jin lets its user store kinetic energy, which can be released at the user’s convenience.</p> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="769" data-injectable="true">Danger Sense is perhaps Midoriya’s most-used Quirk. He may have discovered it later that One For All, but he kept the fourth user’s Quirk active at all times, especially during his stint as a dark hero. After all, Danger Sense can detect any threat within the user’s vicinity. For Midoriya, the warning comes via a stabbing sensation at the back of his head.</p>
 <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">Blackwhip, the fifth user Daigoro Banjo’s Quirk, generates black tendrils that the users can manipulate as extensions of themselves. It’s the perfect Quirk to grab faraway objects ala Spiderman. It’s also the first Quirk that manifested other than One For All’s usual physical enhancements.</p> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="false">The sixth user’s Quirk, Smokescreen, grants Midoriya the power to emit purple smoke, which he utilizes to obscure his opponents’ vision. The final Quirk, Float, is as simple as it comes. It gives the user the ability to remain in mid-air. Using Float jointly with the other Quirks ultimately allows Midoriya to fly.</p>

            <p>Valve has filed to trademark Deadlock, the hero shooter the company still won't confirm exists.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1796434450500419747">Gabe Follower</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/valve-has-now-filed-for-a-trademark-for-deadlock-the-hero-shooter-it-refuses-to-admit-exists/">PC Gamer</a>), <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/98576353">Valve's trademark application</a> is pending approval, but the developer has applied for trademark protection for the term Deadlock across the categories of "entertainment services, namely, providing video games; provision of online entertainment, namely, online computer games; games services provided by means of the Internet". It was filed on Thursday, 30th May, 2024.</p>

<p>Of course, a trademark filing is just that, and is by no means evidence that Valve has a game of that name in development, or even proves that a game in mid-production will ever be released.</p>
<p>However, on top of the leaks that have been circulating for a couple of weeks now, it's hard to imagine this is another "Neon Prime", a different Valve trademark never came to be. Leaked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/images-leak-of-valves-next-game-and-its-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter">details of Deadlock sprung onto the internet last week</a> via images posted to social media and a report from longterm Valve reporter Tyler McVicker, which claimed that Deadlock was currently in closed testing. Shortly after, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-leaked-footage-of-valves-new-game-deadlock">gameplay footage also leaked</a>, showing off Deadlock's training mode, more hero characters, and the existence of BioShock Infinite-style skyrails you can hook onto and ride around on.</p>
<p>As Tom pointed out for us at the time the leak went viral, the sci-fi setting of the game looks distinct from that of any Valve game setting so far - so no, this isn't a new Half-Life spin-off. Hopefully – with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">Summer Game Fest right around the corner</a> – we'll find out more about it soon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-best-horror-anime-of-all-time.887274/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-horror-anime-of-all-time/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-horror-anime-of-all-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="385" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A fantastic way to watch horror as a kid — that you definitely didn’t hear from this website — is anime. Parents won’t suspect these beautifully animated stories for kids to hide some of the most messed-up stuff you can imagine, but we all know that they sure can. Let’s look at the best outings in the horror genre that we got by the hands of Japanese Animation.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Elfen Lied</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Elfen Lied’s Poster</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="629" data-current-count="929" data-injectable="true">Elfen Lied has arguably the most famously gruesome opening in the history of anime. The series never reaches those all-time gory heights again, opting instead to create a very heartwarming narrative where the evil monster loses their memory and becomes the nicest creature on earth. The true horror of <em>Elfen Lied</em> lies in the constant fear of wondering if the beautiful tale will once again turn bad, because the first episode does a great job of showing just <em>how bad</em> things can turn out. Sadly, the <em>Elfen Lied</em> anime doesn’t tell the whole tale we see in the Manga, but it’s still absolutely worth your time and tears.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Parasyte</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="532" data-injectable="true">Alien invasion stories are as common and old as the government’s attempts to keep them quiet, so there must be something special about <em>Parasyte</em> to earn it various series, live action adaptations, and even a spot on this list. </p>
 <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false"><em>Parasyte</em> rules because it shows the story of an average Joe who has to contend not just with seeing his world invaded by the slickest and scariest alien lifeforms to ever (dis)grace the world of anime, but also with being partially infected by one of these lifeforms himself. The uneasy dynamic is awesome, but so are the scares and the action scenes.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust</h2> <figure data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via MUBI</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">As far as vampire-themed properties go, I’d rank <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-post-apocalyptic-movies-like-fallout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust</a></em> as one of the best out of any medium. Yes, it’s up there with <em>Bram Stoker’s Dracula</em> and much better than whatever <em>Blade</em> movie you like the most. It features some of the most original art and best animation I’ve ever seen, and does a surprisingly good job of creating a badass vampire hunter main character who’s not all style over substance. </p>
 <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="139" data-injectable="false"><em>Bloodlust</em> is a sequel of sorts to <em>Vampire Hunter D</em>, a much inferior outing that you can luckily just skip over if you want to see this one.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories aka Yami Shibai: Theatre of Darkness</h2> <figure data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"><em>Yami Shibai </em>boasts one of the most peculiar art styles out there, seemingly going all in on the classic harmless kid’s coloring book style, though it’s only using that to get your defenses down to later hit you with a gut punch.</p> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><em>Yami Shibai</em> features the best ratio of time spent/horror out there, as most episodes are very short, each serving almost like a quick shot of adrenaline. Best of all, there’s no shortage of small horror shots as there are already 12 seasons and counting.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Boogiepop Phantom</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="543" data-current-count="843" data-injectable="true">Boogiepop Phantom is the perfect name for a horror anime because it lures you in with a goofy name, then gets you with a spooky one. Just like a great jump scare! Jokes aside, the anime itself is just as good as its peculiar name. A strange beam of light, serial killings, monstrous superpowers, and an ancient ghost that may or may not be behind it all. <em>Boogiepop Phantom</em> uses a peculiar story structure that makes it both a great anthology that you can digest little by little, or something you can binge if you have a strong enough stomach.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Monster</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="202" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true">Though it features a very traditional animation style, <em>Monster</em> is one of the most unique anime on this list. A very somber take on the genre that never betrays its calm pacing in favor of quick thrills.</p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">What <em>Monster</em> intentionally lacks in jump scares, it more than makes up for with psychological horror. <em>Monster</em> invites players to go for a deep dive into the psyche of one of the vilest characters in the history of anime and manga, and they’re likely to never forget about it.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Gantz</h2> <figure data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>image via MUBI</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">As far as wild takes on sci-fi horror go, it’s hard to beat <em>Gantz</em>. It tells the story of a bunch of unlucky few who die and then somehow wake up to be forcefully employed by the titular Gantz to go on increasingly deadly missions.</p> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">Whereas most other anime would feature characters that would relish the opportunity, the characters in <em>Gantz </em>realistically have a lot of trouble dealing with what their lives have turned into. <em>Gantz</em> feels like an adaptation of a game that should exist. </p>
 <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="163" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, the series ends before telling the entire story present in the Manga, but I assure you that this half-trip is more than worth the full ticket price.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Berserk</h2> <figure data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="544" data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true"><em>Berserk</em>, the original, not the awful series from 2015, remains one of the staples of anime. It features the grand scope that the best anime adaptation of <em>Lord Of The Rings</em> would require, and also small scale drama worthy of the great masters of old. Still, at its heart, <em>Berserk</em> is a tale of horror about how the idea of great power gets to corrupt even larger-than-life men. <em>Berserk</em> is one of the best horror stories ever told because it features great visual horror as well as some of the deepest personal horror you’ll ever encounter. </p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">It’s important to note, however, that <em>Berserk</em> does get too extreme with its themes and imagery at some points, and I say that not to hype readers even further. Viewer discretion is certainly advised.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Pet Shop Of Horrors</h2> <figure data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via MUBI</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">Do the eyes of Count D, which you can see even behind her hair, make you uneasy? Well, then you should really give <em>Pet Shop Of Horrors</em> a try, as there’s much more where that came from. Though rather short at only four episodes-long, this anthology about a possibly cursed story with a very interesting owner is very likely to entertain anyone who loves animals, and to scare straight anyone who doesn’t treat their pets like they should.</p>
 <h2 id="h-mononoke" data-injectable="false">Mononoke</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true">Please do not accidentally start watching this thinking you were about to watch <em>Princess Mononoke.</em> Though both are amazing and feature brilliant animation, this one will plunge viewers into a much darker world.</p>
 <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false"><em>Mononoke</em> tells the story of a healer of sorts, one who will heal the world by facing actual demons. <em>Mononoke</em> offers a “healthy” mix of regular and psychological horror, the latter which is greatly boosted by the series’ very peculiar art style. Though far from the scariest entry on this list, <em>Mononoke</em> is the perfect example of true horror hiding behind pretty pictures.</p>

<p data-characters="368" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>One-Punch Man</em> is known for housing some of the anime world’s zaniest characters, but don’t let their inconspicuous appearance fool you. Many of <em>One-Punch Man</em>‘s characters are <em>insanely strong</em>, to the point that obliterating Earth would be comparable to a grocery run. If you’re wondering which characters I’m talking about, then scroll on.</p> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="315" data-injectable="false">Before anything else, however, a warning is necessary. Some characters and details from recent manga developments are included in this article. If you’re one of the many (me included) waiting for the elusive third season of the anime and still haven’t caught up to the manga, then don’t scroll on.</p> <figure data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-10-platinum-spermatozoon" data-injectable="false">10. Platinum Spermatozoon</h2> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">Platinum Spermatozoon is the final form of Black Spermatozoon, and a former executive of the Monster Association. Platinum Sperm may not have the best character inspiration, but it’s undeniably one of the strongest monsters in the series. It boasts incredible speed, power, and endurance.</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">During the Monster Association Arc, Platinum Sperm managed to go toe-to-toe with monsterized Garo and the S-Class Hero Flashy Flash. Their high-speed exchanges even left behind a spectacle that could teach constellations a thing or two about how to present themselves.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-9-centisennin" data-injectable="false">9. Centisennin</h2> <p data-characters="515" data-current-count="815" data-injectable="true">Centisennin is the latest — and perhaps the last — centipede monster introduced in the manga. It is introduced as the “Incarnation of Father Earth,” which should show how strong Centisennin is. I mean, the Earth can’t be weak, right? Centisennin’s sheer size is already a force to be reckoned with. When it straightened itself during its fight with Garo, Centisennin easily reached the Earth’s atmosphere. However, size isn’t the only thing that makes Centisennin terrifying.</p>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">Like its younger kin, Centisennin is one tough nut to crack. Most physical attacks can’t even make a dent in its carapace, and those that can are almost instantaneously regenerated. The only means of defeating it is locating and destroying its ever-shifting regeneration core.</p> <figure data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-8-evil-ocean-water" data-injectable="false">8. Evil Ocean Water</h2> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">If Centisennin is the Incarnation of Father Earth, then Evil Ocean Water is the Incarnation of Mother Ocean. Similar to the centipede, Evil Ocean Water is nearly impossible to obliterate. It’s one of the very few individuals who survived Saitama’s serious attacks. It can assimilate with any liquid, allowing it to grow massively.</p> <p data-characters="178" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true">While it does not necessarily have the strongest attacks, Evil Ocean Water can still hold itself in a fight. After all, its water jets take down A-Class heroes without a problem.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-7-psychos" data-injectable="false">7. Psychos</h2> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">Psychos, on her own, doesn’t deserve to belong on this list. While she’s a powerful esper in her own right, the likes of Platinum Spermatozoon would make an easy work out of her. However, that changes as she assimilates with Orochi, the Monster King.</p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">Their fusion, also known as Psychorochi or Pyschos-Orochi, incredibly boosts Psychos’ fighting prowess. Before you say that’s cheating, it’s not (probably) since she retains control over the fusion. In that form, Psychos fended off numerous S-Class heroes. Her beam also cut a chunk of the Earth like butter.</p> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>screenshot via Crunchyroll Games X</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-6-tornado" data-injectable="false">6. Tornado</h2> <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">Tornado is officially known as the second-strongest hero, and she definitely gives her title justice. She’s undeniably the strongest psychic in the series, and there’s little chance that’s changing soon. Tornado can make buildings crumble without breaking a sweat and send gigantic boulders with a single thought. Heck, she twisted the entire Z-City to take down the Psychos-Orochi fusion.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via VIZ Media YouTube</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-5-boros" data-injectable="false">5. Boros</h2> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">Boros is one of the first villains introduced in <em>One-Punch Man</em>, but that doesn’t mean he’s on the weaker side. Contrary to that, many fans believe Boros is the strongest opponent Saitama faced. And there may be some truth to that.</p>
 <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">Boros is a born fighter. He is so strong that he has to wear restraining armor and scour the universe to find someone to rival his might. As a testament to his strength, Boros, in his Meteoric Burst Form, sent Saitama to the Moon with a single knee strike.</p> <figure data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">4. Blast</h2> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Acknowledged as the strongest hero by the Hero Association, Blast is certainly one of the strongest characters in the series. Unfortunately, Blast’s full capability is yet to be shown. Nonetheless, what little we know about his character is enough to put him in fourth place. After all, Blast is the only hero other than Saitama who could give Cosmic Fear Mode Garo a good fight. </p> <figure data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-3-garo" data-injectable="false">3. Garo</h2> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Starting as a genius martial artist, Garo’s rise to power is a sight to behold. What makes Garo terrifying is his almost limitless potential. Not only can he adapt to almost any situation, but he can also make his enemies’ abilities his own.</p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="524" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, he can only go too high. Despite giving Saitama the greatest fight of his life (yet), he ultimately fails to take down the bald hero. Even so, it’s undeniable that Garo can take down those listed above by imitating Saitama’s Killer Move series.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via VIZ Media</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-2-god" data-injectable="false">2. God</h2> <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">God is perhaps the most enigmatic character in the entire series. Little is known about its character, but what we know of this individual (or is it individuals?) is that they’re really damn strong.</p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">Living up to their name, God bestows divine power to those their chosen ones. That’s how Homeless Emperor became a powerhouse despite being a nobody. But God isn’t all benevolent. Taking that scrumptious-looking divine power comes with a high cost. The moment God changes their mind and retrieves that power back, almost nothing remains from the victim.</p> <figure data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-1-saitama" data-injectable="false">1. Saitama</h2> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false">As the titular character, Saitama is undeniably the strongest in his verse. He obliterates each and every one of his opponents with a single punch. Well, except Garo, who he defeated with his causality-defying Zero Punch.</p> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="false">Probably the only existence in the entire series who can match Saitama’s power level is God. Both characters’ feats defy logic. But given that Saitama already learned how to harness God’s power once, there’s a great chance he can do it again to give God’s smug face a good beating. </p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-game-might-release-this-year-says-jeff-grubb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported </a>earlier this year via rumors, Sony announced a new Astro Bot game coming to PlayStation 5 on September 6. Following the State of Play <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal</a>, Team Asobi Creative Director Nicolas Doucet talked about the game in an interview with <a href="https://ew.com/astro-bot-2024-game-playstation-cameos-exclusive-8655347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, describing the new Astro Bot as the studio's biggest-ever game thanks to eighty levels spread across six planets.</p>
<p><em>The charm of Astro and how he resonated with people went beyond what we expected. At that point, we decided to make a big game. We wanted to make a big game. This is really about going up one notch — really several notches — and having Astro's big story. We call it Astro Bot because we treat this as a new beginning. That's a really, really big game. I think for us, that's the biggest game we've ever made.</em></p>
<p><em>The core effort has gone into making Astro's own game so that he can stand on his own feet as a new PlayStation character with a good reputation and confidence. But also on top of that, there is this whole coating of nostalgia.</em></p>
<p>This makes sense since Team Asobi <a href="https://wccftech.com/team-asobi-gets-bigger-will-work-on-a-franchise-for-all-ages-with-global-appeal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got larger</a> three years ago in preparation for this game. Astro Bot&nbsp;will feature lots of cameos from other PlayStation characters. Just in the reveal trailer, we've seen Kratos from God of War. Doucet added:</p>
<p><em>It's a kind of eye candy. There's going to be more. We're going to be talking over time about what they mean to the game, but, yes, there's going to be a big reunion. There's a lot of characters from the PlayStation universe crossing over with Astro's path. It's an Astro Bot story, of course, with Astro being the main character, but there's a lot of PlayStation characters that play a part.</em></p>
<p>There will be many other nods to different franchises and stories, too.</p>
<p><em>I would say it's pop culture in general in a very broad sense. That's something we've always done as part of our games — look at iconic real-world inspirations, a lot of them from Hollywood movies or famous animation — and looking at themes that really cross generations.</em></p>
<p>Are you looking forward to this new game? Let us know below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halt-and-catch-fire-understood-video-games-better-than-any-other-show.887265/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168298/halt-catch-fire-video-games-anniversary-best-show<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="vLrnuU">Despite numerous advances in the medium, video games largely remain something of a (usually solitary) frivolity, at least when it comes to on-screen depictions. Even when a show is ostensibly <em>about</em> games — your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23166678/players-review-league-of-legends-paramount-plus"><em>Players</em></a>, your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/sdcc/23205812/mythic-quest-season-3-teaser"><em>Mythic Quest</em></a>s — it’s really all about the interactions that occur outside the games, or the process of their creation. </p>
<p id="n6ZrzH"><em>Halt and Catch Fire</em> would appear to fit into this. The much-beloved AMC show made no secret of the fact that it was never really about the technology covered in a season; in the words of Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace), the computer was always “the thing that gets us to the thing,” a vector for connection, expression, or some other deeper human need. In that way, <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em> understands the draw of video games better than any show that’s come before it. </p>
<p id="emMy01">It would first demonstrate this in its second season when — in the aftermath of a scandal and a company liquidation — Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis) left computer company Cardiff Electric to form Mutiny, a primitive attempt at online gaming. The seed for the rest of the season comes when Donna Clark (Kerry Bishé) notices two players still connected after finishing a game, spurring the creation of a chat board. Even with the limitations of dial-up and 1-bit graphics, people still found ways to communicate. </p>
<p id="Zgu53d">Many shows set in the ’80s would feature <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24001610/super-mario-bros-speedrun-nintendo-nes-tool-assisted-niftski"><em>Super Mario Bros.</em> on the NES</a>. But not many would follow two adults over the course of several days trying to beat it, giving tips on how to get past a tricky area, and trading off when one gets tired so they don’t have to restart the long ordeal again, all ending with them having grown closer to each other as well as with a deeper understanding of the people in their orbits. It’s less about nostalgia and more proving how technology — no matter how rudimentary — can lead to moments of insight and catharsis. </p>
<div id="D5Jevx"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lb7SGxtu2P4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="4plYYa">Season 4 takes this idea and furthers the distance: Cam has released a new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/myst/6576"><em>Myst</em></a><em>-</em>like game called <em>Pilgrim</em> that no one seems to understand. No one, that is, except for Donna, who solves it all on her own. By this point in the show, Cam and Donna have had a falling out, whatever bond they had shared that made them such great co-owners destroyed by hubris and backstabbing. It’s a beautiful scene, one that taps into Cam’s desire to make a sort of higher art form through her games, and Donna remembering when she used to actually <em>do </em>something, problem solving rather than funding projects. It spurs on their hasty reconnection, and one of <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em>’s many strengths is the willingness to let each part of the ensemble be the villain for a season or so. Donna’s betrayal still stings; she’s pushing people to make a competitor to her friends’ new company. But there’s always an understanding of where someone’s coming from, and in this case, it’s a desire — subconscious or otherwise — to apologize and fix a relationship that might be broken beyond repair. <em>Pilgrim </em>is a perfect symbol for their relationship, and the idea that there can be 100 people who play your game, but you just need one person who understands it. </p>
<p id="olk3sG"><em>Halt and Catch Fire</em> excels at these small moments of beauty, sometimes as simple as the way a certain line is read. Video games aren’t always the main plotline, but it understands the inherent draw of them, both in their communal aspects and artistic prospects. After all, what is a game like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24151337/animal-well-review-pc-ps5-switch"><em>Animal Well</em></a> or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/outer-wilds-guide/2019/7/19/20700735/beginners-tips-timer-nova-puzzles-explore-mystery-ship-log-damage-repair-heal"><em>Outer Wilds</em></a> but an attempt to draw you into the minds of the creators while simultaneously leaning on others for support? The characters may have failed and failed again over the course of the show, but they’ll never stop searching for that burst of connection no matter where it might be found. </p>
<p id="7bsOo8"><small><em>Halt and Catch Fire</em></small><small> is streaming on The Roku Channel and AMC Plus.</small></p>

<p data-characters="243" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In the world of <em>Demon Slayer</em>, the Demon Slayer Corps is humanity’s last line of defense against Kibutsuji Muzan and his man-eating army. Unfortunately, however, not all Demon Slayers can hold their ground against the vile monstrosities. </p> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">The average Demon Slayer may be able to fight and even eliminate lower-ranked demons on their own, but they are helpless prey to stronger ones, especially the Upper Ranks. The only Demon Slayers who can match these powerful monsters are the Hashira.</p> <h2 id="h-the-hashira-are-the-strongest-demon-slayers" data-injectable="false">The Hashira are the strongest Demon Slayers</h2> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">The Hashira is the highest achievable rank for a Demon Slayer. Unlike many organizations, the Hashira title is earned and not just handed out, especially since the Hashira are the strongest warriors among all the Demon Slayers.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Hashira Training Arc  |  OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7w5Vfjozzb8?list=PLrNN1YufWexzXXmqHKw_MMuP3J44jhQ-W" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">Each Hashira is a master of a Breathing Style, which can either be taught to them or developed by them. They are strong enough to make easy work of the average demons, as well as hold their ground against Muzan’s strongest henchmen — the Twelve Demon Moons.</p>
 <p data-characters="66" data-current-count="66" data-injectable="false">When Tanjiro joined the corps, there were nine Hashira. They were:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false"> <li>Kyojuro Rengoku – Flame Hashira</li> <li>Tengen Uzui – Sound Hashira </li> <li>Mitsuri Kanroji – Love Hashira</li> <li>Gyomei Himejima – Stone Hashira</li> <li>Muichiro Tokito – Mist Hashira</li> <li>Obanai Iguro – Snake Hashira</li> <li>Giyu Tomioka – Water Hashira</li> <li>Shinobu Kocho – Insect Hashira</li> </ul> <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="591" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, Rengoku was felled by Akaza and Tengen was incapacitated during the Entertainment District Arc. In the latest season of the anime, the Hashira Training Arc, only seven Hashira remain active.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-become-a-hashira" data-injectable="false">How to become a Hashira?</h2> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">To become a Hashira, a Demon Slayer must prove their capabilities. There are two known ways to do that. The first is to either slay 50 demons while still at Kinoe rank or defeat a Demon Moon. The other option is to become a Hashira’s Tsuguko, which is basically both their protégé and successor.</p> <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">Becoming a Tsuguko is also a task of its own. It’s a position that can be applied for, but it is ultimately up to the Hashira whether to accept the application. The Hashira may also scout and recruit their own Tsuguko, as what Rengoku tried to do to Tanjiro. </p>
 <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="158" data-injectable="false">While becoming a Tsuguko almost guarantees becoming a Hashira, that will only come to fruition should the Tsuguko’s respective Hashira perish or retire.</p>

<p data-characters="174" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that <em>Demon Slayer </em>is all about demon slaying. However, that is easier said than done, as those actual demons are in no way weak. </p> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">Eliminating even the tiniest of demons is already a laudable feat; which is why the titular group constantly hones its forces in preparation to face the mightiest of foes. But, interestingly enough, the one at its helm is not a swordsman with unparalleled skills but a dying man named Kagaya Ubuyashiki. </p> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">Kagaya Ubuyashiki has always been painted as physically pained. Despite attempting to train himself in swordsmanship, his body simply cannot endure the physical strain. And in the latest season of the <em>Demon Slayer </em>anime, the Hashira Training Arc, Kagaya has become too weak to even sit down and face the Hashira. So, what’s actually plaguing him?</p>
 <h2 id="h-kagaya-ubuyashiki-is-cursed" data-injectable="false">Kagaya Ubuyashiki is cursed</h2> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">Kagaya isn’t the first Ubuyashiki to suffer from this condition, and that’s because Kagaya isn’t merely dealing with a disease but, a curse — a curse so potent that it affects the entire Ubuyashiki bloodline. The curse stems from the fact that Kibutsuji Muzan, the forefather of demons, shares a blood relation with the Ubuyashiki Clan from a thousand years back.</p> <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true">The curse causes the Ubuyashikis’ bodies to be physically weak and continuously deteriorate. The spreading scars on Kagaya’s face are a manifestation of that curse. Now that the curse has already spread down to Kagaya’s body and hands, he no longer has the strength to get up. </p>
 <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="524" data-injectable="false">Given their physique, most of the Ubuyashikis don’t live to 30. The curse is also more fatal for males, as the other Ubuyushakis have the option to escape their accursed fate by marrying outside the family at the age of 13. Even though their circumstances are quite dire, all hope is not lost. There’s a way to dispel the curse. All they have to do is eliminate the source of the curse — Kibutsuji Muzan himself. As such, the Ubuyashiki family has made it their mission to kill the Demon King once and for all.</p>

<p>"A total of 344 songs on 9 CDs, including songs from the game and songs used in trailers," explains the item description. "The total recording time is approximately 11 hours.</p>
<p>This edition includes "a three-sided luxury box with tall size digipak" and "a sword-shaped USB, which contains high-resolution and 5.1-channel sound sources, allowing you to experience the magnificent game world in greater depth and higher definition".</p>

<p>Each disc includes markings familiar to anyone who's spent time with the game, and comes in a hefty box to keep the CDs safe. However, the Master Sword USB that contains digital copies of the tracks is likely to be the main draw for most fans.</p>
<p>If you don't have a spare £200 hanging around, you can still enjoy the soundtrack on popular streaming services like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6VQ05hTl7qZGLVuAv0PsRn?si=d69d98f05f024211">Spotify</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-just-dropped-another-batch-of-brilliant-game-soundtracks-onto-spotify">Sony also recently added the soundtracks for games like Gravity Rush, Shadow of the Colossus, Wild Arms, and PoPoLoCrois</a> to Spotify and other streaming platforms, joining other free-to-stream OSTs for games like Bloodborne, Destiny, Elden Ring, Silent Hill, and Final Fantasy.</p>
<p>"For Breath of the Wild, Nintendo <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/breath-of-the-wild-composers-on-changing-up-zeldas-music-formula-and-more/">lightened the soundtrack</a> even as it brushed away the heavily telegraphed optional activities that fill most open worlds, reducing the musical component to a troupe of travelling performers who seem as lost in this landscape as you are," Eurogamer contributor, Edwin, wrote in his fantastic feature, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/can-tears-of-the-kingdom-match-the-sly-genius-of-breath-of-the-wilds-music">Can Tears of the Kingdom match the sly genius of Breath of the Wild's music?</a></p>
<p>"Sometimes the piano feels like it's trying to play you, in multiple senses. It wants you to feel pleasantly lost in a world whose smiling desolation is always bringing you to a halt, mesmerised, even as every curve of the road throws up some gently magnetic object of interest. Other times, it sounds like it's reacting to your movements, swept along behind as you race for the next landmark, or knocked askew as you slide off the critical path to investigate a cracked rockface. One of the great surprises of Breath of the Wild, for me, was learning that while the soundtrack is layered and dynamic - it has escalating tiers of combat music, for instance - the piano isn't fully context-sensitive."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/all-one-piece-manga-spinoffs-listed-and-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all-one-piece-manga-spinoffs-listed-and-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="294" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>One Piece</em> has a number of spinoff mangas. These range from sharing Ace’s story to following Sanji as he cooks delectable meals for his friends. The stories provide windows into the lives of side characters while also providing various art styles starkly contrasting with the main series. </p> <p data-characters="113" data-current-count="113" data-injectable="false">Without much ado, here is an explanation of every <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/one-piece-chapter-1116-release-date-time-and-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em> manga</a> spinoff, all of which can be found on <a href="https://www.viz.com/search?search=one+piece" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VizMedia</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-ace-s-story" data-injectable="false">Ace’s Story</h2> <figure data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Official Manga Trailer | One Piece: Ace’s Story—The Manga | VIZ" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpaga_3BWfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">Ace’s Story begins by following Ace on his pirating adventures before joining the White Beard Pirates. To avoid heavy spoilers, I won’t discuss the plot details or nuances. I will say that, as a fan of both Ace and <em>One Piece</em> as a whole, I thoroughly enjoyed this spinoff and highly recommend it. </p> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true">The art is drawn by Boichi. Many of you may be familiar with his work, as he also draws for <em>Dr. Stone</em>. This particular artist shines thanks to his attention to detail, showcased through his gorgeous and incredibly consistent panel work. Though very different from Eichiro Oda’s own art style, the mangaka’s style exceptionally highlights Ace’s personality. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Naoshi Komi Covers Vivi’s Adventure</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">This particular one-shot is a redraw of a preexisting manga chapter. As the title states, Naoshi Komi covers Vivi’s adventure. Specifically, they cover chapter 216. For those unaware, Naoshi Komi is the artist for <em>Nisekoi</em>, a romance manga. </p>
 <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false">Unlike Boichi’s art, which utilizes harsh lines to highlight details, Naoshi Komi’s recreation of <em>One Piece</em> utilizes smooth lines to create a soft mood. This spinoff doesn’t provide any new narrative or lore but rather allows you to relive a favorite moment in a different light. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Boichi Sensei covers the Zolo vs. Mihawk Battle</h2> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">Similar to the previous entry, <em>Boichi Sensei covers the Zolo vs. Mihawk Battle</em> is a redrawing of a preexisting event in the original manga, again illustrated by Dr. Stone artist Boichi. The art is incredibly detailed and provides a vastly different reading experience compared to Eichiro Oda’s typical weekly entries. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Shokugeki no Sanji </h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Official Manga Trailer | Shokugeki no Sanji | VIZ" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1AQ9HM4XYpM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="593" data-injectable="true">Are there any Food Wars fans here? I have great news for you. Shun Saeki, the artist for Shokugeki no Soma, gives Sanji a new life. He creates incredibly fancy dishes, dazzling all those lucky enough to feast on his masterpieces. The narrative is set before Sanji joins the Straw Hat Pirates. </p>
 <p data-characters="92" data-current-count="92" data-injectable="false">The artist created it while participating in an event to promote and commemorate <em>One Piece</em>. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Monsters</h2> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">To be honest, I might be stretching it a bit by calling <em>Monsters </em>a <em>One Piece</em> manga spinoff. In actuality, this is a one-shot Eichiro Oda made before <em>One Piece,</em> and it doesn’t make its relation to <em>One Piece </em>too obvious. However, most <em>One Piece</em> fans don’t realize the character in Monsters is referenced a number of times. </p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">The main character of Monsters has the same name as Ryoma, a legendary swordsman from <em>One Piece</em>. This is the skeleton Brook’s shadow takes over on Thriller Bark. According to <em>One Piece</em>, Ryoma is a samurai from Wano Kingdom who slays a dragon. In <em>Monsters</em>, he’s a wandering ronin. </p>

<p data-characters="134" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Almost all the <em>EA FC 24</em> TOTS players are now available in Ultimate Team, and there’s a massive collection of cards to pick from.</p> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">The Team of the Season events introduced special cards from all five major European leagues. EA Sports also introduced the TOTS lineup from the women’s leagues, along with names from the rest of the world. The list of available choices has never been longer, which also makes it tricky to identify the best <em>EA FC 24</em> TOTS players for all positions.</p> <h2 id="h-best-ea-fc-24-tots-players-by-position" data-injectable="false">Best EA FC 24 TOTS players by position</h2> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true">Thanks to the vast number of TOTS cards released in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-ultimate-team-felipe-anderson-end-of-an-era-sbc-solutions/">Ultimate Team</a>, every position is pretty well covered. EA Sports has also released TOTS Plus items, which make it easier for players to keep squad chemistry pretty high even if they’re using items from the Mixed Leagues.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="14" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0">GK: Alisson, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Yann Sommer</li> <li data-index="1">RB: Jeremie Frimpong, Ona Batlle (SBC), Joao Cancelo, Dani Carvajal</li> <li data-index="2">LB: Alex Grimaldo, Theo Hernandez, Kai Havertz (SBC), Sakina Karchaoui</li> <li data-index="3">CB: Virgil Van Dijk, Sergio Ramos, Alessandro Bastoni</li> <li data-index="4">RWB: Jeremie Frimpong, Joao Cancelo, Ona Batlle (SBC)</li> <li data-index="5">LWB: Kai Havertz (SBC), Sakina Karchaoui, Selma Bacha, Theo Hernandez</li> <li data-index="6">CDM: Rodri, Declan Rice, Grace Geyoro</li> <li data-index="7">CM: Jude Bellingham, Zaire-Emery, Kevin De Bruyne, Luka Modric</li> <li data-index="8">CAM: Aitana Bonmati, Alex Putellas, Lionel Messi</li> <li data-index="9">RM: Ousmane Dembele, Caroline Hansen, Mohamed Salah</li> <li data-index="10">LM: Vinicius, Neymar, Salma Paralluelo</li> <li data-index="11">LW: Vinicius, Neymar, Kylian Mbappe</li> <li data-index="12">RW: Lionel Messi, Caroline Hansen, Lauren James</li> <li data-index="13">CF/ST: Erling Haaland, Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann, Cristiano Ronaldo</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">Do note that some of the best <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-players-to-use-in-ea-fc-24-ultimate-tots-glow-up-evolution/"><em>EA FC 24</em> TOTS players</a> are available in packs as of writing. The Ultimate TOTS has reintroduced some of the best items, so it makes a lot of sense to open all your saved packs. You can also buy these items from the market, but most of them are pretty costly (despite the higher supply from packs).</p>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">Additionally, new End of an Era and Flashback SBCs will be released every day during Ultimate TOTS. These cards have great stats, and the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-ultimate-team-thiago-silva-end-of-an-era-sbc-tasks-solutions/">Thiago Silva EOAE item</a> is undoubtedly among the better defenders currently available in Ultimate Team.</p>

<p data-characters="297" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The newest season of<em> Demon Slayer</em> follows the main cast of characters as they train to eventually fight against Mugen’s demons.

<p id="TRcBF9"><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Criterion Channel<br><strong>Genre: </strong>Action thriller<br><strong>Director: </strong>John Carpenter<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Austin Stoker, Darwin Joston, Laurie Zimmer</p>
<p id="Kdvbem">Often imitated but never outdone, John Carpenter’s 1976 crime thriller is one of the tensest 91 minutes ever put on screen, and now it’s on the Criterion Channel as a part of its “Synth Soundtracks” collection. Carpenter’s second feature film (following <em>Dark Star</em>, and just two years before <em>Halloween </em>changed everything), the movie follows a police officer (Austin Stoker) and a convicted murderer (Darwin Joston) who team up to defend the titular precinct from a heavily armed street gang.</p>
<p id="bfVPUU">Made on a shoestring budget of approximately $100,000, the original <em>Assault on Precinct 13 </em>is a master class of efficient filmmaking, using the closed-in setting of the movie to maximum effect in building tension and staging action sequences. It’s also an early peek at many of the skills that would make Carpenter one of the great masters of genre filmmaking. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="GdXYpc"><strong>Genre: </strong>Dramedy<br><strong>Director: </strong>Sean Baker<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Kitana Kiki Rodriguez, Mya Taylor, James Ransone</p>
<p id="NMn6bX">Director Sean Baker just became the first American to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/25/nx-s1-4981452/anora-wins-palme-dor-cannes-film-festival">win the Palme d’Or</a> since Terrence Malick won for <em>The Tree of Life </em>in 2011. Baker’s new movie, <em>Anora</em>, follows a sex worker (Mikey Madison) in a difficult relationship with a Russian oligarch. It does not yet have a release date in the U.S., but that big award win is a great reason to revisit one of Baker’s early projects, <em>Tangerine —</em> another story about sex workers, but in a very different style.</p>
<p id="UB1su5">Shot on three iPhone 5S phones, <em>Tangerine </em>follows two trans sex workers in Los Angeles who are the closest of friends. One just got out of a short stint in prison and has heard her boyfriend has been cheating on her. The two try to find him and get down to the bottom of this mystery in a raw and funny dramedy that looks gorgeous despite the technological limitations of the equipment. If you liked Baker’s later films — <em>The Florida Project </em>and <em>Red Rocket —</em> or are looking forward to the Palme d’Or-winning <em>Anora</em>, but haven’t made time for <em>Tangerine</em>, now’s your moment. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="1TaQ12"><strong>Genre: </strong>Romantic comedy<br><strong>Director: </strong>Mike Nichols<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Sigourney Weaver, Harrison Ford, Melanie Griffith</p>
<p id="FikyIN">Mike Nichols’ (<em>The Graduate</em>)<em> </em>1988 rom-com classic was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and acting nominations for Melanie Griffith, Sigourney Weaver, and Joan Cusack. A class comedy about a secretary who fills in for her injured boss only to have said boss try to take credit for her hard work, this is a breezy comedy with an outstanding cast that also serves as a bit of a time capsule for late 1980s New York City, and makes an excellent companion piece to <em>9 to 5</em>.</p>
<p id="kUK17p"><em>Working Girl</em> also inspired a particularly funny episode of <em>Bob’s Burgers</em>: the season 5 premiere “Work Hard or Die Trying, Girl,” a mashup of <em>Working Girl </em>and <em>Die Hard</em>. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="KSnzFi"><strong>Genre: </strong>Drama<br><strong>Director:</strong> Lee Isaac Chung<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Steven Yeun, Han Ye-ri, Alan Kim</p>
<p id="NNGE2J">Lee Isaac Chung’s <em>Minari</em> is an American story in the purest sense: Jacob (Steven Yeun), a Korean American father with dreams of a better life for himself and his children, moves his family from California to Arkansas in pursuit of his dream of becoming a farmer. As they weather the challenges and hardships that come with this strange new life in the Ozarks, he and his family learn the true meaning of what it takes to build a home. From our list of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/21538912/best-movies-2020">best movies of 2020</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p id="LTneWs">Novelistic and warmly rendered, Minari is a drama about everyday life, and remembering to see the gifts of what’s right in front of you. And the perspective comes from a top-tier cast: Along with Yeun, playing a piercing patriarch, Han Yeri delivers a touching performance as a mother holding fast to her wayward loved ones, newcomers Noel Cho and Alan S. Kim buck every bad trope to play goofy and lovable kids, and renowned Korean actress Yuh-Jung Youn solidifies her legacy in a film that is wholly American.</p></blockquote>

<p id="wkoA5L"><strong>Genre: </strong>Documentary<br><strong>Director: </strong>Godfrey Reggio</p>
<p id="JeuyQe">Consisting primarily of time-lapsed footage of cities and natural environments, <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> is a fascinating time capsule of 20th-century society on the verge of the new millennium, one which asks its audiences to consider the symbiotic relationship between human beings and Earth and whether or not, as the English translation of the film’s title suggests, life as we know it has been thrown out of balance.</p>
<p id="VPY1to">The movie has gone on to be referenced and parodied countless times since its premiere in 1982, including in the 2007 announcement trailer for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M80K51DosFo"><em>Grand Theft Auto 4</em></a>, which features a track from Philip Glass’ iconic score for the film. Make the time to appreciate this monolith of majestic introspective filmmaking. <em>—TE </em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/a-new-player-foray-into-destiny-2-preparing-for-final-shape/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-new-player-foray-into-destiny-2-preparing-for-final-shape<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="265" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As someone with more than 1,500 hours across the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-borderlands-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands</a></em> games and 150 hours in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-remnant-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remnant 2</a></em>, you’d think I would have tried one of the biggest looter-shooters out there: <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2</a></em>. For one reason or another, it just hadn’t made its way into my gaming library.</p> <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">That changed when I befriended Chris, who had a long history with <em>Destiny </em>and <em>Destiny 2</em>. It turned out that Bungie had recently added a system allowing new players to skip past the early stages and jump straight to the endgame. Before I knew it, I was downloading 114 GB of looter-shooter madness amidst promises that “it won’t be that bad.” I created a human Warlock and was able to quickly claim gear that got me to 1810 Power. I didn’t know what the numbers meant, but 1810 felt pretty high.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-good" data-injectable="false">The good</h2> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">The best part about <em>Destiny 2</em> for me was the gunplay. Every gun feels incredibly satisfying to shoot. Whether it’s a close-range shotgun, a precise sniper rifle, or an explosive rocket launcher, every weapon looks unique and sounds great. There’s just something special about hearing the Arbalest’s signature hollow <em>plink</em> as you land a headshot.</p>
 <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true">I also liked the variety of skills at my disposal. I only have one character – a Warlock – but within that class, I can choose to specialize in an element of my choice. Even within the element, I can further customize my grenade, melee ability, and super ability. I haven’t done much build-crafting in Destiny 2, but the ability descriptions are easy to understand, and with some guidance from Chris, I was able to create a Solar Warlock that felt both comfortable and powerful.</p>
 <p data-characters="124" data-current-count="124" data-injectable="false">All in all, it was surprisingly easy for me to just jump into <em>Destiny 2</em> as a brand-new player and start having a great time.</p> <h2 id="h-the-bad" data-injectable="false">The bad</h2> <p data-characters="575" data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true">One thing I didn’t expect from <em>Destiny 2</em> was the prevalence of jumping puzzles. I expressed that I like sniper rifles, so Chris led me on a mission to go get one. We embarked on a quest to obtain the Whisper of the Worm. Much of the quest involves a series of convoluted jumping puzzles in a dark environment with little room for error. I’m not good at platforming to begin with, and I still hadn’t gotten a good sense of the Warlock’s floating jump ability. I admit feeling pretty frustrated by the end of that dungeon, and I’m not sure if the sniper was worth it.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="true">I also found it difficult to navigate menus. I can look at some of my quests by pulling out my Ghost, but I need to look at my actual quests list in a different menu for a more in-depth view. There are also other objectives I need to accomplish in order to increase my Guardian Rank, but I can only view those from the Journey tab in my character menu. There were times when Chris had to guide me through the exact buttons to press to reach a certain menu.</p>
 <h2 id="h-a-crash-course-in-destiny-lore" data-injectable="false">A crash course in Destiny lore</h2> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">One of the first things we did was play through the story campaigns. Going in, I didn’t know anything about <em>Destiny 2’s</em> lore. I still don’t. Chris did his best to fill me in on a decade’s worth of <em>Destiny</em> lore, but it was like trying to explain the history of Middle-earth to someone while watching the second <em>Lord of the Rings </em>movie.</p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="701" data-injectable="true">This also meant that intense emotional beats just didn’t hit for me. I watched a cutscene where some kind of robot met his end at the hands of a mysterious dark stranger. I didn’t know who these characters were or why they were here, but I was clearly meant to feel sad. Chris had to rapidly fill me in on who Cayde-6 was and why his death was important. </p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">Then, soon after I saw Cayde get murdered, I met Crow. Cayde’s murderer is on our side now, I guess? He became a Guardian? I didn’t know these characters well enough to feel anything but mild confusion. And now, just before The Final Shape expansion, we find out that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-launch-trailer-has-me-asking-a-lot-of-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cayde is alive?</a> Maybe?</p> <figure data-current-count="594" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">Still, I was impressed by the quality of the cutscenes and how fun the campaigns were. We ran through the Lightfall campaign fairly quickly, with Chris hastily explaining who the Witness is, what’s going on with the Traveler, and what we were trying to accomplish. We defeated Calus on the fourth attempt, teabagged his corpse, and logged off for the night. </p> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="194" data-injectable="false">I still don’t know what the Veil is, why Calus was after it, or why we went to Neptune. I’m to understand much of the player base was just as confused when playing through Lightfall.</p> <h2 id="h-a-full-fireteam" data-injectable="false">A full fireteam</h2> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">It turns out that <em>Destiny 2</em> co-op is best enjoyed in teams of three. To that end, Chris invited me to play with his longtime friend Kyle. I voiced some worry that my inexperience would be a detriment to the team, but Kyle assured me that it would be fine. Not just because he was kind and welcoming (he was!), but because he could just hard carry us through anything.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">Kyle routinely got more kills than Chris and I combined. Chris insists there’s something wrong with how kills were counted. All I know is there were lots of explosions with Kyle at the center of them, surrounded by glowing green Threadlings.</p>
 <h2 id="h-why-didn-t-i-try-this-before" data-injectable="false">Why didn’t I try this before?</h2> <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">I think <em>Destiny 2’s </em>biggest deterrent was just how much game there was. I saw my friends and family enjoying their Destiny 2 adventures, but it always felt too late for me to join. Of course, the feeling only grew worse over the years. Destiny 2 was released as a live service in 2017, so there’s now seven years’ worth of content to catch up on. Or four, if you don’t count the content that’s no longer accessible. What’s left is a patchwork of confusing narratives and a game that assumes you already know how to play.</p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">I’m glad that Bungie added a way for new players to jump straight into the endgame, and I’m grateful to Chris for guiding me through the early stages. We’re now counting down the days to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shapes-patch-notes-are-so-big-that-bungies-splitting-them-across-three-previews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Final Shape</a>. Even as a relative newbie, I’m excited to see what <em>Destiny 2</em> has in store for me.</p>

<p data-characters="384" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After numerous bigger than life adventures, <em>Edens Zero </em>draws close to its inevitable conclusion. In a couple more chapters, Shiki Granbell will have accomplished his monumental task — making the end of an era for fans of the series. As to avoid spoilers, I’ll leave out direct story elements from this article. Here is everything to know regarding <em>Edens Zero</em> chapter 290. </p> <h2 id="h-when-does-edens-zero-chapter-290-come-out" data-injectable="false">When does Edens Zero chapter 290 come out? </h2> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">According to <em><a href="https://kmanga.kodansha.com/title/10004/episode/351989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weekly Shonen Magazine</a></em>, <em>Edens Zero</em> chapter 290 releases June 4, 2024. As a part of Weekly Shonen Magazine, Eden Zero’s new chapter release date is the day a new magazine issue drops. The speculated release time is 8 am PST, a time based on the upload of the chapter in the previous week. </p> <p data-characters="216" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">Weekly Shonen Magazine releases every <strong>Wednesday</strong> in Japan, which is every Tuesday in the US. Therefore, the Edens Zero chapter 290 release date is on June 4, assuming there are no complications that delay the release.</p>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">For those wanting to read it for free, you can check in on the <a href="https://kmanga.kodansha.com/title/10004/episode/351989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kmanga’s official site</a> on <strong>June 9, 2024</strong>. This is five days after its initial release. You can also read it as part of volume set 29, which releases on <strong>June 25, 2024</strong>. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What to expect</h2> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">Hiro Mashima, the creator of <em>Edens Zero</em>, has begun wrapping up loose ends for the series. Rather than prolonging the series’ life, like how he did with <em>Fairy Tail</em>, Mashima is approaching <em>Edens Zero </em>closer to how he approached <em>Rave Master</em>. In essence, he’s going for a concise story rather than a drawn-out one. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">EDENS ZERO manga will end in 5 more chapters, in Shonen Magazine issue 29</p>— Shonen Magazine News (@WSM_manga) <a href="https://twitter.com/WSM_manga/status/1791754821415965022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="false">Even after <em>Edens Zero</em> ends, fans will likely see many of the characters again in the near future. Hiro Mashima has a tendency to recycle character designs and concepts in his future series. Therefore, although we will soon have to say goodbye to the series, we may not have to say bid our farewells to all the characters. </p>

<p data-characters="231" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been keeping up with the packed schedule of events in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> in the lead up to <em>Dawntrail</em>, you’ll be expecting the <em>Dragon Quest</em> collaboration event, Breaking Brick Mountains, as it’s returning on June 5.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">With <em>Dawntrail </em>just around the corner, there are a lot of things happening in Eorzea to keep <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>players occupied while they wait impatiently for the doomed summer holiday they’ve been promised.</p> <figure data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>

Regardless of whether you join in or not, be prepared to see a large number of wobbly slime hats.</p>

It's claimed Private Division has completely backed out of projects with Ghostrunner developer One More Level and Silent Hill 2 Remake developer, Bloober Team, with "almost all the staff" at the indie label laid off in April. Insiders say Take-Two is now looking to sell Private Division completely, possibly to a private equity firm.</p>
<p>Staff that remain at the label seemingly blame both Take-Two bosses and Private Division head Michael Worosz for "unreasonable sales targets, and pressured to release games before they were ready, with Kerbal Space Program 2 being a notable recent example".</p>
<p>"The people at Private Division were amazing, talented, passionate individuals who loved what they did and also really cared about each other as a team and as people," said one source. "We loved our projects, we worked hard, and we fostered a great environment internally. I would love to work with any of them again.</p>
<p>"The pain point was always Take-Two and associated leadership forcing our hand. The whole layoff situation proved what we already felt. Take-Two could not care less about its employees."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-confirms-layoffs-reported-to-affect-private-division-and-more">It follows a round of Private Division layoffs in March 2023</a>, which – at the time – leadership called "necessary steps" as the company sought to "position [itself] for another extended period success".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">More than 10,000 people have been laid off from their jobs this year</a> across the video game industry so far.That's according to an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">archive tallying layoffs across the industry</a>, which has now hit an estimated total of 10,100 people.</p>
<p>For comparison, 10,500 people were laid off in 2023, meaning almost as many have been impacted so far in 2024 in less than half the time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/24168766/raid-schedule-legendary-mega-shadow-five-star<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wh4fv5">If you’re preserving your raid passes (remote or otherwise) in<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a>, you’ll want to know who the big targets in raids will be for the month by using a <strong>raid schedule</strong>.</p>
<p id="VTZHXW">The <strong>raid targets</strong> swap out every 10 days approximately, so you’ll definitely want to keep track on who is coming next.</p>
<p id="DTQaCj">Raid eggs spawn in gyms every day from 10 a.m. until 10 p.m. in your local time. After the timer ticks down, a raid target will appear. You can check the difficulty of a raid while it’s still a egg; five-star raids have five little monster icons, Mega raids have the Mega DNA-like swirl, and shadow raids are at gyms taken over by Team Go Rocket.</p>
<p id="3S04E6">Below, we list all the high-value raid targets (Legendary Pokémon, Mega Pokémon, and shadow Legendary Pokémon) in<em> Pokémon Go </em>for June 2024.</p>
<hr id="s6zLpX">

<p id="S4G7FH">The raid schedules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li id="AsAGOu">
<strong>June 1-10</strong>: Zapdos</li>
<li id="fuFxsu">
<strong>June 10-19</strong>: Landorus (Incarnate Forme)</li>
<li id="nemtha">
<strong>June 19-28</strong>: Yveltal</li>
<li id="xsgAel">
<strong>June 28 until July 8</strong>: Ho-Oh</li>
</ul>
<p id="EidMhR">All of these have a chance to be shiny. Remember that any Poké Ball you hit a shiny Legendary with is a guaranteed catch, so make sure to use a Pinap Berry to get some extra candy.</p>
<p id="aGJWUP">June 2024 will specifically have an <strong>Elite Raid day to focus on Mega Rayquaza on June 29</strong>, but not too much information is known about it as of writing this.</p>
<hr id="11E2yK">
<h2 id="JGcAes"><strong>Pokémon Go Mega raid schedule for June 2024</strong></h2>
<p id="jB1Otk">If you want to nab Mega energy, you can participate in Mega raids. As a reminder, you will get an amount of Mega energy based on how fast you take down the raid and you’ll get an opportunity to catch the featured Pokémon after completing it.</p>
<p id="2RpMEh">The raid schedule for Megas is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li id="Xn2ViY">
<strong>June 1-10</strong>: Mega Gyarados</li>
<li id="O23OIq">
<strong>June 10-19</strong>: Mega Alakazam</li>
<li id="P2VLm9">
<strong>June 19-28</strong>: Mega Charizard Y</li>
<li id="lTrLiB">
<strong>June 28 until July 8</strong>: Mega Tyranitar</li>
</ul>
<p id="edTch4">All of these can also be shiny!</p>
<hr id="Le9HJb">
<h2 id="lJpupX"><strong>Pokémon Go Legendary Shadow raid schedule for June 2024</strong></h2>
<p id="ruKzmg">The focus of <strong>shadow raids</strong> this month will be <strong>Raikou</strong>. Note shadow raids will only appear during the weekends.</p>
<p id="YrX9Qa">As usual, you should make sure to team up for shadow raids, as they are quite a bit harder to complete. After completing the raid, the Pokémon will also be harder to catch, as they’ll move around much more often. Keep cool and be patient as you chuck out your balls to catch the shadow Legendary.</p>

<p>Despite the growing popularity of the genre, there’s nothing quite like Escape From Tarkov in the extraction shooter scene. It’s one of the most complex and realistic FPS experiences on the market, and many of us can’t wait for more. Here is everything new coming to Escape From Tarkov in 2024…so far!</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-the-escape-from-tarkov-roadmap-for-2024">Everything Included in the Escape From Tarkov Roadmap for 2024</h2>

<p>As of right now, Escape From Tarkov is about to have a monumental summer. Personally, I can’t wait for the next map, quality-of-life improvements, new weapons to play around with, and the hideout expansion. I just want more content overall, as someone who has played regularly since 2017!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-often-does-escape-from-tarkov-wipe">How Often Does Escape From Tarkov Wipe?</h2>



<p>With so many unique changes on the table for Escape From Tarkov, one would expect countless wipes over the next few months, right? Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you like to play, nope. On average, Tarkov wipes once every five months, give or take, so around two per year.</p>



<p>The next EFT wipe is currently planned for sometime in August, though we don’t know an exact date yet!</p>

<p>It’s a question as old as the game itself—a meme within the community. When is the next Escape From Tarkov wipe? Once you’ve unlocked all traders, completed your quests, and achieved Kappa, what then? It’s time to look toward the future. Here is what we know about the next EFT wipe and how to make the most of wipe day!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe">When is the Next Escape From Tarkov Wipe?</h2>



<p>While we don’t know the exact date, as Battlestate Games likes to keep such information private until the last minute, we know the next Escape From Tarkov wipe occurs in August 2024. We’re a few short months away from a significant content wipe, which will completely reset everyone’s progress. It’s a fresh start, a chance to try out new builds and playstyles and perhaps find a competent squad to play with!</p>



<p>Your typical EFT wipe lasts approximately 200 days, with some a little shorter and some a bit longer, but most right around that timeframe. It’s the perfect amount of time for even more casual players to make significant progress, test out new content, and explore the various maps.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-survive-escape-from-tarkov-wipe-day">How to Survive Escape From Tarkov Wipe Day</h2>



<p>If you intend to take part in wipe day festivities, prepare yourself!</p>



<ul>
<li>Whenever the game preps for a content wipe, Battlestate introduces a variety of in-game events that alter loot values, increase boss spawns, and change fundamentals about the overall gameplay. You’ll want to check in on these events to learn more before diving headfirst into a match.</li>



<li>You’ll face many sweaty streamers and hardcore players who will likely surpass your level and gear on day one, so don’t sweat firefights. The early game usually has some of the best gunfights, so enjoy them and take everything in stride.</li>



<li>Remember to take an occasional break. From personal experience, it can be easy to endure tunnel vision as you set yourself a goal for wipe day and ignore everything else to achieve said objective.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-new-york-times-suing-another-wordle-off-shoot/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-new-york-times-suing-another-wordle-off-shoot<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="139" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The New York Times has sued an offshoot of its viral web game <em>Wordle</em>. Again. If I had to guess, the word of the day is “petty.”</p> <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true">This time, the [insert-word-here]-le game on the legal chopping block is <em>Worldle</em>, a geography-themed puzzle game designed by Seattle-based developer Kory McDonald.<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wordle-owner-new-york-times-suing-one-man-country-guessing-game-worldle"> Averaging around 100,000 players a month</a>, Worldle presents you with the outline of a specific country or territory and challenges you to guess which one it is. It’s like a highly condensed version of <em>Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?</em>, but you aren’t looking for a trench-coated spy.</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, Worldle is now in the crosshairs of the New York Times, which purchased Wordle from its original developer, Josh Wardle,<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60208463"> for an undisclosed seven-figure sum back in 2022</a>. In a legal document<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrr5ee5zv8o"> obtained by the BBC</a>, The New York Times argues that McDonald is trying to “cause confusion” and take advantage of Wordle’s “enormous goodwill”.</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">I’ll be the first to admit that Worldle shares more than a few DNA strands with Wordle, but McDonald is far from the first developer to coast off of Wordle’s success. There’s a Wordle clone for<a href="https://nerdlegame.com/"> mathematicians</a>,<a href="https://heardlewordle.io/"> music lovers</a>, and<a href="https://squirdle.fireblend.com/"> <em>Pokemon</em> fans</a>. I’m especially fond of the last one, myself.</p>
 <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">This isn’t even the first time the New York Times has sicced the metaphorical hounds on a game inspired by Wordle. The newspaper has proven to be immensely protective of what has become one of its most marketable investments, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/wordle-new-york-times-sping-off-worldle-b2554465.html">filing DMCAs against many Wordle-inspired games</a>. If there’s an -le at the end of its title, the game may as well paint a target on itself.</p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="false">Fortunately for Worldle fans, McDonald told the BBC that he’s not letting his game go down without a fight, telling the interviewer that “worst-case scenario, we’ll change the name, but I think we’ll be okay.”</p>

<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’m of the unwavering opinion that <em>Lego</em> and <em>Star Wars</em> go together like peanut butter and chocolate. <em>Lego’</em>s vast library of <em>Star Wars</em>-themed sets contains some of the finest sets ever molded, and there are hundreds of them out there for fans of both brands to enjoy.</p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">Building <em>Legos </em>can be an expensive hobby, and<em> Star Wars Lego</em> sets tend to be a bit pricier <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-lego-harry-potter-sets/">than other licensed <em>Lego</em> sets</a>. But once you’ve put them together, these sets will make incredible room decorations, and they may even become valuable collector’s items if<em> Lego</em> ever decides to stop selling them.</p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true">Sadly, several sets on this list were pulled off the production line years ago, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get your hands on them. The prices tagged onto each set are those listed on the official <em>Lego </em>website, but you should be able to find most of the retired sets on Amazon, eBay, and any other websites that peddle Legos.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-incredible-animations-footage/">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>'s scope was impacted by the Xbox Series S hardware limitations, as developers could only make a game that was 25% bigger than its predecessor.</p>
<p>As reported on the Czech website <a href="https://www.zing.cz/novinky/96488679/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-pobezi-na-konzolich-ve-4k-a-30-fps/">Zing.cz</a>, during the ongoing <a href="https://www.game-access.com/conference/">Game Access</a> event in Brno, Czech Republic, producer Martin Klíma confirmed that the Xbox Series S technical limitations, namely the 10 GB of RAM, have impacted Kingdom Come Deliverance 2's scope. As the weakest current generation console has only 25% more RAM, Warhorse Studios decided to make the game only 25% bigger than its predecessor. This isn't the first time we have heard how Microsoft's console impacted the development of multiplatform games, but it is still disappointing.</p>
<p>During the event, the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 producer also revealed that on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the game will run at 4K resolution and 30 frames per second, although it wasn't specified if it will be 4K native resolution or upscaled. On Xbox Series S, the game will run at 1440p resolution and 30 FPS mode. The lack of multiple display modes suggests the game will be CPU-intensive, which is expected for an open-world role-playing game.</p>
<p>While Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 running at only 30 FPS on consoles is disappointing, performance should be stable at the very least. The game is apparently already running steadily at above 30 FPS, so at this early stage, optimization is definitely ahead of the first entry in the series, which didn't run very smoothly on consoles. On PC, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-already-runs-up-to-80fps-with-dlss-at-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to Wccftech that NVIDIA DLSS already enables up to 80 FPS at 4K resolution with Very High graphics settings (running on an AMD Ryzen 7950X3D CPU and RTX 4080 Super GPU).</p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 launches <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-out-this-year-and-its-looking-great-not-to-mention-twice-as-large/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this year</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
