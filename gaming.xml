<figure data-uuid="5578c9cb15efa"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5578c9cb15efa/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Friday 5th December marks the six-month mark for Nintendo's sequel system. Launching back in June, the earliest adopters among us have now been living with the console for half a year. Blimey! It seems like only yesterday we were all speculating about the follow-up to Switch 1. Would it launch in 2022? 2023? 2024?...</p>
<p>Yes, Switch 2 has been in our minds for years, and it feels surreal to have possessed the thing for six months now. So, before we get into the annual GOTY madness, now's a good time to look back, take stock, and briefly discuss how we're getting on with Switch Part Deux.</p>
<p>You'll find some polls below related to the hardware itself, the software lineup, and how you'd rate the whole shebang now that the final marquee first-party game of the year is out in the wild. (It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid</a>, if you somehow hadn't noticed all the articles with Samus in the lead image.)</p>
<p>Let's start with the system itself, now that the new hardware smell has worn off...</p>
<h2>Hardware: It's a Switch, too</h2>

<p>Picking up my launch-day console, I'm happy to say my initial impressions — as chronicled in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">my hardware review</a> back in mid-June — still hold true.</p>
<p>Having gone back to Switch 1 for review purposes a few times in the last few months, the older console feels so very, very slow. My heart still goes out to the OLED's screen, but besides the novelty of it being slightly smaller, there's nothing about the first console I miss.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182525 @ 1764939328 -->
<p>Switch 2 came in very hot with a launch day update essentially 'activating' it, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">various system updates</a> have refined things on the firmware side. My Joy-Con are still functioning perfectly - which should really be a given, but the spectre of drift lingers, as does the pile of useless OG Joy-Con in the cupboard.</p>
<p>I'm fairly careful with all my devices, but I've taken the system on trips, packed it in suitcases, and generally given it a full and thorough 'using' across all modes, and it's coped with those day-to-day rigours just fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/poll-have-you-had-issues-with-the-ethernet-port-on-switch-2s-dock">User reports</a> about a faulty or malfunctioning LAN port in the dock are disappointing, although it's not a problem anyone on Team NL has run into. Likewise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent">legitimate complaints</a> around blurry panel problems and ghosting seem to have died down, too - not that those issues don't still exist, they just don't seem to be troubling the vast majority of Switch 2 owners.</p>
<p>On the whole, then, there are areas to polish (and the screen on my trusty OLED model still looks spectacular) but Switch 2 gets things mostly right, and it's holding up well after six months of use, if not abuse. What about yours?</p>

<h2>Software: Delightful, certainly, but lacking surprise?</h2>

<p>The number of truly new Switch 2 games, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-games">exclusive</a> or otherwise, might be lacking, but it's hard to argue with the breadth of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-best-nintendo-switch-2-games">quality games</a> we've seen released since June. Plenty of familiar ports, yes — another way in which Switch 1's legacy passes directly to its successor — but with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/every-switch-2-launch-game-ranked">25 games in the launch lineup</a>, is there anything to grouse about on the consumer side, <em>really</em>?</p>
<p>Perhaps. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is a great game, but also 'just' the new Mario Kart, not a genre-defining all-timer like a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">BOTW</a> or even a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wii_sports">Wii Sports</a>. Despite the brilliance of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, there's nothing just yet that you <em>absolutely have to get a Switch 2</em> to play. Plenty of gems, some exquisite ports, and having them on a handheld hybrid is as convenient as ever, but the vast majority can be played elsewhere. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a>, for example, both perform wonderfully on Switch 1.</p>
<p>Backwards compatibility has been expanded (with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata</a> fixes coming in a recent update), and NSO additions have kept trickling in. We're still waiting on four of the ten announced GameCube additions to show up, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-game-on-switch-2-ranked">what's there is good stuff</a>.</p>
<p>So, plenty to play, but how are you feeling?</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:185286 @ 1764939604 -->
<h2>How would you rate Switch 2 overall (so far)?</h2>

<p>We've briefly looked at the system and the software, but how are you feeling about your investment in the console? Any regrets? And standout moments in your time with it so far?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/27-upcoming-nintendo-switch-2-games-were-excited-for-in-2025">The future's looking bright</a>, but let's get a numerical sit-rep - and feel free to head into the comments if you'd like to elucidate or espouse further.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Liquid Swords, the development studio founded by founder of Just Cause dev Avalanche Studios Christofer Sundberg, has announced its first game. That game is Samson: A Tyndalston Story, a new open world game where the stakes are always high. You play as the as Samson who lives in the city of Tyndalston where he has built up a mountain of debt and the lenders want their money back.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAMSON | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Samson, you can explore the open world districts of Tyndalston while also taking missions to pay off your debt. The issue is the debt keeps growing due to the daily interest rate applied, and you do not have the luxury of time on your side. The game will also not let you just do all the missions you want to pay off the debt. Samson has a points system and you have to spend those points to select which missions to undertake. Once you make choice, you cannot go back and pick another. It does not matter if you succeed or fail, as the consequences will depend on the outcome.</p>
<p>As you make progess in the game, you will be able to improve Samson’s skills from fighting to driving as he tries to survive in this world, before the debt gets too much and he runs out of time. Samson will have to keep improving as things progress, as the world changes around him and things get more dangerous. At the moment, Samson: A Tyndalston Story has been confirmed for PC only with a release date yet to be announced.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>, the massive modding project reinterpreting The Elder Scrolls 4 via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine, had its release officially <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivions-release-has-been-delayed-to-2026-but-you-can-check-out-an-interactive-version-of-its-map">delayed to 2026</a> earlier this week. The delay followed an ex-Skyblivion level and world designer Dee Keyes alleging that the mod's previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivions-2025-release-goal-is-pointless-and-unachievable-claims-longtime-dev-accuses-two-leads-of-rushing-the-mod-out">2025 release goal was "unachievable"</a> earlier this year, in a post which also accused Skyblivion project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel and implementation lead Heavy Burns of mismanaging communication within the mod's team. In response, Heavy Burns asserted that "many" of the claims in the ex-dev's post were "either misrepresented or just untrue".</p>
<p>Now, in a Discord discussion emphasising that players shouldn't assume the spellcrafting mechanic the modders have had to cut from the initial release will be put back in down the line, Skyblivion's UI department lead has suggested they weren't consulted about what was said in the YouTube video announcing the mod's delay to next year. That'd be the delay announcement video which features a section specifically dedicated to the current status of Skyblivion's UI and mechanics.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Well, technically, I had no idea what was said in the video, I was not even asked, and I have not even watched it till now," the mod's <a href="https://skyblivion.com/the-team/">sole UI lead</a>, who goes by the handle Fallen011[35], <a href="https://discord.com/channels/239801644076892160/275583958190653440/1446307977232515133">wrote in response</a> to a fan erroneously claiming the delay video had confirmed spellcrafting will definitely be added post-release. "If that was said, then I hope it was said in a manner of 'planned' or better as a hope instead of a promise."</p>
<p>That was how it was framed in the video, with project lead Rebel simply saying it and the also cut underwater combat "are features we would like to add to the game at a later date". In other Discord comments, Fallen011[35] also responded to fans who say that they're planning to wait for spellcrafting to be added before playing Skyblivion, commenting that there's no guarantee that either this or the revamped interface (which Rebel has said the team would work on "if time allows") will definitely arrive.</p><p>"Both require massive amounts of work, and for me to be honest, I do not know if I want to keep working [non-stop] on UI after release," the lead wrote. "UI is not really great to work with in Skyrim, and at some point I just want to be finished with UI. And for me and others in the Project, spell crafting is not that important. That being said, I would keep hopes down and not think that this will 100% be the case."</p>
<p>Makes sense, but it's Fallen011[35]'s suggestion that they weren't privy to what was said in the video about the release delay which stuck me, especially in light of the allegations of communication issues that Keyes levelled at the leads in his post. Rebel's video doesn't just announce the delay - it paints a picture of where each key aspect of the mod's development is at right now, including its user interface. The project lead says in the intro that the group "did not want to announce a delay without also sharing our current plans and ambitions for the release of the project."</p>
<p>With that in mind, it seems strange to me for the mod project leads not to be kept in the loop about the video's contents, at least as it concerned their specific department's area, regardless of whether they had any direct input on exactly what was said. Even if it wasn't necessary to ensure Rebel could provide an up-to-date and accurate picture of progress, it would seem sensible for the team to be all on the same page ahead of making an important public announcement about their project.</p>
<p>I've reached out the Skyblivion team and project lead Kyle Rebel for comment.</p>
<p>If you're keen to get an early idea of how you'll acquire and play Skyblivion before release, check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-and-gog-chat-about-partnering-up-to-release-the-massive-elder-scrolls-mod-following-fallout-londons-troubled-success">the chat I had with Rebel and GOG earlier this year</a>.</p>

            <guid>1374193</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> starts with a bang, but it didn’t really impress me much. However, everything changed once I reached the game’s first real playground, a Giger-esque otherworldly factory filled with robots, puzzles, electrical dangers, and a cool motorcycle.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fans-who-pre-ordered-metroid-prime-4-six-years-ago-have-seen-their-entire-lives-change-2000645936">Nearly a decade after it was first teased</a> and 18 years after <em>Metroid Prime 3,</em> Retro and Nintendo have finally released <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> for Switch and Switch 2. Over here at <em>Kotaku</em>, we didn’t get an early copy of the sci-fi action adventure FPS like many other sites. So I’ve been playing it today on Switch 2, taking my first power-suited steps into this latest entry in the beloved <em>Metroid Prime</em> series. Two things struck me right out of the gate while playing <em>Prime 4:</em> This game looks really nice. And the opening hour is meh.</p>

  <p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is a gorgeous game, even if <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-graphics-comparison-switch-2-ugly-2000650585">some online don’t think it looks realistic or detailed enough</a>. What Retro has pulled off here is at times stunning and always runs at a flawless 120FPS at a crisp resolution, too. It might not be as sharp as something like <em>Black Ops 7</em> running on a PS5 Pro or as detailed as<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on a Series X, but <em>Prime 4</em> nails it where it matters, using art style and smart graphical tricks to create something that looks wonderful on my big dumb 4K 120hz television.</p>

 <p>I especially love the lighting and <em>Prime 4</em>‘s HDR implementation, with dark areas not looking washed out and bright lights popping off the screen. It’s easily the best-looking Switch 2 game around.</p> <p>However, visuals weren’t enough to win me over during <em>Prime 4</em>‘s first hour. The game starts off with an action-packed tutorial and then a slow exploration of an alien world, where you meet a very annoying Galactic Federation soldier who, along with the game itself, practically holds Samus’ hand through most of the first part of <em>Prime 4</em>. It’s not bad, per se, but I wasn’t excited to play more. Thankfully, you ditch that annoying dude and set off to visit the game’s first real area, Volt Forge.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650677" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650677"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650677">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is where <em>Prime 4</em> gets <em>really</em> good. I won’t spoil too much, as it’s an experience I don’t want to ruin for anyone. But what makes Volt Forge so excellent is how it blends everything great about <em>Metroid Prime</em> into one haunting and large level. There are boss fights that utilize your various tools and weapons. It has puzzles that feel just challenging enough that solving them is satisfying, but not so annoying as to be a brick wall. And some incredible music, too. And to my surprise, Volt Forge even gets a bit creepy at points. Don’t expect jump scares or worry that <em>Prime 4</em> is a horror game; it never goes that far, but I enjoyed the change in pace from the opening level.</p>

 <p>Maybe the most unexpected part of Volt Forge is that it reminds me of <em>Titanfall 2</em> and <a href="https://youtu.be/A2W0LfUXFQo?t=1740">that game’s much-praised level set inside a large factory</a>. Again, I won’t spoil exactly what happens in Volt Forge that reminded me of that level from Repsawn’s excellent sci-fi mech shooter, just know that the factory Samus is exploring is far from broken down. So you might want to be careful.</p> <p>And at the very end of Volt Forge, you unlock <em>Prime 4</em>‘s motorcycle, which handles fine enough and feels great to drive. I have no idea if the rest of the game will match Volt Forge’s quality or if I’ll enjoy the more open-ended hub desert where the motorcycle is primarily used. It’s possible that everything after this will be terrible. For now, though, <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was able to overcome its so-so opening hour and win me over with a creepy and dangerous trip through an alien factory.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6238/">The LEGO Star Wars: Attack of the Clones Jango Fett’s Starshipset, which usually goes for around $70, just dropped to $56 at Amazon</a>. That’s after the retailer slashed 20% off its retail tag, making the purchase quite affordable. The offer can be grabbed by both Prime and non-Prime members. Even better, all shoppers get to enjoy free delivery with their purchase, so there are no extra costs to worry about. However, we highly recommend getting your orders in quickly because the holiday rush is in full swing, and deals are moving fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6238/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great for All Ages</h2>
<p>The set is made for ages 9 and up, and comes with a total of 707 pieces. It’s not massive, which is great if you’re planning to grab it for kids and don’t want to overwhelm them with a large project. It’s going to be one of those fun sets that can be brought to life by dedicating just a few hours during the weekend. Since the holiday season is upon us, everyone in the family can join in; maybe by the fireplace with some hot chocolate. Play the Star Wars theme song in the background to get in the feels!</p>
<p>You’ll be building Jango Fett (with dual blasters and jetpack), who is <em>a simple man trying to make his way in the universe</em>, young Boba Fett learning all about family trade, and tall Kaminoan Lama Su minifigures, plus the stunning starship. The attention to detail on the starship is incredible, since it features authentic rotating wings, four stud shooters, and a seismic charge-dropping function for some cool, explosive escapes just in the asteroid chase scene. There’s also an opening cockpit for two minifigures to jump in for some adventures across the Outer Rim, as well as a mobile service cart with ammunition storage. The latter doubles as a display stand.</p>



<p>Once built, the starship is going to measure over 3.5 in. (9 cm) high, 8 in. (21 cm) long, and 8.5 in. (21 cm) wide. It’s going to look stunning on its own, but you can always pair it with others in the LEGO Star Wars collection for a bigger setup that spans multiple star systems. The set also comes with a detailed instruction book that’s going to take younger fans through each step one by one. It’s quite easy to follow, so kids will be able to build on their own. For even more assistance, you can install the LEGO Builder app, which offers digital, 3D instructions. Kids can zoom in from every angle, track their progress, and save sets. The app also makes it easy to build with friends. In this mode, it divides tasks between everyone on board, so everyone can complete their own.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6238/">The current discount brings the price of the starship model to just $56. You’re saving a nice 20% on a set any Star Wars fan is going to love and cherish.</a> If you like it, don’t wait too long to grab it. Once the discount is gone, we can’t say whether it will be back anytime soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After weeks of accepting bids from potential suiters, it’s been announced that Netflix is set to buy Warner Bros. in 2026. The deal is expected to close after Warner Bros. Discovery completes its split into two separate companies.</p>



<p>In a joint <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> on Friday, it was revealed that Netflix <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-looking-at-buying-warner-bros-discovery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be acquiring</a> only the Streaming &amp; Studios side of the split. That means, based on the <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">previously announced</a> details, Netflix will own Warner Bros. Games. That means studios like NetherRealm, Rocksteady, TT Games, and Avalanche will likely all soon fall under the Netflix Games umbrella.</p>



<p><strong>“Today’s announcement combines two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most,”</strong> Warner Bros. Discovery president and CEO David Zaslav said.</p>



<p>Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters added, <strong>“This acquisition will improve our offering and accelerate our business for decades to come. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“With our global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they create—giving our members more options, attracting more fans to our best-in-class streaming service, strengthening the entire entertainment industry and creating more value for shareholders.”</strong></p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that, while the deal mentions a full acquisition of Warner Bros., which is set to be the name of the streaming and studios side of the company, there was no mention of the games division in the press release.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Warner Bros. and Netflix for clarification on what the plans are for the gaming division. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> relaunch is set to arrive on 17th December with a big gameplay realignment and rebranding as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, 1047 Games has announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded | December 17" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrcUZ_F7vX8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is a major gameplay direction shift from that of Splitgate 2 at its launch in June. The Factions have been removed and so have the Abilities that were bound to them, making for a more purist focus on classic arena shooter combat. Because of this, the game progression has been rebuilt and the Ranked system overhauled.</p>
<p>There’s five new maps alongside six that have been fully-reworked, and you’ll play on them with new Arena modes, including a Classic Arena mode that has even starts and powerups to grab. Oh, and there’s three new Primary Weapons and a Railgun as a new Power Weapon.</p>
<p>Rounding things out, store prices have been reduced, the battle pass has been simplified, and they’re promising improved cosmetics quality.</p>

<p>Instead of studio founder Ian Proulx, who appeared in a bungled stage appearance at Summer Game Fest for the Splitgate 2 launch, 1047 Games Design Director Josh Watson provided the main quote, “Splitgate has always been a love letter to the arena shooters we grew up playing. We’ve been hard at work rebuilding the game from the ground up, taking the best of Splitgate 1 and Splitgate 2, removing what didn’t work, and refining what did.”</p>
<p>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded will launch on 17th December for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4 and Xbox One, and 1047 will be really, really hoping it’s better received this time around, and that they can generate enough good will to recapture the breakout popularity of the original game’s first open beta tests.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-m4-mac-mini-price-drop-post-black-friday-holiday-windows-mini-pc-deals-2000650662</link>
            <guid>1374172</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="140" data-end="945">Laptops often get more praise than they deserve. While they’re convenient for mobility, nothing quite compares to a well-designed desk setup with large monitors, a responsive mechanical keyboard, and the comfort of a dedicated workspace. Such an environment not only boosts productivity but also creates a place you’ll genuinely enjoy returning to whenever it’s time to focus. One of the best ways to power a setup like this is with the Apple Mac Mini. Despite being a desktop machine, it’s still compact enough to take with you when needed. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">Even better, the 2024 version of Apple’s compact desktop is currently discounted by 17% on Amazon, dropping the price from $599 to $499.</a> If you’ve been considering an upgrade, this is an ideal moment to treat yourself while saving a whole $100.</p>
<p data-start="947" data-end="1618">The discounted model is the 2024 Apple Mac Mini equipped with Apple’s M4 chip, which features a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The device is sold in 256 GB and 512 GB variants, although the higher-capacity version is currently selling for over $700. Alongside that storage, the system includes 16 GB of RAM. The M4 processor is the star of the show here, giving this compact desktop a tremendous performance boost. Apple claims it can operate up to 13 times faster than the fastest Intel-based Mac Mini. That makes the machine suitable for everyday productivity as well as demanding creative tasks like photo or video editing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1620" data-end="2060">In terms of connectivity, the 2024 Mac Mini packs a generous selection of ports and wireless options. You’ll find three Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB-C ports, HDMI, and Gigabit Ethernet, along with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for fast and stable wireless connections. Apple may have phased out the headphone jack on the iPhone years ago, but it remains present on the Mac Mini, giving you the convenience of wired audio whenever you want it.</p>
<p data-start="2062" data-end="2748">The desktop comes loaded with macOS 15.1 Sequoia, which continues Apple’s emphasis on privacy and security. It includes an upgraded Secure Enclave to help safeguard your personal data and system integrity. MacOS supports a wide variety of software, from productivity essentials to creative tools. You can use the full Microsoft 365 suite, Adobe Creative Cloud applications, Zoom, and thousands of other programs. In fact, the App Store offers more than 15,000 apps, many of which are optimized specifically for the M4 chip.</p>


<h2>Better With Apple Accessories</h2>
<p data-start="2750" data-end="3035">To enhance your experience even further, you can pair the Mac Mini with other Apple accessories. It works seamlessly with the Apple Studio Display and integrates perfectly with peripherals like the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, offering a smooth and cohesive setup across your devices.</p>
<p data-start="3037" data-end="3278"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">For a short time, Amazon is selling the 2024 Mac Mini with the M4 chip for $499, an even $100 reduction from its standard price.</a> AppleCare+ isn’t included, but you can add three years of coverage for a combined total of $588—that’s at a $120 discount.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Splitgate 2 is Relaunching Later This Month as ‘SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-arena-reloaded/</link>
            <guid>1374169</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splitgate developer 1047 Games has announced that Splitgate 2 will be relaunching later this month under the new name SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded. The latest trailer shows that the game isn’t just relaunching with a new name, though, and that 1047 Games has been hard at work listening to community feedback and improving the game in as many areas as possible.</p>



<p>As said in the game’s latest YouTube trailer (see below), the game has seen a significant graphic overhaul, a pullback on the game’s heroes and abilities, and a rebuild of the game from the ground up, taking the best of Splitgate 1 and Splitgate 2 and removing what didn’t work.</p>







<figure><p>
<iframe title="SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded | December 17" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrcUZ_F7vX8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<div><p>In addition to those changes, SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded now also has player stats, leaderboards, a career system, and a new competitive experience.</p><p>SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded, Josh Watson, also revealed that the game will launch with five new maps, four new weapons, new modes, and more, with “A lot more to share in the coming weeks”.</p></div>



<h2 id="h-splitgate-s-redemption-arc">Splitgate’s Redemption Arc?</h2>



<p>After a horrible launch earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developers-say-its-going-back-to-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Splitgate 2 was taken offline back to BETA</a> after the game failed to make a good impression on players and see significant player retention. Splitgate 2’s failed launch was hindered by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-ceo-apologizes-for-sgf-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial comments</a> from 1047 Games CEO Ian Proulx at Summer Games Fest and since then, the game struggled to find any kind of interest from the wider community.</p>



<p>Now, though, 1047 Games seems like it’s started a redemption arc by listening to the community and seemingly keeping Proulx away from the game’s marketing. The YouTube community on the trailer seem to suggest that players are once again interested, which would be a huge turnaround for the developers if they can pull it off.</p>







<p>The game is set to launch as a free-to-play title on December 17th on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PC, with the latest game trailer </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cast-outs-reveal-trailer-drops-features-developers-from-closed-sony-london-studio-team/</link>
            <guid>1374166</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony’s London Studio is back with fewer staff members and has been rebranded as Twisted Works. The team has revealed Cast Outs, which bears a striking resemblance to London Studio’s canceled game it was working on.</p>



<p>Last May, the unfortunate news broke that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstations-london-studio-has-closed-after-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation’s London Studio closed after 20 years</a>. The team primarily focused on games designed around gadgets, such as the EyeToy and PlayStation VR. But Twisted Works is comprised of several London Studio members, and they are working on Cast Outs.</p>







<h2 id="h-london-studio-developers-return-to-finish-what-they-started">London Studio Developers Return To Finish What They Started</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Back, sort of. Credit to Sony</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the wake of London Studio’s 2024 closure, everyone learned of a canceled PS5 game the developer was working on.</p>







<p>An online co-op game, Cast Outs uses fantasy elements in its London setting. You’ll need to embrace the fantastical arts, such as magic and spells. Here’s how Twisted Works described the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Cast Outs&nbsp;brings you the pure spectacle of magic where spellcasting hits with the physical impact of a brawler and the immediate kick of a&nbsp;shooter. Dive into the ultimate magical urban battleground where you and your friends can truly cooperate, regardless of skill level. It’s the perfect balance of quick-fix fun and high-octane action, built to be played together.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Much of the footage and elements sound like the studio’s original canceled project. Development must be moving along well, as the studio is already talking about a beta: “We are entering production soon and plan to release an early access beta in early 2027.”</p>



<p>You can see the reveal trailer for yourself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Game Bakers have announced a new release date for their mountain climbing game Cairn, which was delayed back in September as the team needed more time. The new release date for Cairn is January 29th, when it will be released for PC and PS5. Ahead of the full release, you can play the Cairn demo on Steam and PS5 to get an idea of what to expect on your climb of Kami.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cairn - Launch Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6KWhvvk3bM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Game Bakers has also revealed the details of the Deluxe Edition, along with pricing for the different versions of the game. The Cairn Deluxe Edition will include a Kami travel book, wallpapers, and three keepsakes that can be added to main character Aava’s rucksack. Both versions will have a 10% launch discount with the standard edition priced at $26.99/26.99€ / £22.99 / JP¥3060 / CN¥98 and the Deluxe Edition priced at $34.20/ 34.20€ / £28.60 / JP¥3924 / CN¥129.</p>
<p>In Cairn, players climb the mountain Kami as explorer Aava. On this journey, Aava will find traces of past climbs, historical artefacts that tell the story of the mountain, and run into other climbers who are on their own journeys. Cairn is a realistic climbing simulator where you will need to guide Aava to suitable holds for her hands and feet, while also maintaining balance so she does not fall off of Mount Kami.</p>

              <p>According to a report by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-wins-the-warner-bros-discovery-bidding-war-enters-exclusive-deal-talks/"><em>TheWrap</em></a>, Netflix is now entering exclusive talks to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, having outbid other competitors for the&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>-owning megacorp. If the deal goes through, rumored to be at $30 a share, it would mean the streaming giant would own everything from HBO to DC comics, including all your favorite Lego and <em>Batman</em> games.</p> <p>Warner Bros. boss David Zaslav has been making it clear he wants to sell the company for a good while now, but holding out for a big exit. In October this year he <a href="https://kotaku.com/holy-monopoly-batman-warner-bros-reportedly-reject-a-buyout-bid-from-paramount-2000634581">turned down a bid from Paramount</a> said to be at $20 a share, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-12/warner-bros-is-said-to-rebuff-paramount-takeover-approach"><em>Bloomberg</em> claiming</a> the CEO was holding out for 50 percent higher. That valuation seemed crazy, and it was assumed that Paramount came in much lower to test the waters, with the expectation of either a $25 per share bid to follow, or more hostile takeover moves. However, instead, it seems Netflix has swooped in with that $30 offer thus won the war.</p>

 <h2>What are the implications of this deal?</h2> <p>If the deal goes through, this would mean streaming giant Netflix would own one of its big rivals, HBO Max, and presumably look to merge the two services. It would also own Warner’s entire movie business including New Line Cinema, all of DC Entertainement, the Discovery network of channels, and multiple networks like CNN, TBS, TNT and the Cartoon Network. And, of course, Warner Bros. Games.</p>

 <p>In a normal universe, this would be the sort of deal that would be tangled in monopolistic concerns for years to come, as people questioned the unparalleled power this could offer Netflix over multiple industries. However, given other recent mergers that have taken place after, um, payments made to the Trump orbit, what might happen is anyone’s guess. However, earlier talk last month of the potential deal between Netflix and Warner <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-warner-bros-bid-antitrust-concerns-darrell-issa-letter/">resulted in antitrust concerns being raised</a>, and certainly there will be a lot of fight from those concerned how the deal could affect Hollywood.</p>

 <p>Yet, at the same time, Paramount was allowed to merge with Skydance and Disney was allowed to buy Fox, so Netflix has plenty of precedent to argue from. As it happens, it could be Paramount that objects the loudest to the Netflix deal, given how it and so many others had assumed it would get Warner eventually, and the company is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/04/paramount-questions-warner-bros-discovery-sale-process-letter.html">already questioning the “fairness and adequacy”</a> of the process. A Warner attorney wrote, “It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder.”</p>

 <h2>A messy breakup for gaming?</h2> <p>The Netflix deal also makes another aspect of Warner Bros. Discovery more interesting. <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies">Zaslav had appeared determined to break up the company</a> such that its linear cable channel businesses would be separated from the rest, and then that loss-making sector take all the company’s debt with it. Because that’s legal I guess. However, while Paramount likely wouldn’t want to end up owning a bunch of profitless cable channels, for Netflix the vast number of new shows to stream could be a real boon. Not only would it have everything on HBO Max, but also be able to strip-mine the remaining cable channels for extra content.</p>

 <p>At the same time, the deal could be very concerning for games players, given <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-gaming-hades-monument-vally-golden-idol-braid-1851785038">Netflix’s very clear backward step from anything other than mobile gaming</a>. Its owning the studios that develop the <em>Arkham</em> and&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> games could mean bad times for console players if the pattern continues.</p> <p>There’s obviously a lot of fighting to come, and presumably some hefty legal challenges from those who feel dropped at the altar, let alone the antitrust maneuvers. But given [broad sweeping gesture], it won’t be in the least bit surprising to see it happening sooner rather than later.</p>

But fan discussion has now centered on the fact this amiibo also unlocks a jukebox feature for Samus' Vi-O-La motorbike, which allows you to hear other themes from the game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/samus-1764933522137.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The amiibo - Samus - Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Series costs $29.99.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussion around the rights and wrongs of Nintendo providing extra features for amiibo owners is nothing new, and dozens of Nintendo games include exclusive additions for people who own associated figurines (or borrow them from friends). Additionally, in this case, there have also been a number of inaccuracies shared over the radio's usage, with some reports incorrectly stating that it includes otherwise exclusive music, or that the bike's main Sol Valley area is silent otherwise. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's true that the Sol Valley's etheral, ambient music is relatively sparse — the desert-like area is meant to be a wasteland, after all, and a notably different environment from the game's main areas that Samus once again explores on foot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some fans have suggested that it would have been nice to have the option of turning on the in-game radio without buying a $29.99 toy, which — while a familiar argument for Nintendo games with amiibo-exclusive features — seems fair enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Couldn't they have given us that jukebox mode in the first place instead of having us buy an accessory to unluck said jukebox mode?" wrote Nintendo fan knightedwolf851 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/casualnintendo/comments/1pdpg1j/it_seems_you_will_be_able_to_put_music_in_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>.

"It is a cosmetic that doesn't impact the game. (Unlike the the Skyward Sword teleport, which I think that mechanic removed some decision making from the game anyways.)"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"30 dollars to kill the intended ambiance? Okay then," quipped a third fan, The_Pepper_Oni.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">i genuinely think the desert would have been at least 3x better if they had put some BANGING music behind it.

            <p>Banjo-Kazooie is now playable on PlayStation - at least, a fan-made version created in Dreams - and it's even caught the eye of Rare.</p>
<p>Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania has been created by William Butkevicius, and is just a single level made in homage to the N64 platformer. Butkevicius, incidentally, is a level designer at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ori-and-the-blind-forest">Ori and the Blind Forest</a> developer Moon Studios, who created this project in their spare time.</p>
<p>Butkevicius described it as a "labour of love", but doesn't have plans to add to it. "I'd like to move away from big Dreams projects now, so unless I get the opportunity to work on an official Banjo-Threeie (which I would be thrilled to), this is it for now," Butkevicius wrote on social media. Rare, are you listening?</p>

<p>Well actually, it is. The studio shared Butkevicius' post, stating: "Put our fanciest hat on just so we could tip it to this. Incredible work!"</p>
<p>Gregg Mayles, Banjo-Kazooie's director (who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-kazooie-director-officially-leaves-rare-following-everwild-cancellation">recently left Rare</a>), also <a href="https://x.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1996694869297795109?s=20">shared the post</a> calling it "splendid", while <a href="https://x.com/grantkirkhope/status/1996298038286111087?s=20">composer Grant Kirkhope</a> shared it with the googly eyes emoji.</p>

<p>Butkevicius' video shows the iconic bear and bird exploring an island level reminiscent of Treasure Trove Cove - it even has that terrifying shark. There are musical notes and jiggies (30!) to collect, platforming challenges and puzzles, and new characters to meet.</p><p>Perhaps most notable are the new transformations, including a rock golem and a skeletal fish. It took Butkevicius around 14 months and over 800 hours of work to create, adding: "A lot of the concepts were born out of issues I had with the original game, like 'the transformations don't feel fun enough to use', or 'going to the hut to transform is tedious' and then tons of iteration to find good solutions!"</p>
<p>There's some great jaunty music too from composer Duckenomics and brass ensemble The Game Brass, while PieceofCraft assisted with sculpting, animation, and logic.</p>
<p>The original Banjo-Kazooie was released for the N64 27 years ago and the last new release was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/banjo-kazooie-nuts-bolts">Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts</a> in 2008 for Xbox 360. It's clear the original game has left a lasting impression, but could we see a new game in the series in future?</p>
<p>It seems unlikely, considering Mayles' recent departure from Rare. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-kazooie-sequel-chances-better-than-zero-but-not-much-says-composer-grant-kirkhope">Kirkhope also told Eurogamer there's "better than zero but not much" of a chance</a> the bird and bear will return.</p>
<p>The project is also a reminder that Media Molecule's Dreams is still up and running. A report last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dreams-pc-playstation-5-ports-reportedly-canned">claimed PC and PS5 versions of the game were in development</a>, but were later canned.</p>

            <p>The next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> patch will finally remove all glamour restrictions, even though Yoshi-P isn't really a fan of it.</p>
<p>Glamouring essentially allows players to combine the visuals of their favourite armour with the stats of something better - transmog, basically. However, players can only glamour within the Job they're playing as, so your White Mage can wear any other White Mage outfit but can't dress as a Dragoon.</p>
<p>That's all set to change in Patch 7.4, out later this month, which is great news for fashion fans - the real endgame of Final Fantasy 14. However, it seems director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has agreed to the change reluctantly.</p>

<p>The decision not to allow this type of glamour until now wasn't due to technicalities, but Yoshida's personal taste.</p>
<p>"I felt more strongly than anyone else that we had to cherish the Final Fantasy worldview," Yoshida told <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/59484">Famitsu</a> (translation via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/ff14s-yoshi-p-reveals-why-hes-finally-lifting-glamour-restrictions-hes-got-his-own-preferences-but-its-no-longer-the-time-to-force-them-on-players/">PC Gamer</a>). "I felt that the way Final Fantasy should be is for Dragoons to be able to equip their character in that style, and to be able to hold their spear and strike the 'Kain pose' [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-iv">Final Fantasy 4</a>'s iconic Dragoon]. It's the job's identity, so to speak. The core of that feeling hasn't changed much even now."</p><p>However, he noted there are "very few games that have the same limitations as Final Fantasy 14 in terms of enjoying fashion", although he added if he were in charge of a free-to-play game he'd naturally want players to buy items without restrictions.</p>
<p>Yoshida has been playing games from other companies and now understands, in this modern era, what players want may differ to his own preference. For instance, he plays as a Black Mage and wouldn't want his character to wear other armour.</p>
<p>"These are my own roleplaying rules, so I have decided them arbitrarily," he said. "I reconsidered and decided that it would be pointless to impede the roleplaying of people who say, 'My character is the coolest and cutest in the world. I want to dress up even more,' by [forcing them to follow] my own rules.</p>
<p>"I'm fine with being particular about my own preferences, and I'm sure there are many others who feel the same way, but that doesn't mean that the system should restrict the motivation of people who are particular about dressing up."</p><p>Another reason for the change is to combat the use of mods. Yoshida has been adamant about not allowing mod-use in Final Fantasy 14, which reached a peak earlier this year when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-most-controversial-third-party-plugin-used-for-in-game-stalking-has-been-shut-down">a controversial third-party plugin used for in-game stalking was shut down</a>.</p>
<p>Some players used mods to alter their character's appearance - most notably the Mare Synchronos mod, whose creators were <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/final-fantasy/legal-inquiry-shuts-down-one-of-final-fantasy-14s-most-popular-mods-adding-yet-another-blurry-line-in-the-sand-from-square-enix/">sent a cease and desist earlier this year</a>. Now the game itself has been altered to appease players.</p>
<p>What's more, the change is an offer of goodwill to players. When, anecdotally, the MMORPG has seen a reduction in player count since the release of the less well-received expansion Dawntrail, this change to glamouring will likely be a popular change - and give an extra incentive to explore everything in the game in the search for the right outfit.</p>
<p><a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/patch_7_4/">Patch 7.4, Into The Mist</a>, will be released on 16th December, extending the story and bringing various other additions as expected with each patch. Next year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> will host multiple Fan Fest events as it prepares to launch the next expansion, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-us-fan-fest-event-square-enix-accessibility-disabled-players">disabled fans in the US fear their accessibility needs won't be met</a>.</p>

            <p>It looks as though Epic is getting over its aversion to showing male nipples in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>The discussion around Fortnite's lack of nipples on its shirtless characters famously began after a Travis Scott concert was held in-game, with the <a href="https://x.com/Fresh/status/1252792137143312384">topless singer sporting some very smooth pecs</a>.</p>
<p>However, you may recall last month, a then-leak revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-homer-simpson-going-to-be-the-first-character-skin-to-get-his-nipples-out-in-fortnite">Homer Simpson would be getting his own nipples out in Epic's shooter</a>, thanks to a skin of the yellow patriarch in his underwear. In Homer's case, his nipples were just two black dots on his chest.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>But now it seems Homer was in fact a vessel for change. As spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-really-does-seem-to-have-changed-its-nipple-policy-and-now-its-not-just-homer-simpsons-chest-thats-in-the-game">IGN</a>, a new battle pass skin for Carter Wu shows a shirtless Fortnite model complete with actual nipples. Unlike Homer's cartoonish pec specs, though, these nipples are actually (for Fortnite) quite anatomically accurate, with detailed areola.</p>
<p>You can check out how Carter Wu's Fortnite nipples look in the reddit embed below.</p>
<p>So, has Homer Simpson started a new wave of nipples in Fortnite? What a triumph to add to his ever growing list of achievements (I mean, this man has gone to space, become a professional boxer and stopped nuclear meltdowns).</p>

</span></p><p>As for Fortnite more generally, it recently made headlines after players discovered what they believed to be AI-generated images within the game. In a Reddit post entitled "Say 'No' to AI slop, a billion-dollar company should have no problem supporting real artists for real art", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-fans-are-saying-no-to-ai-slop-after-spotting-what-they-believe-are-ai-generated-images-in-game">Fortnite players shared their thoughts on a number of alleged AI-generated images</a>, including in-game posters and sprays.</p>

<p>During a Q&amp;A session following its recent Q2 financial results, Sega‘s top brass addressed the use of AI when it comes to making games (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sega-says-it-will-use-ai-in-game-development-but-only-in-appropriate-use-cases/">VGC</a>) and how it will help tackle the increasing costs of development.</p>
<p>Sega's response was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rather than fully following the trend toward the large-scale development, we will also pursue efficiency improvements, such as leveraging AI. However, as AI adoption can face strong resistance in creative areas such as character creation, we will proceed by carefully assess appropriate use cases, such as streamlining development processes."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while Sega certainly isn't against turning to AI to streamline production, it doesn't look like it will be embracing it with quite the same vigour as other companies.</p>
<p>While Generative AI models are powerful tools, they are often trained on the work of artists, musicians, filmmakers<span>, and animators without permission or remuneration. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">Many models have been found to produce</a></span> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/openai-is-trying-to-get-sued-nintendo-ip-floods-sora-2-video-generation-app">copyright-infringing results with minimal effort.</a></p>
<p>Nintendo has previously stated that it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/dont-worry-nintendo-likely-wont-utilise-generative-ai-in-its-game-development">doesn't currently intend</a> to use Generative AI in its own games, citing "issues with intellectual property rights" as one of the main reasons for avoiding it.</p>

		<p>Well, I don’t think anyone was expecting a new Carmageddon game to be announced, and yet 34BigThings has revealed Carmageddon: Rogue Shift. The new Carmageddon game is a roguelite racer where vehicular combat is central to every event. Players will have a number of different vehicle bodies and weapon types to use to build their own deadly racer. You can see some of the gameplay in the announcement trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Carmageddon: Rogue Shift - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7mFmSbChgC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is set in the year 2050, where the streets are overrun by the Wasted at night, meaning humanity has to shelter in their homes during the dark. That is unless they are a street racer looking for money, prestige, and a chance to get off of the planet to safety. Carmageddon: Rogue Shift will feature 15 vehicles, a mix of FWD, RWD, and AWD, with each having their own unique stats. There are also 13 weapon classes from shotguns to rocket launchers, and these are upgradeable too. Players will also have access to over 80 perks to further customise vehicle loadouts as they race across tracks that have a dynamic weather and day and night cycle. All campaigns will be unique as the events are randomly generated, with players taking part in races to boss battles as progress is made. In each event players will sustain damage so it planning routes to the shops dotted around will also be key, to make repairs and buy upgrades.</p>
<p>A pre-registration event is also taking place on the <a href="https://playcarmageddon.com/#unlock-rewards">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift&nbsp;</a>website, where players can unlock rewards for the game. Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is due to release in early 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gta-6-will-release-before-the-elder-scrolls-vi-todd-howard-practically-confirms/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Will Rockstar's GTA 6 be released before The Elder Scrolls VI? That's the question posed to Bethesda Creative Director Todd Howard <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRzIJQ-CGtt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Power Unlimited</a> on a red carpet for the presentation of the second season of Amazon's Fallout TV series, which airs on Prime Video starting on December 17.</p>



<p>Howard suggested GTA 6 would indeed launch before his studio's next big project. He then went on to profess his great respect and admiration for Rockstar's work.</p>



<p><em><strong>What game do you think releases sooner? Is it GTA 6, is it The Elder Scrolls VI, or is it Fallout 5?</strong></em></p>



<p><em>I got my fingers crossed for GTA 6. </em></p>



<p><strong><em>Do you think it will really come next year?</em></strong></p>



<p><em>I do. They are doing an incredible job. I know the folks at Rockstar and I think they are some of the absolute best at bringing a virtual world to life. It's a world that feels like it would go on even if you weren't there.</em></p>



<p>It's high praise from Howard, but then again, gamers who have experience with both franchises are aware of some similarities. While The Elder Scrolls is, of course, a roleplaying game and Grand Theft Auto is not, both try to achieve world simulations that are among the best in the industry.</p>



<p>Regarding the release window prediction, it isn't too much of a shock. Fallout 5 was never a realistic chance, as it remains in pre-production while Bethesda focuses on finishing The Elder Scrolls VI. Plus, it's not even been a whole month since Todd Howard himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told fans</a> that TES VI is 'still a long way off'.</p>



<p>Granted, on that occasion, he also teased that he'd love to make it 'just appear' when it's ready, but the chances that he'll be able to do that before November 19, 2026, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the new GTA VI release date</a>, are slim to none. There are still some people who believe Rockstar may delay the next Grand Theft Auto yet another time, but it's unlikely. They've never delayed a game three times in their entire history so far.</p>



<p>As for The Elder Scrolls VI, the track record of Bethesda Game Studios tells us that it took them nearly four years between The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and then another four years between The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4 (which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received</a> its Anniversary Edition to celebrate the 10th anniversary). Sure, Fallout 76 (just <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-now-live-adding-the-ghoul-from-the-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updated</a> with the largest map expansion to date and The Ghoul character from the TV show) launched only three years later, but that was essentially Fallout 4 modded to support multiplayer and set in Appalachia. </p>



<p>Starfield took five years to make, but it happened during COVID and it was also the first sci-fi game made by the developer, not to mention their first new IP in 25 years. They had to create the whole space travel and combat systems. It stands to reason that TES VI will require four years, thus putting its target window to around late 2027. On the other hand, GTA 6 will most likely be released in November 2026, and even if it slips a bit, it wouldn't be delayed beyond the end of Take-Two's fiscal quarter (March 31).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone, raise your glass and let’s make a toast to The FINALS, as it’s quite literally introduced a weapon skin that makes toast as you’re playing a match.</p>



<p>Just when you think you’ve seen every kind of wacky cosmetic in a live-service shooter, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-current-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The FINALS</a> comes along and boots all expectations out of the window and into the kitchen—next to your toaster. If the thrill of killing and scoring points doesn’t satiate your appetite, then a new toast-making skin might.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-finals-players-are-toast-thanks-to-new-skin">The FINALS Players Are Toast, Thanks To New Skin</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A real breadwinner. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’ve fallen out of love with the P90 or need a new exercise to use it, Embark might interest you with the new Toast &amp; Roast Skin.</p>



<p>When you want to reload, simply insert bread. Hilariously, the longer you fire the gun and the more you burn through your ammo clip, the more the bread will cook—Ergo, the more it will toast.</p>







<p>Should you suddenly be overcome by full, unadulterated, and unfilmed bullet-spewing menace, barreling through a full clip will completely incinerate your toast: Taking it from a well-toasted snack to a charred mess.</p>



<p>It’s a genius skin, and fits in with the arcadey and kooky nature of The FINALS.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It would look out of place in Call of Duty or Battlefield, that’s for sure. Is it your new favorite skin in The FINALS? If you still play The FINALS, what keeps drawing you in compared to all the other new shooters released in 2025?</p>



<p>As always, please head to the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> to express your thoughts, whether about The FINALS or anything else!</p>

<p>Well, say no more because (and thanks to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2025/12/03/samus-aran-finally-gets-the-chogokin-toy-she-deserves-next-year/">Forbes</a> for the heads-up) Bandai Spirits has announced a very appealing diecast 'Samus Aran in Varia Suit' model that's got us morphing in and out of ball mode furiously over here. Whatever that means.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, it is very nice. We agree. Standing at 21cm, there's a whole lot of lovely diecast metal here, and with lights accentuating all of the most important and iconic elements, such as Samus' great big cannon (so batteries required). We've also got lots of nice moveable joints, so you can recreate all your most frequent in-game poses (for this writer that's just Samus' death pose).</p>


<p>We've been over <a href="https://tamashiiweb.com/item/15649/?wovn=en">on the official website</a>, and the price is set at 30,800 yen (that's around £148 or $198) and you can also pre-order on the <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/goods/VM_NSJ_8_A3AA2">official Nintendo site</a>. However! Fly in the ointment klaxon. The pre-orders, which went live yesterday AM, are Japan-only for now. Although we can't see it being very long before you're able to get yourself one imported from either the main Bandai Spirits website or another vendor.</p>
<p>The expected release date for the model is May 2026. Ooooft. It would have looked so good on top of the Christmas tree, too. Maybe next year.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cejrwhgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

		<p>A big cinematic story trailer has been released for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV</a>, revealing some of the alien races that you’ll battle and a surprise Space Marine team-up in the fight for the future of the planet Kronus.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV - Story Trailer | PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ja6IOle_Thg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The planet Kronus was the setting for the second DLC campaign for the original Dawn of War game, and this leads us back to battling some familiar foes. Co-written by Black Library author John French, the story sees Kronus beset by an Ork infestation, now with two rival Ork Warbosses vying for power, while the Necrons are emerging from their tombs beneath the surface, as well as with an invasion fleet appearing above.</p>
<p>That’s a lot for a Space Marine Chapter to deal with, as formidable as they all are, so it’s a good thing that they’ll be getting a hand. The Adeptus Mechanicus will feature in the game, and the Dark Angels are also turning to to ally themselves with the Blood Ravens. You’ll get to play as both chapters, with Company Master Astoran and Chaplain Ezrael leading the Dark Angels into the fray. They’ve also teased that Dark Angels Primarch Lion El’Jonson could be playable at some point in the campaign, which would be a landmark moment for 40K in general, not just video games!</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV has been entrusted to Iron Harvest developer King Art Games and publisher Deep Silver. It’s a new leaf for the franchise, which was created by Relic Entertainment way back in 2004 and defined a new style of real time strategy with less focus on resource gathering and base building, and more on controlling the map and battlefield. Dawn of War enjoyed a good few expansions before Dawn of War 2 explored a more tactical approach in 2009, and Dawn of War 3 sought to blend them all together.</p>

<p>The interest in having King Art work on Dawn of War IV was organised by Games Workshop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawn-of-war-4-devs-on-taking-over-from-relic-the-health-of-real-time-strategy-and-reviving-a-legend-of-the-genre">some time before Iron Harvest’s release in 2020.</a> It’s not known if GW initially wanted to stick with Relic, but that time frame would have been around the time that Relic was focussed on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/25/age-of-empires-4-review/">Age of Empires IV</a> and later <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/company-of-heroes-3">Company of Heroes 3</a>. Relic has since gone through the tumult of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/relic-entertainment-confirm-layoffs-affecting-121-employees/">layoffs while under Sega’s ownership in 2023</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/sega-cuts-another-240-uk-jobs-relic-entertainment-goes-independent/">independence with an investor buyout in 2024</a>. They had plenty of things going on, in other words, but King Art had proven themselves with their steampunk RTS and could be great new stewards for this series. We look forward to seeing more in the run up to its 2026 release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amidst the veritable sea of announcements (<a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samson</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hello-sunshine-preview-you-the-desert-and-your-giant-robot-best-friend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hello Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/intriguing-sci-fi-first-person-bullet-hell-game-luna-abyss-gets-2026-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luna Abyss</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-shown-in-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawn of War IV</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/survival-pirate-adventure-game-crosswind-gets-rebranded-to-windrose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crosswind/Windrose</a>, to name a few) from the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025 showcase, SOL Shogunate certainly stood out among the most impressive.</p>



<p>Small independent developer Chaos Manufacturing reimagines the sci-fi genre in samurai fashion. In this 'space opera action RPG', a powerful shogunate rules a colonized solar system. However, it's about to be challenged by protagonist Yuzuki, the broken heir of a once-powerful samurai family that was massacred by a rival clan. With no choice left but to become an outlaw ronin, Yuzuki seeks to carve a bloody path of vengeance with a traditional ronin arsenal reforged for the battlefields of the future. As the game unfolds, new abilities and skill combinations are unlocked, enabling evolving tactics against increasingly challenging foes.</p>



<p>Yuzuki will explore the so-called Lunar Glass cities of SOL Shogunate, where artificial gravity and simulated night-time provide an Earth-like experience for the Moon's inhabitants, who also enjoy infrastructural wonders such as space elevators and high-speed rails. But beneath the bright skylines and opulent districts of the wealthy lie sprawling industrial zones where workers toil unseen to sustain the shogunate's pervasive influence.</p>



<p>According to the people behind SOL Shogunate, each metropolis on the Moon draws inspiration from a different era of Japanese history. To navigate these vertical districts, players must use gravity-assist gear. They will also uncover hidden layers within each biome and discover clues that unlock the mysteries of the game's backstory.</p>



<p>The developers at Chaos Manufacturing have designed combat to be all about precision, timing, and adaptability. Yuzuki is meant to feel like the ultimate space samurai, albeit genetically modified for the future of combat. Players will get to choose between various weapon types and can channel different types of energy into attacks to expose weaknesses, stagger foes, and create new tactical opportunities. As Yuzuki's abilities grow and her enhancements, like bio-ceramic skin and enhanced vision, evolve, new techniques shift how battles flow and how players overcome increasingly dangerous enemies.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The pinnacle of combat encounters are, of course, the boss fights. The studio promises dynamic, cinematic, multi-phase boss encounters that challenge players to identify and exploit weaknesses. Meanwhile, the music changes as battles intensify, featuring dynamic tracks hand-crafted for the game by talented recording artists, including Japanese rock band AliA.</p>



<p>SOL Shogunate is still in early development, but we already know the game will be released on PC and consoles. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219360/SOL_Shogunate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> also lists the surprisingly low system requirements.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Price, Explained—How Much Does It Cost On PlayStation 5?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-price/</link>
            <guid>1374076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re wondering whether a year-old Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5 still has a high price, you might be in for some turbulence. This guide has details on the game’s full price and the different editions you can pick up.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-release-date-early-access-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5</a> isn’t a free in-flight meal, far from it. Originally an Xbox and PC title, MSFS 2024 arrives on PS5 with all the updates and content additions that have landed over the last 12-plus months. But don’t think Xbox Game Studios and Microsoft will go easy on you, PlayStation owners.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-does-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-cost">How Much Does Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Xbox Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Standard Edition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5 has a fairly routine $69.99 or £69.99 price.</strong></p>



<p>No discount, no price reduction, it’s a full-priced port on PlayStation. It is a premium property with a ton of content, though, so it’s worth the price of admission. When you also consider that this is the first entry in the series’ 40-year history to arrive on PlayStation, it’s quite a significant milestone.</p>



<p>Many will see $69.99 as a fair deal. This is only for the Standard Edition, so is the damage much worse for more expensive packages?</p>







<h2 id="h-all-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-editions-amp-prices">All Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Editions &amp; Prices</h2>



<p><strong>There are four Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 editions for PS5: Standard, Deluxe, Premium Deluxe, and Aviator.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of each edition and what it costs. Warning: The later editions get sky-high with their pricing.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">MSFS 2024 Edition</th><th data-align="center">Price</th><th data-align="center">Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Standard Edition</td><td data-align="center">$69.99 or £69.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-70 Aircraft<br>-150 Airports</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$99.99 or £99.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-Early Access<br>-80 Aircraft<br>-155 Airports</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Premium Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$129.99 or £129.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-Early Access<br>-95 Aircraft<br>-160 Airports</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Aviator Edition</td><td data-align="center">$199.99 or £199.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-Early Access<br>-125 Aircraft<br>-160 Airports</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It’s up to you if you can justify as much as $200 for the PS5 launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. What do you think of its pricing? Should it be more reasonable? Is $200 too much for simply adding more vehicles and airports?

<p>A new Monster Hunter Showcase is scheduled for December 8, 2025, featuring the title update 4 for MH Wilds and the latest information on MH Stories 3. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-still-2025s-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top launches of 2025</a>, but some PC performance issues and content complaints have brought criticism from the community. The developers already confirmed they are working on those issues and have now announced a new showcase that will provide players with details on another free content update for Monster Hunter Wilds and the latest information on their upcoming title, MH Stories 3: Twisted Reflection. </p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-monster-hunter-showcase-on-december-8-2025">How to Watch Monster Hunter Showcase on December 8, 2025?</h2>



<p>Announced through the Monster Hunter <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1996867143057445119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the Monster Hunter Showcase will begin on Monday, December 8, 2025, at 2:00 PM PST. Interested readers can tune in to the live stream on the official <a href="https://t.co/WbntyFTmOM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://t.co/KNEebgyzzy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> accounts. The developers have also explicitly stated that “For Monster Hunter Wilds, the event will focus solely on Free Title Update 4.” For Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, we might get to see new story details or maybe a gameplay deep dive. Players will have to wait to know for sure. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is set to arrive in March 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2. The title is the latest instalment of the RPG series set in Monster Hunter World.
