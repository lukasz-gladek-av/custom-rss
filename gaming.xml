            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-will-release-in-october-dataminer-teases">The rumours were true</a>: Bandai Namco has confirmed that Dragon Ball Sparking Zero will indeed release in October – 11th October, to be exact – and it will feature a day one season pass.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco also took the opportunity to announce four different editions – standard, digital-only deluxe, ultimate, and premium. While all will give you the base game, you'll need to purchase a deluxe, ultimate, or premium edition to get the three-day early-access period, season pass, and season pass bonus of Summon Shenron.</p>

<p>The season pass includes the first three DLC packs, which appear to include over 20 additional characters. There's also the now-prerequisite sweetener for anyone looking to pre-order the game ahead of its October street date.</p>
<p>For players with their eye on the pricey premium edition, you'll get everything above as well as an Ultimate Edition Upgrade Pack voucher code – although we don't yet know what that does – as well as "exclusive" cards, a steelbook cover, a metallic bookmark, a lenticular card, and an "exclusive" diorama (click on the image below to get a closer look). </p>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero will release on 11th October, 2024, on PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-ball-sparkling-zero-has-secured-an-esrb-rating-as-a-hidden-video-pops-up-on-the-eu-youtube-account">Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero secured an ESRB rating back in March</a>, shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tributes-shared-as-dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyama-passes-away">manga legend Akira Toriyama died aged 68</a>. Toriyama was best known for his work as the creator of the Dragon Ball manga, which was then adapted into numerous anime series, films, and video games. He also worked on multiple video games and was responsible for the character designs in Dragon Quest, Chrono Trigger and Blue Dragon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/delta-force-hawk-ops-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-timi-studio-goes-next-gen.894693/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-hands-on-preview-timi-studio-goes-next-gen/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tencent's TiMi Studios and Team Jade recently invited Wccftech to Los Angeles to get an early look at the team's first fully-fledged console (as well as PC and mobile) title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-shows-off-impressive-unreal-engine-5-black-hawk-down-campaign-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Force: Hawk Ops</a>. As the first new entry in the Delta Force franchise in fifteen years, Call of Duty Mobile's director Leo Yao has certainly picked a passion project that most modern gamers might have had the opportunity to play. Stepping away from the tactical roots of the Delta Force franchise, Hawk Ops aims to modernize the shooter series with modern components while retaining some of the signature elements of the series.</p>
<p>For our 90-minute early look, we were invited to play two of Delta Force: Hawk Ops' multiplayer modes and get a brief peek at the Black Hawk Down campaign. It was a relatively low-key affair, with only a couple of Team Jade members accompanying me as the only media attending that particular appointment. There were only a handful of other media present across other appointments and NetEase billed this as a VIP opportunity before the game is properly unveiled at Summer Game Fest this weekend.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty Mobile influence is immediately present as players put together a loadout before getting boots on the ground. Players first pick an operator to field in battle, each with a variety of special weapons and abilities powered by cooldown timers that differentiate one another far more than just being a differently dressed target on the battlefield. The weapons themselves come with a variety of attachments that can be unlocked and slotted in that feels right at home from Call of Duty. Attachments seemed to have a currency cost associated with the basic currency that's awarded for simply playing Delta Force, and I couldn't get a glimpse into the cost per part nor if there was a per-account or per-weapon requirement before an attachment or weapon was unlocked.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Recon_3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The primary multiplayer mode, Havoc Warfare, is their large-scale operations taking place across expansive maps with teams broken down into bite-sized squads. This particular map featured an attack-and-defend style layout. Attackers would need to push forward and overtake points, while defenders had to keep enemy forces at bay until either side's reinforcements were depleted. Players can spawn upon squadmates out of danger or back at select key points, a mechanic I've used in Battlefield and playing as a medic or assault class to resupply on the front lines. With Delta Force: Hawk Ops, I could see a glimpse of the various operator classes performing in similar ways, but I would like to take a much longer look at the multiplayer modes to see how progression and operator unlocks are handled at a much larger scale. Would the game reward for a particular playstyle beyond just gunning for the highest K:D ratio? Could playing the medic and dropping medpacks be a valid option for hitting the scoreboards? How do tanks and other vehicles handle in Havoc Warfare? These were all questions I was left pondering after completing my brief preview, and I aim to find the answers to them in the next closed beta or hands-on sessions.</p>
<p>Delta Force: Hawk Ops' second signature mode revealed so far and was playable in this month's hands-on event is Hazard Operations. This is Team Jade's take on the extraction shooter: squads of three Operators pick a spot to spawn into the map, scour the map for loot and high-value targets, complete mini-missions, and try to extract and bring what they've earned forward into another game. The one map showcased was fairly large to traverse without jumping into a vehicle, and I was able to make it through most of the math, stumbling into hidden loot caches and heavy artillery-wielding minibosses and beginning my path toward extraction before I ran across another player. Being that this was an offline session, those players I ran into were all bots, and about on par with the level of intelligence, one would expect from Call of Duty Mobile bot matches (which is to say not very reactive or dangerous if not caught unaware). Much of the loot was in the category of "useless and not worth the bag space" to pick up but once in a while, differently colored loot would be revealed that would be worth a significant chunk of currency if successfully extracted. The act of looting requires players to stop and inspect a cabinet or other container, wait for the inventory menu to pop up, and then wait for items to get scanned one by one. In its current form, the mechanic sounds good on paper to force players to make deliberate choices on when to stop and hunt for loot, but in execution, players just rifle through the inventory, waiting to see what color a souvenir might be all the while hoping that an enemy doesn't walk into the room out of the blue.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Combat_2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>There are certainly some novel concepts to Hazard Operations that I do want to see fleshed out in greater detail. Players can bring forth different rarity tiers of ammunition with them into the operation and I would be curious to see what differentiates a green box of 7.62mm rounds versus a purple one. Similarly, there are many ways to equip an operator, from helmets and backpacks and armor satchels that provide different numerical benefits both in terms of defense and also gear slots. If these might provide other passive boons to a player, I did not yet have the opportunity to see them firsthand, but I would not be surprised, given how varied the loot has been thus far. Another area of opportunity is in the player count. During our interview, Leo Yao revealed that they're planning for less than half of the roster count that players might see in Call of Duty's DMZ mode (which is 22 squads of three players for a total of 66 in all). Whether the AI bots and missions will make that world feel more alive is yet to be seen, but for a game that wants to capture the high stakes of being an extraction shooter, there needs to be more danger around every corner. I must give Team Jade credit for having random escape points that might not always open up in every map rotation.</p>

<p>Lastly, Leo Yao showed off a brief campaign trailer for their Black Hawk Down story. Interestingly enough, this is the second time that Delta Force has crossed over with Black Hawk Down, but unlike the 2003 title, Delta Force: Hawk Ops draws from the film rather than the book of the same name. Leo Yao was proud to talk about securing the rights to the film (and the Delta Fore franchise as a whole) and use clips from the movie. More details on the campaign will follow, as Team Jade was heavily focused on the multiplayer component, and the campaign received its first trailer during Summer Game Fest. The PC Alpha test will take place in July, as you can read <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2507950/view/4173227802700072746?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

Currently, super samples are locked to Helldivers 2 difficulties seven to nine (Suicide Mission, Impossible, and Helldive), making them out of reach to many. Super samples are used to unlock the final ship module in each section.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Helldivers 2 Viper Commandos Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>And here’s a really welcome change: visible supply lines and attack origins. Currently, planets viewable on the galaxy map have invisible lines between them that determine the path to liberation. To access a planet, Super Earth must have full control of a planet with a supply line connecting to it. But because Helldivers 2 does not surface this mechanic, the wider player base is most often oblivious to the focus of attention when new Major Orders come around. Hardcore Helldivers 2 players who enjoy playing the meta narrative that is the Galactic War believe this lack of information in the user interface has caused some Major Orders to fail.</p><p>The early patch news is going down well within the Helldivers community, which had called on Arrowhead to take more time with updates and Premium Warbonds after previous efforts fell flat. “It was frankly about time we offered you something,” Twinbeard said in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dagnf3/comment/l7kdkon/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on the Helldivers subreddit</a>. “We know you've been waiting a long time. Hopefully the patch and new warbond are two steps in the right direction.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Speaking of warbonds, Helldivers 2 gets <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-reveals-jungle-themed-premium-warbond-viper-commandos-heres-what-to-expect">the new jungle-themed Viper Commandos warbond</a> on June 13. In a recent post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/helldivers-ii-enlists-the-viper-commandos-warbond-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation Blog</u></a>, Katherine Baskin, social media and community manager at Arrowhead, said the studio had responded to feedback on Helldivers 2’s warbonds and had changed its approach as a result. For a start, Arrowhead has slowed down the pace at which it releases warbonds “to give us a little bit more time to polish these designs before they’re released.” Baskin continued: “We don’t want to rush anything out of the oven before it’s fully baked.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“We know you've been waiting a long time. Hopefully the patch and new warbond are two steps in the right direction.</p></div><p>So, next week is a big one for Helldivers 2, with the game-changing patch and warbond set to hit around the same time. It feels like the start of a new way of working for Arrowhead and cadence of updates for the game. Last month, Arrowhead revealed it was in the process of setting the studio up so it could “make more and better stuff” in the long-term. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d2pozq/hello_fellow_helldivers_greetings_from_the_newly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an introductory post on reddit</u></a>, new CEO Shams Jorjani, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs"><u>who recently replaced previous Arrowhead CEO and now current Chief Creative Officer Johan Pilestedt</u></a>, said the studio has had to adjust to the enormous success Helldivers 2 has brought to the company.</p><p>PlayStation 5 and PC co-op shooter Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time, having shifted an incredible 12 million copies in just 12 weeks since going on sale earlier this year. Amid the huge revenue Helldivers 2 has generated, Arrowhead itself has suffered a number of crises, including launch server problems and, most recently, a battle with Sony itself over the console maker’s controversial attempt to force Steam players to account link to PlayStation Network.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>In “The Star Named EOS,” Dei’s adventure is narrated by his mother’s voice as he explores locations she once photographed. Suzie Yeung, known for her role as Yuffie in Final Fantasy VII Remake and FFVII Rebirth, lends her voice to the English version. Aoi Yūki provides the Japanese voiceover, and Shandy Ma performs the Chinese voice acting.</p>
<p>The Star Named EOS will be available on PC, Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5, with a 10% discount for pre-orders. This discount is not live for Switch owners in Europe yet, as the pre-order will not be live until July 4th. The game will be priced at $14.99.</p>

            <p>Persona 3 Reload: Episode Aigis - The Answer will release on 10th September, 2024.</p>
<p>The news came as part of the Persona Live Tour 2024 concert in Yokohama, during which developer Atlus confirmed when the "final set of content for the Expansion Pass" will be available across all platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and last-gen consoles. It'll also be available for no extra cost to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, too.</p>
<p>Here's a new – if disappointingly brief – teaser to mark the occasion:</p>

<p>Added to the main game 16 years ago with the release of Persona 3 FES, Episode Aigis – also known as The Answer when it was released in North America – is described as "a major post-ending DLC that expands the story of Persona 3 Reload and serves as a story epilogue".</p>
<p>"After unravelling the mysteries of the Dark Hour, fighting epic battles through Tartarus, and all the unforgettable events of Persona 3 Reload, the S.E.E.S. members find themselves trapped in a never-ending March 31st," Altus teases. "Journey through the Abyss of Time as Aigis, undertake new challenges, and uncover the cause of this strange fate and the truth of what happened on that day…"</p>
<p>If you don't have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, the Persona 3 Reload: Expansion Pass is available for £29 (although the price varies across territories) and also includes the previously released Persona 5 Royal EX BGM Set, Persona 4 Golden EX BGM Set, and Velvet Costume &amp; BGM Set.</p>
<p>Persona 3 Reload, released earlier this year, was initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-3-reload-review">criticised for not including all the extras</a> from various past versions of the game to provide a complete experience.</p>
<p>This revised version of Episode Aigis will include some differences, however, including a few tweaked lines of dialogue, a "completely new aspect" to its core dungeon adding to exploration elements, and a generally faster pace thanks to improvements from Reload.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24171620/wholesome-direct-2024-sgf-trailers-news<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Despite its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/27/23523251/cozy-games-animal-crossing-stardew-world-of-warcraft-dragonflight">cozy appearance</a>, Wholesome Direct 2024 is actually shaping up to be the most packed event of Summer Game Fest. The hour-long presentation featured more than 70 different games. Some were brand-new announcements, some were previously known games that got a fresh trailer or release date, and a handful of titles even launched during the event.</p><p>Now, 70 is a large number, so to help, I’ve curated the games that stood out to me the most. You can also watch the full presentation <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DocV4LvEYJcg">right here</a> to soak in every detail. Even better: many of the games have <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcurator%2F35411526%2Fsale%2Fwholesomedirect2024">demos on Steam that you can check out</a>. Anyway, here are my picks, in no particular order.</p><p><h4><em>Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge</em></h4></p><p><h5>Launching today on PC and Switch</h5></p><p><em>Kamaeru</em> looks like a more interactive take on <em>Neko Atsume</em>, only with frogs instead of cats and a beautiful painterly art style. The goal is to not only build a sanctuary to raise those frogs in but also restore their wetland habitat. Best of all: it’s out today.</p><div><figcaption><em>Squeakross: Home Squeak Home.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Alblune</cite></p></div><p><h4><em>Squeakross: Home Squeak Home</em></h4></p><p><h5>Launching on Steam; no release date announced</h5></p><p>This is what would happen if you mashed <em>Animal Crossing</em> with <em>Picross</em>. The game is all about solving nonograms, which then create items (out of cheese, naturally) that you can use to decorate a cozy home. It also looks to be jam-packed with mouse puns.</p><p><h4><em>Discounty</em></h4></p><p><h5>Launching 2025 on PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox</h5></p><p>Calling <em>Stardew Valley</em> fans. <em>Discounty</em> looks like it has a similarly charming vibe, only with less farming and more business. Instead of building up a farmstead, you’re tasked with running a grocery store in a small town, which naturally means getting deeply involved in the community.</p><p><h4><em>Kitsune Tails</em></h4></p><p><h5>Launching August 1st on PC</h5></p><p>A side-scrolling platformer that looks a bit like <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em>, if only it was coated in Japanese folklore and mythology. It also comes from the same developer behind the oddball political platformer <a href="https://eniko.itch.io/superbernieworld"><em>Super Bernie World</em></a>.</p><p><h4><em>Moonstone Island</em></h4></p><p><h5>Launching June 19th on the Nintendo Switch</h5></p><p><em>Moonstone Island</em> is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1658150%2FMoonstone_Island%2F">already out on PC</a>, but its mix of life sim and creature collection feels like a perfect fit for the Switch. There’s a lot going on in this game: farming, potion brewing, card-based battles, and spirits to tame. Plus, you can ride around on a broom.</p><p><h4><em>Caravan SandWitch</em></h4></p><p><h5>Launching on PC, Switch, and PS5; no release date announced</h5></p><p>The end of the world is usually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5">dark</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video">dire</a>, but <em>Caravan SandWitch</em> takes things in a slightly more wholesome direction. It’s an exploration game about venturing through a wasteland in your trusty van, and it has no combat or death, so you can drive around at your own pace.</p><p><h4><em>Lost and Found Co.</em></h4></p><p><h5>Launching on PC, iOS, Android, and consoles; no release date announced</h5></p><p>This is looking like the most charming <em>Where’s Waldo?</em>-style game since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/15/14611446/hidden-folks-review-iphone-ipad-steam-apple-tv"><em>Hidden Folks</em></a>. But whereas that was a black-and-white world, <em>Lost and Found Co.</em> is bursting with color. It even has a cute little dragon.</p><p><h4><em>Afterlove EP</em></h4></p><p><h5>Launching on Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox later this year</h5></p><p>From the creators of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23689348/coffee-talk-episode-2-review-ps5-xbox-switch-steam"><em>Coffee Talk</em></a>, <em>Afterlove EP</em> is described as “a colorful mixtape of genres” that’s part dating sim, part rhythm game, and part story-driven adventure. Whatever it is, it both looks and sounds great, with hand-drawn art from Soyatu and a soundtrack of Indonesian pop-rock from L’alphalpha.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171519/wholesome-games-direct-june-2024-showcase-trailers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="tTa55T">Saturday’s Wholesome Direct showcased dozens of (yes, wholesome) games, including four that surprise launched alongside the event. Four whole games! Those games are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978150/Kamaeru_A_Frog_Refuge/"><em>Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge</em></a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2935840/POOOOL/"><em>POOOOL</em></a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2562620/The_Palace_on_the_Hill/"><em>The Palace on the Hill</em></a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1487630/Tracks_of_Thought/"><em>Tracks of Thought</em></a><em>. </em>All are available on Windows PC Steam, but you’ll also find <em>Kamaeru</em> on itch.io and Nintendo Switch; <em>The Palace on the Hill</em> on Android, Apple iOS, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X; and <em>Tracks of Thought</em> on Windows PC via the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p id="klinPc"><em>Kamaera</em> is basically a frog farming simulator, where you’re essentially setting up a habitat for your frogs to thrive, while <em>POOOOL</em> is a physics puzzle game that sounds like a twisted <em>Suika Game. </em>Meanwhile, <em>The Palace on the Hill</em> is a slice-of-life game about life in rural India in the ’90s and <em>Tracks of Thought</em> is a card-based mystery solving ride. They all couldn’t be more different, but each looks delightfully wholesome all the same.</p>

<p id="of3q1C">Beyond the four surprise released games, the Wholesome Direct was not short on games to get excited for. Some that I’m looking forward to include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2871440/Squeakross_Home_Squeak_Home/"><em>Squeakross: Home Squeak Home</em></a>, which is mouse <em>Picross</em>; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1065070/t/"><em>Été</em></a>, a watercolor painting simulator; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1935330/Sopa__Tale_of_the_Stolen_Potato/"><em>Sopa: Tale of the Stolen Potato</em></a>, an adventure game about getting a potato for your grandma’s soup; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2449160/While_Waiting/"><em>While Waiting</em></a>, a silly game that makes you wait around; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2133760/Tiny_Bookshop/"><em>Tiny Bookshop</em></a>, which has a new demo available; and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2769240/Wax_Heads/"><em>Wax Heads</em></a>, where you run a record store.</p>
<p id="OMOqqR">There were too many incredible looking games shown during the Wholesome Direct to list here, so if you missed the show, I’d recommend watching it for yourself. There’s a lot to look forward to in the next couple of years.</p>

Even certain power-ups like <em>SMB3</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/from-kuribos-shoe-to-requiem-for-a-dreams-fridge-skull-5816326&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/from-kuribos-shoe-to-requiem-for-a-dreams-fridge-skull-5816326">Kuribo’s Shoe</a></span> have one-to-one replications in <em>Kitsune Tails</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="6255ca3a77abd44d5273101707b225fa" data-recommend-id="image://6255ca3a77abd44d5273101707b225fa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A fox girl platforms around a snowy mountain with floating platforms" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A fox girl platforms around a snowy mountain with floating platforms" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kitsune Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6255ca3a77abd44d5273101707b225fa" data-recommend-id="image://6255ca3a77abd44d5273101707b225fa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A fox girl platforms around a snowy mountain with floating platforms" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But similarly to what I discovered with the new <em>SSX Tricky</em>-inspired indie game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ssx-spiritual-successor-tricky-madness-demo-steam-1851519350&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ssx-spiritual-successor-tricky-madness-demo-steam-1851519350"><em>Tricky Madness</em></a></span>, <em>Kitsune Tails’ </em>weaknesses also lie in how close it tries to stick to its inspiration. Movement feels a bit floatier than it should, and my first gameplay moments were full of missing jumps because Yuzu wouldn’t land where I expected her to. I also found that I couldn’t get as close to some enemies as I expected due to the hit box sizes.<br></p><p>And the aforementioned invincibility power-up, clearly a nod to <em>SMB3</em>, is a bit difficult to use at the moment. The power-up turns Yuzu into a smaller rainbow-glowing fox form, but the e issue is that this form currently doesn’t have a timer, so you have no way of knowing when the power-up will end. During my gameplay, it would run out without me realizing, and I’d run into enemies or walk on spikes and die. </p><p>When I did finally got a handle on the game, I enjoyed its quick platforming and the power-ups it offered. The visuals of <em>Kitsune Tails</em> also help its cause, as it boasts gorgeous pixel art with a pastel palette focusing on pops of pink and purple. The game changes seasons as you progress through levels, too, a feature that helps show off its wide range of beautiful art (I found the cherry blossom season especially beautiful). However, the demo levels still feel a bit simple.

It's been a while...&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Where <em>Kitsune Tails</em> seeks to move past its inspirations is the narrative, which shouldn’t be hard considering the early <em>Mario </em>games don’t really have much of one. And <em>Kitsune Tails</em>’ story might be its biggest draw. Yuzu is trying to help keep the peace between the Kitsune and the humans, and along the way, she finds herself in the middle of a sapphic love triangle. Yuzu is crushing on a human healer while Yuzu’s kitsune friend is still crushing on her.<br></p><p>This very gay drama is the emotional and narrative core of <em>Kitsune Tails</em>. It’s a cute story to watch unfold and the promise of seeing a new cutscene gave me motivation to beat every level I could. As a player who isn’t an expert at platforming games, an investment in the narrative is likely to be the thing that hooks me about <em>Kitsune Tails</em>.</p><hr><p><em>Kitsune Tails</em> is set to launch on August 1 for PC via Steam and itch.io.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>70+ wholesome games were teased or revealed during the direct, four of which shadow drop released during the livestream.</p></section>

                <p dir="ltr">This year's Wholesome Direct was a real doozy, showing off over 70 games. Whether you're in the mood to open up a traveling book store in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tiny-bookshop/" data-ref-id="5000-571689">Tiny Bookshop</a>, raise an assortment of faithful crablings in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crab-god-mother-of-the-tide/" data-ref-id="5000-584845">Crab God</a>, perform tricks on your witch's skatebroom in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ila-a-frosty-glide/" data-ref-id="5000-631142">Ila: A Frosty Glide</a>, or test your mettle in a 3D Legend of Zelda meets social sim in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dungeons-of-hinterberg/" data-ref-id="5000-590949">Dungeons Of Hinterberg</a>, the Wholesome Direct has a little bit for everyone. Below, we round up every game shown off during the Wholesome Direct, listed in the order of their reveal.</p><p dir="ltr">During the Direct, four of the games that were shown off were shadow dropped onto Steam as well--frog-focused farming simulator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kamaeru-a-frog-refuge/" data-ref-id="5000-590688">Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge</a>, pool-inspired physics puzzler <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pooool/" data-ref-id="5000-626852">POOOOL</a>, '90s rural India-set slice-of-life adventure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-palace-on-the-hill/" data-ref-id="5000-529852">The Palace on the Hill</a>, and card-based talk-'em-up RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tracks-of-thought/" data-ref-id="5000-524083">Tracks of Thought</a>. All four games look <em>fantastic </em>if you're looking for something to play while awaiting the next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5449/" data-ref-id="2900-5449">Summer Game Fest</a> announcement or livestream.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Mythmatch</h3><p dir="ltr">Revealed for the first time during the Wholesome Direct, Mythmatch sees you play as Artemis, Greek goddess of the hunt and wisdom, who uses her innate talents to solve environmental match-three puzzles. Her efforts help her learn more about the lives of mortals and her fellow Olympians, allowing her to "match" and bring them together as well.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Caravan SandWitch</h3><p dir="ltr">The Wholesome Direct revealed that a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1582650/Caravan_SandWitch/" rel="nofollow ">Steam demo</a> is now available for Caravan SandWitch. Caravan SandWitch is a narrative-driven exploration adventure in which you explore a predominantly savannah-covered planet in search of your missing sister, disembarking from your van to search for upgrades or explore the layers of history that defined the planet, from the original indigenous citizens, to the robotic people that they built and subsequently left behind, to the humans who settled and ultimately never left.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Tiny Bookshop</h3><p dir="ltr">Up next, the Wholesome Direct revealed that there's a free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2133760/Tiny_Bookshop/" rel="nofollow ">Steam demo</a> for Tiny Bookshop as well. Tiny Bookshop gives you right what it says on the tin: a life-sim in which you run a small book store. Similar to several cooking or bartending sims, the crux of the gameplay is satisfying customers' needs by listening to their asks and then finding something to fit their needs. Satisfied customers will return for more books and increase your rating, growing your business as you acquaint yourself with more of the locals. Tiny Bookshop is set to launch in 2025.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Été</h3><p dir="ltr">Already revealed at past showcases and livestreams, Été is a game in which you create paintings with 3D stamps, bringing life and color to your city. You can engage with other people in choice-driven dialogue and unlock new stamps over time that help you accomplish the tasks they ask of you. The Wholesome Direct revealed that Été now has a launch date of July 23, and is releasing for PC.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Discounty</h3><p dir="ltr">Discounty falls into that niche of "wholesome game with a potentially darker underlying narrative." The Wholesome Direct trailer showcased the game's cute pixel-like art style and explained how the game has you run your own supermarket by filling out your store's stock and managing its layout via a grid system. As you make more money, you can expand and even hire employees, though the cutesy messaging of the trailer "glitched" near the end, with a hint that the game will deal with the pollution and overconsumption that comes with running a supermarket and making money, as well as the issues that accompany those problems. As revealed during the Wholesome Direct, Discounty is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Switch, and PC in 2025.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Rooster</h3><p dir="ltr">Rooster is a point-and-click narrative-driven adventure game about the Chinese zodiac. You play as Rooster, a troublesome member of the zodiac, who is sent back in time by Dragon in order to learn some life lessons and grow as a person. These lessons play out as a diverse assortment of minigames, each with an underlying message for Rooster.</p><h3 dir="ltr">New games for Playdate</h3><p dir="ltr">The Wholesome Direct followed the look at Rooster with a quick montage of a half-dozen new games coming to Playdate, the handheld device with a 1-bit black and white screen and a crank.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Into The Emberlands</h3><p dir="ltr">A new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2856370/Into_the_Emberlands/" rel="nofollow ">Steam demo</a> was revealed for Into the Emberlands. Into the Emberlands is a roguelike in which you're charged with protecting a village from a looming darkness. The gameplay loop sees you traveling out into the wilds to gather resources ahead of coming attacks, before returning home to defend yourself and your allies. Into the Emberlands is set to launch in early access on June 19.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Squeakross: Home Squeak Home</h3><p dir="ltr">Revealed for the first time during the Wholesome Direct, Squeakross: Home Squeak Home--as its name implies--sees you play picross, but you're mice and you're playing the game with pieces of cheese. Each solved puzzle rewards you with new furniture to decorate your tiny houses or clothes to dress up each mouse.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Critter Cafe</h3><p dir="ltr">Another new reveal during the Wholesome Direct, Critter Cafe sees you rescue cute little critters from dangerous situations or harsh environments and enlist them into servitude at your cafe. The game has big Pokemon vibes, but with more of a puzzle twist than battling things out and genderless character customization so you can more easily achieve your ideal appearance in the game.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Garden Of The Sea</h3><p dir="ltr">Released for VR in 2022, Garden of the Sea is coming to Steam and Nintendo Switch later this year. This first-person game sees you awaken on a mysterious island where you can plant and grow fruits and vegetables and decorate your house. You can also sail to other islands dotted across the ocean, uncovering new resources you can bring back to your home island.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Fantastic Haven</h3><p dir="ltr">In Fantastic Haven, you play as a mage in a world where magic is dying, forcing you to explore it and do your best to find and preserve arcane secrets before they're lost forever. The main crux of your efforts is finding fantastical creatures that are going extinct and doing your best to build structures and systems that might save them from completely dying out. As revealed during the Wholesome Direct, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719840/Fantastic_Haven_Prologue/" rel="nofollow ">the free prologue for the game dropped today on Steam</a> if you want to try it out--the full game is scheduled for Q3 2024.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Crab God</h3><p dir="ltr">The Wholesome Direct revealed that Crab God is also getting a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2289390/Crab_God/" rel="nofollow ">Steam demo</a>. You play as a (hopefully) benevolent deity in Crab God, raising crablings and teaching them skills as they grow up. You also can shape the environment, building coral reefs to attract new sea life and expand your domain.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Ila: A Frosty Glide</h3><p dir="ltr">The Wholesome Direct next announced a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1560160/ILA_A_Frosty_Glide/" rel="nofollow ">Steam demo</a> for Ila: A Frosty Glide. In A Frosty Glide, you play as the titular Ila, a young witch-in-training who can't yet fly her broom so she customizes it with a skateboard to create a skatebroom, a delightful invention that can briefly glide through the air and perform sick tricks. Set in an open world you can freely explore, A Frosty Glide tasks you with uncovering the secrets of magic to expand Ila's skillset, all in service of eventually finding a way to reach the summit of a mountain.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Sally</h3><p dir="ltr">The Wholesome Direct revealed a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2165040/Sally/" rel="nofollow ">Steam demo</a> for Sally as well. In Sally, you start as a kid living aboard a flying skyship piloted by two loving grandmas. Each new playthrough changes who else lives aboard the skyship, as well as their likes, desires, and personalities. As you grow up, your interactions with these characters will shape their relationship with you, as well as whether you specialize as a crafter, cook, farmer, or builder, resulting in several unique storylines that can end in various ways.</p><h3 dir="ltr">New games from Fellow Traveller</h3><p dir="ltr">Following the trailer for Sally, the Wholesome Direct hosted another montage, this time for the half-dozen new games coming out attached to Fellow Traveller Games, an Australian game publisher. Among the titles highlighted is Times &amp; Galaxy, a brave little indie considering it's dropping the same day as Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC on June 21.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Dungeons Of Hinterberg</h3><p dir="ltr">The Wholesome Direct then revealed that a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1983260/Dungeons_of_Hinterberg/" rel="nofollow ">Steam demo</a> is out now for Dungeons of Hinterberg. Set in the Austrian Alps, Dungeons of Hinterberg sees you play as law-trainee Luisa who, after suffering serious burnout, decides she's going to take a little break and go snowboarding and monster slaying. Between dungeon dives (all of which give off serious 3D Legend of Zelda vibes in terms of the puzzles, gear upgrades, and combat), you can forge friendships with others staying at Hinterberg. Dungeons of Hinterberg is set to launch for Xbox and PC on July 18.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Fruitbus</h3><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484130/Fruitbus/" rel="nofollow ">Steam demo</a> for Fruitbus was next revealed during the Wholesome Direct. Fruitbus sees you play as a bear that runs a food truck during their cross-country trip to find their grandmother's old friends and reunite them for "one last feast." As you journey toward each long-lost friend, you'll converse with locals, satisfying their orders to the best of your ability, and presumably cry a lot if the trailer's tone is any indication. Fruitbus is scheduled to launch this October.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Freeride</h3><p dir="ltr">Freeride is an adventure RPG in which you board a train to the spirit world and encounter an assortment of troubled characters, each of whom could use your help. The problems facing each passenger are designed to be solved in multiple ways and the game itself is designed to be replayed more than once, encouraging you to use what you learn with each playthrough to uncover additional secrets and unlock progressively better outcomes with each attempt. Freeride is set to launch in Q1 2025, and as revealed during the Wholesome Direct, it now has a free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1597910/FREERIDE/" rel="nofollow ">Steam demo</a>.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge</h3><p dir="ltr">The first of four games to shadow drop during the Wholesome Direct, Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge is a farming sim in which you restore wetlands and collect and breed frogs. You can craft goods to better house your amphibian pals and even give them little pets to make them (and you!) happy. Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge is available for PC.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Lost &amp; Found Co.</h3><p dir="ltr">Lost &amp; Found Co. is a Where's Waldo-looking game in which you search for lost items amidst the massive clutter of multiple environments. Your successes will net you more money to further customize yourself, as well as additional customers with increasingly complex tasks. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101390/Lost_and_Found_Co/" rel="nofollow ">Steam demo</a> for the game was revealed during the Wholesome Direct.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Littlelands</h3><p dir="ltr">The Wholesome Direct next played a new trailer for Littlelands. Littlelands looks like Stardew Valley but with an art style more like Animal Crossing (even featuring characters with little bodies and big heads!). The game includes farming, light dungeon delving, and crafting--everything we've come to expect from the genre. Littlelands is set to release for PC.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Minami Lane</h3><p dir="ltr">Already out on PC, Minami Lane is set to come to Switch later this year. The game sees you build and oversee a single city street, customizing its layout and unlocking new types of buildings as business grows. The game is all about maximizing citizen happiness to attract more and more people to your street.</p><h3 dir="ltr">POOOOL</h3><p dir="ltr">The second of the four shadow-dropped games, POOOOL is a physics-based game in which you hit pool balls to "eat" the others on the table to grow your collection as much as possible, all while trying to fit as many balls on the table as you can. It looks goofy as hell, but could be quite competitive with built-in systems to track your efforts against friends.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Tiny Lands 2</h3><p dir="ltr">2021's Tiny Lands is getting a sequel, as revealed during the Wholesome Direct. Like its predecessor, Tiny Lands 2 gives you an assortment of fully rotatable and zoomable 3D models that you have to examine and compare in order to find the differences between them. Unlike the first game, Tiny Lands 2 can be played by two people at the same time, letting players work together to uncover the differences between the nearly identical dioramas.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Moonstone Island</h3><p dir="ltr">Already available on PC, Moonstone Island is now coming to Switch on June 19. This creature-collecting life sim sees you explore over 100 different islands, finding and capturing the small monsters you come across. You can meet other collectors too, making friends with some and battling others in card-focused turn-based combat.</p><h3 dir="ltr">On Your Tail</h3><p dir="ltr">Up next, the Wholesome Direct revealed the details for a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2132560/On_Your_Tail/" rel="nofollow ">Steam demo</a> for On Your Tail and the game looks <em>phenomenal</em>. On Your Tail is a mystery-driven life sim in which your relaxing island getaway (including meeting friends, going fishing, forging relationships, and doing other typical life sim activities) is routinely interrupted with sleuthing and interrogations as you solve a handful of local mysteries and hunt down a masked thief. Also, everyone is a cute animal person. On Your Tail is coming to PC and Switch this year.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Spilled</h3><p dir="ltr">In Spilled, you pilot a boat that cleans up waste and oil spills. As you sail through dirty oceans and murky canals, you'll earn money to upgrade your boat so that you can clean the waters more efficiently. If you're thinking about checking it out, you can via the free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240080/Spilled/" rel="nofollow ">Steam demo</a>, first revealed during the Wholesome Direct.</p><h3 dir="ltr">The Palace On The Hill</h3><p dir="ltr">The third of the four games shadow-dropping during the Wholesome Direct, The Palace on the Hill has you play as the son of a poor farmer in India during the '90s who wakes up on the first day of summer to discover his father is sick and he needs to spend his time off picking up odd jobs to help the family make ends meet rather than focus on his true passion: art. His childhood friend, a cool city girl, also comes to visit, presenting a possible romantic connection he can add to all the other tasks he has to juggle. The Palace on the Hill is available for Xbox, PC, and mobile devices.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Traveler's Rest</h3><p dir="ltr">A new trailer for Traveler's Rest, which is still in Steam Early Access, was revealed during the Wholesome Direct, showcasing more of what players can expect from the tavern-management game, such as learning the history of old tavern keepers and making friends with the townsfolk who live in the same city as you.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Petit Island</h3><p dir="ltr">Petit Island looks like it's going to be a bit of a tearjerker, as you play as Lily, the grandchild of a once adventurous cat whose memory is declining. Armed with his trusty notebook in hand, you set out on your own adventures across your quaint island home, hoping to relive your grandfather's memories and help him remember them as well. Petit Island is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Switch, and PC.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Albatroz</h3><p dir="ltr">The Wholesome Direct kept the potential tear-filled train rolling with a new trailer for Albatroz, a backpacking adventure RPG in which you play as Isla, who breaks away from her boring routine to search for her brother who mysteriously disappeared during his search for a mythical mountain. The game is described as a tale about "knowing when to let go and start over," which just sounds like a story that ends on an emotional note that will leave you a wreck. The game is set to launch later this year for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Magical Bakery</h3><p dir="ltr">Up next, a new trailer for Magical Bakery was revealed. The title kind of spells out this game's whole deal--you play as someone who's running a bakery, concocting sweets and tasty pastries with the help of magic. The game is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Switch, and PC.</p><h3 dir="ltr">While Waiting</h3><p dir="ltr">Previously revealed for PC, While Waiting is now set to launch for mobile devices, as well. The game explores the art of waiting, offering over 100 minigames that all deal with waiting for stuff, whether that's awkwardly standing around for the elevator to arrive or twiddling your fingers while your laundry finishes up. Intended as a game to be played while you're waiting for real-life tasks to finish up, it makes sense to see the game coming to mobile devices.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Sopa: Tale Of The Stolen Potato</h3><p dir="ltr">The Wholesome Direct then revealed a trailer for Sopa: Tale of the Stolen Potato, in which you play a young boy who routinely keeps being dragged into a fantastical world to locate the missing ingredients his grandmother needs to finish cooking. Each trip is filled with puzzles to solve and environmental obstacles to overcome and they conclude with your actions having a tangible effect on the real world in unexpected ways. Sopa: Tale of the Stolen Potato is scheduled to launch for Xbox, PC, and Game Pass later this year.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Tracks Of Thought</h3><p dir="ltr">The final shadow-drop of the Wholesome Direct was Tracks of Thought, a game in which you play as a lost ladybug trying to figure out why everyone on the train she's riding has forgotten something important, including her. To do that, you'll need to talk to the other passengers, engaging in conversations where you "fight" for consensus in card-based conversations that look an awful lot like the combative conversations of Signs of Sojourner, one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamespots-best-of-2020-editors-spotlight-awards/1100-6485695/">our favorite games of 2020</a>. Tracks of Thought is available for PC.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Ending montage</h3><p dir="ltr">The Wholesome Direct concluded with an ending montage that teased dozens of games and projects scheduled for the near future--they're all coming out this year or "soon" and can be wishlisted on Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2024/2024/06/08/the-stanley-parable-creators-next-game-is-about-a-cozy-tea-shop-we-think<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Wanderstop is the next game from the creators of The Stanley Parable and The Beginner's Guide, and in it, you are a character named Alta who is running a tea shop, though it seems in the past she was a soldier. The trailer starts with charming, cozy tea shop tasks like serving customers and collecting tea ingredients but ends with Alta on a bench working through a panic attack while convincing herself she is living her best life. Both The Stanley Parable and The Beginner's Guide are games that play with player perceptions and are some of the best uses of taking the interactive medium to tell stories that only video games can tell. Wanderstop looks like a cozy game, but it's safe to assume there is more to it than that.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TrAJzniyyZI" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game is being published by Annapurna Interactive and is planned for PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam.</p>

<p data-characters="214" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">During the Wholesome Direct stream today, Krillbite Studio announced that their cute take on food truck employment now has a release window. <em>Fruitbus</em> is currently planned for release on PC sometime in October 2024.</p> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false"><em>Fruitbus </em>grabbed my attention last year <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fruitbus-is-a-food-truck-sim-that-i-need-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when it was announced</a>. I really love the idea of a food truck simulation game, but the actual <em>Food Truck Simulator</em> was a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-food-truck-simulator-pc-simulation-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">catastrophic disappointment</a>. <em>Fruitbus </em>is very similar conceptually, as you drive around in a food truck, park it in a good spot, and then cook and serve food. The big difference is that <em>Fruitbus</em> has a much cuter take on the profession.</p> <figure data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Fruitbus Gameplay Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BSVK38Jllxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false">There was a demo released shortly after its announcement. I dove into it but found it mainly functioned as a proof of concept. The basic mechanics were there, but it needed a lot more work to tie it together. A lot more work has no doubt been done at this point, so I’m looking forward to trying it out again.</p> <p data-characters="554" data-current-count="865" data-injectable="true">Of note was the fact that the world was somewhat bland outside of towns. One of the mechanics has you journey into the wilderness to acquire new ingredients, and the lack of liveliness in the world made this more of a chore than it has to be. There were other areas that needed to be tightened, but I don’t remember them all. This was nearly a year ago and probably an early build. Since then, the demo has been updated a few times (most recently a completely new build in March), but I decided I’d probably wait until closer to release to try again.</p>
 <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="176" data-injectable="false">It’s still a few months off, but at least I know where I should be clearing my schedule. If you’re interested in taking <em>Fruitbus</em> for a spin, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484130/Fruitbus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there’s a demo</a> available now.</p> <p data-characters="53" data-current-count="229" data-injectable="false"><em>Fruitbus </em>will be available for PC this October, 2024.</p>

<p data-characters="182" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Life is scary, and times are tough. For that reason, not everyone wants to read a big, grimdark fantasy series. Sometimes, something a little happier is just what the doctor ordered.</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">Cozy fantasy has exploded over the past few years, giving fans a happier way to experience the genre they love. Sometimes the setting is just simple and happy. Sometimes it takes place in a high fantasy world, but far away from the darkness where a normal story would be told. However it frames it, cozy fantasy is making itself known all over.</p> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">Feel like reading something a bit brighter? Never heard of cozy fantasy and want to give it a try? For every type of fan, here are some great cozy fantasy options to keep you warm, even when the summer sun has fallen far below the horizon.</p>
 <h2 id="h-a-psalm-for-the-wild-built-by-becky-chambers" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/6Jpy08l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">A Psalm for the Wild-Built by Becky Chambers</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="614" data-current-count="914" data-injectable="true">What would happen if all robots were to become fed up with us? If all technology decided to up and walk away? 1000 years have passed since that event happened, and humanity has lived in low-tech, self-sustaining cities ever since. Our main character is a monk who grows tired of city life and decides to become a tea monk, traveling to the small farming communities around humanity’s outskirts, serving tea, and listening to people’s problems. One day, while traveling through the woods, the first robot anyone has seen in 1000 years comes to him with a simple question. What is it that humanity needs?</p>
 <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/6Jpy08l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The book</a> is a fun and meaningful exploration of what makes a good life, and what it is we need. Following this odd couple through the world is interesting and entertaining, with the problems and discussion mostly focused on the larger scale problems of what human society needs instead of danger and discord. The main character is endearing, the robot is a perfect naive outsider, and the book will just take you on a calm journey through the human psyche. </p>
 <h2 id="h-emily-wilde-s-encyclopedia-of-faeries-by-heather-fawcett" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/kxzpb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Emily Wilde’s Encyclopedia of Faeries by Heather Fawcett</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Penguin Random House</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="483" data-current-count="783" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/kxzpb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">A cozy book about faeries</a>, though not the sexy kind many fantasy books seem to be about right now. The book takes place on an alternate planet, Earth, where faeries are widely accepted as real, and Emily Wilde is the foremost academic expert when it comes to them. Traveling north to investigate a type of faerie called the Hidden Ones, she becomes more entrenched in the community of the town of Hrafnsvik and more interested in her academic rival Wendell Bambleby than she expects.</p>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">For those who like the dark faerie books that are all the rage but want to tone it down a bit to cozier levels, this book will do wonders. There is a solid romance subplot, and a good chunk of mystery, tied together with a lovable academic curmudgeon for a main character. While it might lack the sex and edge that authors like Sarah J. Mass have, this book more than makes up for it in whimsy and joy.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="706" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/R78UB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Legends &amp; Lattes</a></em> is by far one of the warmest, coziest books a person can choose. The story takes place at the end of an adventurer’s career when Viv, an Orc swordsman, decides to retire and open a coffee shop. Viv gathers a group of unlikely misfits to fill the roles in the coffee shop, each with their own talent that lets them blossom in the community-driven space of Viv’s coffee shop.</p>
 <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">There is some conflict and reckoning, as any book needs, but the focus is still on the characters, their smaller issues, and their relationships that develop along the way. The book has a bit of everything, some romance, some comedy, some fantasy worldbuilding, all built into a very modern, understood setting. For someone who truly wants some warm, simple fun, Legends &amp; Lattes is the perfect drink on a cool summer evening.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-house-in-the-cerulean-sea-by-tj-klune" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/BycgjN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="726" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/BycgjN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The House in the Cerulean Sea</a></em> is possibly the most popular title on this list, exploding in popularity a few summers ago. Take the X-men, then give them powers that aren’t useful in the slightest. This book takes place in an orphanage for these children, where our protagonist, Linus, has to decide if these children pose a threat to the world at large. Bonds are made, secrets are revealed, and a family starts to form.</p>
 <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true">This book drives people between happy crying and sad crying with alarming frequency, focusing on a group of children who just want to find their place in a world that doesn’t seem to want them. There’s so much charm to this cast of characters, making it nearly impossible not to be invested in their lives. If you want an emotionally intelligent book that looks at the families we make and how we find ourselves, this book will keep you hooked from page one.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-cat-who-saved-books-by-s-osuke-natsukawa" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/fTfYtZn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Cat Who Saved Books by S<strong>osuke Natsukawa</strong></a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Harper Collins</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="562" data-current-count="862" data-injectable="true">Do you love books? Do you love cats? Do you love magical cats that want to bring you to save the books they love? <a href="https://geni.us/fTfYtZn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Cat Who Saved Books</a> is a magical journey through the importance of books and the many layers of meaning they can hold for us. Our protagonist, Rintaro, has inherited his grandfather’s secondhand bookstore. While it had once been his happy place, it has been nothing of the sort since his grandfather’s passing. Still, amid his sadness, a magical cat named Tiger calls on him to save books that should otherwise be enjoyed and loved.</p>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">The journey Rintaro goes on is enjoyable, often mirroring popular trials and tasks from books, movies, and other media. Through these journeys Rintaro learns of the importance of books, the memories they hold, and a little about himself. With a good amount of romance, introspection, and quick-witted comedy, the Cat Who Saved Books is a thoroughly enjoyable read.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-strongest-quirks-in-my-hero-academia.894615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/10-strongest-quirks-in-my-hero-academia/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10-strongest-quirks-in-my-hero-academia<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="358" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Becoming strong in <em>My Hero Academia </em>is more than just being blessed with a powerful Quirk. Having mastery over said Quirk is far more important, and Mirio Togata is a prime example of that. After all, the dude started as a wimp whose Quirk is more of a liability than a curse. But through sheer grit and effort, he ultimately became U.A.’s top student.</p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false">While all that talk is inspiring and cheesy, it also doesn’t change the fact that a powerful Quirk is, well, <em>powerful</em>. Mastery is indeed important as most Quirks have drawbacks, but a mediocre Quirk can only bring you to a certain height. And in my opinion, here are the ten strongest Quirks.</p> <figure data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-10-erasure" data-injectable="false">10. Erasure</h2> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">The world of <em>My Hero Academia </em>is run by people with overpowered abilities. It even reaches the point wherein a Quirk can determine a person’s social status, with the Quirkless at the bottom of the pyramid. But no matter how powerful a Quirk is, Erasure can counter it.</p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true">Erasure cancels other people’s Quirk factors as long as the user lays their eyes on the target. It doesn’t even have to be the entire person. It can simply be a body part. However, Erasure has one major drawback. Its effect instantly disappears the moment the target gets out of the user’s field of view or the user blinks.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via TOHO animation YouTube</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-9-black-hole" data-injectable="false">9. Black Hole</h2> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true">Utilized by the hero Anan Kurose, Black Hole lets its user generate black holes through their fingers. The suction force is strong enough to disintegrate anything at the atomic level, including light. However, using Black Hole requires a lot of caution.</p>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">Black Hole may be extremely powerful, but it is also volatile and dangerous. It sucks anything and everything, including the user and their allies. While it can be deactivated at a moment’s notice, doing so leaves the user vulnerable to counterattacks.</p> <figure data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via TOHO animation YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-8-double" data-injectable="false">8. Double</h2> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">Double grants its user the ability to create replicas. The catch, however, is that the user must possess an impeccable understanding of the target, down to their physical features and measurements. Otherwise, the resulting double will be weak and fragile.</p> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true">The created copies are not invulnerable. They will turn to sludge after receiving sufficient damage. The user can also only create two doubles at a time, but there is a catch. Since Double copies both the target’s appearance and abilities, the created doubles also possess Double. Should the generated clones spam Double, the user can theoretically create a never-ending army of themselves.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-7-half-cold-half-hot" data-injectable="false">7. Half-Cold Half-Hot</h2> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true">Endeavor’s Hellflame allows him to fight even the mightiest of villains, and Shoto’s Half-Cold Half-Hot Quirk is something like that but better. Half-Cold Half-Hot gives Shoto the ability to generate both fire and frost. While it doesn’t let him control external fire and frost, what he can generate is more than sufficient to defeat villains.</p>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">Half-Cold Half-Hot also eliminates the Hellflame’s drawback — overheating. By using his cold half, Shoto can regulate his temperature to avoid reaching dangerous temperatures. Similarly, he can heat himself to prevent hypothermia.</p> <figure data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via TOHO animation YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-6-rewind" data-injectable="false">6. Rewind</h2> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">As its name suggests, Rewinds is a Quirk that turns back time. However, it only works on living beings. Those affected by Rewind will find their bodies being reverted to their previous states, including the point before they came into being.</p> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true">The only reason Rewind’s full potential isn’t shown in the anime is Eri’s inexperience. Eri is still too young to grasp and control the full capacity of her Quirk. And since Rewind only works on living beings, practicing it requires a lot of caution. But should Eri master Rewind to its fullest, she can easily become the strongest healer and fighter in <em>My Hero Academia</em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via TOHO animation YouTube</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-5-overhaul" data-injectable="false">5. Overhaul</h2> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="725" data-injectable="true">Overhaul is, without a doubt, one of the most destructive Quirk in the entire series. Using Overhaul lets the user destroy and restructure their targets, and it applies to both organic and inorganic matter. The user can also opt not to restructure the target, leaving them obliterated. Should the user choose to do some reconstruction, they can revert the target to its original form or turn it into something new altogether.</p>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Overhaul’s only weakness is its activation requirement. The user needs to be in contact with the target through their hand. It can be just the tip of a finger, but it has to be the hand. The moment the user’s hands are incapacitated, Overhaul is no longer a threat.</p> <figure data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-4-decay" data-injectable="false">4. Decay</h2> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">Decay is quite similar to Overhaul. It can obliterate anything with the slightest touch. But unlike Overhaul, Decay does not give the option to reconstruct. What’s already turned into dust remains as such. </p> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">After its evolution, it far surpassed Overhaul in destructiveness. Decay’s effects spread beyond what the user touched, creating a wave of destruction. Similar to Overhaul, however, Decay’s activation relies on the user’s fingers. Incapacitating them also incapacitates the user.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Shueisha</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-3-new-order" data-injectable="false">3. New Order</h2> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true">Cathleen Bate’s New Order created a buzz with her superb use of it. The Quirk allows Cathleen to manipulate her environment by setting new rules on them, even to a miraculous degree. For instance, she turned light tangible and altered the very nature of her Quirk.</p>
 <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">However, New Order has a lot of limitations. The power it grants has limits, and the user can only set two rules at once. Most of all, the user must have the same understanding as the target in terms of the target’s identity. Otherwise, the Quirk won’t activate.</p> <figure data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-2-one-for-all" data-injectable="false">2. One For All</h2> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="196" data-injectable="false">One For All has been heralded as the heroes’ strongest weapon against the series’ main villain, All For One. And for good reason. It was, after all, the Quirk the No. 1 Hero possessed.</p> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">One For All is a transferrable Quirk, allowing the old user to transfer their Quirk — in addition to One For All — to the new one. Even without the extra Quirks, One For All’s physical boosts still make it a top-tier Quirk. As shown by All Might at his peak, utilizing One For All’s full power can easily decimate its surroundings.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-all-for-one" data-injectable="false">1. All For One</h2> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true">All For One is undeniably the vilest and strongest villain in <em>My Hero Academia</em>, and it’s all because of his Quirk. All For One lets its user steal and bestow Quirks. He can store the Quirks inside him and use them as he sees fit.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">The only probable weakness of All For One is the possibility of overloading the user. Should the point wherein the stolen Quirks surpass what the user’s body can handle, then the Quirks will start to affect the user’s body. But given <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-known-all-for-one-quirks-in-my-hero-academia/">the long list of All For One’s stolen Quirks</a> without any negative effect, this can’t even be considered a weakness.</p>

<p>Consisting of Orpheus Ascending, Isle of the Blessed, and Into the Abyss, the DLC will "reunite you with beloved characters through a series of thought-provoking new stories".</p>
<p>Orpheus Ascending sees you explore the philosophy of love, death, and resurrection through the story of Hypatia and Sarabhai and "gorgeous environments" inspired by Ancient Egypt, while Isle of the Blessed takes you to a Caribbean Island where you'll get to "hang out with Yaqut and Miranda as they join Cornelius and Athena on a puzzle-driven adventure".</p>
<p>Finally, Into the Abyss takes you back to one of the most dramatic moments in the base game, and you'll get to see what really happened when someone was trapped in the Megastructure...</p>
<p>"Following the events of The Talos Principle 2, Road to Elysium continues the evolution of the robot world, providing you with a new perspective on some of the key moments from 1K's journey, and challenging you with puzzles built around both new and pre-existing mechanics," the team explains.</p>
<p>The Talos Principle 2 Road to Elysium will release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 14th June, 2024.</p>
<p>"It took me a while to decide how I felt about The Talos Principle 2," contributor Ruth Cassidy wrote in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-talos-principle-2-review-a-thought-experiment-to-puzzle-over">The Talos Principle 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>"None of its parts are beautifully integrated - the story, the philosophy and the puzzling all playing tug-of-war at various times, and sometimes disruptively so - but my feeling in the end is that I just keep thinking about it. If it's a thought experiment, I'm still puzzling over it, while I'm pondering its puzzles too. Maybe I'm not sold on robots as the sequel to people - I'd rather we stuck around - but The Talos Principle 2 is a worthy sequel to its own predecessor."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deadpool%E2%80%99s-5-best-video-game-appearances.894585/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/deadpools-5-best-video-game-appearances/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=deadpools-5-best-video-game-appearances<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="370" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Way back in 1990, Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza created a brand new character for the ever-expanding Marvel Comics universe. The mercenary named Wade Wilson, better known by the alias Deadpool made his introduction in the pages of <em>The New Mutants</em> #98. Little did anyone realize then how much of a global phenomenon this character would become in only a few short years.</p> <p data-characters="515" data-current-count="515" data-injectable="true">Plenty of quips, fourth wall breaks, and astounding comic book moments later, Deadpool has become one of the most popular Marvel creations of all time. His crude humor and willingness to poke fun at just about anything has endeared him to generations of comic readers, in addition to those who don’t read so often. Merchandise, cartoons, and movies, such as the highly anticipated <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, set to release on July 26, have very much extended Wade’s reach across the pop culture spectrum.</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Naturally, this has also meant that the Merc with a Mouth has popped up in more than a few video games over the years. While he’s a highlight of the titles he’s in more often than not, some of his appearances are simply a cut above the rest. </p>  <figure data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-5-spider-man-shattered-dimensions-2010" data-injectable="false">5. Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions (2010)</h2> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">Despite traditionally being more of an X-Men character, as the mischievous mercenary that he is, Deadpool has encountered other heroes in the Marvel Universe within the gaming sphere. For instance, he appears in the 2010 action-adventure game <em>Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions</em>, voiced by Nolan North. While not an evil mustache-twirling villain, he does serve as something of an antagonistic force in the story.</p>
 <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">The Deadpool featured here is based on his old Ultimate Comics incarnation and is the host of a <em>Fear Factor</em> spoof called <em>Pain Factor</em>. As such, he forces Spider-Man (specifically the Ultimate Spider-Man iteration) to go through a series of daring challenges in exchange for a piece of the Tablet of Order and Chaos. Spidey does so successfully, but Wade is a bit of a sore loser, so a boss fight ensues. When the dust settles, the webhead wins and gets his fragment.</p>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">All in all, Deadpool’s involvement in<em> Shattered Dimensions</em> isn’t too heavy, but his portion of the game is fun. As one would expect from the character, there are plenty of jokes and gags to keep the sequence entertaining, yet he’s no slouch when you have to fight him. This is an excellent use of the beloved Marvel Comics creation that plays all the hits and doesn’t overstay its welcome.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via 2K</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-4-marvel-s-midnight-suns-2022" data-injectable="false">4. Marvel’s Midnight Suns (2022)</h2> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true">Compared to other Marvel games, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-marvels-midnight-suns/">Marvel’s Midnight Suns</a></em> more or less flew under the radar for a lot of gamers. The tactical role-playing game features characters like Wolverine, Ghost Rider, Blade, and Captain America. It didn’t receive a lot of fanfare upon release, though it did garner relatively positive reviews from those who played it. Despite this lack of press, it wound up receiving downloadable content, including a pack dedicated to none other than Deadpool.</p>
 <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">Deadpool, again voiced by North, was added to the game in January 2023 via the <em>Good, The Bad, and The Undead </em>DLC alongside three new missions. He previously took over the <em>Midnight Sun</em>s X, or Twitter, page to advertise his imminent arrival. Wade comes with a handful of outfits, including his now iconic gray and black X-Force suit, a room in the Abbey full of posters from the <em>Marvel Swimsuit Special</em>s of the 1990s, and, naturally, one-liners to spare.</p>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">On a roster already chock full of Marvel greats, Deadpool is a welcome addition to <em>Midnight Suns</em>. Many of its characters are fairly no-nonsense, so he’s a breath of fresh air in this environment. While no one really likes paying for DLC, if you’re a fan of the character and <em>Midnight Suns</em>, you’ll likely find he’s worth the dough.</p>  <figure data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-3-marvel-ultimate-alliance-2-2009" data-injectable="false">3. Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 (2009)</h2> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">The original<em> Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</em> is a very enjoyable dungeon crawler featuring pretty much every Marvel hero you would want to see. That game does feature Deadpool as a playable character, but unfortunately, he doesn’t play an active role in the story. Seemingly aware of the character’s continually increasing popularity, the second <em>Ultimate Alliance</em> game from 2009 puts him firmly in the spotlight for a bit.</p>
 <p data-characters="604" data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true">Deadpool pops up early in the <em>Ultimate Alliance</em> <em>2 </em>campaign when you and your crew of chosen heroes arrive in Washington, DC. You’re all tasked with stopping a terrorist threat in the United States capital, but Wade doesn’t want to hear it. All he knows is that he wanted to see the cherry blossoms in bloom and the chaos of the situation is ruining his vacation. Fisticuffs ensue, and once the fight is over, Deadpool is unlocked as a playable character. This also opens the opportunity for fun dialogue options throughout the game between him and everyone from Wolverine to Stan Lee himself.</p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Deadpool is an absolute treat in<em> Ultimate Alliance 2</em>. His boss fight and the circumstances surrounding it are fun and appropriate for the character, he’s fun to play as once unlocked, and, graphically speaking, his character model looks excellent for the hardware. Of course, his alternate maskless costume is a tad nightmare-inducing.</p>  <figure data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-2-lego-marvel-super-heroes-2013" data-injectable="false">2. LEGO Marvel Super Heroes (2013)</h2> <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">Much like the <em>Ultimate Alliance</em> games, the main draw of 2013’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-lego-marvel-super-heroes/">LEGO Marvel Super Heroes</a></em> is its expansive roster. From good guys like Iron Man and Hulk to bad guys such as Doctor Doom and Loki, the minds behind the game packed in an immense number of Marvel icons. Unsurprisingly among these is Deadpool, and while he doesn’t involve himself too much in the main campaign, he does have a neat overarching role in the game.</p>
 <p data-characters="577" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true">Aside from the story missions, <em>LEGO Marvel Super Heroes</em> features a handful of bonus ones centering on specific heroes and villains. The introductory cinematics are all hosted and narrated by Deadpool, who sets the stage for the mission you’re about to embark on. Additionally, the red power bricks that had become a staple of <em>LEGO </em>games up to that point used for unlocking extras have been renamed Deadpool red bricks. To purchase the extras they unlock, one has to go to Deadpool’s room on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. Collecting them all makes Deadpool playable.</p>
 <p data-characters="523" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">Seeing as <em>LEGO Marvel Super Heroes</em> is aimed at children, this version of Deadpool is a bit different than most others. He’s far less crude, and his penchant for violence is very much dialed back to make him fit the LEGO style. While this may seem like a negative, in reality, this is an incredibly fun take on the character. His remaining characteristics, especially his fourth wall breaks, fit the <em>LEGO Marvel Super Heroes</em> universe so well, and those behind the game couldn’t have picked a better spot for him.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-deadpool-2013" data-injectable="false">1. Deadpool (2013)</h2> <p data-characters="486" data-current-count="786" data-injectable="true">After just under a decade in the Marvel Comics spotlight, Deadpool made the leap to the movies. 2009’s <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em> brought the character to the big screen for the first time, portrayed by Ryan Reynolds, infamously botching him in every way possible. Thankfully, a mere four years later, fans were given a much more faithful adaptation of the Merc with a Mouth, but not at the cinema. Deadpool took the gaming world by storm in his own game, the aptly-titled <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-deadpool/">Deadpool</a></em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">Deadpool sees Wade team up with the X-Men and various other characters in a fight against the mad mutant geneticist, Mister Sinister. Like a typical <em>Deadpool </em>comic, the story is full of twists and turns, goofy humor, and plenty of moments in need of a double-take. The action is also copious, with Wade making full use of his arsenal of weapons to dispose of his enemies.</p> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="747" data-injectable="false">Speaking strictly to the game’s depiction of the title character, <em>Deadpool </em>is a home run. Per usual, North is excellent in the role, infusing the written material with so much energy and prime comedic timing. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gamescom-deadpool-will-make-fun-of-you-if-you-suck/">He’ll even make fun of you if you suck</a>. Deadpool is funny, capable in a fight, and as animated as he should be, amounting to a solid take on the character.</p>

<p data-characters="290" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Fortnite</em>‘s <em>Chapter 5 Season 3: Wrecked </em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-season-3-wrecked-slams-the-brakes-on-the-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was off to a rough start</a> as many players felt alienated by the bigger focus on vehicular combat. Things got even worse when some players began wondering if premium cars offered more advantages than free ones, and someone proved the doubts right.</p> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="195" data-injectable="false">Credit for the discovery goes to Tiktoker Nickeh30, who easily proves in the video below that some of the cars you can only get by spending V-bucks offer much greater protection to their drivers:</p> <figure data-current-count="495" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">Even though this doesn’t apply to every single one of the premium cars at your disposal, it’s still a problem because Epic states that paid cosmetic skins that offer actual gameplay advantages go <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/faq#:~:text=Are%20Fortnite%20experiences,any%20Fortnite%20experience">directly against the company’s policy.</a> The company quickly addressed the situation by admitting that the issue exists and stating that it’s working on fixes that will begin rolling out with the upcoming updates.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’re aware of an issue where some Vehicle bodies, like the Whiplash, have larger exposed sightlines to the driver while in the passenger position.</p><p>We are adjusting the driver position backwards in some Vehicles to prevent any potential gameplay advantage over our next game… <a href="https://t.co/GTVeg2nKzP">pic.twitter.com/GTVeg2nKzP</a></p></div>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1798369473021313238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">Interestingly, The unfair advantages present in premium cars don’t come from better stats resulting from secret codes that the company put there just to benefit the rich. They come from these cars’ more extravagant design that features smaller windshields and leave the drivers way more protected. It seems like this was but one of the many untold side benefits of being rich. </p>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">You’d think that a car design inspired by Lamborghini wouldn’t be the best choice for a road trip on the Wasteland, but these things have proven time and time again that they’re somehow capable of adapting to any situation.</p> <figure data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Lamborghini passes from under the toll" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0wdo1IRsTHg?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>

<p data-characters="284" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s been over 10 years since Bit Kid successfully crowdfunded <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-chasm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Chasm</em></a> and nearly six since it fully launched. Now the developer is ready to return to the Metroidvania genre, this time ditching procedural generation in favor of the gnarly, intricately-designed world of <em>WOLFHOUND</em>.</p> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">There’s no release date in place yet, but <em>WOLFHOUND </em>is <a href="https://bitkidgames.com/?p=3967#more-3967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the works</a> for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC (Steam). You can see what Bit Kid is going for with this one in the announcement trailer below.</p> <figure data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="WOLFHOUND Announcement Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iWprFF0A-io?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">Set in 1944, <em>WOLFHOUND </em>sees the appropriately grizzled Capt. Chuck “WOLFHOUND” Rossetti attempting to infiltrate a Nazi base hidden in the Bermuda Triangle. Naturally, that means he’ll run into a number of monstrous creatures during his mission as he scavenges for weapons and ammo and ventures deeper into the heart of a greater mystery.</p> <h2 id="h-back-to-basics" data-injectable="false"><strong>Back to basics</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bit Kid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">The visuals immediately stand out, and not just because of some great character animation. Check out that tile arrangement, which manages to look mismatched and hectic in a way that works and feels authentic. That authenticity is one of the key aspects driving the aesthetic. Bit Kid founder and lead developer James Petruzzi said he wanted to “dive deep into the style of NES and 8-bit gaming” with this one. While this isn’t exactly something you could ever get running on an original console, <em>WOLFHOUND </em>adheres to an 8-bit color palette and 320×180 pixel resolution.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="467" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="false">Some of the artistic talent reeling in all those pixel art explosions and viscera have previously worked on games like <em>Freedom Planet 2</em>, <em>Sparklite</em>, and the <em>Shantae </em>series. In a similarly legitimate vein, the soundtrack was composed in Famitracker, featuring the chiptune earworms of RushJet1 (<em>Alwa’s Legacy</em>, <em>Cave Story+</em>). It all swirls together for a run-and-gun concoction I very much want to play right now, so hopefully, we won’t be waiting too long.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Cult of the Lamb's next free update, Unholy Alliance, introduces a brand new character and couch co-op.</p>
<p>While you won't be able to join friends online, you will be able to buddy up via couch co-op as you "crusade through dungeons, slay heretics, build your cult, and seek new powers together" on 12th August, 2024. One of you can play as Lamb, and the other as Goat.</p>
<p>You can see it in action below:</p>

<p>"Unholy Alliance is the latest free update for smash hit Cult of the Lamb, introducing a new playable character: the Goat!" Massive Monster explains.</p>
<p>"Experience the entire Cult of the Lamb campaign in local co-op, with one player inhabiting the role of the Lamb and the other taking on the mantle of the Goat. Enjoy new two-player twists on existing mini-games like fishing and knucklebones, and choose from a selection of corrupted weapons, tarot cards, curses, and relics as you embark on co-op crusades."</p>
<p>As well as take on the heretics together, Lamb and Goat will be able to swap weapons, deal extra damage when fighting back-to-back, or even critical damage if their attacks "are in sync".</p>
<p>The Lamb and the Goat can swap weapons, deal extra damage when fighting back-to-back, or deal a critical hit if their attacks are in sync.</p>
<p>Unholy Alliance expansion also introduces new tarot cards, relics, buildings, fleeces, follower traits, follower quests, and secrets, as well as new powers and abilities for solo players who don't have a co-op buddy handy.</p>
<p>Unholy Alliance will launch for free on PC, PS5, PS4, Switch, and Xbox Series S/X on 12th August, 2024.</p>
<p>The update follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cult-of-the-lambs-sins-of-the-flesh-sex-update-arrives-next-week">Sins of the Flesh, a free update</a> that rolled out to all platforms in January. It included new progression systems, adding more complexity to the gameplay, plus "shiny poop, baneful brooms, and bigger, better buildings".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cult-of-the-lamb-review-a-genre-mash-up-with-a-lot-of-ideas">Eurogamer's original Cult of the Lamb review</a>, our Donlan called it a "charmer with a hundred moving parts".</p>
<p>"Being a cult leader in this funny old game, then, is a little bit like being a game designer, I imagine. It's complex on certain levels, and to use the lovely vivid cliche, you're herding cats quite a lot," he wrote. "But really you're trying to arrange happiness for people. The only difference is that as a cult leader, if they don't become happy on cue, you can cook them and eat them."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-ending-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=senuas-saga-hellblade-2-ending-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="65" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><strong><em>[This post contains spoilers for Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2]</em></strong></p> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 continues Senua’s journey after the troubled and traumatic experiences of Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice. While the original Hellblade heavily implied that most of the events in the game were all happening in Senua’s mind, the sequel is even more complicated. </p> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true">Hellblade 2 is a visual work of artistic storytelling before it is a video game. With lines between what’s real and what’s happening in Senua’s mind so blurry, there is a lot to interpret and make sense of in Hellblade 2.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ninja Theory</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="793" data-injectable="true">While the whole game is full of twists and turns, it doubles down on the intrigue during its ending. Senua comes face to face against Godi, Thorgestr’s father, at the end of the game. Up until this point, the game had led us to believe the Giants were real and that Senua had been leading the charge to take the Giants down for them. However, it is revealed during the fight with Godi that the Giants were never real. Godi constructed them to create fear among the people and gain power.</p>
 <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">Once Senua discovers that Godi lied to the people, she attacks him and very nearly takes the life of the Tyrant. At this point, Senua comes to a crossroads where she must choose between taking Godi’s life or sparing him. While her initial rage after all that he put her and those around her through pushed her to end his life, she slowly begins to question the decision.</p> <figure data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ninja Theory</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">Throughout the game, Senua has been troubled by her past, particularly her abusive father. Senua begins to rationalize the decision to kill Godi, fearing that she will become just like her father and go down a darker path. At the same time, Senua starts realizing that there is another choice, where she can spare Godi’s life, finally moving on from the trauma of her past and the influence her father still has over her thoughts and actions.</p>
 <p data-characters="517" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">During this internal battle, Senua also hears Thorgestr telling her that “we are not our fathers,” highlighting how he also chose to be better before his life ended. While it may seem like Senua choose the latter option and spares Godi’s life, Ninja Theory never shows the decision she makes. By leaving the story up for interpretation, the game leaves it to the player to decide what Senua did. In turn, it allows the player to decide how they perceive Senua’s struggles and what she would ultimately decide.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ninja Theory</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="false">Several themes run through the final moments of the game, with love, friendship, trauma, acceptance, and hope all highlighted through Senua and her Furies’ internal dialogues. Whether Senua makes the Tyrant pay for his crimes with his life or spares him is ultimately up to whatever the player accepts as Senua’s choice. The ambiguity of a definitive ending is another way Ninja Theory wanted to convey the message that there is always a choice.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/is-43311-better-than-44111-for-echoes-in-wuthering-waves/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-43311-better-than-44111-for-echoes-in-wuthering-waves<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="256" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are many ways to equip your characters with Echoes in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, but there are only two viable ones you should consider using: ‘4,3,3,1,1’ or ‘4,4,1,1,1’. The question comes then: which of these Echo loadouts is better?</p> <h2 id="h-which-configuration-is-better-for-echoes-in-wuthering-waves-4-3-3-1-1-or-4-4-1-1-1" data-injectable="false">Which configuration is better for Echoes in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>: ‘4,3,3,1,1’ or ‘4,4,1,1,1’?</h2> <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">Regarding total stat gains, <strong>‘4,3,3,1,1’ </strong>is completely superior to <strong>‘4,4,1,1,1’</strong> thanks to the inclusion of more high-ranked Echoes. Echoes with higher loadout costs come with a main stat that provides more overall of the main stat. Despite this, both setups are actually viable for current content in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, but there are times when you might consider using <strong>‘4,4,1,1,1’ </strong>over the superior one. There is nuance to this subject, and the best way to explain them is to break down each configuration for your reference.</p>
 <h3 id="h-echo-configuration-4-3-3-1-1-breakdown" data-injectable="false">Echo Configuration ‘4,3,3,1,1’ Breakdown</h3> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Since this setup yields higher total stats, <strong>your characters will always deal more damage with it</strong>. Specifically, the two ‘3’ Echoes should either be ATK% or Element DMG%, and both, when leveled to max rank, should give you 30% of whichever stat is on them. This is a big deal for damage and is the main reason why this config is superior. </p> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="872" data-injectable="true">However, this config is not without its faults. Despite the superior stat spread, the two ‘3’ Echoes that are a part of this setup are incredibly difficult to obtain on a set bonus. You see, ‘3’ Echoes are the only ones that can come with an Element main stat, but there is an Element main stat for every Element in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. Every time you slay and capture an Elite enemy, you have <strong>a low chance of obtaining the Element you need for your character</strong> thanks to all of the differing variables. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="628" data-current-count="928" data-injectable="true">Even if you do get the correct element, chances are, it’s on the wrong Echo set for said character. It is possible to get Spectro DMG on a ‘3’ Echo that has the Havoc set attached to it, which is very much useless. To make matters even worse, Elites are finite in the overworld, meaning you <strong>can </strong>farm and kill all of them on the entire map. If this happens, you must wait for the daily reset for them to respawn so you can continue farming them. All of these randomized variables make getting proper ‘3’ Echoes a rare occurrence, thus the difficulty in achieving this setup, despite its superiority.</p>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">Beyond this rarity limitation, <strong>‘4,3,3,1,1’ </strong>has no other inherent negatives. It offers you a wider range of stat options to choose from and gives you more raw stats in general. For those looking the make their characters as powerful as possible, use this configuration.</p> <h3 id="h-echo-configuration-4-4-1-1-1-breakdown" data-injectable="false">Echo Configuration ‘4,4,1,1,1’ Breakdown</h3> <p data-characters="680" data-current-count="960" data-injectable="true">Due to the nature of ‘3’ Echoes, you may want to opt into using this configuration instead because of how easy is to get running at a viable level. You see, ‘1’ and ‘4’ Echoes are very easy to obtain with the correct stats you need. Although ‘1’ Echoes are finite, there are significantly more basic enemies on the map to farm, making it unlikely for you to run out before the daily reset. ‘4’ Echoes can be farmed infinitely because they come from the respawning bosses on the map. There is no limit to how many times you can farm these, so getting the correct main stat from them is a matter of your farming diligence.</p>
 <p data-characters="617" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">This ease of build comes at the cost of a weaker character overall. The lack of ‘3’ Echoes means you have <strong>no Element DMG bonuses </strong>and <strong>fewer ATK% bonuses</strong>, resulting in a sizable loss of damage. However, because two ‘4’ Echoes are used in this setup, it is significantly easier to obtain both <strong>CRIT RATE </strong>and <strong>CRIT DMG</strong>. This is due to your ability to farm for these main stats as much as you want. Characters running this setup probably won’t have issues obtaining acceptable levels of CRIT value stats, resulting in them becoming mid-to-late game viable much earlier than the superior setup. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true">Another not-so-obvious caveat of this configuration is the <strong>resource drain</strong> using will have on you. In <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, you are constantly stretched thin for resources and must make continuous decisions of whether or not to invest in specific characters or weapons. Waveplates timegate the amount of resources you can obtain, making these decisions crucial to how effectively your account progresses. </p>
 <p data-characters="592" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="true">Before using this configuration, ask yourself: <strong>is it worth wasting resources to build a stat inferior Echo setup? </strong>In my opinion, as someone who likes to min-max my character builds, I find my resources valuable, and if I’m just going to transition from this setup in the future, then I’d rather wait to get the correct pieces before investing in a character. If you’re not a min-max number cruncher like me, though, <strong>this setup is perfectly viable to use</strong>. For those who simply want to get their characters up and running effectively, <strong>‘4,4,1,1,1’</strong> will accommodate.</p>
