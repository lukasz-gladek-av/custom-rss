            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24267805/neva-nomada-studio-interview-gris-devolver<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After the launch of <em>Gris</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137844/gris-review-nintendo-switch-pc-gaming">a beautiful game exploring grief</a>, the team at Nomada Studio in Barcelona needed a long break. They spent around half a year not even thinking about what was next, avoiding words like “Unity” or “sequel.” Eventually, director Conrad Roset, who became a parent during that time, came up with the idea of a similar experience that would introduce a new companion, allowing players to connect with and care for another character.</p><p>“I told him, no problem, as long as it’s not a four-legged animal, you can do whatever you want,” says lead producer Roger Mendoza, noting that animating critters with lots of legs can be “quite painful.” But the director was able to make the case for a game called <em>Neva</em> about a young woman who goes on an emotional journey with a magical fox creature. “I think it was worth it,” Mendoza admits.</p><p><em>Neva</em> launches on October 15th (it’s coming to PC, Switch, Xbox, and PS5), and like <em>Gris</em>, it’s a stunningly animated 2D adventure. Players take on the role of a young woman caring for a young fox pup named Neva, trying to usher it to safety in a world filled with dark forces that look ripped out of <em>Spirited Away</em>. It only takes around five hours to finish, but the game spans a long period of time; each chapter is a different season, and you see the fox grow over time. At first, it’s a relatively helpless pup, but by the end, it becomes your protector.</p><p><em>Neva</em> and <em>Gris</em> share a lot in common: the short length, approachable gameplay, incredible art and animation, and narrative that’s told almost entirely without words. (<em>Neva</em> does have some voice acting, but it’s multiple variations of the heroine calling out Neva’s name. “I think we recorded 500 different ways of saying Neva,” jokes Mendoza.) But the new game also introduces two major features: not only a second character but also combat.</p><div><p>“When she’s not with you, you really feel it.”</p></div><p>According to Mendoza, the latter was inspired by the former. “[The addition of Neva] was in a way where the combat came from — we thought it would be a good mechanic to bring together the fact that there’s a companion now,” he explains. Early on, you have to fight to protect the fox, but as she grows up and changes, so, too, does that dynamic. “Now she’s the one who is taking care of you,” Mendoza says. “When she’s not with you, you really feel it. Combat felt like a good way to tie everything together.”</p><p>This presented a number of design challenges, most notably in terms of accessibility. One of <em>Gris</em>’ biggest strengths was how easy it was to pick up and play; it even worked well on a smartphone touchscreen. But the added layer of complexity that comes from combat and a companion meant that <em>Neva</em> “isn’t as approachable as <em>Gris</em>,” according to Mendoza. “That’s something that we knew early on; the moment you add more controls, it becomes more difficult.” To account for this, the developers designed the game from the beginning with a story mode, where you can’t die in battle. “That was a way to try to find the right balance,” he says.</p><p>The success of <em>Gris</em> — the game <a href="https://x.com/nomadastudiobcn/status/1838963894712221984">sold more than 3 million copies to date</a> — gave the studio the confidence to both push in these more ambitious directions but also continue to pursue its strengths. One of the major learnings from that game, according to Mendoza, was that “you can do a strong narrative without the need for words. It’s something that we had no idea if it would work on <em>Gris</em>.” <em>Neva</em> takes things a step further, with a more direct storyline that covers a number of topics simultaneously — not only the evolving nature of a parental relationship but also overt themes about environmental destruction. Again, this story is conveyed almost entirely through art, sound, and animation.</p><p>The other major learning from <em>Gris</em> was more practical. One of the main reasons that game’s development was so stressful and required such a long post-launch vacation was that the team was relatively small. In fact, only two programmers worked on <em>Gris</em> at all, forcing lots of late nights and long hours. Now that many members of Nomada are a little older, with families of their own, work-life balance is a much bigger priority. And so one of the most important changes between <em>Gris</em> and <em>Neva</em> was a seemingly simple one: “we hired more programmers.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sektori promises to "transport you into another state of consciousness", but what the pulsing soundtrack initially did was transport me to Youtube so I could look up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfSndZPynQk">this scene from Spaced</a>, where Michael Smiley raves out to a boiling kettle. By elegant coincidence, that video is about the length of my longest run so far in Sektori's demo - a very busy 60 seconds or so.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>How exactly does Sektori propose to transport you to another state of consciousness? Via the holy medium of techno. And also, via the holy medium of being swamped by fleets of angry Xmas decorations. Yes, it's a twin stick shooter - a lost cousin of Bizarre's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-geometry-wars-retro-evolved">Geometry Wars series</a> in its specific combination of astral pretties, score-attack arenas and withering odds. I quite like it. Frankly, the only reason I disengaged is that when you perish, the demo takes you to a "wishlist now!" menu with a really annoying three second countdown before you can respawn. Three seconds? Why, I could die at least six times in that time. I have already wishlisted, Sektori - now please, let me get my uninterrupted fill of being murdered by triangles.</p>

<p>The full game will have a variety of modes, including a traditional arcade campaign for the purists, and a choice of ships and modifiers.  The demo gives one mode to butt heads with - Surge. This lumbers you with a peashooter and an occasionally life-saving, generally life-endangering rushdown attack that blows up anything in your path. As you harvest the stardust of slain geometry, you'll activate collectible power-ups that, once you've frantically found your way to them, briefly transform you into an absolute geyser of bullets and missiles, causing you to immediately lose track of yourself and fly into a wall. Look, I only played the demo for 10 minutes. I'm sure I'll improve. The only way is up.</p>
<p>Adding insult to injury, sometimes the arenas shapeshift. Swathes of triangular grid flicker red and fold inward, boxing you in as you strive to thread the throng and reach the power-up across the way.</p>
<p>"With Sektori I wanted to create a shoot'em up where every run feels familiar, but is still completely unique," comments developer Kimmo Lahtinen on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2105620/Sektori/">the Steam page</a>. "A game of skill, not memorization. The hand crafted attack waves, levels and even the bosses are combined and randomized and layered with the upgrade systems in a way that creates an interesting challenge for every run.</p>
<p>"The aesthetics of the game are very much inspired by techno music," he continues. "Fast, detailed, colorful, saturated, intense, aggressive." I am here for it, and I don't even like techno. Shame there's no release date yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s not really a spoiler, as the game’s reveal trailer showed this very moment off and it’s the very first thing you’ll experience when you start playing.

Like its predecessor, <em>Neva</em> has gorgeous visuals and often-delicious platforming puzzles. The sophomore title falters, however, in how it executes on its often too-familiar themes. For those who have played <em>Gris</em>, this game’s distinctive art style and animation resembling that of a hand-drawn film make it abundantly clear the same team is behind it. That pedigree isn’t always a good thing, however, as the game fails to strike out on its own, instead falling back on creative choices we’ve seen before. <em>Neva</em>’s story about our relationship with nature and the cycle of life seems ripe with potential, but it never knows how to deliver on that promise.</p><h2 id="h420161"><a id=""></a><strong>A story of seasons</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="d7d35e19ddb640eaf040286c4b73a4f0" data-recommend-id="image://d7d35e19ddb640eaf040286c4b73a4f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d7d35e19ddb640eaf040286c4b73a4f0" data-recommend-id="image://d7d35e19ddb640eaf040286c4b73a4f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While the wolf pup gets top billing in <em>Neva</em>, that is not the part you play. Rather, you step into the shoes of Alba, a surrogate parent for the now orphaned Neva. A young woman living in a gorgeous forest inhabited by larger-than-life deer, boar, and wolves, Alba has known Neva seemingly since birth, as we see her fighting a wave of enemies made of some sort of nature-killing plague alongside the pup and their parent in the game’s opening cinematic. With the forest around them rapidly dying due to this new threat, the pair embark on a journey that’ll last a full cycle of the seasons (or roughly five hours of game time). Along the way, you’ll help guide Neva from a small, nervous pup into a colossal wolf as you fight off the now infected inhabitants of the world.<br></p><p>Before you even set out on your adventure, though, which has massive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-kingdom-princess-mononoke-anime-1850333639&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-kingdom-princess-mononoke-anime-1850333639"><em>Princess Mononoke</em></a></span><em> </em>vibes throughout (if you couldn’t already tell from the giant wolf in the game’s opening and its female companion), you’ll likely be dazzled by <em>Neva</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/check-out-how-beautiful-side-scrolling-platformer-neva-1851661108&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/check-out-how-beautiful-side-scrolling-platformer-neva-1851661108">gorgeous visuals</a></span>. Much like <em>Gris</em> before it, <em>Neva</em> takes a painterly approach to its presentation. An early shot of the game’s starring duo resting underneath a massive flowering tree is particularly stunning and sets the bar for every beautiful vista to come. The leaves of skyscraper-tall trees are composed of countless little colorful dots that smudge together in a way Georges Seurat would approve of. As the game begins in summer and progresses through the seasons, the color palette becomes more muted, with the growing infection killing nature also playing its part. <em>Gris</em> was a game that started in greyscale and had you bringing color into the world. <em>Neva</em> reverses that, and it’s a wonderful visual journey to go on.</p><h2 id="h420162"><a id=""></a><strong>Lone wolf and cub</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="0a7aa48dd7a0215c069bdd1c3605b584" data-recommend-id="image://0a7aa48dd7a0215c069bdd1c3605b584" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a7aa48dd7a0215c069bdd1c3605b584" data-recommend-id="image://0a7aa48dd7a0215c069bdd1c3605b584" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You navigate <em>Neva</em> through 2D platforming, which sees you run, jump, double jump, and dash through its lush natural environments. There are plenty of platforming puzzles, but there’s also combat, a mechanic absent in <em>Gris</em>. While I was initially concerned about how combat would be integrated into this narrative-heavy platformer, after a full playthrough I can say it’s mostly okay. You’ll slash your way through a number of enemy varieties, some of which take a little more thought to defeat than others and be on your way. As Neva grows from season to season, you’ll also unlock new ways to incorporate them into battles. Combat isn’t particularly bad, but it also isn’t good enough to make it satisfying to engage with, which makes the game’s boss battles (which come near the end of every chapter) low points of your short adventure.<br></p><p>Platforming, on the other hand, feels delightful, which becomes especially true as <em>Neva</em> introduces new challenges. Yet, just as in <em>Gris</em>, these interesting variations on the game’s standard platforming often only get brief spotlights before being thrown away entirely. One area required me to navigate invisible platforms by looking at a reflection of the level, which made it so the controls felt backwards as I leapt through the air, hoping to not fall to my death. Subsequent rooms added more reflections and different perspectives, making them even more fun to navigate, but before long I was through this particular series of levels and would never face a similar challenge again. I can’t help but think it would have been better to have a smaller assortment of innovative wrinkles to the core gameplay that each got a bigger spotlight.</p><h2 id="h420163"><a id=""></a><strong>It’s the circle of life </strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="5c1df63eba6da0386c59a0961e695280" data-recommend-id="image://5c1df63eba6da0386c59a0961e695280" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5c1df63eba6da0386c59a0961e695280" data-recommend-id="image://5c1df63eba6da0386c59a0961e695280" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/neva-tribeca-games-demo-impressions-the-last-guardian-1851539029&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/neva-tribeca-games-demo-impressions-the-last-guardian-1851539029">previewed</a></span> <em>Neva</em> this June, I came away excited for the potential of this story. But having completed it now, I find that it’s a game of potential that is never reached. In the game’s earliest chapter, Summer, Neva’s companionship feels meaningful, in part because you must constantly be aware of the young pup. If you aren’t paying attention, they’ll run off or fall off a ledge and struggle to follow you. Calling for Neva and petting them, which you can do at any time with the press of a button, promises that forging this bond between Alba and Neva will mean something.<br></p><p>Yet that never feels true in later chapters. Eventually Neva just becomes a tool for Alba (and you) to utilize during combat or platforming, but never a true partner. The focus on an NPC companion puts this game in conversation with the likes of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/08/icos-graveyard-was-more-than-nightmare-fuel/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/08/icos-graveyard-was-more-than-nightmare-fuel/"><em>Ico</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-guardian-the-kotaku-review-1789666352&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-guardian-the-kotaku-review-1789666352"><em>The Last Guardian</em></a></span>, but unlike those games, it fails to understand the importance of allowing such a companion some level of freedom that may sometimes grate against the player’s wishes but that ultimately leads to a wonderful symbiotic relationship forged through challenges. </p><p>In theory, the game’s combat serves a thematic purpose as well, in that it allows you to actively fight for a better world. As Alba and Neva make journey on, they’re constantly waylaid by the once-thriving fauna of the forest, now infested with the same corruption poisoning the land itself, and by engaging you directly in that struggle, the game seems to assert itself as an environmentalist call to arms. Unfortunately, however, these themes never go more than skin-deep. Beyond destroying the threat, Alba and Neva can’t work to meaningfully bring life back into the world. Neva is the only animal you as the player directly have responsibility over and interact with, and even they become nothing more than another tool to wield in the context of combat. There is a lot of set-up that left me waiting for the game to say something meaningful, but it never paid off. With the game’s narrative failing to commit to the environmentalist message, the inclusion of combat feels like an afterthought whose only real purpose is to give the player some busywork in the form of enemies to cut down.<br></p><p>Instead, <em>Neva</em> prioritizes a meditation on life and loss that too often feels half-baked and pales in comparison to <em>Gris</em>’ execution of the same themes. Much of <em>Neva</em> feels propped up by its predecessor to cover its weaknesses, with familiar themes and the same platforming (flaws and all) from <em>Gris</em> encouraging fans of that game to not look too closely at this game’s faults. Ultimately, when <em>Neva</em> attempts a final narrative twist that fully leans away from the initially compelling and original themes of its story, it’s too much of a shift too late in the game, and only serves to undermine the few unique choices this experience attempts. At least it’s short.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-felt-unfinished-developers-admit-a-year-after-disastrous-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>To say the launch of Payday 3 was bad would be an understatement. The game released with so many problems that Starbreeze CEO <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-flawed-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to publicly apologize</a>. Things only got worse at the time as updates to fix player concerns <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were regularly delayed</a>. </p>



<p>Now, over a year since its release, Starbreeze once again admits that the game’s launch was  “disastrous” with the game feeling “unfinished” in a lot of ways. </p>



<p>“When you have a launch like we did – a disastrous launch, where nobody is able to play the game – there is no place to hide,” Starbreeze community head Almir Listo said in a new <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/payday-3/interview-starbreeze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with PCGamesN</a>. “But it’s important that we don’t use the technical issues as an excuse because we clearly missed the mark from an experience point of view as well. </p>



<p>“The game just felt unfinished. It was a bad experience for our players.”</p>



<p>Listo added that while its hard to make video games, it’s even tougher to make a game after a successful game that lasted a decade.</p>



<p>“Andreas and myself were part of the Payday 2 development team at that time,” he said. “Not everyone, ten years on, was still there. To draw the exact right learning from a ten-year production is challenging, but also every game project is different from another one. I think a lot of small things built up.”</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happened-with-payday-3-s-launch">What Happened With Payday 3’s Launch?</h2>



<p>Lead Producer Andreas Penniger said that many of the problems came from the studio not doing their “due diligence” with what the players actually wanted from the game.</p>



<p>“It ended up being a product that people didn’t resonate with,” he said. “I think we were a bit confident from the success of Payday 2 that we ended up making decisions too quickly.”</p>



<p>With the game out for over a year and a number of updates released to players, Starbreeze is hoping that Payday 3 can have the same turnaround games like Cyberpunk 2077 had after a less-than-ideal launch.</p>



<p>“Something we’ve learned is to try and understand the community, understand what made Payday 2 successful, and then to try and translate that into a more modern context,” Penniger said. </p>



<p>“While we haven’t communicated what year two might be, for me, the game currently suffers from a split personality – trying to be too many things at once. Our focus needs to be a stronger core fantasy. Every heist needs to feel more tense, open-ended, and rewarding.”</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> will be playable (in beta) with Xbox Cloud Gaming on day one.</p>
<p>Microsoft shared the news this afternoon, while adding it's also bringing Xbox Cloud Gaming support to both Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Call of Duty: Warzone for Game Pass Ultimate members.</p>
<p>This is all happening on the same day: 25th October.</p>

<p>"This is a first for the Call of Duty franchise, and a win for the community," Microsoft wrote in an accompanying <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/14/call-of-duty-coming-to-cloud-october-25/">blog post</a>. "Players will be able to access multiple Call of Duty games with Xbox Cloud Gaming for the first time, and Game Pass Ultimate members will be able to enjoy Call of Duty in more places than ever before."</p><p>This all means those members on Microsoft's Ultimate Game Pass tier will be able to experience the aforementioned Call of Duty titles on consoles and PC, as well as mobile devices and "select" Samsung TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Meta Quest devices.</p>
<p>"This opens up even more ways to play Black Ops 6 starting on day one at launch," the company proclaimed.</p>

<p>In August last year, Microsoft agreed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-sell-activision-blizzard-streaming-rights-to-ubisoft">sell the streaming rights for Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft</a>. At this time, Microsoft president Brad Smith said this change would mean Microsoft won't control the "exclusive" rights to stream <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> games.</p><p>"Under the restructured transaction, Microsoft will not be in a position either to release Activision Blizzard games exclusively on its own cloud streaming service - Xbox Cloud Gaming - or to exclusively control the licensing terms of Activision Blizzard games for rival services," Smith wrote last August.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I have not yet seen mention of Ubisoft being involved with any Call of Duty cloud dealings.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is set to release across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC.

            <p>Starbreeze - the developer behind the beleaguered <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a> - has likened its release to being a rock band when "the whole stage just collapsed and everyone left".</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/payday-3/interview-starbreeze">PCGN</a>, lead producer Andreas Penniger and community head Almir Listo discussed the shooter's disappointing debut, acknowledging its "disastrous launch" wasn't the only issue.</p>
<p>"The game just felt unfinished. It was a bad experience for our players," Listo admitted.</p>

<p>"It's hard to make videogames, and it's particularly difficult to follow up on the kind of success that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-2">Payday 2</a> was, not only at its launch, but also in the ten years succeeding that," the community head added.</p>
<p>"Andreas and myself were part of the Payday 2 development team at that time. Not everyone, ten years on, was still there. To draw the exact right learning from a ten-year production is challenging, but also every game project is different from another one. I think a lot of small things built up."</p><p>"A lot of the problems were due to the fact that we didn't do our due diligence well enough," Penniger added. "We built Payday 3 while trying to understand what we wanted, in parallel. It ended up being a product that people didn't resonate with. I think we were a bit confident from the success of Payday 2 that we ended up making decisions too quickly."</p>
<p>"Our energy was like 'we're a rock band, and we're coming onto the stage, and we've got a new album'. And the whole stage just collapsed and everyone left."</p>
<p>On its release last year, Payday 3 struggled with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-players-endure-second-consecutive-day-of-server-issues-preventing-them-from-playing">matchmaking issues</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-requires-an-always-on-online-connection">unpopular online-only requirements</a>, while its first major patch was hit with repeated delays, eventually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-much-delayed-first-patch-is-finally-here">arriving</a> two months after the game's troubled launch. Since then Starbreeze has released two additional major bug fixing patches <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-second-operation-medic-bag-patch-is-now-available">under the name Operation Medic Bag</a>, and introduced an early <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-is-finally-getting-an-offline-mode">offline mode</a>. Amid all this, the studio revealed it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">working on a Dungeons and Dragons game</a>.</p>
<p>Listo cites the launch issues as particularly problematic, but said it was "important that we don't use the technical issues as an excuse because we'd clearly missed the mark from an experience point of view as well. The game just felt unfinished".</p>
<p>Admitting that if the team had just carried on as if there was nothing wrong, the game "would be dead at this point", Listo also took time to acknowledge the importance of feedback from the Payday community.</p>
<p>"If we just put our heads in the sand and continued on, the game would be dead at this point. But even the angriest Payday fans still come from a good place. They want the game to succeed, and their anger is only a reflection of that.</p>
<p>"They're not hating on the game just to be haters - they're telling us what they want the game to have, in order for it to improve."</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-review">awarded Payday 3 three out of five stars</a> last year, calling it a "shallow shooter that doesn't offer anywhere near enough bang for your ill-gotten buck."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be available on Xbox Cloud Gaming at launch. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/14/call-of-duty-coming-to-cloud-october-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft has announced</a> that Black Ops 6, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (2023), and Warzone will all be available starting October 25 on the cloud with Xbox Game Pass.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is the first game in series history to launch day one on Game Pass.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-ps5-preview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Arcadia Bay is all but a forgotten memory for some. Washed away in a brutal storm, the town that Max Caulfield, Chloe Price, and so many others called home has simply ceased to be. Now, years after those traumatic memories have finally subsided, Max is ready to pick things back up and start a new life in Life is Strange: Double Exposure.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Life-is-Strange-DE-Chloe.png"></a></figure>

<p>Square-Enix invited us to take an early look at the first two chapters of <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure/">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> in their entirety. This will be the same Early Access that owners of the Ultimate Edition will gain access to starting on October 15th, a full two weeks ahead of the five-chapter game's full release.</p>
<p>Max Caulfield is certainly making a name for herself as a promising student at Caledon University, having won a number of awards and a residency through the prestigious school's art programs. Take one step into the Fine Arts Building that serves as a central hub for students and faculty to bump into each other over a quick cup of coffee and you'll see Max's photos all over the place as part of an art exhibit. This version of Max Caulfield has taken her past trauma and turned it into a form of self-expression through the photos she routinely takes. This is a Max whose time-traveling and bending days are behind her, and she's simply trying to enjoy a normal life once more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/LIfe-is-Strange-DE-Moses.png"></a></figure>

<p>Normal for Max Caulfield is rarely that. She hasn't quite grown out of her snarky self-talking phase, so if you were one to mute the TV while rummaging through the various knickknacks of Max's bedroom, you'll find no quarter here. Cute double entendre have instead been replaced with banter that's practically oozing with sexual tension, whether it's with the cute bartender who Max has a crush on, the administrative assistant who, by and large, feels like a grease ball no matter how much they try to humanize him and his faults, and the various other university fellows around.</p>
<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure centers around her relationships with a couple of close friends primarily: an up-and-coming poet named Safi Llewelyn-Fayyad whose mother is the President of Caledon University and Moses, a young astronomer whose dreams are in the stars. Amidst a meteor shower and a quiet gathering on the school's roof, Safi breaks from the group for a short while. In this time, she is tragically gunned down and left in the snow for Max and Moses to discover. It's this pivotal moment that serves as the crux for Life is Strange: Double Exposure's narrative.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Life-is-Strange-DE-Amanda.png"></a></figure>

<p>Those rewind powers that served Max so well in her first story have since atrophied and can no longer be relied upon. Instead, through perhaps a gift of the meteor shower or her own sheer determination to try and change the past, Max discovers that rather than moving to a previous time, her powers have grown to allow her to tear open a rift and travel to an alternate timeline: one where Safi is still alive.</p>
<p>Much of Life is Strange: Double Exposure's gameplay hinges on this dual-world mechanic. Venturing into a timeline where Safi is still alive is not quite a perfect world either, as the relationships between the various residents of Caledon University are strained in various ways. A character who might be the nurturing type in one timeline might have a fractured home life in another. In the world where Safi has passed, many of the residents have instead turned to coping mechanics such as alcohol and the downfall that slowly builds.</p>

<p>Early on, not much can be done with this newfound power in Life is Strange: Double Exposure. It starts initially with an ability to peer into the other world, seeing ghostly afterimages of people walking by or catching snippets of conversations on the wind. However, Max soon discovers that she can affect both timelines at once by carrying objects from one world into the other. This mechanic is largely used in the second chapters for menial items, such as keys and email printouts, but quickly grows as the demo comes to a close. While being unable to rewind loses much of its immediate potential, this world-shifting power might be the key to unraveling Safi's death in one world and preventing it in the other.</p>
<p>All in all, I left my time at Caledon University quite impressed with how they showed Max Caulfield's personal growth while giving players one more chance to go on a wild adventure with her. Even though Dontnod have already stepped away from the series early on, I have faith that Deck Nine and Square-Enix can do right by bringing Max Caulfield's story to an eventual close.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-head-retiring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox Game Studios head Alan Hartman is retiring at the end of next month, and Rare head Craig Duncan is apparently set to take his place.</p>
<p>That's according to a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rares-craig-duncan-to-become-head-of-xbox-game-studios-as-alan-hartman-retires" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz article</a>, which cites an internal email sent to Xbox staff by studio boss Matt Booty. In that email, Booty celebrates Hartman's "innovation, dedication, and...unwavering passion for gaming".</p>
<p>As he points out, Hartman's career with Microsoft began as a contractor in 1988, and he would go on to work on franchises like&nbsp;<em>Age of Empires</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Freelancer</em>,&nbsp;as well as being included in the credits of games like&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forza-alan-hartman-xbox-game-studios.jpg?itok=_W6bMg1k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forza-alan-hartman-xbox-game-studios.jpg?itok=UZax8DOq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alan Hartman's illustrious career includes work on franchises like&nbsp;<em>Forza</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Hartman was also involved in the founding of&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>developer Turn 10, which was established back in 2001 to steward the racing franchise.</p>
<p>He would go on to become Turn 10's studio manager in 2005, a position in which he served all the way up until 2023, when he was made the head of Xbox Game Studios (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-studios-rebranded-as-xbox-game-studios">rebranded from Microsoft Studios back in 2019</a>) after former position holder Matt Booty was promoted.</p>
<p>All told, this means Hartman will have served as Xbox Game Studios head for just over a year at the point of his retirement, which isn't a bad innings.</p>
<p>Hartman's replacement, Craig Duncan, is the current studio head of Microsoft subsidiary Rare, a position he's held since 2011. His appointment makes a lot of sense given that Rare is a Microsoft studio, as well as the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172620/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">continuing success</a> of Rare's live-service game&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em>.</p>

<p>Duncan also inherits a number of subsidiary studios under the Xbox label, including&nbsp;<em>Psychonauts&nbsp;</em>developer Double Fine,&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fable&nbsp;</em>studio Playground Games, and Hartman's former stomping ground Turn 10.</p>

After more than 30 years at Microsoft, Alan Hartman is retiring at the end of November.&nbsp;</p><p>Alan’s career has been marked by innovation, dedication, and an unwavering passion for gaming. Starting as a contractor at Microsoft in the fledgling CD-ROM group in 1988, Alan has worked on a variety of projects in his time here, from Age of Empires, to Brute Force as the studio head of Digital Anvil, to the founding of Turn 10. Over the years, Alan, Turn 10 and Playground Games delivered 13 Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon games, building Forza into one of the top racing franchises in the world and regularly pushing the capabilities of our hardware. His work to advance accessibility in gaming has set a benchmark for the industry and under his leadership, Xbox Game Studios has shipped multiple critically acclaimed titles this year and set the stage for highly anticipated games like Avowed, South of Midnight, Fable, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>When seeking our next leader to navigate the complexities of our business and foster the creativity needed for our games to thrive, we collaborated with HR to evaluate both external and internal candidates, considering the unique demands of the XGS role.</p><p>I am pleased to announce that Craig Duncan will assume the role of Head of Xbox Game Studios. Craig brings a wealth of experience from his tenure at Codemasters, Midway Games, and Sumo Digital before joining Xbox in 2011 to lead Rare. During this time, Rare has achieved sustained business success and developed new IP, most notably the ever-evolving Sea of Thieves, a cross-platform franchise with over 40 million players.</p><p>In his new role, Craig will continue to focus on helping our studios deliver high-quality, differentiated game experiences that can grow into successful franchises and reach more players by investing in new IP. Craig will report to me and join the Game Content and Studios leadership team, working closely with Alan during the transition. The existing XGS leadership team Alan established will remain intact and report to Craig.&nbsp;</p><p>I am also pleased to announce that Joe Neate and Jim Horth will take over as co-leads of Rare. Their leadership has played a crucial role in Rare’s growth, and I am confident they will elevate the studio and its games to even greater heights.</p><p>Please join me in congratulating Alan on his retirement and welcoming Craig, Joe, and Jim into their new roles.</p><p>Matt</p></blockquote></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As a pair of scratchy, black-and white intertitles explain, you are Sadie, an aspiring actress and stuntwoman denied a fair shot at making it in the Golden Age of Hollywood. Sadie’s solution, apparently, is just to peg it stage left, bounding through an entire weekend marathon’s worth of film sets and increasingly hazardous prop warehouses.</p>

<p>As a platformer, it’s functional and slickly animated, if only about as deep as Charlie Chaplin’s hat. Its dedication to the silent movie bit, however, is bound to raise a smile. Besides the black-and-white film look, and the fact that Sadie starts doing the Charleston if you set your controller down for a while, the big highlight is the use of sound. In place of realistic action noises, Sadie’s traversal moves are synced with little period-appropriate instrumental flourishes. Twiddly strings accompany rope grabs, their pitch playfully creeping higher with successive swings, and hard landings produce a bassy drum roll to emphasise the timeless slapstick quality of falling on one’s arse. It’s not a rhythm game but when you’re successfully stringing together jumps and slides, there is a keenly satisfying sense that you’re playing the lead in a twenties flick <em>and</em> composing the score at the same time.</p><p>There’s also an attention to detail that really helps breathe some life into these plywood gauntlets. Stagehands and set designers go to work around you, putting the finishing touches to their fake Western/pirate/farmyard scenes, while forklift drivers cart their crates through the studio backlots. Even the static environments have character, especially a series of background billboards through which their Prohibition-era renters struggle to make water sound interesting.</p>

<p>Later on, the platforming gives way to some stealthing, with mixed success. It seriously slows down the pace, completely abandoning that flowing musical platforming in favour of forcing you to hide in cupboards from lumbering patrols. Still, the introduction of a barrel disguise – like you’re a flapper Solid Snake – does reintroduce the comedy aspect, and there’s still a dash of dynamic audio cleverness, as going into sneak mode lowers the jaunty swing soundtrack to a simple, slinking piano melody.</p>
<p>There’s no release date for Silent Sadie as of yet, though I can recommend this Next Fest demo right now. Even if the actual platforming part isn’t all that groundbreaking, the strength of its presentation and the charm of its affectionate 1920s pastiche go a long way in giving it a unique and likeable character.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft has announced a new head of Xbox Game Studios. Rare studio head Craig Duncan will be leaving his position to take over as Head of Xbox Game Studios.</p>



<p>The move comes as current head of Xbox Game Studios, Alan Hartman, has announced his retirement at the end of November. He held his position as studios head since October 2023. </p>



<p>Duncan comes in after leading Rare since February 2011 where he oversaw the development of Sea of Thieves along with other titles like Battletoads, Killer Instinct, and various Kinect titles at the studio. Prior to Rare, Duncan was a director at Codemasters and studio head at Midway Games.</p>



<p>In a memo to staff via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rares-craig-duncan-to-become-head-of-xbox-game-studios-as-alan-hartman-retires" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, president of Game Content and Studios Matt Booty thanked Hartman for his years of dedication and service to the industry and Xbox. He then touched on what Duncan will focus on moving forward.</p>



<p>“In his new role, Craig will continue to focus on helping our studios deliver high-quality, differentiated game experiences that can grow into successful franchises and reach more players by investing in new IP,” Booty said.</p>



<p>Taking over for Duncan at Rare will be Joe Neate and Jim Horth. Neate has been the executive producer of Sea of Thieves while Horth has spent over 20 years at Rare.</p>



<p>Currently, Rare is still regularly developing and releasing updates for Sea of Thieves. The studio is also working on the upcoming action-adventure game Everwild.</p>

While some customer service representatives have indicated the <a href="https://x.com/AndrewLostTime/status/1845815095021957410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancellation emails were sent in error</a>, others have confirmed that the <a href="https://x.com/Matoh543/status/1845820655742161264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancellations are legitimate</a>, leaving buyers uncertain about the status of their orders.</p><p>This isn't the first bit of trouble the PS5 30th Anniversary that customers have run into.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-catalyst-is-a-metroid-hades-hybrid-soaked-in-neon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>For a small, independent studio, Bithell Games really doesn’t like to be pigeonholed. The studio began life as a one-man band and released its debut puzzler Thomas Was Alone to critical acclaim. In the 12 years since, the studio has grown and experimented, tackling genres like stealth, strategy, point-and-click adventure, and even visual novels. For its next project it’s going even bigger, and Tron: Catalyst is an action-adventure with a scope and ambition far greater than anything the studio has done before.</p><p>Of course, it’s not the first time the studio has worked on the Tron franchise and 2023’s Tron: Identity was a fresh spin on the movie series. Tron: Catalyst is set in the same world as Identity and features an all-new story, but it’s the action-focussed gameplay that piqued my interest the most when I recently sat through a 30-minute hands-off demo.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Playing as Exo, a courier who’s been swept up in a conspiracy and is now on the run, Catalyst reminded me a little of Hades. It has a similar 3D isometric viewpoint and the action flows thick and fast. Showcasing the combat was the aim of the demo and, equipped with the infamous Identity disc, Exo fought multiple enemies at the same time. Melee attacks – slamming the disc in the face of the nearest enemy – is the foundation on which combat is built, but the disc can be used as a ranged weapon too, throwing it like a frisbee to target distant enemies. Additionally, the disc can be ricocheted off surfaces and even other enemies, to string together combos, or it can be thrown past a target so it catches them on the rebound, pulling them nearer so you can finish them off with a close-up sucker punch. It’s fast and satisfying, and of course, it’s all drenched in neon so it feels <em>very</em> Tron. </p><p>“The goal is to hit all the Tron verbs, to enable players to do everything they would want to do in a Tron movie, and to do them in an interesting way,” explains creative director Mike Bithell. Of course, if you think of Tron you automatically think of its iconic Light Cycle, which is a core part of Catalyst. It is by far the fastest way to explore the city, at least at ground level, but it’s also useful in combat and side-swiping a bunch of enemies while doing a donut looks like a lot of fun.</p><p>That said, verticality is a key part of the city’s design so often you need to explore on foot. There are high rises to climb, buildings to infiltrate and roofs to parkour over, and there’s a fluidity to the way it all flows together. Exo is able to run and vault over obstacles seamlessly, and can even combo an attack if there’s an enemy on the other side of a wall. Indeed, Bithell says Tron: Catalyst has a deep upgrade tree and that both your combat and traversal skills can be buffed to improve your ability to fight and move quickly around the environment. “Some of the upgrades happen through story moments, plus you can also earn XP by collecting green data shards to upgrade too”, says Bithell. “There are also other layers to the upgrade tree I cannot talk about now, but the idea is to constantly give the player a constant stream of new stuff to play with.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even though Catalyst tells a separate story from Legacy, it’s mindful of everything that has come before and indeed is coming later</p></div><p>Interestingly, the Light Cycle cannot be upgraded because the studio wanted players to be able to use it to its full ability right from the start rather than having to wait, but the way you navigate around does change over time as shortcuts are unlocked.</p><p>These are revealed as part of bigger ‘glitches’ in the game, which are effectively gameplay loops you can use to your advantage. Although the exact nature of these loops isn’t clear right now, the demo reveals that they roll back time, meaning you’re able to revisit locations you’ve been to before, but with equipment you picked up later in the game. It’s a nod to Metroidvanias and I’m interested to see how big a part it plays in the finished game, especially because Bithell says the loops are used in different ways throughout and that there are puzzles that can only be solved by using the glitch.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Tron: Catalyst First Screens</h3></div></output><p>One thing we are unlikely to see in Tron: Catalyst is boss fights, or at least not many of them. “There will be boss fights but it’s not a massive focus for the game”, admits Bithell. “The combat is really built around fighting multiple enemies at the same time; it’s about making each individual enemy interesting but also the intersection of different enemies together interesting too – how they work together and how the overlaps feel. There are multiple factions in the game so that plays into it too.”</p><p>We know nothing about the factions Bithell speaks of but one thing is for sure – Tron: Catalyst is a canon entry in the Tron universe and takes place after Legacy, but is set on a different Grid, one that has been left alone for decades. “I wanted to explore the idea of what would happen if you left those programs to their own devices, and what would happen if that grid starts to break apart and glitch”, explains Bithell. Even though Catalyst tells a separate story from Legacy, it’s mindful of everything that has come before and indeed is coming later, when the third movie, Tron: Ares, releases next year.</p><p>Working with Disney and the people behind the movies to ensure authenticity is something Bithell relishes highly. It’s something he first explored with John Wick Hex, which released five years ago, and is now something he actively looks forward to. “I absolutely love learning opportunities and getting the chance to work with the people who make the things I love,” he admits. “I’ve been able to talk and learn from them, so much so there are action scenes [in Tron] that I’ve put together after learning from the best stunt teams in the world. With Tron, I’ve been able to learn from artists, writers, designers, directors of previous Tron media… You can’t pay for an education like that.”</p><p><em>Alex Simmons is IGN's Features Director.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As head of Xbox Game Studios, Duncan will oversee projects from the likes of Rare and Turn 10, as well as Playground Games, Ninja Theory, The Initiative, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-confirms-multiple-new-games">newly named Halo Studios</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Back at Rare, Duncan will be replaced by Joe Neate and Jim Horth. Neate has led Sea of Thieves as executive producer, while Horth has worked at Rare for over 20 years - most recently as studio director.</p>
<p>"Alan's career has been marked by innovation, dedication, and an unwavering passion for gaming," wrote Xbox president of game content and studios Matt Booty in an email to staff (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rares-craig-duncan-to-become-head-of-xbox-game-studios-as-alan-hartman-retires">GI.Biz</a>).</p>
<p>"Starting as a contractor at Microsoft in the fledgling CD-ROM group in 1988, Alan has worked on a variety of projects in his time here, from Age of Empires, to Brute Force as the studio head of Digital Anvil, to the founding of Turn 10. Over the years, Alan, Turn 10 and Playground Games delivered 13 Forza Motorsport and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> games, building Forza into one of the top racing franchises in the world and regularly pushing the capabilities of our hardware. His work to advance accessibility in gaming has set a benchmark for the industry and under his leadership, Xbox Game Studios has shipped multiple critically acclaimed titles this year and set the stage for highly anticipated games like Avowed, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, Fable, and more."</p>
<p>On Duncan's position, he wrote: "In his new role, Craig will continue to focus on helping our studios deliver high-quality, differentiated game experiences that can grow into successful franchises and reach more players by investing in new IP."</p>
<p>Rare has been working on its next project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-now-targeting-2024-release-report">Everwild</a>, for quite some time now, which was pencilled in for a 2024 release back in 2021. That now seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sea of Thieves was released on PS5 earlier this year and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-published-sea-of-thieves-reportedly-surpasses-1m-sales-on-playstation-5">quickly hit 1m copies sold</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>To make the confusion worse, some customers who got in touch with Argos' customer support were told the emails had been sent "in error", with several receiving assurances from the retailer that their orders had "not been cancelled" and were still scheduled to be delivered at the end of November.</p>
<p>But at the same time, other customers were informed that "all cancellations are correct", with Argos apologising for "any inconvenience caused".</p> <div>

<p>Whilst it's unclear how many customers have been affected, a Argos representative told one customer that "as this is a mass cancellation, it is taking time for some orders to update to cancelled. Refunds are being processed as we speak".</p>
<p>"The annoying thing is that we've missed the opportunity to buy elsewhere thinking our orders were confirmed," <a href="https://x.com/FPL_Boots/status/1845823445440872944">said</a> one unhappy pre-orderer.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't have to preorder from multiple shops to stand a chance of getting something in case of cancellations."</p>
<p>Whilst Argos representatives are contacting affected customers on social media, there's been no wider public statement about the mass cancellations. We've reached out to Argos for a formal confirmation and more clarification on the situation.</p>

			<p>I’m always in awe at the dedication that long-running Japanese game developer Nihon Falcom has for their legacy series like The Legend of Heroes and Ys. Most game franchises this long in the tooth might have gone through some reboots or massive changes in style or direction at this point, but not Ys. This series is a lot like Final Fantasy in how each entry can update and reinvent itself, but each game still features the same protagonist Adol Christin and the same sort of high-fantasy, treasure-hunting vibe that the series is so closely tied to. Well, all except for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/17/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-review/">Ys IX: Monstrum Nox</a>, which shot for a wildly different tone and atmosphere that was honestly a welcome change of pace. While Ys X: Nordics introduces just as many meaningful changes to the formula, it ends up coming a lot closer to being the sort of bright and vivid expedition adventure that the franchise has been known for.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ys X: Nordics - Release Date Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, PC) (EU - English)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ob0w-Wi9Nc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ys X: Nordics technically takes place after the second entry in the series, but that only matters if you’re a diehard fan analysing every crumb of minor NPC dialogue for hints of lore like a rabid fanboy tying the various Legend of Zelda timelines together. This is essentially a standalone adventure about a young swordsman named Adol who gets himself roped up in some trouble while hitching a sea-fairing ride on a large ship.</p>


<p>A raiding party of Normans arrive, who are a very 11th century viking-inspired clan of peoples, and Adol soon finds out that the ship he’s on is helmed by bandits and that the raiding Normans are actually just protecting their village. After arriving on land and making camp with the Normans, Adol finds himself mysteriously stuck to their princess leader Karja Balta by a mysterious glowing chain – kicking off a series of events that sees Adol involved in a mysterious, ancestral battle involving undying creatures, clashing clans and more.</p>


<p>While I was impressed by the story of Ys IX, I felt like it didn’t hit the mark as well with the character-specific writing and little moments of interaction and bonding between the crew. I feel like I walked away from my time with Ys X: Nordics with the opposite feeling. This game has some of my favorite character writing and interactions in the whole franchise. Adol and Karja bounce off each other so well, and despite every game in the series throwing a new temporary ally into Adol’s arms, Karja is one of the rare ones who feels like such a perfect foil and companion to Adol’s energy and vibe that I wish she would become a series mainstay going forward.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the overarching story didn’t do much to impress me. A lot of big moments kind of happen for the sake of happening, and the overall adventure ends up feeling less like a grandiose emotional adventure and more of a flashy and silly anime-fueled action romp.</p>

<p>If anything, that sometimes mindless story helps put you onto the rails for some of the most fun combat the Ys series has ever had. The last few entries in the series had you controlling a party of three characters with different weapon types, swapping between them in real-time depending on the weakness of the enemy you were facing. Ys X: Nordics does away with the weapon weaknesses and the three-person party – instead, you only play as Adol and Karja, and you play as them at pretty much the same exact time.</p>
<p>Now, your main gameplay focus is building combos by linking your special attacks together, but using the same special attack twice in a row kills your combo, and certain special attacks drain way more SP for the character who used it than others might. You quickly fall into a rhythm of not only swapping between each character’s unique sets of skills, but also building up to your strongest attacks by first using weaker ones so you can extend your combo, give your meter time to charge, and effectively deal with your enemies. It’s an incredible change that adds more agency and thoughtfulness to the combat than there’s been in this series for ages.</p>

<p>The other major gameplay wrinkle in Ys X: Nordics is the ship exploration and combat. In the same vein as a AAAA game like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/26/skull-and-bones-review/">Skull &amp; Bones</a>, you can navigate a seafaring vessel across the massive amount of oceans and small bodies of land that make up the expansive world of the game. It isn’t quite open-world in terms of scale, but there’s far more to see and explore than I was expecting.</p>
<p>For the first few chapters, though, your ship is kind of boring. It’s slow, and it doesn’t have much in the way of firepower, but as you progress through the game and do things like tackling the enemy fortresses or deal with side quests you’ll quickly upgrade your arsenal and ship capabilities. There’s some clunkiness to the way your ship handles that I imagine could be ironed out in a future entry, but it’s still a fun enough distraction to help tie the otherwise pretty linear dungeon encounters together.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Ys X: Nordics maintains a lot of the qualities that this series has come to be known for. Some of those qualities aren't necessarily a positive, like the familiarly linear dungeon encounters and the less-than-impressive visuals of the game, but a lot of it works great. Combat is the best it's ever been, naval gameplay is a fresh and welcome addition, and Ys X: Nordics introduces refreshing character moments with Adol and Karja that I'm desperate to see more of in the next entry.	</p></div>

			<p>Disney TRON: Catalyst is a brand new action-adventure game that will be launching on PC and consoles in 2025. This game is developed by Big Fan Games, a subsidiary of Devolver Digital, alongside Bithell Games in collaboration with Disney Games. This story-driven isometric title will be taking place in TRON's world, with the game acting as a continuation of the Arq Grid story, which was introduced in TRON: Identity, a game created by Bithell Games that was released in 2023. For those eager to jump into the futuristic cult classic world of TRON once more, the game will be launching <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025590/TRON_Catalyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on PC</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in 2025.</p>
<p>The Arq Grid is just about on the brink of collapse, and you are in charge of figuring out why and how to resolve the issue. In the sequel to TRON: Identity, players will get to play as Exo, where you'll be in charge of battling on-foot while using your Identity Disc and piloting your Light Cycle to try and complete missions as well as obtain information that will help you advance on your quest. Exo is a multi-faceted character, and players will get to see her learn from her mistakes as she tries to complete her quest and navigate the warring factions to uncover new paths and secrets of the Arq Grid while harnessing the power of the Glitch loop.</p>
<p>Exo can initiate time loops and is in charge of using the time loops to manipulate time and space to fight back against the overlords of a crumbling Grid. While this is happening, Exo has to try to evade Conn, the main enemy in the game, who is a dangerous agent of CORE. Exo has to harness her abilities to be able to uncover the 'Glitch' that is currently threatening the grid in TRON: Catalyst.</p>
<p><iframe title="Disney TRON: Catalyst - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qvDOAkbemRw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Original music from the TRON universe will be a feature, and the game features hand-drawn art to give it that personal touch. To celebrate the announcement of the game, Big Fan Games has released a trailer in just over one minute that will show off some of the art, action, and story that players can expect to jump into when the game releases in 2025. Below is the trailer, giving those excited TRON fans a sneak peek into the future.</p>
<p>For those who don't know much about Bithell Games, they are a small indie team that was founded in 2013. They were created after the success of Thomas Was Alone, the project made by <a href="https://wccftech.com/interviewing-mike-bithell-ygf/">Mike Bithell</a>, Creative Director. Since then, there have been games such as John Wick Hex, Volume, and, more recently, TRON: Identity.</p>

<p>The game, which will be released through Devolver's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devolver-big-fan-games-licensed-indies">new Big Fan label</a>, will combine "electrifying action and a rich story" set in what Bithell calls "the immersive and diverse locations of the Arq Grid".</p>
<p>You might recognize that term if you've played Bithell Games' previous&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>game,&nbsp;<em>Tron: Identity</em>, a visual novel released last year that first introduced the Arq Grid to the&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

Using that power, you must battle your way through the Arq Grid, dealing with the sinister machinations of malevolent AI Conn as you go.</p>
<p>Bithell is promising a "dynamic combat system" that will allow you to engage in both melee and ranged combat, and you'll also have access to one of the&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>franchise's iconic Light Cycles, which you can also use to do battle.</p>
<p>As you explore the Arq Grid, you'll also be able to uncover "secret areas and shortcuts" using Exo's Glitch ability, which can help you see "system level time loops" caused by sinister Glitches.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the&nbsp;<em>Tron: Catalyst&nbsp;</em>launch trailer, which shows off some of the ways in which Bithell's game captures the clean, moody cyberpunk aesthetic of&nbsp;<em>Tron</em>, right here.</p>

<p>Mike Bithell's previous games include the likes of tactical action game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/john-wick-hex"><em>John Wick Hex</em></a>, narrative-focused visual novel&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mike-bithell-announces-and-releases-quarantine-circular"><em>Quarantine Circular</em></a>, and futuristic card game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-bithell-short-solitaire-conspiracy-announced-for-october-6th"><i>The Solitaire Conspiracy</i></a>, the latter two of which are shorter projects released as "Bithell Shorts".</p>
<p><em>Tron: Catalyst&nbsp;</em>isn't a Bithell Short, though; it's a full-length game, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025590/TRON_Catalyst/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch sometime next year.</p>

<p>Team BDS has announced it is pulling out of the Rocket League Championship Series, the topmost tournament in the game’s esports ecosystem. The organisation stressed that it’s not removing itself from the Rocket League competitive scene entirely, but it’s making an adjustment that will take ‘into account the economic realities of Rocket League’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-champs-to-this">From Champs to This</h2>



<p>Team BDS was one of the most impactful organisations in the RLCS. In 2022 and 2024 (just weeks ago), the team won the RLCS World Championship, and in 2023, the squad wound up in second place. Elsewhere, Team BDS has claimed the top spot in many regional events and majors, netting a whopping $2.6 million in earnings and becoming one of the winningest organisations in Rocket League.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team made a shocking revelation, confirming that it’s withdrawing from the tournament it <strong>just won</strong>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Today, Team BDS is reviewing its position and investment in the competitive Rocket League scene. After thorough analysis and careful consideration, we have decided to adjust our resources and priorities for this game, taking into account the economic realistic of Rocket League and the resources allocated by the publisher to the esports scene.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To that end, the organisation’s players have been dismissed. However, it’s not the end of the line for Team BDS:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We remain committed to Rocket League, which is part of the DNA of Team BDS, by staying in the competitive scene on one hand, and by launching our own tournament during this offseason on the other.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Team BDS will host a tournament called ‘Take the Throne’ in Geneva, Switzerland on November 23. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s not goodbye from Team BDS, but it is a monumental change. It has been a solid four years for Team BDS in the RLCS, but this latest news confirms rumours that started circulating a couple of weeks ago.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-online-weekly-update-time-9302">GTA Online</a>'s time-limited zombie mode is here and players cannot get enough of it.</p>
<p>On 10th October, Rockstar launched a new survival mode and a community challenge that took us back to North Yankton to collectively slay 80 million zombies in order to unlock "special gifts", including a spooky-season appropriate Orange Glow Skeleton Onesie and the Red Hooded Skull Mask.</p>
<p>Within a couple of days, <a href="https://stats.gtao.gg/?contentId=Ev15vTKgxU6-Eg6atOSQlg">over 400,000 players</a> logged in to take part, prompting Rockstar to revise the collective slay count up from 80 million undead denizens to 800 million.</p>

<p>If successful, all participants will secure a Purple Glow and Green Glow skeleton onesie to match the goodies unlocked when the community previously hit 80 million collective zombie deaths.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/chandigarh-board-game-review-colorful-and-think-y<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the early 1950s, the Indian government set out to design and plan a new capital city for the Punjab region, and they recruited the famed Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier to do the job. That city, and the name of the game we're going to review today, is&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh</em>. In&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh</em>, players take on the role of urban planners assisting Le Corbusier in this colorful, think-y game. I got a chance to check out and playtest a review copy of the game, so read on for my Chandigarh Board Game review to learn more.</p>
<h2>How Do You Play the&nbsp;Chandigarh board game?</h2>
<p><em>Chandigarh&nbsp;</em>is a pattern-building, point-to-point movement game for two to four players. The game's designed by Toni López and illustrated (gorgeously) by Edu Valls, published by the <a href="https://ludonova.com/en/our-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Spanish gaming company&nbsp;Ludonova</a>&nbsp;and distributed in the USA by Asmodee North America.</p>
<p>In the game, players will collect cards, building materials, and the help of specialists as they move around the city of Chandigarh collecting prestige points.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chandigarh-board-game-review-early-board.jpeg?itok=9vZ-cSBd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chandigarh-board-game-review-early-board.jpeg?itok=qSyec6JM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The buildings come in four different colors and the game ends when any one color of a building runs out. At the end of the game, the player with the most prestige points wins.</p>
<p>And while this may sound simple, the core mechanics of the game create a much more in-depth, and at times potentially brain-burny experience that my gaming group and I were surprised to find.</p>

<h3>Move and Build in&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh</em></h3>
<p>On your turn, you can do one of two different available actions, the first of which is the Move and Build action. Take a look at the image above, these are the cards you'll be drawing and collecting in the game. And these cards, which you'll hold in a tableau of up to three in front of you (called your project), tell you everything your pawn on the board can do.</p>
<p>First off, the footprint symbols at the top of cards represent how many spaces on the board your character can move, and&nbsp;you gain colored buildings whenever you play a card in front of you (those buildings are on the bottom of the card). Those buildings are your key resource in the game.</p>

But why? Well that's where the second action comes in...</p>
<h3>Add a New Card to Your Project and Score in <em>Chandigarh</em></h3>
<p>This second action,&nbsp;Add a New Card to your Project and Score, controls one of the main ways you gain victory points, influences how far you can move on the board, and controls the buildings you gain. When you add a new card to your project you'll add it to one of the outer edges of your cards. You can only ever have three cards in front of you, so if you do already have three cards, the incoming card will "push" the card on the opposite side of your project off, and you'll score that pushed off card.</p>
<p>Each card contains scoring conditions - like having two blue buildings in adjacent city blocks - and you'll score for each time that condition is met on the board. Pushing cards together also gives you buildings to add to your reserve.</p>
<h2>How does it feel to play the&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh&nbsp;</em>board game?</h2>
<p>Here's what's so interesting about&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh</em>&nbsp;- those descriptions of the core game above will either leave players scratching their heads, or salivating at the prospect of forethought and planning required to make moves in the game. There are other elements that add complication, like the benefit of being the last person to place a building on a city block.</p>
<p>There are also four randomly selected specialists in each game, which give you little game-breaking abilities if you build the right building on a block they're occupying. So here's how it feels the play the game: you move from intersection to intersection, carefully laying down buildings to try to hit one of your cards' scoring conditions.</p>

Maybe you weren't quite ready to score that yet, but you&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;need a yellow building - so that card's got to go. These pressure-points, and complex (but not complicated) moments make&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh&nbsp;</em>a unique experience that may overwhelm some gamers.</p>
<h2>The Look and Feel of <em>Chandigarh</em></h2>
<p>By far the best part of&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh</em>&nbsp;is the artwork, design, and colorful elements of the game.&nbsp;Edu Valls, illustrator of the lovingly crunchy&nbsp;<em>Bitoku</em>, uses charming hand-drawn illustrations throughout the game to give this a warm, inviting, and sophisticated look that perfectly blends a midcentury look with colors and tones you'd expect for a game about Chandigarh. Le Corbusier would be proud.</p>

Each of the four different color types of buildings also reflect real-life buildings in Chandigarh, which is a very nice touch!</p>
<h2><em>Chandigarh&nbsp;</em>Board Game - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>As I've mentioned above, this is a game that is more chunky than you might expect for the mechanics and illustrations, but it does fit in well with like other pattern-centric games with cute themes, like <em>Calico&nbsp;</em>or <em>Tiny Towns</em>. And while <em>Chandigarh</em>&nbsp;won't be for every gamer, there's so much here to recommend it.</p>
<p>The decision tree logic you have to make&nbsp;<em>on every turn</em>&nbsp;may burn out some, but it's core to what makes&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh</em>&nbsp;so much fun to get into. If you're looking for a game that blends limited movement, limited resources, and careful planning, while still clocking in at around 45 minutes, you can do no better than&nbsp;<em>Chandigarh</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-gigantamax-pokemon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Niantic has announced that Gigantamax Pokemon are coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>later this month, and you'll be able to team up with up to 39 other players to take them down.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/max-pokemon-battle" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>website, Niantic describes Gigantamax Pokemon as the game's "biggest challenges yet". They're stomping their way into the popular mobile RPG starting from the weekend of October 26th-27th.</p>
<p>You'll take on Gigantamax Pokemon via Max Battles, which see players team up in groups of four to battle the giant creatures. At the conclusion of the fight, you'll get the chance to catch the Gigantamax Pokemon you're facing off against.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-go-gigantamax-venusaur.jpg?itok=U_haxvt- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-go-gigantamax-venusaur.jpg?itok=UnFd2F0E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Go</em>'s Gigantamax Pokemon ain't no joke.</figcaption></figure><p>Taking part in a Max Battle will also allow you to hear a new piece of music inspired by&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Sword and Shield</em>, and it was arranged by none other than longtime series composer Junichi Masuda himself.</p>
<p>When you do manage to take down a Gigantamax Pokemon and catch it for yourself, you'll be able to use Candy and Max Particles to level up your 'mon and unlock new moves, just like with Dynamax Pokemon.</p>
<p>Each Gigantamax Pokemon is capable of learning "up to three Max Moves: a unique attack, Max Spirit, and Max Guard".&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with the mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, Gigantamax Pokemon have a unique G-Max move they can use at the start of battle, and it "may not be the same type as [the Pokemon's] Fast Attack", according to Niantic. Better strategize accordingly.</p>

<p>This new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>announcement comes against the backdrop of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-freak-pokemon-hack-confirmed">a massive leak</a> that appeared over the weekend, with tons of sprites, screenshots, and other information about past and future&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games now widely available across the internet.</p>
<p><em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>is available to download right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.pokemongo&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-go/id1094591345" rel="noopener" target="_blank">iOS</a>. Gigantamax Pokemon will be available in the game starting from October 26th.</p>
