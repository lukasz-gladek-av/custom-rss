            <p>I’ve likely mentioned hitting Lovecraft fatigue so often that it’s now evolved into a second phase of Lovecraft-fatigue fatigue. This is not the same as Lovecraft refreshment, no matter how much I might want to return to the days before old one plushies and Cthulhu children’s books terrorised the internet en masse. There’s not quite enough information about “story generator” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marry-a-deep-one-innsmouth-simulator">Marry a Deep One: Innsmouth Simulator</a> for me to confidently say it’ll cut through my exhaustion with all things tentacular and horrifically be-gilled. But it is <em>beguiling</em>, isn’t it? There’s all sorts of little widgets and details shown off that remind me of everything from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-pirates">Sid Meier’s Pirates</a> to classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure games</a>, and maybe even a little <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rimworld">Rimworld</a>? It’s a heady soup, although one I’d recommend against quaffing, given where the water comes from.</p>

<p>“Marry a Deep One is a story generator with social mechanics at its core,” reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143760/Marry_a_Deep_One_Innsmouth_Simulator/">store page</a>. “You play as a villainous cult leader exerting considerable control over a small community. Nevertheless, you must also meet the demands of the Deep Ones, or they will punish the village."</p>

<p>Here’s a feature list. Probs don’t recite it out loud. And if you do, make sure to check your neck in the mirror afterward.</p>
<blockquote><p>STORY: The game doesn't follow a fixed script or sequence but features numerous randomized story elements that can interconnect into a larger narrative. Your actions—and even those of the NPCs—significantly influence the outcome.</p>
<p>MAGIC: Develop creative ways to manipulate villagers even further, to the point of breaking the game. Study documents to learn sigils, which you combine into spells.</p>
<p>POWER: Your grimoire grants you the power to monitor all villagers' feelings, relationships, actions and motivations. You even have the authority to choose villagers as sacrifices to the gods of the Deep Ones.</p>
<p>CUSTOMIZATION: Name yourself, your cat, grimoire, cult, village, spells and children. Try out various hairstyles, glasses, and hats. Construct, expand, and modify the village's buildings to your liking.</p>
<p>CATS: You can pet them.</p></blockquote>
<p>This one’s due out sometime this year. Could it finally be the game to wash the completely average taste of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a> out of my mouth? Am I going to elaborate on calling Dredge completely average? Nope! If you’re hankering for some Lovecraft in the meantime, the devs behind visual novel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481400/Dagon_by_H_P_Lovecraft/">Dagon</a> recently announced they’d raised <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/free-lovecraft-horror-game-developers-bit-golem-raise-50000-for-humanitarian-aid-in-ukraine">over $50,000 for humanitarian aid in Ukraine</a> - despite their game being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So it makes sense that Geoff Keighley, who runs ONL as well as the annual Game Awards show, would want to tweet to confirm the Hollow Knight: Silksong no-show. “Just to get this out of the way, no Silksong on Tuesday at ONL,” Keighley said. “Team Cherry Games is still cooking.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just to get this out of the way, no Silksong on Tuesday at ONL. <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamCherryGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TeamCherryGames</a> is still cooking. <a href="https://t.co/FlQHlc26zo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/FlQHlc26zo</a></p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1824923122929119364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Hollow Knight fans were already left with an all-too familiar feeling of dismay <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-fans-crushed-as-summer-showcases-pass-with-no-silksong-announcement">after 2024's E3-esque video game summer showcases came and went with no word on Silksong</a>.

"Almost from the very start, Hornet’s adventure was intended to take place in a new land, but as we dove in, it quickly became too large and too unique to stay a DLC, as initially planned," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-sequel-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch"><u>Team Cherry said at the time</u></a>.

Another year passed and Silksong finally reared its head, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-trailer"><u>the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase of 2022</u></a> revealed the game would be coming to Microsoft's console and Game Pass on day one. Further hope was inspired as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-release-window-next-12-months"><u>Xbox had said everything shown at the event would be released within a year</u></a>.

            <p>
Dead Cells today has received its final major update, The End is Near, after seven years of development.
</p>
<p>
This will be the 35th update to the game, which has received a number of DLCs to expand gameplay and reference other popular games, from Castlevania to Hollow Knight. 
</p>
<p>
The End is Near expands on the curse mechanic, with three new mobs, three new weapons, and three new mutations.

<p>
However, the new cursed mobs won't randomly spawn. Instead there's a new biome effect, Cursed Biomes, players can select in exchange for extra rewards.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the update includes new legendary affixes, over 40 new heads to customise the player character, new routing between levels, and more accessibility options. These include adding a background to text to improve readability, an option to invert player and camera movement, a reworking of the auto-hit assist mode, and more.
</p>
<p>
Full details can be found in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/">Steam post</a>. You can also see the update in action in the above video, in which developers Motion Twin and Evil Empire thanked the game's community.

</p>
<p>
The game will still receive small updates for bugs and issues and will remain playable. Plus, Motion Twin said the "beheaded will continue to feature outside of the game itself".
</p>
<p>
Both studios have also shared their thanks on social media.
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Welp, this is it - the last update we made for Dead Cells (and its last update ever) is out now 🫡<br>Huge thanks to everyone in the community, we had such a great time creating insane content with you, and of course thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/motiontwin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@motiontwin</a> for letting us play with your creation! <a href="https://t.co/fpq8L5yGMA">https://t.co/fpq8L5yGMA</a></p>— Evil Empire (@Studio_Evil) <a href="https://twitter.com/Studio_Evil/status/1825466895853645859?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Dead Cells was first released into early access in 2017. Updates to the game have brought new biomes, quality of life improvements, a boss rush mode, and plenty more.
</p>
<p>
Motion Twin's next game will be the combat roguelite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-developers-next-game-is-lightning-fast-combat-roguelite-windblown">Windblown</a>, while Evil Empire (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-developer-ends-support-focusing-on-new-projects">ended its own support for the game earlier this year</a>) released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-lot-of-dead-cells-in-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>.



</p>
<p>
The original designer of Dead Cells, Sébastien Benard, formed a new studio and has a new roguelike game on the way called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tenjutsu-is-an-all-new-roguelike-action-game-from-the-designer-of-dead-cells">Tenjutsu</a> in which players take the role of a renegade yakuza.

</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, Benard called the decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-designer-calls-decision-to-end-development-the-worst-imaginable-asshole-move">end Dead Cells development "the worst imaginable asshole move"</a>.

            <p>One of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">best roguelikes on PC</a> is getting a farewell of sorts this week. Twitchy slashfest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> received its final major update, introducing new enemies, fresh weapons, and a few mutations. Unfortunately, all this new stuff is very cursed. In other words, it all toys with the game's "curse" status effect, a hex that causes you to be killed if you take even a single hit. You'll probably die a few times as a result of this update, which in some ways is a fitting finalé for this fast-paced jar smasher of a game. You can see the new features in the trailer below. </p>

<p>Usually, you suffer the "curse" status by agreeing to open cursed chests in a risk-reward gamble for good gear. It's a Faustian bargain that plops a number over your head - kill that amount of enemies to lift the curse. But take even a teeny weeny bit of damage and you are toast. With this final update, there are going to be some new ways to catch the curse, and new ways to benefit from it. Enemies like the Doom Bringer and Curser will curse you with their attacks. And a new "cursed flask" will let you regain health infinitely but you'll also take a stack of curse with every slurp. There's also a mutation that increases your damage by 30% if you're cursed.</p>
<p>The new mobs won't appear randomly like other enemies, though. They only appear in biomes marked as "cursed". You'll see a special skull showing this is the case before entering the area, letting you make the decision to face those creeps or take another route. The upside is that all gear dropped in those bewitched biomes will be of a higher level. There is other stuff in the update, like new heads with which to customise your character, and new routes to take on your run. I'll not explain everything, you can see the nitty gritty for yourself in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588650/view/6100774879119621994">the patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Although this is the final update when it comes to special features (it's fittingly titled "The End Is Near"), there will still be minor bug-fixing patches in future, developers Evil Empire say. They've been working on this last blast of goodies for a while. We've known about it since at least February, as they reported the studio was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-cells-to-receive-its-final-update-as-devs-move-on-to-new-secret-projects">winding things down</a> on Dead Cells to focus on a new game. We've since learned this new game is co-op roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/windblown">Windblown</a>. That swapover is a decision that Dead Cells's former lead designer Sébastien Benard called an "asshole move" out of frustration, although it's not particularly unusual for studios to move on to new projects in this way. Benard later apologised for the strong words but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ending-dead-cells-updates-is-a-marketing-stunt-to-leave-room-for-windblown-claims-former-lead-designer">clarified his thoughts</a>. (Benard worked at Motion Twin when they created the game, but it has since passed onto Evil Empire as the de facto custodians).</p>
<p>When I first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-cells-review">reviewed Dead Cells</a>, I called it "blisteringly fast when it needs to be, challenging without being frustrating, and packed with sharp, fatal toys." After eight years and 35 updates, it is simply more so. An exceptional game. In the endless butter churn of video games news, people may see talk of a game's final update through a mortal lens, adopting the rotten "dead game" mentality that feeds the anxiety of an industry (and an audience) obsessed with games-as-a-service. I hope that doesn't happen here. There will be people who only get around to picking up Dead Cells years from now, and fall madly in love with its speed, fury, and playfulness. There will be folks who return to it again and again. Nobody ever says "dead movie" or "dead book". And even though "dead" makes up 50% of this game's name, this franchise is as unlikely to perish as the flame-headed hero who carries it. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Konami has dropped a brand new story trailer for its highly-anticipated Silent Hill 2 Remake.</p>
<p>The teaser essentially matches the original's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md-vvbxyjDA">acclaimed 2001 E3 trailer</a>, and the script is almost identical, too, all set against a fabulous reimagining of (one of) Silent Hill 2's end themes, Promise.</p>
<p>The Remake trailer is below. For comparison, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md-vvbxyjDA">here's the 2001 E3 trailer for Silent Hill 2</a>:</p>

<p>Perhaps most excitingly, we <em>finally</em> get our first peek at the Remake's take on Eddie and Mary, two key NPCs that, until now, had not been shown in any cinematics (or at all, in Eddie's case).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">The last character reveal</a> generated, uh, <em>interesting</em> responses from some corners of the internet, but Eddie's face - if highly reminiscent of Tweedle Dee/Tweedle Dum - is much more faithful to the original, complete with his backwards baseball cap. He is palpably weird in all the right ways.</p>
<p>Mary, too, closely mirrors the original character, including her outfit and hairstyle.</p>
<p>We also get to see a little more combat, and a longer peek at Silent Hill 2's grungy environments courtesy of that all-new over-the-shoulder camera perspective. In this particular trailer, we briefly see the prison, the hotel, the park, and Brookhaven hospital, of course. All appear to have been so faithfully recreated, they look almost identical to the originals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> - one of gaming's worst-kept secrets <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-is-back-but-is-it-too-much-too-soon">before it was formally revealed back in October 2022</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">is set to release on PC via Steam and PS5 on 8th October, 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Tom Morgan shared his thoughts on the opening hours of the remake in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2s-remake-dares-to-modernise-a-classic-and-is-largely-succeeding">Silent Hill 2 Remake preview</a>.</p>
<p>"In rebuilding such a beloved classic with upgraded visuals and controls, the new combat style fits in surprisingly well then," Tom wrote in his excellent summary.</p>
<p>"The puzzles, too, find a natural place in its world. A remake project is a delicate balancing act for any developer, it's fair to say: stray too far from the source at your own risk, while a failure to innovate defeats the point of the whole endeavour.</p>
<p>"What I've seen so far of Silent Hill 2 Remake, though, shows a team determined to stick to the original blueprint first. It provides the game a comfortingly familiar structure - while allowing new detail to flourish around it like a trellis - and I'm looking forward to seeing where it grows past its first three hours."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In comparison, The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, which was released earlier this year on PS5, is priced at £44.99.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there's been no mention of a £10 upgrade path such has been done with other re-releases. Eurogamer has contacted Sony for more.</p>

<p>On its release this autumn, remaster studio Ballistic Moon promises that this souped-up version of Until Dawn will offer a more "atmospheric experience" for players, thanks to a number of tweaks and adjustments. This includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-gets-suitably-spooky-pc-ps5-release-date">changes to graphics, gameplay, story elements and "more"</a>.</p>
<p>Until Dawn is set to release across PC and PlayStation 5 on 4th October. If you are still on the fence as to whether this game is for you, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-review">Eurogamer's original Until Dawn review from 2015</a>, where Dan Whitehead called it "weird, gory and surprisingly moving".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
This week's launch of Black Myth: Wukong has brought further controversy to the game with the leak of a document sent to influencers requesting they do not include "politics", "feminist propaganda", or references to Covid-19 in their coverage.
</p>
<p>
Over the weekend, a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1aKlZvxWxbPOzldSUdc6CaHmoy80Fl7W_wQt-Ex-vl0k/mobilebasic?pli=1">document</a> from the marketing team at co-publisher Hero Games leaked, which was sent to influencers and streamers ahead of coverage and contains a list of do's and don'ts.
</p>
<p>
While the do's simply reads "enjoy the game", the don'ts includes a number of caveats. "Do not insult other influencers or players" and "do not use any offensive language/humour" are both understandable, but other requests are far more political.

</figure>
<p>

In full, the don'ts are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Do NOT insult other influencers or players.</li>
<li>Do NOT use any offensive language/humour.</li>
<li>Do NOT include politics, violence, nudity, feminist propaganda, fetishisation, and other content that instigates negative discourse.</li>
<li>Do NOT use trigger words such as 'quarantine' or 'isolation' or 'Covid-19'.</li>
<li>Do NOT discuss content related to China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The document was shared on social media by French content creator and journalist Benoit "ExServ" Reinier (thanks <a href="https://videogames.si.com/news/black-myth-wukong-streamers-feminist-propaganda">VideoGames.si</a>). Forbes reporter <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1825193786273681489">Paul Tassi</a> has also confirmed its validity.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer can confirm this document was not shared with journalists for review coverage. 
</p>
<p>
While guidelines for coverage are relatively normal, the above stipulations for Black Myth: Wukong are strict for their political nuance. It's unclear if this is typical practice in China, or for dealing with Western influencers.
</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is the first major console release from the Chinese developer and has received massive attention around the world. The document perhaps suggests some inexperience working with Western media.</p>
<p>
However, it's clear Game Science, through Hero Games, is keen to control the narrative around Black Myth: Wukong to avoid negative coverage and ensure focus is on the game itself. This matches my own experience during preview, when I was told Game Science "will only answer questions related to gameplay".
</p>
<p>
The guidelines are also likely in place to avoid mention of previous reports of misogyny at the studio. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-resurfaces-misogynistic-comments-from-developer">Posts from Game Science CEO Féng Jì</a> including sexualised and misogynistic language were reported on in 2020, while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">IGN</a> also reported on the studio's history with sexism.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Game Science for comment. Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-black-myth-wukong-review">review of Black Myth: Wukong</a> is still on the way.

</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong will release on PS5 and PC tomorrow, 20th August. There is still no news on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delayed Xbox Series X/S release</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last week, the Xitter account for H2M - a mod aiming to recreate the heyday of classic Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer inside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered</a> - <a href="https://x.com/H2Multiplayer/status/1824167247436542167">announced that they had received a cease and desist</a> from Activision Blizzard, and would shut down the project. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2">2022 version of Modern Warfare 2</a> lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS </a>balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans<a href="https://x.com/okGRAPHS/status/1824168720819753007"> speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch</a> on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In all, H2M was set to include remasters of every classic Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer map, campaign levels tweaked for multiplayer, and all the maps from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare">Call Of Duty 4</a> - for a total of 54 maps. Basically, it was a lot of work, took a long time, and Activision waited until the very last minute to get all litigious about it.</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyZY_BiTmd8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Now, H2M project lead and ‘founder’ Watchful Wolf has <a href="https://youtu.be/WhHQ76SgPUI">taken to YouTube</a> to speculate on the reasons surrounding Activision’s decision, as spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/h2m-creator-activision-interfere-black-ops/">Insider Gaming.</a> Watchful Wolf had this to say about the publisher’s motivation for sending the cease and desist.</p>
<blockquote><p>Essentially, because of the popularity H2M was gaining and how close it is to Black Ops 6, releasing and kind of the marketing and the beta stuff like that, they did not want H2M interfering with possible sales of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a></p></blockquote>
<p>If you were looking forward to H2M, there is somewhat of a silver lining to the story, however. Hours after the news of the cease and desist came out, the mod had leaked online through several Discord servers, again via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/h2m-leaked-online/">Insider Gaming</a>. “Around 800 people were playing the Mod at the time of writing, with thousands believed to have downloaded it,” they write.</p>
<p>There’s also currently a petition, with over 8000 signatures at the time of writing, named “Let H2M-Mod Live in peace.” From the petition:</p>
<blockquote><p>H2M is a passionate project that has revived interest in a game long considered dormant, actually helping Activision earn money from a title many thought was dead. The proof? It's been in the top 5 on the Steam charts for almost a week since it was announced and gained attention.</p>
<p>Instead of sending a cease and desist letter, Activision should thank the creators for dedicating countless hours to developing such an impressive mod for their game.</p>
<p>Consider the hundreds of thousands of dollars Activision has likely made thanks to this mod.</p>
<p>They should follow Rockstar's example with FiveM—a multiplayer mod created by players for players—and partner with H2M instead of fighting it. This is what the community wants.</p></blockquote>
<p>Best of luck with that, lads - although its hard to disagree with the sentiment. In other COD news, Activision are aiming to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-are-finally-cutting-down-call-of-dutys-horrendous-install-sizes-for-black-ops-6s-release">cut down the obscene install size for the next entry in the series. </a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Former team behind The Division: Heartland restructured.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Ubisoft has cut 45 staff across two of its North American studios, as part of its third round of redundancies so far this year.
</p>
<p>
The company has laid off workers at both Ubisoft San Francisco, the developer of XDefiant, and Red Storm Entertainment, which had been working on the now-cancelled The Division: Heartland live service game.
</p>
<p>
"Last week Ubisoft San Francisco and Red Storm Entertainment informed their teams of a restructuring that will result in 45 employees leaving Ubisoft," a spokesperson confirmed in a statement to Eurogamer.

<p>
"This difficult yet necessary decision was made to align these studios' organisations with their future business and development objectives. We are committed to providing comprehensive support to those affected, including severance and career assistance, and we thank them for their many contributions to Ubisoft."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-free-to-play-shooter-the-division-heartland-cancelled-three-years-after-being-announced">Ubisoft canned The Division: Heartland after more than three years' worth of work</a> back in May, when the publisher said it needed to refocus resources on "bigger oppurtunities". 
</p>
<p>
At the time, Ubisoft said it was moving some staff to work on San Francisco's XDefiant, as well as ongoing work on Rainbow Six. 
</p>
<p>
Back in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-lays-off-30-ubisoft-toronto-devs-so-it-can-deliver-on-its-ambitious-roadmap">Ubisoft laid off 33 staff at its Toronto studio</a> as part of a "targeted realignment". The company is currently working on the long-awaited Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake and Splinter Cell. A further <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-hit-with-another-wave-of-layoffs">45 workers were let go from Ubisoft's global publishing teams</a> in April.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft has repeatedly shrunk in size over the past couple of years as it grapples with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-ceo-admits-mario-rabbids-sequel-should-have-waited-for-next-nintendo-console">disappointing financial results</a> and searches for its next big hit. The company is doubling down on Assassin's Creed over the next few years, beginning with the arrival of Japan-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> in November, with several other games in the pipeline. The publisher also has Star Wars Outlaws set to arrive in just a couple of weeks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/19/check-out-two-new-trailers-for-silent-hill-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We have two new videos for the remake of Silent Hill 2 from Konami which will be landing on 8th October. The first is almost all cut scenes and gives you an idea of the story of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Story Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CMvrMTmuJuA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This second video is from footage from a preview event earlier this month in Japan. This is a preview build so may not be exactly the same as the final game, and the video focuses on the new features that are found in the game, as well as a decent look at combat which has also been enhanced. Just a quick note, the English captions are auto generated from the Japanese so they’re not perfect.</p>
<p><iframe title="【サイレントヒル2】『SILENT HILL 2』リメイク版の進化を体験。レッドピラミッドシング戦までの序盤を世界最速先行プレイ" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Ni3-2MmMF4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In development by Bloober Team, Silent Hill 2 is a big step up for the studio, but one that absolutely makes sense. They’re best known for their work on psychological horror games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/15/layers-of-fear-review-2/">Layers of Fear</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/19/observer-system-redux-review-ps5-series-x/">Observer</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/27/the-medium-review-xbox-series-x-pc/">The Medium</a>. That experience will be vital when updating a game made and designed for the limitations of the PlayStation 2 hardware in 2001.</p>

<p>In terms of the core gameplay, Silent Hill 2 will most noticeably be transformed by a shift away from fixed cameras and tank controls to over-the-shoulder and a more modern control scheme, similar to the treatment that Capcom gave to their Resident Evil remakes.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s also a massive leap forward graphically, with Bloober Team tapping into Unreal Engine 5 and all the cutting edge technology that this features like Lumen for realistic lighting effects and Nanite for exceptionally detailed 3D modelling and texturing.</p>
<p>It had been a while since Silent Hill 2 was first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/20/silent-hill-2-remake-is-using-unreal-engine-5-with-lumen-and-nanite-graphics/">announced back in 2022</a> – of course, it had been heavily rumoured for a good long time before then – but true to their word, it seems that development had been progressing smoothly in the time since then.</p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 will be released on 8th October 2024 for PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-hands-on-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ever since the release of the Resident Evil 2 remake, developers have returned to the well en masse to give their classic games a new lease of life, more often than not with mixed results. From what I’ve seen so far, the upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake doesn’t come close to hitting the heights of Resident Evil 2 – a blueprint for how a great remake is made – but it certainly feels like developer Bloober Team has made a lot of the right decisions when building on the survival horror classic’s undeniable legacy, even if at times it feels a little too safe.</p><p>I played the opening three hours of Silent Hill 2 and it was immediately apparent from the off that the remake gracefully captures all the important elements; an oppressive tone and straightforward game mechanics, even when the task itself is being obtuse. As with any Silent Hill game, atmosphere is king, and Silent Hill 2 immediately and consistently puts you into a state of unease. A thick fog surrounds the town like the original, now benefiting from modern lighting and volume thanks to today’s technical improvements. The streets are now filled with a new level of detail, shops are explorable, and strange sounds, cries, and groans are dynamically lurking around every corner.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The diegetic sounds of Silent Hill are where the game really sings, or rather, drones.</p></div><p>I can imagine it would have been incredibly tempting to layer music into the Silent Hill 2 remake, bringing the scares more in line with contemporary horror hits. But its slavish resistance is commendable, as the diegetic sounds of Silent Hill are where the game really sings, or rather, drones. Every room in the Wood Side Apartments creates its own version of uneasy tension, subtly assaulting you with an oppressive, unearthly soundscape of pulses and organic audio. From the moment protagonist James enters Silent Hill, the onslaught of bad vibes is present and never lets up for a second. Often fear is driven by anticipation, but Silent Hill 2 is <em>all</em> anticipation, with the sounds of the Lying Figures and co being ever-present. In some ways, it’s a difficult state of mind to be locked into.</p><p>It’s fair to say that Silent Hill 2 has stepped up its visual and audio game, but that’s to be expected for a 2024 release. The bigger and perhaps more impactful change is perspective, with Silent Hill 2 adopting the trusty over-the-shoulder playstyle that’s become a staple of the genre. What could have once been considered sacrilege for the series now serves the gameplay well, helping the unearthly combat encounters feel surprisingly familiar. Like the original, James’ arsenal is limited, with the only weapons available in the section I played being a handgun and his trusty wooden plank. Combat is certainly light and rudimentary, but Silent Hill 2 was never about that. It’s serviceable in a way that compliments the character’s ability – although I imagine it would have been extremely tempting for Bloober Team to strap James up Rambo-style, it would have been a disservice to the character and story it’s telling. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That’s not to say James doesn’t have a new move in his locker though. Silent Hill 2 implements a new dodge mechanic, allowing James to quickly dart out of the way of an enemy’s projectile vomit or Pyramid Head’s swinging blade. It’s a simple quick shuffle, not a Dark Souls-like forward roll, but it’s a tool that helped me to quickly establish a swing-swing-dodge rhythm before the Lying Figures threw up all their guts on me. Perhaps the biggest compliment I can give is that it’s a move that feels like it always should have been in Silent Hill 2.</p><p>From what I’ve seen so far the story is largely faithful, and I visited all the locations I expected to in the first few hours. The opening jaunt through the streets of Silent Hill is expanded, though, tasking you to solve a puzzle involving a jukebox in Neely’s Bar and forcing you to visit several of the town’s locations. Along the way, there’s plenty to examine further and marvel at the detail layered into this once sparse location. While purists might scoff at this addition, I feel it’s a smart move that encourages you to spend a little more time roaming the iconic, foggy streets. It’s a welcome addition before you spend a large portion of the game funnelled down dark hallways in a largely linear path. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>My usual urge to brute force the puzzles was quickly replaced by a wish to legitimately solve them.</p></div><p>Fans of the original will be happy to hear that the remake doesn’t hold back with its returning puzzles. Like the original, the remake scales clues based on your difficulty level ( you can individually choose how challenging both combat and puzzles are in the main menu, although I didn’t get to test out how this is implemented in-game), but even on the normal difficulty setting I found some puzzles momentary head-scratchers that encouraged me to truly absorb my surroundings, especially after hard switching from my ‘kill everything that moves’ head space. Fans of the 2001 classic and the Resident Evil series know exactly what kind of thing to expect – using environmental clues to solve riddles and combinations –  but it felt like there was a little less signposting in Silent Hill 2 than its peers. It’s hard for me to quantify this, but all I can say is my usual urge to brute force the puzzles was quickly replaced by a wish to legitimately solve them. Hopefully that speaks to the puzzle’s design and not the pressures of the play session’s environment. </p><p>Bloober Team’s decision-making when rebuilding this classic has been clever, but it’s not perfect. The dialogue and performances still feel too campy and silly for my taste, often taking me out of the super serious tone. Unlike Resident Evil, where the campy nature is a big part of the vibe, Silent Hill in 2024 requires a subtle touch to complement the same masterful approach in atmosphere and sound design. Purists might celebrate its faithful remaking of the original’s lines, but I felt there was an opportunity here for some subtle rewrites and tweaks. I only got a small taste of the dialogue though, and Silent Hill 2 isn’t exactly known for its long conversations, so perhaps it’s not any kind of deal breaker.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Silent Hill 2 Remake</h3></div></output><p>Another irksome inclusion is the logical, but slightly tedious activity of opening countless kitchen cupboards and drawers to collect handgun ammo and healing items, similar to modern games like The Last of Us. It makes sense on paper, organically placing your collectible items in realistic locations, but I can’t help but feel the process took me out of the atmosphere, altering my thought process from fear to loot every time I entered a new room. Maybe it says more about me than the game, but several times after entering a room I was jumped by a hidden mannequin because I had prioritised scouring for pick-ups instead of enemies. </p><p>Disappointingly, from what I’ve seen so far Silent Hill 2 doesn’t appear to incorporate my favourite feature the best remakes tend to have: Taking your expectations based on what you know about the original and subverting them. 2002’s Resident Evil Remake, which played around with the ‘dogs jumping through the window’ jump scare that all fans expected, is the perfect example of how this can be expertly crafted. The approach allows for the tension of a fake out, and the creative space to drop new scares where you least expect it. This Silent Hill 2 remake doesn’t appear to have any real moments like that and, ultimately, no real big swings that change the landscape for hardcore fans. At least not in the opening three hours. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As a remake, Silent Hill 2 falls more in line with BluePoint’s faithful Shadow of the Colossus rather than Capcom’s rejuvenated Resident Evil 2. It substitutes bold new swings for a slavish dedication to the original, which is by no means a bad thing, just not the radical step some might expect. Silent Hill 2 certainly needed a fresh coat of paint and a tune of the engine, and Bloober Team has provided that in spades, but everything else is an extremely faithful reimagining that mostly resists the urge to alter the successful formula of a stone-cold classic.</p><p><em>Dale Driver is IGN's Executive Producer of Video Programming.

            <p>New week, same old terror of that cyclopean glutton known as the Maw emerging from its cosmic bolthole and swallowing the entirety of Devon. As ever, we have a way of thwarting the Maw's advance, and it's... pasta sauce? Graham, why is there pasta sauce in the Trello? Have Ziff Davis subfranchised us to Dolmio? Oh, I'm sorry! That's just my shopping list. What I meant to say was: new video games! Video games (PC games, specifically) are the only thing that can preoccupy the Maw, the only thing newsworthy enough to distract it from the tempting clifftop maisonettes of Torquay. Let's see what the week has in store for us, eh.</p><!--more-->
<p>Monday 19th August is a quieter one, but my eye is drawn to the early access launch of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1116170/CyberCorp/">Cybercorp</a>, a top-down looter-shooter that might amuse fans of The Ascent. Tuesday 20th August is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth Wukong</a> Day, but you might also be keen on misfit words-are-weapons roadtrip <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dustborn">Dustborn</a>. On Wednesday 21st August, a balance of the airily winsome, the sorrowfully puzzling and the seductively monstrous in the shape of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mika-and-the-witchs-mountain">Mika And The Witch's Mountain</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1791590/Sunset_Hills/">Sunset Hills</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-lovely-empress">My Lovely Empress</a>. On Thursday 22nd August, it's all about spells of defenestration in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tactical-breach-wizards">Tactical Breach Wizards</a>. And on Friday 23rd August, it's all about heroes shooting heroes in Sony's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>.</p>
<p>You can read of yet more video games and related happenings in our weekly news liveblog, below. And now, the traditional Mawpost ending ceremony of stating that there are probably a bunch of cool PC games out this week that I've left out of the round-up, which you should sneeringly mention in the comments so that I can spend the day feeling bad about myself, questioning my life choices, and downing the Dolmio by the flagon. Have a jolly week.</p><div data-live="true">

            <p>
When Bloober and Konami announced that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">remaking Silent Hill 2</a> as part of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/every-new-silent-hill-project-announced-including-the-silent-hill-2-remake">comprehensive series reboot</a>, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.</p>
<p>Still, the decision to 'skip' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill">the first game in the series</a>, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"I think Silent Hill 2 just matches our DNA way better," Lenart began. "It's much more emotional, a much more personal story than, for example, the first game or the third game. And we at Bloober were always fans of telling personal stories about people's experiences, people's feelings and how they go through them. Not so much about, you know know, occultism and things from other worlds, right? So I think that was the main reason, basically."
</p>
<p>
Some context: without giving too much away, the original Silent Hill is more of a supernatural affair, with your character Harry swept up in various diabolical doings, though it's also a work of psychological projection. The sequel switches priorities, placing a sorely disquieted brain at the centre, though it keeps one foot in that lineage of occultism. 
</p>
<p>
Lenart added that Bloober prefers to tell stories that are similarly "grounded" and focussed. "Obviously [our games] feature some supernatural elements, but in the end it's all about a specific person, on a specific journey that they need to make to find out the truth about themselves."
</p>
<p>
Of course, the choice of which Silent Hill game to tackle was broadly out of Bloober's hands. "Yeah, Silent Hill 2 is the best match for us as Bloober Team, in terms of our DNA and the games that we've done and that we did previously," Glomb agreed. "On the other hand, it's not like we were making this decision, right? The franchise is connected to Konami's plans.
</p>
<p>
"So we had this proposition, probably because of our DNA, our backgrounds with Silent Hill 2. And we were very glad to do this version of the game, just because it fits our feelings. Even in our previous games, we were so inspired by Silent Hill 2 in more specific aspects - in Layers Of Fear, which is a completely different game, but having those different endings, it was inspired by Silent Hill 2. Having those small things during the game where we don't tell you that it'll lead to a different ending."
</p>
<p>
As I said, if I were a canny Konami exec, I would probably greenlight Silent Hill 2 for the remake treatment before any of the others. As a player, however, I'm curious to know how Bloober's remake will land with people who haven't played the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game that started the ball rolling. It's still my favourite of the Hills, and Silent Hill 2 is a richer play for understanding how it responds to the original game - what it preserves, what it rejects.</p>
<p>While there has been a "remake" of sorts in the shape of Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, the first Silent Hill lives on today mostly in the shape of the retro horror scene: its PS1 graphics and visual direction have become a distinct aesthetic, evolving alongside the hi-fi photorealism of later Silent Hill sequels. I guess we'll always have <a href="https://itch.io/games/in-jam/tag-silent-hill">Itch.io</a>.

<section><p>After spending about three hours with Silent Hill 2 Remake, I feel confident the puzzle-driven horror game will honor the original's tones and excite old fans while also creating plenty of new ones.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There is no genre quite like horror. At its best, it's so much more than guts and gore, or tired tropes and torture scenes. It's self-reflection. It's catharsis.</p><p dir="ltr">It's entering an implicit agreement with a work's creator: If you spill your guts out to me (metaphorically <em>or </em>perhaps literally), then I will wade through my own, hold them up, and take note of what makes ours similar to one another. While there are certainly qualities that make for a "good" work of horror, the transcendent variety is subjective; it relies on your own fears, traumas, and beliefs to create resonance with what's laid before you. The more vulnerable a work is, the greater its opportunity to connect with--or possibly alienate--its audience. This is precisely what makes Silent Hill 2 such a memorable and pivotal entry in the horror game genre--it's sheer vulnerability creates a game wherein even alienation <em>feels</em> like connection.</p><p dir="ltr">I say all this to emphasize that the upcoming remake of this 23 year-old game is an incredibly exciting prospect to me. Though the original holds up well, there's no denying that it feels quite dated--and not always in an endearing, "time capsule" kind of way. There's also no denying that the game is incredibly influential; its DNA is woven into countless horror games and horror-adjacent titles, with last year's Alan Wake 2 proving that, even decades later, this continues to be true. This ultimately elevates Silent Hill 2's status from "great game" to a "genre essential," albeit one that is frustrating to play--or even simply access--at the moment. A remake, then, seems entirely warranted.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352147-jhry6e-e.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352147" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352147-jhry6e-e.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352147"></a><figcaption>James approaches an enemy in the fog.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352147-jhry6e-e.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, following Konami's recent treatment of the Silent Hill series--and production partner Bloober's own perceived missteps--many have wondered if the company truly has a grasp on what makes Silent Hill 2 so special and whether it can effectively remake it. It's a fair question, especially after a handful of less-than-impressive trailers. And it's one I kept in mind as I spoke to some of Konami and Bloober's lead developers and played about three hours of the Silent Hill 2 remake at Konami's Tokyo headquarters. While brief conversations and my jaunt through the game's opening hours (including the infamous Wood Side Apartments) can't make for a complete answer, what I saw left me impressed; assuming the game's tone remains in place and that what I played is a proper indication of what's to come, the upcoming remake could be an exceptional and reverent experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Reverence was a consistent feeling throughout my playthrough, as Silent Hill 2 is an <em>incredibly </em>faithful adaptation helmed by a mix of the original game's key developers--who repeatedly expressed their own awe at the game a group of young, scrappy developers managed to pull off--and fresh faces who cite Silent Hill 2 as among their greatest inspirations. I was pleased to note that the game didn't feel entirely reconstructed or reinterpreted as a means to satisfy perceived modern demands, nor does it feel swayed by the urge to add in more jump scares, viscera, or plain ol' <em>content. </em>The game begins the same way it always has , with James examining himself in a derelict bathroom mirror and explaining, somewhat chillingly, what brings him to Silent Hill. James' new voice actor Luke Roberts nails the delivery of this and every one of his monologues, managing to sound both Completely Normal while also slightly… off. Breathy. Dissociative.</p><p dir="ltr">As he makes his way down the winding, fog-drenched footpath that leads to Silent Hill, he passes a familiar red symbol--one of those long-forgotten save points that, yes, remain <em>vital</em> and are the only form of saving progress in the remake. James then offers the same strange, meta remark he did in the original game: "Looking at this makes me feel like someone's groping around inside my skull." Though it seems a small thing to be excited by, the game's retention of these minor, surreal situations. ("There was a hole here. It's gone now." is another that comes to mind and is still present) feels like proof that the team understands how these quiet moments ultimately establish a more extreme level of dread than a high-fidelity Pyramid Head jumpscare might.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352150-hole.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352150" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352150-hole.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352150"></a><figcaption>James examines a window covered in newspapers. It reads: There was a hold here. It's gone now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352150-hole.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In fact, just the sheer retention of the game's opening slow burn feels like a triumph. According to Bloober Team's Maciej Glomg, the lead producer of Silent Hill 2 Remake, the team <em>did</em> attempt to develop a faster-paced opening to the game before realizing it simply didn't feel right. Silent Hill 2 earns and relies upon the way its opening minutes--and the grotesque creatures found within them--crawl.</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, the team repeatedly noted that Silent Hill 2 is "not a combat-oriented game." It is not fast-paced. It is not punchy. The same can be said for its remake, which improves upon combat by making things a bit more fluid and adding an extremely helpful dodge button and an aiming reticle, but does not necessarily overhaul the overall experience. For some, this could be frustrating, as it still has a light dusting of PS2 jank, for lack of a better term, that something like the Resident Evil remakes have more or less done away with. However, I found that the remake's combat actually feels perfectly in service to the rest of the game. Part of what makes Silent Hill 2 as terrifying as it is are those small bursts of panic and tension that arise from its cumbersome combat; the remake seems to accept and build upon this, taking away the more unruly and frustrating aspects of combat while letting the game retain its sense of friction. Combat feels solid in Silent Hill 2, but it's not at the forefront.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, the team being so forthcoming about that means that combat is treated truly as a secondary part and doesn't feel awkwardly pushed to the front and promoted only for it to feel less polished than your average survival horror game in 2024. Another way they emphasize this within the game is by retaining the remaster's choice to separate the combat and puzzle difficulty settings, allowing you to fine-tune your experience and select what level you wish to engage your brain or brawn. It's also worth noting that the main menu contains an impressive amount of accessibility options; we're talking pages of them. Whether a player has visual, auditory, or motor impairments--or merely likes to be able to tweak a robust amount of playstyle preferences--the option to do so probably exists in Silent Hill 2's remake. You can change the color and boldness of your reticle, alter the game's color palette to adjust for multiple types of color blindness, set text to account for dyslexia, and more. This is just another way Silent Hill 2 emphasizes constant, meaningful upgrades rather than embracing complete AAA modernity at any cost.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352144-pyramid.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352144" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352144-pyramid.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352144"></a><figcaption>James points his pistol at an approaching Pyramid Head.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352144-pyramid.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Of course I can't gloss over the most drastic of all these changes: the game's visuals. With the recent and ongoing wave of remasters, remakes, and the like, the number one thing I ask myself when playing one of them is, "Does this feel like an attempt to make things sleek and modern, or did they successfully create the bridge between what was once there and how my imagination expanded it when I played it years ago?" The Silent Hill 2 remake does the latter, and it does it exceedingly well. And this was a welcome surprise, considering how rough some of the trailers published by Konami and Bloober look.</p><p dir="ltr">The Silent Hill 2 remake is a gorgeous game that doesn't abandon the grime, grotesquerie, and yes, fog, that made the original game so mesmerizing. In fact, it regularly amps it up. Locations are expanded upon, with a handful of new buildings and eerie shops to walk through and plenty of smaller details and objects that make the world seem more grounded in reality--even if that reality is one of horrific isolation. Neely's Bar, for example, no longer feels like merely a small, derelict cube, but looks like an actual abandoned bar. And, as you stumble upon notes from off-kilter former residents, these locations transform into places with greater meaning.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352142-bar.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352142" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352142-bar.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352142"></a><figcaption>James examines the counter at Neely's Bar.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352142-bar.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">And yet everything still <em>feels </em>the same. It still <em>feels</em> like Silent Hill. Suffocating. A place where the air feels tainted by a tangy, metallic scent and its people, hellish cerebral forces. Though there was some uncertainty around the game's character models, those I encountered--while not on the same level as the game's environments--looked surprisingly good. Though Angela's appearance in trailers seemed a bit off, to put it lightly, I found that her movements and VO were not particularly jarring in game. And yet, what impressed me more than anything I've listed so far was the game's music and audio.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Silent Hill 2 composer Akira Yamaoka, creating a new yet reminiscent soundtrack for Silent Hill 2 Remake was incredibly important to him; however, doing so proved to be not only a difficult process, but an impossible one. Yamaoka said he tried repeatedly to enter the same mindset he was in when he composed the original title's music; mid-20s and "financially unstable," he added with a laugh. He recounted how he didn't own a bass guitar at the time of recording, meaning he was resigned to tuning his guitar extremely low to create the same effect.</p><p dir="ltr">Yamaoka admitted that there was no going back to that space; that that younger version of himself felt foreign to him now. And yet, none of that was apparent when I listened to his new take on the iconic soundtrack. Though the game's music has been reworked, it feels familiar, with its iconic motifs wrapped in all-new layers of dissonance, static, synth, and intensity. And along with the new music is a focus on 3D "depth-oriented sound direction," meaning steps, scrapes, creaks, moans, and shrieks feels even more unsettling (though remarkably more helpful, as well).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352145-james.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352145" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352145-james.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352145"></a><figcaption>James approached a pair of wooden double doors. The room is tinted red and filled with cages.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352145-james.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">While tracks I heard felt similar to what already existed, everything feels a bit deeper now, a bit darker. And it works incredibly well. As danger encroaches out on the streets of South East Vale, sharp, abrupt, and dissonant chords get your heart beating faster. In especially tense situations, the sound takes on a life of its own; it feels like it is breathing alongside you. As you approach Pyramid Head for the first time, his hulking frame staring blankly from behind a set of bars, the synth and accompanying static are horrifying. Despite him doing <em>nothing</em>, it was the scariest portion of the already frightening preview.</p><p dir="ltr">In short, I was incredibly impressed by the time I spent with Silent Hill 2 Remake. It is surreal, cerebral, horrifying, and grotesque--all of the things that made the original title such a remarkable title not only for Konami, but for the horror genre as well. Considering I was resigned to the game's beginning hours (and it's worth nothing here that I'd estimate we're looking at a 8 or so hour experience in total based on what I managed to accomplish within the three or so we were given), it's hard to tell if the game will nail its tone and message; if certain plot twists will remain as vile and unnerving and the studio will fully commit to creating a suffocating, psychological hell above all else. But after my time with Silent Hill 2 Remake--and after months of witnessing the internet (and myself) hem and haw on whether or not this Remake even has the capacity to be great--I am no longer on the fence. I am thrilled the wait for the full experience is almost over, and will be brushing up on my bravery until the game launches on October 8.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NZXT Capsule Review: Low-Cost, Crystal-Clear Microphone]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nzxt-capsule-review-microphone/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nzxt-capsule-review-low-cost-crystal-clear-microphone.956469/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nzxt-capsule-review-microphone/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I’ve been using the NZXT Capsule for a few weeks and have finally pulled together enough experience with it to assemble a full review. I picked it up from NZXT with open expectations after moving across from the HyperX Quadcast, which had been a capable microphone for me for four years.</p>



<p>I wasn’t sure if the low price point was representative of the quality of the NZXT Capsule, but now I believe that the company isn’t charging enough for his stellar peripheral. </p>



<p>Read on to check out this full NZXT Capsule review before you buy the microphone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-seriously-heavy-stuff">Seriously Heavy Stuff</h2>



<p>The NZXT Capsule is a cardioid-based USB microphone designed to stand upright on a desk or attach to a boom arm – which NZXT also sells. At just $59.99, the NZXT Capsule is one of the most affordable microphones on the market, coming in at less than half the price of the HyperX Quadcast S.</p>



<p>Out of the box, the NZXT Capsule looks <strong>very </strong>attractive. It’s available in either solid white or solid black, and everything from the build of the base unit itself to the uncompromising, shock-resistant desk stand feels premium. It has a nice braided cable in the box and a few adapters, just in case you want to mount it to a boom arm.</p>



<p>One of the things that surprised me the most was the weight of the microphone with the desk stand attached – it’s <strong>heavy</strong>. That translates nicely into a more ‘expensive feel’ for the unit, which is made of tough, resilient plastic and aluminium. On the face of the microphone sits two dials, one to control the voice volume and another to control the volume of a headset.</p>



<p>That second dial is important, as it leans into another feature – you can run a headset <strong>through </strong>the NZXT Capsule.</p>



<p>With a quick-release implementation, solid cardioid microphone pattern, and crystal-clear audio capabilities, the NZXT Capsule could be the Quadcast killer we’ve been waiting for. On stream, my viewers noted that it sounds much better than the Quadcast, and the built-in shielding does a stronger job of masking background noise.</p>



<p>I can’t find much of a fault with <a href="https://nzxt.com/en-GB/product/capsule#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the NZXT Capsule</a>. I was going to suggest that it’s perhaps <strong>too big</strong>, but there’s a Mini version available if you’re limited on space. I can wholeheartedly recommend giving the NZXT Capsule a shot if you’re a streamer looking for a solid microphone.</p>



<p>You’d hardly believe it has been on the market since September 2021 – it’s brilliant.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Zotac Gaming Zone Handheld Available to Preorder Now]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/zotac-gaming-zone-preorder-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zotac-gaming-zone-handheld-available-to-preorder-now.956463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/zotac-gaming-zone-preorder-now/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Zotac Gaming is the latest hardware manufacturer to break into the handheld gaming market. It has just been revealed that the ‘Zotac Gaming Zone’ is available to preorder. Zotac unveiled the Zone at Computex 2024 in June, announcing its intention to enter the growing handheld gaming race.</p>



<p>This means that the Zotac Gaming Zone will start to compete with the likes of the ROG Ally, the Lenovo Legion Go, Steam Deck, and MSI Claw.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-next-generation">Next Generation</h2>



<p>The Zotac Gaming Zone is a fine contender compared to the current market leaders. It boasts an AMD Ryzen 7 8840U with RDNA 3 graphics and Zen 4 architecture for maximum gaming power. It enters the running with 16 GB of LPDDR5X-7500 RAM, which means it’s half as capable in that respect as the ROG Ally X released just weeks ago.</p>



<p>Out of the box, the Zotac Gaming Zone features a full HD AMOLED display, which is the best screen currently available in the realm of handhelds. It will be capable of putting out a 120Hz refresh rate and is rated at 800nits of brightness, which edges out the ROG Ally X and the new MSI Claw.</p>



<p>It’s perhaps restricted slightly by the 512 GB NVMe SSD, but it does have a UHS-II microSD card reader for expansions.</p>



<p>Perhaps where the Zotac Gaming Zone shines the brightest is in the overall build of the unit and the controls. It features a few innovations that are sure to make it stand out among the competition:</p>



<ul>
<li>Drift-resistant analog sticks</li>



<li>Hall-effect triggers with two-stage adjustment</li>



<li>Radial dials around the sticks for on-the-fly tweaking</li>



<li>Dual trackpads (like the Steam Deck)</li>



<li>Dual USB ports rated for rapid charging</li>



<li>Front-facing camera and onboard microphone</li>
</ul>



<p>All that and it also has a touch of RGB to really impress the gamer in you.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed how much the Zotac Gaming Zone will cost, but it’s expected to retail for around $800. It was recently announced that the Zone will be playable at Gamescom, so we’ll be hands-on with the device later this week.</p>

They have a secret—in this school, there is a war that only they’re able to fight in. It is called the “Suuransen (Number War).” Since the olden days, this periodically-fought war has been determining the rankings of the Suuke, as well as selecting a “Soyogi” who leads and controls the Suuke. This war was thought to never take place again after one number broke away. However, since the sudden re-emergence of “the number that should not exist,” the conditions for the Suuransen to be held have now been met… “When the time comes in which the ten numbers assemble, The carved seal shall guide you to the field of battle.” Her name is Reisaki Hiroka. She is the one who signals the beginning and the end.
