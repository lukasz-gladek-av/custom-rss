<p>Following the immense success of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2‚Äôs advanced access launch, which garnered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-already-has-over-130000-concurrent-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 130,000 players in a single day</a>, people have their eyes on the studio behind the game. Who is Saber Interactive? What other games did the Space Marine 2 developer create? Let‚Äôs dive in and find out!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-saber-interactive">Who is Saber Interactive?</h2>



<p>Saber Interactive is an American video game developer founded in 2001 by Andrey Iones, Mathew Karch, and Anton Krupkin. Today, they employ more than 1,350 people and work on numerous projects, including Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, John Carpenter‚Äôs Toxic Commando, and RoadCraft.</p>



<p>Back in the day, the studio handcrafted a 3D game engine for its first title, Will Rock, before moving on to TimeShift in 2007.</p>



<p>In 2016, the studio expanded outside its internal studio in Russia to Madrid, Sweden, and Belarus. Since then, with immense success, they‚Äôve partnered with 343 Industries, CD Projekt RED, and numerous other high-profile developers and publishers in the industry.</p>

The gifts will be doled out to players who log in to the FPS, starting with 100 XCoins on September 9.

                <p>Remedy recently announced that a coming update for Alan Wake will <a href="https://x.com/alanwake/status/1831739167392272866" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remove</a> the classic David Bowie song Space Oddity from the game, replacing it with the original song Strange Moons, penned by Remedy composer Petri Alanko. However, it seems that this update will not affect Alan Wake Remastered, which came out in 2021.</p><p>Arguably one of Bowie's best-known songs, the galactic rock song that features the iconic line "ground control to Major Tom" originally played over Alan Wake's closing credits. Though we don't know what Strange Moons will sound like yet, composer Alanko <a href="https://x.com/Peppepappa/status/1831740963368108257" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on X/Twitter</a> that a part of the song was originally included in an Alan Wake level that was cut prior to the game's final release.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Alan Wake Full Story Recap</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Music licenses often cause game developers to have to update or even delist their games years after release due to expiring legal contracts. Perhaps the best-known recent example is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spec-ops-the-line-delisting-reason-revealed-director-comments-on-removal/1100-6520743/">Spec Ops: The Line</a>, which was delisted from Steam due to "several partnership licenses related to the game‚Ä¶expiring." While it's not clear if these are related to music licenses, it's a shame that one of the most critically acclaimed shooters of the early 2010s is no longer available for the next generations of players to enjoy. Alan Wake 2's latest DLC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-night-springs-dlcs-genre-bending-trailer-reveals-surprise-launch-this-week/1100-6524028/">Night Springs</a>, released back in June.</p><p dir="ltr">Remedy recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-and-annapurna-strike-a-deal-to-expand-control-and-alan-wake-franchises/1100-6526191/" data-ref-id="1100-6526191">struck a deal</a> with Annapurna to co-finance and self-publish Control 2, and that may result in the production of films or TV shows based on the Control and Alan Wake franchises.</p>

That‚Äôs only because everybody I know has one and desperately wants a new console to replace their aging system. While you wait, why not boot up that relic and pick up a game from its massive library? Nintendo is currently discounting some of its titles as part of a blockbuster sale, and there are a range of diverse games to pick from depending on the mood you‚Äôre in or the genre you‚Äôre looking for. </p></div><div><p>This series remains the most unorthodox crossover in the world, but they are also some of the most brilliantly accessible tactics games too! Both games are also scored by Grant Kirkhope, a composer most known for his work on classics like <em>Donkey Kong 64 </em>and <em>Goldeneye 007</em>. The <em>Mario + Rabbids </em>games are exactly the kind of weird risks I wish more big publishers would take with their most famous properties. I don‚Äôt have a particular preference between <em>Sparks of Hope </em>and its predecessor, <em>Kingdom Battle</em>, but I‚Äôll err on the side of the most recent title, which does away with some of the more rigid and conservative systems of the first to make for a wild strategy game.<strong> </strong>It‚Äôs also the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-voice-charles-martinet-nintendo-64-galaxy-1850757371&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-voice-charles-martinet-nintendo-64-galaxy-1850757371">last game to feature Charles Martinet</a></span>, the longtime voice of Mario, as the character, if you‚Äôre the sentimental type. <strong>You can give Mario a gun by picking up <em>Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope </em>for $19.79.</strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/prince-persia-lost-crown-review-accessible-metroidvania-1851174187&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/prince-persia-lost-crown-review-accessible-metroidvania-1851174187"><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em></a></span><em> </em>is one of maybe two Switch games I‚Äôve managed to play this year, but it definitely started 2024 on a great note. I loved the PS2 games, but didn‚Äôt know at the time that they were reimaginings of a 2D platformer series that‚Äôd been around forever. Given how dormant the franchise was throughout the late ‚Äò00s and all of the ‚Äò10s, it was exciting to see it come back to life as this excellent Metroidvania that gave some hope to younger and older fans alike. <em>The Lost Crown </em>is a stunning return to form, complete with gorgeous visuals, a slick movement and combat system with depth if you look for it, and a confident puzzle game in spots too. It is also, crucially, a game that you can complete in the span of a weekend on your couch snuggled up with your favorite handheld. <strong>Hack-and-slash your way backwards and forwards in time with </strong><em><strong>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown </strong></em><strong>for $24.</strong></p></div><div><p>Kotaku is home to a few <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tag/persona&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tag/persona"><em>Persona</em></a></span><em> </em>marks, so I have to recommend that you pick up the trio of games that are currently on sale on the Switch. The<em> Persona Collection</em> features <em>Persona 3 Portable</em>, <em>Persona 4 Golden</em>, and <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>, meaning you‚Äôre getting something pretty close to the definitive versions of each of those titles for a more-than-fair price. <em>P3P</em>, despite its constraints, features the series‚Äô only female protagonist, and <em>P4G </em>and <em>P5R </em>both contain new expanded final chapters that most fans love. Each one of those titles will cost you at least 50 hours to complete. The base version of <em>Persona 5 </em>alone took me 105 hours.<strong> For just $45, you too can experience the highs and lows of Japanese teenagedom while saving the world from destructive supernatural forces in the</strong><em><strong> Persona Collection.</strong></em></p></div><div><p><em>Monster Hunter </em>is blowing the fuck up right now thanks to the meteoric success of <em>Monster Hunter World </em>and the anticipation that‚Äôs building for next year‚Äôs <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-1851633107&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-1851633107"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a></span>. There‚Äôs a middle child between them that is often overlooked despite its excellence though, and that‚Äôs <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>. Often viewed as a bit of a step back from the scope of <em>World</em>, <em>Rise </em>initially launched on the Switch, meaning it was largely designed for the hybrid console. To that end, it‚Äôs a much faster game than either of the titles that bookend it, which might make it more appealing for playing on the go, or from the comfort of your bed. <em>Sunbreak</em>, its lone expansion, is massive, and that‚Äôs without taking into consideration the number of additions made to the base game through title updates leading up to its release. <strong>You can grab the utterly massive </strong><em><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong></em><strong>, as well as its expansion, for just $20.</strong></p></div><div><p>The Switch has earned a reputation as the party console. Many systems feature games that can be busted out during gatherings, but I don‚Äôt think many have the murderers‚Äô row of titles that the Switch has. In terms of first-party games alone, it has <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, </em>several <em>Mario Party </em>titles, <em>Warioware: Move It! </em>and <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, which is about what any real party even needs. If you‚Äôre having some difficulty getting people up and moving, or you just want to make everyone look ridiculous, <em>Just Dance </em>is the move. I love <em>Just Dance</em>, and I would play any incarnation, no matter how sober I am. You cannot put a price on the joy of drunkenly pulling three of your friends into a dance number set to the theme of <em>Tetris </em>and being the orange L-block that then gets lifted by the other dancers. <strong>However, you can put a great price on the deluxe edition of </strong><em><strong>Just Dance</strong></em><strong> 2024 which is going for $31.49. If you pick it up, you get four months of the </strong><em><strong>Just Dance+ </strong></em><strong>subscription, which gives you access to the entire catalog of dances through the years. </strong>You will not regret this choice.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pentiment-on-playstation-and-nintendo-switch-1851278458&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pentiment-on-playstation-and-nintendo-switch-1851278458"><em>Pentiment</em></a></span><em> </em>is my favorite game of 2022. It is one of the most moving stories I‚Äôve ever experienced in one of the most artfully rendered worlds in the medium. The game‚Äôs protagonist, Andreas Maler, is never far from my thoughts, and neither is the wildly memorable cast that fills town of Tassing, where the game takes place. Set against the backdrop of a recent spree of murders, you are tasked with solving the mysteries plaguing the townsfolk and local abbey, all while interrogating your neighbors and close friends. <em>Pentiment</em> is developed by Obsidian, a studio best known for RPGs like <em>Fallout: New Vegas </em>and <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, and this game keeps some of that alive within the trappings of a more straightforward adventure game to add some mechanical depth and further characterization to its nuanced story and cast. <em><strong>Pentiment</strong></em><strong> is a sterling example of what games </strong><em><strong>could </strong></em><strong>and should be, and it can be yours for $12.</strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Cyberpunk 2077 from developer CD Projekt Red had a challenging start when it was released in December 2020--the issues were so bad that Sony removed the game from sale entirely on the PlayStation Store. But the game rebounded in a very meaningful way and went on to become a critical and a commercial success. In fact, following the 2.0 update and release of the Phantom Liberty expansion, it's one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-rebuilds-its-gameplay-to-make-a-fantastic-rpg/1100-6517704/" data-ref-id="1100-6517704">best comeback stories in modern times for games.</a></p><p dir="ltr">With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-much-cyberpunk-2077-has-earned-so-far/1100-6522250/" data-ref-id="1100-6522250">more than 25 million units sold</a>, it's one of the most successful video games in history. Naturally, CD Projekt Red is moving ahead with a sequel that's in development right now at one of the team's newest studios.</p><p dir="ltr">In this post, we're rounding up everything we know so far about the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, which doesn't have an official title as of yet and is in the works under the working title Project Orion.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, CD Projekt is working on The Witch 4, a remake of the original Witcher, a new IP, and more--the studio is very busy.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When will Cyberpunk 2077 sequel be released?</h2><p>This is a big unknown. So far, CD Projekt Red and upper management at the Polish studio have spoken in broad strokes about Cyberpunk 2077 and have shied away from specifics. Management has not provided even a release window, or a target, for the game. This is not unusual, though, as the game is no doubt still early in development. For context, Cyberpunk 2077 was announced in 2012 and wouldn't be released until eight years later. So fans should get comfortable as they await the sequel.</p><h2>Preorder Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</h2><p>Preorders for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel are not open yet, and if you see any retailer taking orders this early, you should not give them your money or information.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4363241-cyberpunk2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363241" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4363241-cyberpunk2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363241"></a><figcaption>A scene from Cyberpunk 2077</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4363241-cyberpunk2.jpg"></figure><h2>Cyberpunk 2077 sequel trailer information</h2><p>Cyberpunk 2077's sequel has no trailer or even any concept art as of yet. Rest assured, as soon as we get information on art or video for Cyberpunk 2077's sequel, we'll bring it to you.</p><h2>Cyberpunk 2077 sequel platforms</h2><p>Platforms for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel have not been confirmed, but CD Projekt has a history of supporting both PC and console. The studio operates its own PC storefront, GOG, which offers games without DRM. It's likely that would be the case for Cyberpunk 2077's sequel as well, though this is not confirmed as of yet.</p><h2>Cyberpunk 2077 sequel story, setting, and characters</h2><p>Unfortunately, there is basically nothing to go on in terms of specifics for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel at this stage pertaining to its story, settings, and characters. Fans can reasonably assume, however, that it'll be another RPG set in the future. It will also be "uniquely American," which follows on from the news that the game is being developed by CD Projekt's new team in Boston.</p><p>"I think Cyberpunk is obviously a uniquely American story," acting executive producer Dan Hernberg explained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBpEDCZMvo">an episode of the AnsweRED podcast</a>. "It's got a lot of like, punk energy, and [the tabletop game] was written by an American, so it just seems right to do it in America."</p><h2>Cyberpunk 2077 sequel game engine</h2><p>In 2022, CD Projekt shocked some fans by announcing it would abandon its own internal engine, Red Engine, and instead partner with Epic Games to use the company's Unreal Engine 5 for its future projects.</p><p>CTO Pawel Zawodny said Unreal Engine 5's updates help with the kind of open-world game development that the Polish studio is known for, and this was a major selling point. "This opens a new chapter for us, where we really want to see how our experience building open-world games is combined with the engineering power of Epic," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-explains-why-its-using-unreal-engine-5/1100-6502196/" data-ref-id="1100-6502196">Zawodny said.</a></p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4363244-cyberpunk1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363244" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4363244-cyberpunk1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363244"></a><figcaption>Cyberpunk 2077.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4363244-cyberpunk1.jpg"></figure><h2>Who's developing Cyberpunk 2077 sequel?</h2><p>CD Projekt Red is developing Cyberpunk 2077's sequel. Specifically, the company's newest office in Boston, Massachusetts is leading development on the game. A number of staffers from the first Cyberpunk 2077 relocated to Boston to work on the sequel, including Igor Sarzy≈Ñski, the narrative director for Cyberpunk 2077 and Project Orion.</p><p>"I couldn't be more excited for this project and I'm sure we can make it something special. 2077 was just a warm-up," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-is-looking-to-be-something-special-dev-says/1100-6520213/#:~:text=Project%20Orion%20currently%20has%20no%20release%20date.&amp;text=CDPR%20has%20officially%20started%20to,ll%20be%20%22something%20special.%22" data-ref-id="1100-6520213">Sarzy≈Ñski said on social media earlier this year</a>.</p><p>CD Projekt's team in Vancouver is also working on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, and the company's network of other global studios may contribute to its development as well. The game's director is Gabe Amatangelo, who was the game director on Cyberpunk 2077's popular Phantom Liberty expansion.</p><h2>Cyberpunk 2077 sequel development news</h2><p>As of February 2024, the Cybperunk 2077 sequel was in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-gets-an-update-on-how-its-coming-along/1100-6520849/" data-ref-id="1100-6520849">"early stages of development,"</a> CD Projekt said in a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cyberpunk-2077-follow-up-codenamed-project-orion-grows-in-strength-at-cd-projekt-red-north-america/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">news release</a>. The team working on the game includes a number of senior staffers from the original game, including Gabriel Amatangelo (game director), Pawe≈Ç Sasko (associate game director), Igor Sarzy≈Ñski (creative director), Andrzej Stopa (cinematic director), Kacper Niepok√≥lczycki (environment art director), Sarah Gr√ºmmer (acting lead quest designer), and Kacper Ko≈õcie≈Ñski (engineering director).</p><p>As for people who joined the Boston studio to work on the sequel, these include former lead product manager at Blizzard, Dan Hernberg, who is an executive producer on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel; IO Interactive and Massive Entertainment's Ryan Barnard as design director; and Mortal Kombat technical director Alan Villani, who is engineering director on the Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up.</p><p>Additionally, writer Anna Megill (Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Guild Wars 2, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora) is joining the Cyberpunk sequel as its lead writer. Megill also worked on the narrative elements for Microsoft's upcoming Fable game. Finally, novelist and comic book writer Alexander Freed is working on the writing for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel. Freed was previously a lead writer at BioWare on Star Wars: The Old Republic, and he also wrote or consulted for DICE, Obsidian, and Wizards of the Coast.</p><p>Pawel Sasko, the associate director of the next Cyberpunk game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-aims-to-retain-the-whole-dna-of-first-game/1100-6522708/" data-ref-id="1100-6522708">said</a> he's interested in expanding on the concept of reactivity that was more of a focus in Phantom Liberty, which he worked on as quest director.</p><p>"We want to make sure that whole DNA is preserved and still in the game. In Phantom Liberty, there's this moment where the story splits almost, and that's the structure that we used with Witcher 2, actually, and Blood and Wine with Witcher 3 as well--where you had a split in the middle [that leads to] completely different branches with completely different endings," Sasko explained.</p><p>Sasko also mentioned that Cyberpunk 2077 needs to validate its players' choices. "If you in your story have made a certain choice and that's the way you have decided to go with your V and your partners and whoever else you met in the game, that's your story. It's important when making those decisions not to invalidate what players have been doing because it is their story and the decisions they made," the developer said.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for more on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel as we learn more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/livestream-showcases-90-minutes-of-silent-hill-2-remake-gameplay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Japanese streamer 2RBO. livestreamed 90 minutes of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, which Bloober Team is developing with a release date of October 8, 2024. The live stream showed off the early area gameplay, introducing the players to James Sunderland, a man looking for his wife in Silent Hill. In this livestream, fans get to watch the livestreamer travel through the city, comparing the sights of the new game to the original, expressing their excitement (as read via translated captions) at the differences made with new graphics.</p>
<p><iframe title="„Äê„É™„É°„Ç§„ÇØÁâà„Çí‰∏ñÁïåÊúÄÈÄüÈÖç‰ø°!?„ÄëÂºüËÄÖ,„Åä„Å§„ÅÑ„Å°„ÅÆ„Äå„Çµ„Ç§„É¨„É≥„Éà„Éí„É´Ôºí(2024) | SILENT HILL 2 (2024)„Äç„Äê2BRO.„Äë" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZTxhiokIUxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Silent Hill 2's remake features ray-tracing and new technical enhancements to add to the thick atmosphere of Silent Hill 2, with new immersive soundscapes, as well as the option to turn on a filter that gives the game the 90's feel, making it noisy and even foggier than before.</p>
<p>As seen in the live stream, there is a stark difference between the camera of the original Silent Hill 2 and the remake. In the remake, the camera is now over the shoulder so that you are closer to the character, providing more immersion when fighting off enemies and being jump-scared. When picking up items and spotting secrets, the high-quality graphics and the over-the-shoulder camera will make things significantly more accessible, and James will look over at essential items to nudge players in the right direction.</p>
<p>The original Silent Hill 2 featured many inaccessible buildings and locations, but the remake has sought to open up those areas, allowing players to explore more thoroughly and <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-completionist-route-will-take-more-than-20-hours/">access new puzzles and items</a> to aid them on their journey through the game. In the livestream, some of these areas are shown off, with the streamer also stating that they remember being unable to access certain areas in the original. The buildings don't necessarily hold items of interest, with some of them just being an extra way to jumpscare the player.</p>
<p>In the livestream, players also get a first glance at the updated combat system, which was severely clunky in the original. Players will get to use iconic weapons from the original such as the Steel Pipe and Handgun. Still, the combat system will make it easier to attack enemies, while having to perfect your dodges to avoid taking damage. Combining the new combat system with the new camera system makes for a terrifying experience showcased in the livestream, with the streamer coming up against many enemies in plain sight or waiting in ambush.</p>

My favorite moments from the base game weren‚Äôt firing up my ship‚Äôs engines and pondering all the places I could go, but rather navigating strained loyalties and menacing deceptions in individual cities and questlines. We‚Äôll find out if it‚Äôs worked when the expansion arrives on Xbox and PC later this month. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-will-start-sharing-more-revenue-with-creators.974304/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237039/roblox-share-revenue-creators-paid-experiences-rdc-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As Roblox marches toward its ultimate goal of 1 billion users, the company is finding new ways to share revenue with the developers who have made millions of games on the platform.</p><p>During the company‚Äôs annual developers conference in San Francisco on Friday, CEO David Baszucki announced that creators of these games, which Roblox calls experiences, will be able to keep between 50 and 70 percent of revenue from their paid titles when they‚Äôre purchased in real currency on desktop computers. That‚Äôs significantly more than the roughly 30 percent revenue split Roblox<em> </em>gives developers for purchases made with its native Robux currency inside freemium experiences. </p><p>The move could help incentivize the creation of more premium games as Roblox <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23775268/roblox-ceo-david-baszucki-gaming-metaverse-robux-virtual-reality">looks to attract older users</a>. Baszucki says the intention is to also bring these new economics to paid experiences bought on other devices, including mobile phones and consoles, though app store fees will likely get in the way on iOS and Android. He declined to share specifics.</p><div><figcaption><em>A breakdown of Roblox‚Äôs revenue sharing for paid experiences on desktop.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Roblox</cite></p></div><p>‚ÄúWe believe we‚Äôre setting the groundwork for a more expansive range of type of content on the platform,‚Äù Baszucki tells me with regard to paid experiences. In addition, he says there‚Äôs ‚Äúa huge effort within the company to support 100-plus-player open-world sports or battle royale-type experiences on low-end devices.‚Äù Though he doesn‚Äôt say it, that strategy is seemingly aimed at competing more directly with Epic Games‚Äô <em>Fortnite</em>, which Roblox<em> </em>still doesn‚Äôt have a viable alternative to on its platform.</p><p>Another way Roblox is sharing money with creators is via a new affiliate link program. Those who are accepted into it will be able to earn up to 50 percent (capped at $100) of Robux purchases a new user makes within six months after joining from their sign-up link. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going to make it a lot easier for creators to be comfortable leaning into heavy social marketing‚Äù for the platform, says Baszucki of the new program.</p><div><figcaption>Roblox<em>‚Äôs new Party mode.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Roblox</cite></p></div><p>Roblox‚Äôs<em> </em>other big announcements at this year‚Äôs developer conference include a new ‚ÄúParty‚Äù mode that lets up to six people communicate and move between experiences as a group. Starting early next year, it‚Äôs<em> </em>also partnering with Shopify to let developers sell real-world items through the platform. Revenue sharing terms of that arrangement haven‚Äôt been disclosed yet. </p><p>While Roblox‚Äôs daily user base continued to steadily grow to 79.5 million last quarter, the company has come under fire in a recent <em>Bloomberg </em>investigation titled <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">‚ÄúRoblox‚Äôs<em> </em>Pedophile Problem.‚Äù</a> After that story was published this summer, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24216300/turkey-blocks-roblox-instagram">the government of Turkey banned <em>Roblox</em></a>, citing its hosting of ‚Äúvirtual sex parties‚Äù and ‚Äúviolent games‚Äù played by children. Roblox<em> </em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-04/roblox-turkey-ban-tied-to-kids-access-to-virtual-sex-parties">this week appealed the ban</a>, and Baszucki tells me, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre optimistic and working with their government and their courts.‚Äù</p><p>He says that ‚Äúany incident on our platform is unacceptable‚Äù and that trust and safety is the ‚Äútop priority‚Äù inside the company. ‚ÄúOur AI gets better all the time.

After watching the announcement trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/whispers-of-the-eyeless">Whispers of the Eyeless</a>, I have one request: please, do not have that voiceover in the full game. It is hammier than a hamster eating a ham sandwich in Hamburg during a performance of Hamlet. It starts with "The Whispers [of the Eyeless] call to me!!!" and does not improve from there. Beyond that, colour me fairly enthused.

Created by Evil Gingerbread Studios and Venris, the dev behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> mod SFO, Whispers Of The Eyeless is about growing a terrible cult beneath a pretty awful city, so as to resurrect three dead gods: Wrath, Desire, and Madness. It's a strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with grim storybook art reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon</a>, a turn-based combat system and a splash of base and army-building. Other inspirations include Loop Hero, Children Of Morta and Polish folklore at large. 
</p>
<p>
"Assume the role of the last descendent of the Old Faith and First Prophet of the New Age in the city of Aranthor where new and old gods vie for power," proclaims <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523890/Whispers_of_the_Eyeless/">the Steam blurb</a>. "Defeated, exiled and nearly forgotten, the Dead Gods have been silent for generations. But finally... the Whispers have returned. The 'Dead' Gods were not dead, and it is up to you to reinstate them to their full glory."
</p>
<p>
The aforesaid city is presided over by various upstart Living Gods, and broken into districts with distinct enemies, local culture and histories. Each district is home to a "branching web of events". You'll seemingly visit them on your lonesome as cult leader - there isn't any party-based combat in the trailer - but you can recruit people as cultists and ordain them as disciples, who can be sent on missions. 
</p>
<p>
There's also the question of which particular Dead God you favour, with consequences including different decorations for your underground den of cosmic villainy. "Upgrade your base, enact divine Benedictions, and make Sacrifices to the Dead Gods to strengthen the cult and increase your power in the city as Prophet," the blurb goes on. "The God you favor will impact your Sanctum's appearance, which can be customized to your liking."
</p>
<p>
Whispers Of The Eyeless is in the "very late stages of development", according to publishers Camlann Games, and will enter Steam early access in either Q4 2024 or Q1 2025 - in other words, later this winter or early next spring. You can expect a demo in one of Valve's forthcoming Steam Next Fests - either October 2024 or February 2025. Here's hoping the launch trailer narration is a fading memory by then.

                <p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/astro-bot/" data-ref-id="5000-630892">Astro Bot</a>, there are 300 bots to find, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/astro-bot-all-cameo-bots-and-secret-characters-list/2900-5754/" data-ref-id="2900-5754">169 cameo bots</a>, as well as dozens of puzzle pieces and several secret Void levels hidden within the game. Normally, a game like this would be quite a chore for players seeking to polish off all of its optional items to 100% completion, but Astro Bot offers a special tool that makes this process much faster and more enjoyable. Here's what you need to know.</p><h2>Astro Bot - All secrets and collectible locations</h2><p>Astro Bot's lengthy list of optional secrets to find is made incredibly easy--hopefully in a way that transforms the genre--thanks to its robot bird companion.Each time you complete a level and have collectibles like hidden bots or puzzle pieces still undiscovered, jump back into the level whenever you'd like to.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4361206-img_6712.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361206" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4361206-img_6712.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361206"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4361206-img_6712.jpg"></figure><p>There, you'll find right at the start of a level a peculiar item that wasn't there before: a birdhouse encased in domed glass. It reads 200 on the bottom, which means it'll cost you 200 coins to open it. This is only available when you're replaying a level you already completed.</p><p>Pay the 200-coin fee, then pull on the wires to reveal a robot bird. This bird, which seems to be nameless, actually pings any remaining collectibles in the level. This includes all undiscovered bots, puzzle pieces, and Void levels, which are the secret levels found within other levels (as opposed to those found in the space map). The bird pings collectibles from quite far away, and the pinging intensifies as you get closer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4361207-img_6715.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361207" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4361207-img_6715.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361207"></a><figcaption>Follow the bird's ping to find every collectible in the game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4361207-img_6715.jpg"></figure><p>Simply put, this feature makes collecting all bots and other secrets in the game trivially easy. It's a lovely idea, and we hope it finds its way into other games that could use it similarly in years to come.</p><p>If you'd like to take a peek at the secret character bots specifically, we've arranged a gallery of all the Astro Bot hidden cameo bots.

            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>'s Shattered Space expansion just weeks away from release, Bethesda has been teasing some of the things players can expect to find when House Va'ruun's homeward of Va'ruun'kai opens for business on 30th September.
</p>
<p>
"Thank you to the millions of players who have made the Settled Systems their home and helped make this an incredible first year for Starfield", Bethesda wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1832055921758867842">post on social media</a>, before turning its attention to those pre-launch teases.
</p>
<p>
First up is the reveal Shattered Space's new planet of Va'ruun'kai will be something for explorers to get stuck into, featuring "over 50 locations to discover" - one of which, as we learned during <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, will be House Va'ruun's capital city of Dazra.

<p>
Elsewhere, Shattered Space introduces a "gross" new grenade that can be crafted from organic material, as well as "formidable" enemies, including the Redeemed and Vortex Horrors. Additionally, Bethesda warns players "haven't seen the last of Zealots, Spacers, or the Crimson Fleet", who all just might be looking to take advantage of the "situation" on Va'ruun'kai.
</p>
<p>
That situation, as Eurogamer's Lottie Lynn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-warps-bethesdas-final-frontier-into-full-on-horror">recently discovered</a>, is a vortex that's consumed much of Dazra, and whose effects are now bleeding out across the whole of the planet to create a Starfield expansion focusing on "pure space horror".
</p>
<p>
"Creatures are emerging from the other side of the vortex and they're certainly not happy to be on an unfamiliar planet," Lottie wrote. "Not to forget about the planet's terrain itself which includes gravity anomalies." Oh, and it'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-gets-release-date">have space buggies</a> too.

Now, when talking about new games, I also have to think ‚ÄúWait, is this out for everyone or just people who pre-ordered some fancy $100 edition?‚Äù </p><p>At least one game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-gold-edition/9PD4PSZW2Q9Z/0010/B1GM6CW2358Z&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-gold-edition/9PD4PSZW2Q9Z/0010/B1GM6CW2358Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown</em></a></span>, has even made things more frustrating by offering two different early access options. Pay a bit more and you can play the game two days ahead of launch. Pay even more and you can play 7 days before launch. If you‚Äôre quiet, you can literally hear a greedy publisher somewhere counting money, looking at <em>Solar Crown</em>‚Äôs nonsense, and thinking ‚ÄúMaybe we can offer <em>three </em>tiers of early access!‚Äù </p><p>So that all makes me want to declare just how happy I am that <em>Astro Bot </em>has one release date. It‚Äôs weird that in 2024 having a single release date is something worthy of praise, yet here we are. The video game industry has become so addicted to ‚Äúnumber go up‚Äù and endless growth that a single release date (you know how things have worked for <em>decade</em>) is becoming a rarity and something worth celebrating</p><p>And look, in six months, none of this will matter. The games will all be playable and their early access periods will be a distant memory. (Another reason to not pay extra for this shit.) But it does mean that for most games, the first week or so after launch has become a weird dance online as people try to talk about something that might not be out for everyone.<br></p><p><em>Astro Bot </em>will get to sidestep all of this by not being forcing gamers to pay a ransom fee to play a finished game a few days before others. How nice and just one more reason to love Sony‚Äôs new PS5 platformer. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A killing blow with a throwing knife will grant a damage bonus to your next knife, and this effect can be stacked. The stats on this roll aren't too great, as while strength is above-average and you get some nice resilience on it, recovery, discipline, and intellect are quite low. It's a decent roll, and worth grabbing if you don't already have it.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 21</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 3</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 64</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Mask of the Quiet One (Exotic Titan helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363223-destiny22024-09-0619-05-34.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363223" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363223-destiny22024-09-0619-05-34.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363223"></a><figcaption>Mask of the Quiet One</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363223-destiny22024-09-0619-05-34.jpg"></figure><p>This spooky mask gives your Titan ability energy when damaged, and when critically wounded, you'll regain maximum health on kills. It's a bit of a glass cannon Exotic, but it can work nicely with the right Prismatic build. While mobility is higher than we'd like on this Exotic, you are getting great recovery, discipline, and strength stats. It's a middle-of-the-road roll, so you can ignore this one unless you really need it.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 4</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 16</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 19</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 67</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Promethium Spur (Exotic Warlock leg armor)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363224-destiny22024-09-0619-05-43.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363224" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363224-destiny22024-09-0619-05-43.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363224"></a><figcaption>Prmoetheium Spur</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363224-destiny22024-09-0619-05-43.jpg"></figure><p>Promethium Spur has quite a bit of utility if you're focused on the Daybreak Solar Super, as this Exotic will let you spawn a healing <em>and </em>empowering rift at the location of any target you kill. Solar weapon final blows also grant rift energy if you have a Solar Super equipped, and standing in a rift while you take out enemies will activate another buff. Xur hardly ever has this Exotic in stock, and the stats on this one are quite nicely balanced. Strength will need to be modded, but you're getting a nice spread of points across your resilience, recovery, discipline, and intellect stats, so this is worth spending some Strange Coins

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

The selection includes hidden gems and famous faces, and most of the games are Steam Deck compatible. Pricing starts at $10 for three games, $15 for five games, and $20 for seven games, which breaks down to $2.86 per game. You can create a bundle with more than seven games, and each subsequent pick will only cost $2.86.</p><p>While you're checking out the Platinum Collection, make sure to take a peek at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fbundle%2Fwar-child-charity-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-7-pc-games-for-20-including-mega-man-legacy-collection-2-overcooked-2-and-more-hits%2F1100-6526319%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fanatical's new charity bundle</a>, which features nine games for a donation of $5.49 or more.

Stretching across the 16- and 32-bit eras of gaming, it's fascinating to see how Mega Man evolved over the years, and like other compilations of classic games from Capcom, you're getting plenty of extra content as well. Not only do the retro games still look fantastic in high-definition, but you can also check out time trials, remix challenges with online leaderboards, an extensive gallery of rare illustrations, and additional modes originally released as DLC for Mega Man 9 and 10.</p><p>Another game you can consider buying is Martha is Dead--don't tell Batman--a dark psychological-thriller that takes place in Italy during World War II. After her twin sister Martha dies, Giulia sets on a journey to find the truth behind her sister's murder, which turns out to be shrouded by folklore and the horrors of war. If you'd like to lose some friends, you can also check out the manic co-op action of Overcooked 2, and Three Minutes To Eight is a fascinating pixel-art adventure game where the protagonist is destined to die and must find a way to cheat death.</p><p>For more video game deals, there's no shortage of great bargains to look at right now.
