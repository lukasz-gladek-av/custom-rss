            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>YouTube is updating its policy to age-restrict more content containing video game scenes with “graphic violence,” <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/383711785?hl=en&amp;sjid=3922247506148764624-NC">the company announced on Tuesday</a>. The update will go into effect on November 17th and will prevent accounts under 18 and signed-out users from watching videos with games focused on showing “realistic human characters” involved in scenes of “mass violence against non-combatants” or torture.</p><p>When choosing whether to restrict a video, YouTube says it will take the length of the graphic scene into account, as well as whether it’s zoomed in or the main focus of a scene. It will also evaluate whether the video shows violence targeted at a character “that looks like a real human.” YouTube’s post doesn’t clarify if this applies to the violence seen in games like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, a <em>Call of Duty</em> sequence like the infamous <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201735/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-remastered-release">“No Russian” mission</a>, or other kinds of realistically rendered scenes.</p><p>However, YouTube spokesperson Boot Bullwinkle said in a statement to <em>The Verge</em> that “certain content may be age-restricted if it’s non-fleeting or zoomed in,” adding that “there may be ways the creator can choose to play the mission to avoid content that would lead to an age restriction.” Creators can also choose to blur or obscure the violence, according to Bullwinkle.</p><p>The update builds upon <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802008?hl=en">YouTube’s existing policies</a>, which state that the platform may restrict videos featuring “dramatized violence” focused on torture, severe injuries, or violent deaths with blood, with an exception for games. The current policy says, “Generally, we do not remove dramatized violence when the content or metadata lets us know that the content is fictional, or when it’s apparent from the content itself, such as with animated content or video games.”</p><p>“YouTube’s policies are designed to adapt to the evolving digital world, and these updates reflect our ongoing commitment to protect younger users and foster a responsible platform,” Bullwinkle said.</p><p>In addition to stricter policies surrounding video games, the update will also prevent creators from directing users to online gambling content involving digital goods, like video game skins, cosmetics, or NFTs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623985/youtube-online-gambling-rules-restrictions">YouTube stopped allowing creators</a> to verbally mention or display online gambling services not approved by Google in March. The platform started blocking approved online gambling content for users under 18 at this time, and now it’s planning to age-restrict social casino content as well.</p><p><em><strong>Update, October 28th: </strong>Added clarification from YouTube.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/808545/youtube-graphic-video-game-violence-age-restriction]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-60-000mah-power-station-is-cheaper-than-a-budget-no-name-power-bank-now-selling-for-pennies.1337647/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Your phone dies at the worst moments. Your laptop battery gives up mid-presentation. Power outages leave you sitting in the dark scrolling through a phone at 5% battery. Generic power banks help a little but they barely charge your phone twice before needing a recharge themselves. The Anker <em>PowerCore Reserve</em> changes the game with 60,000mAh of capacity that can <strong>charge an iPhone 17 over ten times</strong>. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/"> just dropped this powerhouse to $79, down from $149</a>, hitting an all-time low price that costs barely more than a no-name 10,000mAh power bank.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Battery Technology That Lasts a Decade</h2>
<p>The power bank uses LiFePO4 battery types. Although it may sound complicated, it’s actually very important: In normal Li-ion batteries used by those cheap power banks that last only a year at most, the charging cycle ends at 500 to 1,000 cycles. The power bank from Anker uses 3,000 cycles: That’s three thousand charging cycles or complete discharge cycles before the battery’s capacity reaches 80%. <strong>That’s around a decade of normal life</strong>.</p>
<p>The true advantage of LiFePO4 over a standard lithium ion battery is more than endurance: This form of battery prevents thermal runaway. In technical terms, LiFePO4 <strong>prevents overheating of a battery</strong> that eventually leads to it exploding in a fire. The high temperature tolerability of LiFePO4 ranges from –4°F to 140°F which makes it ideal for winter camping or summer road travel.</p>



<p>The <strong>192Wh battery capacity translates to 60,000mAh with a cell voltage of 3.2V</strong>. The battery provides enough power to charge a MacBook Air 2.9 times or power an LED light of 3 watts for 42.3 hours. The LED power duration comes in handy during prolonged power outages of several days when you may require constant illumination without having to recharge smartphones. The <strong>power bank comes with four charging ports</strong>: These include <strong>two charging sockets of 27W and 60W</strong> through the USB C charging sockets.</p>
<p>The <strong>XT60 input port supports the connection of solar panels</strong> with a capacity of up to 60W: The Anker power station can now become a sustainable off-grid power solution (the solar panels are not included). The power station takes around four hours to recharge with a 60W USB C wall charger.</p>



<p>The <strong>digital smart display</strong> takes over the face of the front panel and comes with information such as battery life, input power level, output power level, and estimated remaining life. This provides real-time data that helps you determine perfectly the amount of power being used and the remaining life based on current power levels. No need to guess whether you’ll have enough power to last the night.</p>
<p>The device measures <strong>4.59 inches wide, 4.59 inches deep, and 8.17 inches high</strong>: That’s comparable in size to a large water bottle. Weighing 5.1 pounds makes it heavy enough to be substantial but light enough to throw into a backpack or emergency kit. The green cloth exterior provides good traction that won’t slide off and comes with a flat-folded handle.</p>
<p>For $79 for a 60,000mAh LiFePO4 power bank that can recharge from the sun’s power, you’re paying pennies – 0.001 per milliamp-hour. That’s a fraction of what each power bank on the market costs.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbls-mini-bluetooth-speaker-is-selling-for-pennies-now-cheaper-than-an-old-dumb-radio-2000639597</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jbl%E2%80%99s-mini-bluetooth-speaker-is-selling-for-pennies-now-cheaper-than-an-old-dumb-radio.1337644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tiny speakers get no respect, but they solve a real problem. Your phone’s speaker sounds terrible. Your laptop barely projects past your keyboard. You need music in places where dragging a full-size speaker makes zero sense: the shower, the kitchen counter while cooking, your workbench in the garage, or clipped to your backpack on a winter hike. Amazon just dropped the JBL Go 3 to $29, down from $39, hitting an all-time low price that puts this rugged Bluetooth speaker cheaper than most wired alarm clocks. At this price, you’re paying less than a dollar per hour of battery life for a speaker that can survive getting dropped in a snowbank.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4565/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pocket-Sized Power That Survives Everything</h2>
<p>The JBL Go 3 has a width of 3.4 inches by 2.7 inches high and 1.6 inches deep, and a weight of 0.46 pounds. The speaker has a 43 x 47mm driver that produces 4.2 watts of sound: The sound signature of JBL’s Pro Sound design <strong>includes bass response from the tiny speaker</strong> instead of high-pitched treble on lower-priced models. The frequency response of the speaker includes 110 Hz to 20kHz to encompass the full range of your hearing.</p>
<p>The <strong>rating of IP67 water resistant and dust resistant</strong> provides that it can withstand being submerged in full water, at a depth of a meter for 30 minutes. Place it in your shower as you rinse off the chill. Use it on your countertop as you clean dishes from dinner. Attach it to your jacket as you walk out into the snow and aren’t concerned as freezing rain begins to fall. The speaker won’t slip from the countertop or smooth surface as it sits there. The attached loop of cloth that comes with it enables you to attach it to your shower hooks or carabiners.</p>



<p>The speaker <strong>comes with Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity that connects rapidly to smartphones</strong>, tablets, and laptops and provides a constant connectivity connection from 10 to 15 meters away. The five buttons on top of the speaker control power on/off, pair the speaker with devices via Bluetooth connectivity, play/pause music as well as increase and decrease the sound volume.</p>
<p>Battery life goes an <strong>estimated five hours on a single charge</strong> but it’s been known to extend well beyond that based on overall audio output levels. Charging only takes 2.5 hours via the new USB C port. This leaves behind those days of digging around for a proprietary charging cord only found in your smoking hot new TV or powering a brick-sized micro-USB wall charger.</p>



<p>The internal microphone provides speakerphone capability with noise and echo reduction: This makes it a convenience device for when <strong>you want to take your calls while cooking in the kitchen or showering</strong>. The speaker design provides mono sound that resonates from the front on one side. The rubber on the back of the speaker prevents it from slipping: This particular design trait appears practical for transportability as opposed to stereo sound that you won’t be needing inside a shower or kitchen.</p>
<p>At $29, the speaker may be purchased for less than the average ticket to a movie and provides years of enjoyment. Budget-friendly Bluetooth speakers usually have to cut back on either sound quality, durability, or battery life. The Go 3 doesn’t scrimp on anything in those departments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to imagine what first-person shooters would be like today, if they were to exist at all, without the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom">original DOOM</a>, released back on December 10, 1993, for MS-DOS. A lone super soldier, the legendary Doom Guy, fending off the hordes of demons from hell is one of the defining images of PC gaming, and the series continues to shock and amaze fans to this day with every new gory entry. Now, Modiphius Entertainment is bringing DOOM to the tabletop with the upcoming Doom Arena Board Game, now on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPV4PZ?object_uuid=7af612f4-7bea-4eb8-b245-7679ceedf7c9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Kickstarter</u></a>, and I had a chance to get some time with a prototype to see just how well I could rip and tear in my dining room.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/doomboard-1761661236811.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While Doom Arena isn't the first cardboard adaptation of the series, this latest rendition is a bloodbath contest between one player controlling Doom Guy and the other controlling the demons. Taking place in – you guessed it, an arena – the two players maneuver their plastic forces around the hexagon grid-based warzone, competing to see who can dish out the most pain. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each point of damage done to an opponent earns you blood, which serves as a victory point.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each point of damage done to an opponent earns you blood, which serves as a victory point. The winner is whoever comes out ahead in two out of the three rounds by earning the most blood, with each round consisting of six turns each for both sides. Between rounds, both Doom Guy and the Demons can upgrade their arsenals. Doom Guy gets new weapons and armor, while the Demons swap out weaker enemies for hartier ones like Pinky, Cacodemons, or the mighty Cyberdemon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom Arena is one of those games that fits great as a filler between some heavier ones during a game day, or when you just want to have some fun while sipping a cold one and munching on some snacks. The gameplay is a slick dice-chucker where the strategy takes a back seat to running in guns blazing and seeing how much pain you unleash, which is very reminiscent of its source material. The only real "strategy" I found myself thinking about is what upgrades I was going to spend my resources on between rounds.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/doomarena-preview-2-1761661236811.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I appreciate the simpler ruleset behind Doom Arena, because you can explain the rules to friends pretty quickly and be rolling dice shortly after. That being said, I wouldn't complain if there were a smidgen more depth to be found. To be fair, the prototype I had access to and a work-in-progress ruleset included only <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player</a> game modes, whereas the final game will be playable with 2-4 players, so it's possible the additional depth I am hoping for will be found in the final rules and other game modes. On the topic of game modes, I will say that having official rules for starting with more upgrades is smart, and makes for a ton of chaotic fun, and I could see some great matches happen by adopting a pick/counter-pick approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The version of Doom Arena that I played featured miniatures showcasing the classic looks of Doom Guy and demons that players of the original game from the '90s will recognize. But those who jumped on the chainsaw wagon in more recent decades will have a version for them, too. Modiphius is producing a mechanically identical version that instead has arenas, models, and weapons pulled from the most recent Doom: The Dark Ages, with Doom Guy replaced by the menacing Doom Slayer and demons including the Mancubus, Imps, Imp Stalkers, Hell and Battle Knights, Pinky Rider, Arachnotron, and Soldiers. And for folks who may be lacking in storage space, Modiphius will also offer a version that replaces the plastic miniatures with acrylic standees, shrinking the box size and lowering the cost.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/doomarena-preview-3-1761661236811.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When I first heard the announcement that Modiphius was designing a new Doom board game, my mind immediately went to images of playing as Doom Guy, exploring corridors, finding keys to unlock doors, that eventually would lead to a fight with a big scary demon. Something more akin to say a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-board-game-buyers-guide">Betrayal at House on the Hill</a>, Cthulu: Death May Die, or Zombicide. I still would love a Doom game like that, but I can't deny that Doom Arena captures the spirit of these games splendidly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a series about killing as many things as fast as possible, and Arena delivers on that premise in an exciting and digestible package. Even playing dice with this WIP build led to tense moments where I had to hold my breath as I rolled my dice, or giant sighs of relief as my demons avoided being brutally dismembered by a chainsaw. I eagerly look forward to seeing what sort of additional elements or add-ons will be available to play around with and what sort of other game modes will ship in the final release that use <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-three-player-board-games">three</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a>. With the Doom Arena Board Game, Modphius looks to deliver a box that fans of both the video games and board games in general can enjoy, and I am counting down the days until I can rev up my chainsaw again and take it to some demons again.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/doomarena-preview-5-1761661236812.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom the Arena Board Game’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPV4PZ?object_uuid=7af612f4-7bea-4eb8-b245-7679ceedf7c9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">campaign</a> runs until November 21, 2025 with an expected delivery date of October 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-ceo-wants-games-%E2%80%98to-be-on-every-platform%E2%80%99.1337617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the company <strong>wants to put its games “on every platform”</strong>. Just recently, Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of Combat Evolved, is now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heading to PlayStation consoles</a> at launch, a first for the series.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-possibly-considering-gears-of-war-playstation-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> made the jump to PlayStation 5, as will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2025</a>. Many Xbox exclusives have slowly been heading to different consoles. Now, it seems this is the start of many, maybe even ending the exclusivity fans have come to respect forever.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-wants-its-games-to-be-everywhere-says-ceo-satya-nadella">Microsoft Wants Its Games To Be Everywhere, Says CEO Satya Nadella</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The consoles wars are now over. What does that mean for Microsoft's gaming business model?</p><p>"We just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere; consoles, PC, mobile, cloud, or TV." – <a href="https://twitter.com/satyanadella?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@satyanadella</a> <a href="https://t.co/AOGf3mj0Kf">pic.twitter.com/AOGf3mj0Kf</a></p></div>— TBPN (@tbpn) <a href="https://twitter.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The news comes from <a href="https://x.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TBPN</a>, as the group chatted with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about the company’s new partnership with OpenAI. The CEO talks a bit about Xbox and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/white-house-uses-ai-donald-trump-master-chief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘end’ of the console wars</a>. In the clip, <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1983255817785597980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">transcribed by GameFile’s Stephen Totilo</a>, Nadella states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Remember, the biggest gaming business is the Windows business,” says Nadella to TBPN. “To us, gaming on Windows, and of course Steam – has built a massive marketplace on top of it and done a very successful job of it.&nbsp;So to us, the way we are thinking about gaming is; let’s first of all, now we are the largest publisher, after the Activision [deal] so therefore we want to be a fantastic publisher, similar approach to what we did with Office. <strong>We’re going to be everywhere, in every platform</strong>. We want to make sure, whether it’s consoles, whether it’s the PC, whether it’s mobile, whether it’s cloud gaming – or the TV; <strong>we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not too surprising to see Microsoft and Xbox shed the exclusivity factor. Many games, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sales-drop-about-90-in-japan/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, sold less than stellar due to sticking to one console. While it’s franchises, especially Halo, never seemed to have that problem, it may lead to more sales. Still, the recent shift, plus <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-is-outpacing-ps4-while-xbox-series-trails-xbox-one-in-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lackluster sales of Xbox Series X|S</a>, do ring out a touch off for the once-influential company. Whether it’s next console, rumored for a 2027 release, is going to include big changes is unclear.</p>



<p>What do you think of Satya Nadella’s comment on bringing Xbox games everywhere? Is it too ambitious? Too risky? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon Game Studios has announced that just four years after release, <a href="https://kotaku.com/two-days-with-new-world-amazon-s-extravagant-food-harv-1847777090">its once-popular MMORPG <em>New World</em></a> will no longer receive content updates as it slowly begins its journey to the end.</p> <p>On October 28, shortly after news broke that Amazon was planning to lay off thousands of employees, <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates">Amazon Game Studios posted an update on <em>New World’</em>s official website</a> confirming that the game’s recently launched season 10 and Nighthaven update will be its last. In the post, the devs said that after an “incredible journey” with the community, <em>New World</em> has reached a point where it is “no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates.” The MMORPG’s last big content drop, Nighthaven, has been made free to all PC players, as has the game’s <em>Rise of the Angry Earth</em> expansion, which is needed to play Nighthaven.</p> <p><span>“Players of Aeternum: Your dedication and enthusiasm have made this </span><span><i>New World</i></span><span> adventure an unforgettable journey,” said the devs.&nbsp; “We’re deeply grateful for every moment you’ve spent helping build this extraordinary world alongside us. It has been an honor to share Aeternum with you. Thank you for helping make this game something truly special.”</span></p>

 <p>To be clear, <em>New World</em> isn’t shutting down today or any time this year. In an included FAQ, the devs claim players will still be able to play the game normally on all platforms, bug fixes will still happen, and you’ll even be able to keep buying in-game currency. The servers will remain open and operating “through 2026” to allow the community “<span>time to continue their adventures in Aeternum.” The studio says it will provide more details on <em>New World’</em>s future in the coming months and promised to provide a minimum of six months’ notice before shutting down the servers and killing the game completely.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>While <em>New World</em> isn’t dead yet, the writing is on the wall for the MMORPG, <a href="https://kotaku.com/over-populated-new-world-servers-no-longer-allowing-new-1847790460">which at one point was one of the most played games on Steam</a>. In October 2021, <em>New World</em> launched to over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1063730/charts/#max">900,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>. It was a genuine smash hit for Amazon, a company that, up until that point, had struggled (and continues to struggle) to break into the game industry. But by March of 2022, player counts slipped into the mid 30-thousands and continued to dwindle. A console port and some big updates over the years helped keep <em>New World</em> afloat, but it seems like Amazon is finally done spending money on its once-popular MMORPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620">as the retail giant rushes to replace people with AI.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-games-twitch-hit-by-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Amazon layoffs</a>, <strong>New World is stopping development</strong> and ending with Season 10 and the recent Nighthaven update. The news comes after more than 14,000 were let go from Amazon and its affiliates like Twitch. </p>



<p>Released in 2021 on PC and in 2024 for consoles, New World, also known as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-aeternum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New World Aeternum</a>, is an MMORPG from Amazon Games. It was revealed as one of three titles announced to be in development for Amazon. New World was the only one to succeed, despite abandoning its original free-to-play entry. Unfortunately, the game’s journey will stop here, unfortunately ending development and future updates.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-world-ending-with-season-10-after-amazon-layoffs-servers-shutting-down-after-2026">New World Ending with Season 10 After Amazon Layoffs, Servers Shutting Down After 2026</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a statement from <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the New World team</a> on the official website, development on the game has ended. The recent Season 10 and Nighthaven update, which launched earlier this month, are the final updates. <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In the blog</a>, the team states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we’ve reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates. The recently launched Season 10 and Nighthaven update will serve as the final content release for&nbsp;<em>New World</em>&nbsp;on PC and consoles. It is only after much consideration that we’ve reached this decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Both the Nighthaven and Rise of the Angry Earth updates are now free for fans on PC and Aeternum will remain on PS+ Premium and Extra for the time being. <strong>Servers for New World will remain open through 2026</strong>, with more information regarding the game’s future to be revealed at a later date. </p>



<p>While not stated in the blog, the team was hit with multiple firings due to today’s massive-scale Amazon layoff. A report from Bloomberg, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-games-twitch-hit-by-layoffs/">which we wrote on</a>, said that Amazon’s game studios were hit hard. Specifically, the layoffs were felt hardest for teams developing MMOs, like Amazon Game Studios. Sadly, this will likely be the first of many bad news stories surrounding the topic, as the studios were working on multiple new titles that are now in jeopardy.</p>

There are endless <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-harry-potter-gift-ideas">Harry Potter gifts for every type of fan</a> out there, but if your specific interest is in puzzles, there's some serious variety available to you. Just a quick search for "Harry Potter puzzles" will drown you in options from various brands that can take a while to sort through.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR – These Are the Best Harry Potter Puzzles</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As a fan of both Harry Potter and puzzles, I have taken it upon myself to help you find the right Potter puzzle for you. Below I've gathered some of my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults">favorite adult jigsaw puzzles</a> with a Harry Potter theme, as well as some great options for kids. I've also included an awesome model kit that makes for an exciting 3D puzzling experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marauder's Map Puzzle</h3><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215775"><div id="215775" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marauder's Map Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marauder's Map</a> is one of the most recognizable items from Harry Potter lore. From Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, this puzzle looks like the full map from the movie once it's been assembled. The puzzle itself is from The Noble Collection, which is known for making some of the highest quality officially licensed wand and Harry Potter prop replicas. You can see what the fully assembled puzzle looks like below:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hogwart's Express Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215776"><div id="215776" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hogwart's Express Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Hogwarts Express puzzle from Buffalo games depicts Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid as they were at the end of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone">The Sorcerer's Stone</a>. The train is set against a beautiful sunset backdrop, and we also see Malfoy sitting on a bench with Goyle at his side. It's a great-looking jigsaw puzzle from one of the most iconic scenes from the first film of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-movies-in-order">Harry Potter movie series</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Herbology Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215777"><div id="215777" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Herbology Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This herbology puzzle is my favorite option on this list. It depicts various ingredients students would find and grow in herbology class. At the center of it all is a mandrake in all its weird root baby glory. The design of this puzzle is reminiscent of the classic drawings you'd find in a vintage botanical identification diagram and makes for a great display piece.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hogwarts Crest Wooden Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215778"><div id="215778" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hogwarts Crest Wooden Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Hogwarts Crest puzzle is made up of 201 laser-cut wooden pieces. It depicts the Hogwarts crest, including all four houses, and a vibrant floral design. What makes this puzzle interesting is that it comes with many unique pieces you'll recognize from the books and movies. These pieces include a witch's hat, the Goblet of Fire, and the Deathly Hallows symbol. It's a great puzzle for both kids and adults to put together.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hogwarts Castle Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215779"><div id="215779" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hogwarts Castle Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This 3,000-piece Hogwarts Castle puzzle is an excellent option for anyone looking for something more challenging. The image depicts the majority of Hogwarts Castle and grounds, including Hagrid's hut. There are also owls, a phoenix, a hippogriff, and various other small details that make this larger puzzle really fun to piece together. It's made by Ravensburger, which is our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">overall favorite puzzle brand</a> on the market right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like the massive size of this puzzle, you may want to check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/largest-jigsaw-puzzles">largest puzzles out there</a>. 3,000 pieces is nothing compared some of these.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hogwarts Express 3D Puzzle Model Kit</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215780"><div id="215780" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hogwarts Express 3D Puzzle Model Kit</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While not a traditional puzzle, this 3D model kit of the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Express" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hogwarts Express</a> belongs on this list because of how cool it is. The kit comes with eight sheets of 181 pieces that you'll need to put togehter. No glue or tools are required to assemble the train, but it may be difficult for young children to piece together. Overall, this is a really different kind of puzzle and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-lego-alternatives">excellent alternative to the LEGO Hogwarts express</a> that is extremely pricey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't mind spending a bit more, there is also a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-lego-book-nook-sets">LEGO Book Nook set</a> for the Hogwarts Express that is worth checking out.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hogwarts Map</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215781"><div id="215781" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hogwarts Map</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The second Ravensburger puzzle I'm featuring on this list also depicts Hogwarts castle and grounds, but in map form. The map itself has a rather whimsical design and features a variety of notable locations including <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogsmeade" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hogsmeade</a> and the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbidden Forest</a>. The puzzle also includes a border featuring small images of various other locations from the story. At 1,500 pieces, it is a bit more challenging that some of the other puzzles on this list, but the end result is worthy of displaying.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Enchanted Car Mini Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215782"><div id="215782" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Enchanted Car Mini Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for a good Harry Potter puzzle for kids, this 100-piece mini puzzle from The New York Puzzle Company is a great option. The image shows Ron and Harry flying in the enchanted car with Hogwarts in the background. This is an iconic point of the story in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets">The Chamber of Secrets</a>, and the design of this image looks like the original cover artwork from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-books-in-order">Harry Potter books</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Gryffindor Crest Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215783"><div id="215783" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gryffindor Crest Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Every true fan knows which house they belong to. Whether you're in Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff, there is a crest puzzle available from Aquarius. I've featured the Gryffindor design here, but each house is has its own crest and background color. At just 500 pieces, these smaller puzzles are great if you want to spend an afternoon finishing a single image.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Harry Potter Puzzle for Kids</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215784"><div id="215784" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Harry Potter Puzzle for Kids</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The final Ravensburger puzzle I have on this list is specifically meant for kids. Not only is it just 100 extra-large pieces, it features bright colors and recognizable characters that make it fairly easy to put together. The box says it is meant for ages six and older, so it should be simple enough for younger kids to handle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What About Harry Potter LEGO Sets Instead?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Jigsaw puzzles are an excellent choice for any fan of Harry Potter and puzzling, but it isn't the only option available. There are a ton of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-lego-harry-potter-sets">LEGO Harry Potter sets available</a> that depict iconic scenes and characters from across the entire series. These LEGO sets <em>are</em> quite a bit more expensive than the puzzles on this list, but many of them are easier to play with and display than a simple puzzle once put together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jacob Kienlen is a Senior SEO Strategist and Writer for IGN.

Assembly is essentially a readable version of binary machine code, so Game Boy developers were communicating directly with the handheld's processing chip.</p><p>Game Boy Coding Adventure teaches you how to write and debug code with <a href="https://rgbds.gbdev.io/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RGBDS</a>, the leading open source assembler for GB and GBC software and hardware projects. You'll learn about frame pacing, programming controls, and creating sound channels. Later chapters cover more in-depth topics such as memory banking and serial communication.</p><p>The Game Boy's 8-bit graphics are built from a series of 8x8 tiles. The book teaches you all about tiles and how they are assembled by VRAM into backgrounds, windows, color palettes, and sprites--and how to animate sprites. All of the projects included in this book work on real Game Boy hardware.</p><p>It's pretty awesome that this book exists and that it was picked up and released by No Starch Press, a publisher with a strong track record with tech and gaming how-to books. No Starch Press previously published a highly rated <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Boy-Modding-Greg-Farrell/dp/1718500149?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">beginner's guide to modding Game Boy hardware</a>.

<p>Remember how much time you have sunk into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>? How about all the hours you've put into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/balatro">Balatro</a>? What if they were... in the same game?</p>
<p>Yep, you guessed it, Vampire Survivors is crossing over with Balatro in the new 'Ante Chamber' free expansion. This one arrives on most platforms today, but we'll have to wait a little longer until it lands on Switch on <strong>31st October</strong>.</p>
<p>As for what it entails, well, it's just as you might expect. There are four new characters, including Jimbo himself and a few other jester pals, four new weapons and evolutions, a brand new card-filled stage, and a sweet remix of the Balatro theme — because we <em>really</em> needed that stuck in our heads again.</p>
<p>To unlock the crossover, you'll have to track down the merchant in Moonglow and pick up the 'Joker Disk' for 50k gold. After that, the chains of upgrades and unlocks are yours to play through once you enter the new stage.</p>
<p>All of this is part of the massive ver. 1.14 update that Poncle has been teasing us with in recent weeks. The patch includes online co-op, an '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors_ode_to_castlevania">Ode to Castlevania</a>' expansion, the new 'Westwoods' mode and more.</p>
<p>We'll enjoy the free time between now and 31st Oct, because we have a feeling that another time sink might be on the horizon once this drops...</p>

              <p>Halloween’s around the corner. Got plans? No? I’m not much of a costume party person myself, so I’ll be staying in to play a bunch of spooky games, and one that has recently caught my attention features a lovely injection of PSX-style retro grunge that I struggle to not just stare into for hours as I contemplate the grim realities of existence. Sound up your alley? Good.</p> <p><i>Labyrinth of the Demon King</i> arrived earlier this year on console and PC. At first glance, I just knew it had to be added to my Steam library. It features that kind of grim, low fidelity <i>dread</i> that the original PlayStation was so good at delivering in games like <i>Silent Hill</i>. It’s dark and moody as hell, making it perfect for late night gaming sessions during the autumn months as the world grows dark and cold.</p>

  <p>A first-person dungeon crawler, expect <i>Demon King</i> to put up a fight. It can feel a little <i>Souls</i>-y with its stamina bar and emphasis on timing your attacks and dodges correctly. Enemies also don’t always go down as easily as you want them to.</p>

 <p>I’m still early on in my trip through the titular labyrinth, but the vibes of this retro-horror experience are easily going to drag me in for many more hours. The game defaults to a 4:3 perspective, reminiscent of the days when we all were gaming on square-ish screens. You can change that to 16:9 or 16:10, which makes it a great option for the Steam Deck’s taller screen format.</p> <p>The game also features a demo, so if you’re curious but aren’t sure about thinning your wallet a touch, it’s easy to jump in. Besides, you need a game to play on Halloween and those annoying kids begging for candy at the door aren’t going to ignore themselves.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-satya-nadella-xbox-halo-profit-margins-2000639721</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-boss-explains-xbox%E2%80%99s-controversial-new-approach-to-gaming.1337557/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Having failed to keep up with PlayStation through two successive hardware generations, Microsoft is <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">pivoting Xbox</a> into something other than a conventional console platform. What exact shape that will take remains to be seen, but CEO Satya Nadella just outlined three of the core principles that will seemingly guide this new era of Microsoft gaming.</p> <p>The executive, who’s currently on track to rake in almost $100 million <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadellas-total-comp-rises-to-96point5-million.html">in fresh equity awards</a>, started by reminding daily business show TBPN that the biggest gaming business in the world remains the Windows business. Everything else, including Steam, is built on top of that. And following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft is one of the biggest gaming publishers in the world. In other words, the Xbox brand <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">might be in shambles</a>, but Microsoft Gaming is bigger than ever. From there, Nadella laid out the company’s evolving approach to exclusivity, interactive content, and hardware.</p>

 <p>“We want to be a fantastic publisher, similar to the approach of what we did with Office,” he <a href="https://x.com/tbpn/status/1983231937306354078">told TBPM</a> (via <a href="https://www.threads.com/@stephentotilo/post/DQXXIhPkd65"><em>Game File</em></a>). “We’re going to be everywhere, on every platform. We want to make sure, whether it’s consoles, whether it’s the PC, whether it’s mobile, whether it’s cloud gaming, or the TV, so we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Satya Nadella says he wants Xbox gaming to be like Microsoft Office: everywhere. </p> <p>Says the best way to innovate is through strong profit margins that can support risk taking. </p> <p>Calls for new forms of interactive entertainment to compete with short form video. <a href="https://t.co/pRbIqncXCc">pic.twitter.com/pRbIqncXCc</a></p> <p>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1983264670502006799?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>Second, we also want to do innovative work in the system side on the console and on the PC. And it’s kind of funny that people think about the console-PC as two different things. We built the console, because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for gaming. And so I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom. But at the end of the day, console has an experience that is unparalleled. It delivers performance that’s unparalleled, that pushes I think, the system forward.</p> <p>So I’m really looking forward to the next console, the next PC gaming, but most importantly the game business model has to be where we have to invent maybe some new interactive media as well. Because, after all, gaming’s competition is not other gaming. Gaming’s competition is short-form video. And so if we as an industry don’t continue to innovate both how we produce, what we produce, how we think about distribution, the economic model—best way to innovate is to have good margins. Because that’s the way you can fund.</p></blockquote> <p>For anyone who’s been <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-tiktok-switch-ps5-halo-2000639241">paying attention</a> to Xbox over the last 12 months, none of this should come as a shock, though seeing it come straight from Nadella shows there’s no question that these are the new marching orders for Xbox moving forward. While the idea of a next-gen Xbox that sports a more open PC gaming ecosystem offers a lot of promise, <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-pc-windows-rog-ally-2000638181">even if it’s priced at a premium</a>, the talk of higher profit margins shows this new direction comes at a cost.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546"><em>Bloomberg</em> recently reported</a> that Microsoft CFO Amy Hood has been mandating a 30 percent profit margin target across Xbox, a sprawling gaming division where not every project is a hit and hardware has traditionally been a lossl eader in the hunt for a future upside in the form of platform fees and reoccurring customer spending. While healthy profits might give Xbox room to experiment in the future, over the last 18 months it’s meant many canceled games and shuttered studios, and thousands of layoffs.</p> <p>Treating <em>Halo</em> like Microsoft Office and shipping it everywhere might be exciting to investors but it’s not going to win much goodwill from existing fans who just saw Game Pass nearly double in price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Today’s ID@Xbox showcase featured the surprising announcement that Routine, a sci-fi horror game first announced well over a decade ago, finally has a release date: December 4.</p><p>Routine is a first-person horror game set within a lunar base sporting an aesthetic described as an '80s-era vision of the future. Players must explore the base after it goes quiet, using special tools to investigate why the station has gone dark. However, deadly machines such as killer robots roam the facility, and players are forced to sneak, run, and hide from these mechanical threats.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KHB0L55bL0s"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KHB0L55bL0s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As the debut title by Lunar Software, Routine was first announced at Gamescom 2012 with a 2013 launch window. It would suffer numerous delays as Lunar Software released updates less and less frequently; the game would fall off the map for years with nary an update, leading many to question its existence.&nbsp;</p><p>Routine <a href="https://gameinformer.com/summer-game-fest/2022/06/09/routine-resurfaces-at-summer-game-fest">re-debuted</a> during Summer Game Fest 2022, and Lunar Software explained the game's lengthy development cycle in a <a href="https://lunar-software.squarespace.com/home/message-about-our-hiatus">blog post</a>. The studio revealed it had restarted development at some point after being unhappy with the game's direction. “As we were approaching what we believed to be the end of development, we were finding more and more things that we weren’t happy with that negatively impacted the experience," said Lunar Software in 2022. "We had worked on the project for 5 years at that point and simply couldn’t release it as it was.”&nbsp;</p><p>Lunar Software also endured financial troubles that further slowed production. Things became so challenging that the designers could only work on Routine part-time while taking on other jobs to keep the studio afloat. A lifeline came when publisher Raw Fury was announced as the game's new publisher in 2022, along with the announcement that former Doom and Wolfenstein composer Mick Gordon had been enlisted to create the game's soundtrack.</p><p>It's surreal to know that Routine is finally on the horizon, and it will be very interesting to see how its spin on the “helpless protagonist” horror trend popularized by Amnesia: The Dark Descent in the early 2010s holds up in 2025. You can check out Routine on Xbox platforms and PC, and it will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/28/sci-fi-horror-game-routine-arrives-in-december-13-years-after-its-reveal]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Gameplay Group International has announced that its recently announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/12/avatar-legends-the-fighting-game-announced-releases-in-2026/">Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game</a> is getting a closed alpha soon, though no release date or way to apply has been confirmed yet. The announcement is also accompanied by some gameplay which shows Aang, Korra, and Zuko fighting each other, with Korra also entering the Avatar State towards the end of the footage.</p>

<p>Yep, this looks awesome</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Developer Fumi Games and publisher PlaySide Studios have announced that the vintage noir FPS title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mouse-p-i-for-hire">Mouse: P.I. for Hire</a> will be launching on the Switch 2 on <strong>19th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Utilising the talents of voice actor Troy Baker in the starring role, Mouse showcases stunningly authentic rubber hose animation as you explore a corrupt city full to the brim with armed gangs and crooked cops. Visually, it looks awesome, but we're equally enamoured by the gameplay, too. There are some seriously weird weapons on display!</p>
<p>We're expecting silky-smooth performance on the Switch 2, but as ever, we'll keep you updated on any new information as soon as hear. For now, if you're a fan of old-school animation and FPS games, this definitely seems like one to keep a close eye on.</p>
<p>Now let's check out the list of features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Black and white, hand-drawn rubber hose animation, inspired by cartoons of the 1930s<br>
- Fast-paced FPS combat, where constant movement is key<br>
- A thrilling single-player campaign that unravels a complex web of crime and corruption<br>
- Over 20 noir-infused levels, teeming with mice, rats and shrews<br>
- Fully-loaded arsenal of over a dozen unique weapons and equipment - with a cartoon twist<br>
- Devastating consumable power-ups, capable of turning the tide of any battle<br>
- Unlockable movement abilities and Metroidvania-inspired level traversal<br>
- Original jazz soundtrack, featuring a big band orchestral ensemble</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-missed-expectations-dont-nod-signs-deal-with-netflix/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-nod-admits-lost-records-bloom-rage-missed-expectations-signs-deal-with-netflix-to-create-new-game-based-on-%E2%80%9Ca-major-ip%E2%80%9D.1337527/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Developer and publisher DON'T NOD has <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850">published its latest financial release</a> which goes over its half-year results for 2025, which includes a few notable updates from the studio, like how its most recent release, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage performed "<em>below expectations</em>," and that the studio signed a deal with Netflix to make a narrative game based on "<em>a major IP</em>."</p>



<p>It's definitely a disappointing result for DON'T NOD, particularly considering the fact that its last major releases last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and Jusant, also fell below expectations</a>. The studio's total operating revenue took a 5% dip compared to last year for the same time period at €13.9 million.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the future appears a little more promising for DON'T NOD, with the release of its most recent published title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dont-nod-published-the-lonesome-guild-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-demo-now-on-steam/">The Lonesome Guild,</a> which arrived on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S last week on October 23, 2025.</p>



<p>More importantly, its newly signed deal with Netflix to create a new narrative title based on what's described as "<em>a major IP</em>" could prove to be a saving grace for the studio as it begins work on the title at its studio in Montreal, with Netflix signed on to publish the game.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how that goes, though, because while games with a stronger narrative focus like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Split Fiction, and Dead Take are proving there's an appetite for strong storytelling in games, Netflix <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/806303/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment-studio-shut-down">shuttered its Squid Game: Unleashed studio, Boss Fight Entertainment, just days ago</a>.</p>



<p>Could that just be Netflix wanting to move away from internally developing and publishing games going forward? Sure. Could it also be that Netflix is becoming more cautious of its participation in the video game industry overall? Absolutely, it could be. For now, it has a deal to publish this new game from DON'T NOD. Hopefully, this deal will work out for the Paris-based developer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-preservation-program-private-detectives-drm-2000635611">Digital PC gaming storefront GOG</a> has looked outside and noticed all the leaves are orange and falling to the ground. So it’s time for a big ol’ Autumn Sale! This year, GOG has marked down over 4,000 PC games, including a whole bunch of classics that are well worth checking out in 2025.</p> <p>On October 28, <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1983173386718019604">as spotted by deals guru Wario64</a>, GOG (formerly known as Good Old Games) <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/autumn_sale_2025?order=desc:bestselling&amp;discounted=true&amp;hideDLCs=true">launched its Autumn 2025 Sale.</a> The sale<a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-fall-autumn-sale-2025-best-biggest-cheapest-deals-games-pc-steamdeck-2000629959">,</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-fall-autumn-sale-2025-best-biggest-cheapest-deals-games-pc-steamdeck-2000629959">which follows Steam’s fall sale back in late September</a>, runs from now until November 4. So you’ve got about a week to pick through the huge list of discounted games and grab one (or more) to help you endure the coming weeks, which bring cold weather, snow, and family gatherings.</p>

 <p>For those curious to hop into the original<em> Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</em> ahead of (or perhaps after) playing the <a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews-round-up-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-it-good-pc-ps5-xbox-2000636600">recently released sequel,</a> you can snag the OG game for just $10. And it, like many of the games on this list, is part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">GOG’s “Good Old Game” preservation program</a>. That means it and others like it will continue to be maintained and supported by GOG for the foreseeable future, letting you easily play the original <em>Bloodlines</em> for years to come. On the flipside, if the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tron-ares-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-jared-leto-fortnite-2000632606">new <em>Tron</em> movie</a> has you in a cyber mood, just know that<em> Tron 2.0</em> isn’t part of this program. So if you grab this classic PC game as part of the sale, you may want to download some mods to help make it play and run well on modern PCs.</p> <p>Anyway, here’s a list of good games and deals I spotted in <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/autumn_sale_2025?order=desc:bestselling&amp;discounted=true&amp;hideDLCs=true">GOG’s big sale</a>.

It comes with a blaster and a blue-bladed Lightsaber, with a standard blade and one that mimics the blurred swinging effect. It’s a figure that looks good enough for adults to enjoy as a collectible, but it works equally well for play, with a suggest age range of 4+. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-dark-forces">Star Wars: Dark Forces hit PC in 1995</a>, with a port to PS1 the following year. It’s one of the early “Doom clones,” but it had strong enough story and gameplay elements to stand up on its own. Gameplay-wise, it included novel ideas like the ability to jump and duck, as well as to look up and down, all of which Doom and Doom 2 lacked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Forces is set in the (no-longer-canon) extended universe, around the time of the first Star Wars movie. It follows Kyle Katarn, a mercenary working for the Rebel Alliance, as he uncovers the Dark Troopers Project and goes about trying to stop it. This mission brings him all over the galaxy to locations like Jabba’s yacht, the Imperial mines on Gromas, inside a Star Destroyer, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Dark Forces got the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-dark-forces-remaster">remaster treatment</a> last year, making it accessible on modern platforms and tweaking its graphics and adding various quality-of-life improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hybrid-action-rpg-duet-night-abyss-launches-globally-with-new-monetization-system.1337509/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Free-to-play hybrid action RPG Duet Night Abyss is out now worldwide on PC, mobile devices, and Epic Games Store featuring a dual narrative with two protagonists, no stamina limits for movement or commissions, and no character or weapon gacha systems. Let’s get into the details of what this game has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Duet Night Abyss takes place in the world of Atlasia, where tree-like crystals called Heaventrees were viewed as gifts from the gods and gave rise to a central religion called the Elysian Church. Originally, practically everyone followed this religion, but over time, groups broke off and formed their own factions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play through the story from the perspectives of two protagonists with very different backgrounds, and you can freely choose and deploy each of them across different chapters. You’ll meet people from several of Atlasia’s different factions, and you can unlock many of them as playable characters by using character shards, which can be obtained either by buying the exact number you need for a specific character or by collecting them through gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters are not sorted into tiers or star ratings, all of them are just as viable in combat as the others. There are also no character gacha banners where you have to spend resources and just hope you eventually get what you want. You can identify the character you want, gather the required crystals, and be 100% guaranteed to unlock that character.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/image-4-1761248741433.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the developers said when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/duet-night-abyss-dev-team-discusses-the-games-narrative-combat-and-latest-updates"><u>we interviewed them in August</u></a>, this was in response to player feedback and was with the goal of making the game more accessible to free-to-play (F2P) players. And as part of the game’s global launch rewards, players can complete events to unlock seven characters for free, giving you the opportunity to build the team you want right from the start. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter what characters you want to use in battle, you can equip them with both melee and ranged weapons and swap between them on the fly. Every character has access to every weapon type, so you can freely equip them however you want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Melee weapon options include standard choices like swords, polearms, and greatswords, as well as more unique ones like the whipsword. There are also a variety of ranged options, from a bow and arrow to dual pistols, grenade launchers, and shotguns. And like characters, weapons aren’t locked behind banners and aren’t sorted into different tiers or star ratings. So you can use whichever combination of weapons you want with no optimization lost.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/melee-and-ranged-weapons-1761248804318.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat will pit you against waves of enemies in hack-and-slash action, where you’ll mow down hordes of foes in seconds. The flow of combat stays quick thanks to the fact there are several mobility options with no stamina requirements, so no need to keep your eye on a gauge to see what moves you can use. At any time, you can sprint, use a grappling hook, dodge, jump, double jump, wall jump, or Helix Leap, which in one button press allows you to cover very long distances very quickly.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/image-6-1761248842756.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can tackle commissions with up to three players in co-op mode, or go solo with two AI companions. There are no stamina restrictions for commissions either, so you’re not limited to only a certain amount of time you can play freely. And you can further customize your fighting style with Demon Wedges, which are versatile add-ons that you can obtain during commissions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Demon Wedges come in three varieties: character, melee weapon, and ranged weapon. They can provide boosts to your health, crit rate, attack speed, and other attributes. These boosts are guaranteed at a set level when you acquire and upgrade them, so you don’t have to keep grinding for the same thing and hoping to get a better version. There’s no randomization involved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of stat boosts, Demon Wedges can also change the mechanics of your characters’ attacks and skills, and you can combine these with certain weapon traits to customize your attack pattern. And once you’ve acquired a Demon Wedge, you can use it across as many characters or weapons as you want. So again, no need to farm for additional versions to equip multiple of them.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/image-7-1761248877455.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters, weapons, and Demon Wedges can all be obtained through normal gameplay. The game’s monetization model is currently focused only on cosmetics, with a range of character skins, accessories, patterns, dye colors, and weapon skins. Both outfits and weapons can be dyed, allowing for an additional level of customization.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/24/character-skins-1761338540276.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers recently unveiled new skins for the characters Psyche, Rebecca, and the duo Truffle and Filbert. They also revealed Christmas-themed skins and a new sword skin called Tough Love. And as part of the game’s global launch rewards, players can get up to 107 Pristine Hourglass and Prismatic Hourglass just for logging in. These items can be used to draw new skins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Duet Night Abyss is available to download now on PC, iOS, and Android.

		<p>Developer DON’T NOD has released a brand new trailer for its sci-fi adventure, which is due to be released in 2026. The brand new trailer confirms a second playable character to provide a different perspective to Ariane, and that new character is fellow astronaut Thomas. The two characters have different ways of dealing with things, with Ariane being more physical as she moves around while Thomas uses his mind to piece things together due to picking up an injury.</p>
<p><iframe title="Aphelion | Hide to Survive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_oUUnfGffCQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer for Aphelion also shows a creature native, named The Nemesis, to the planet Persephone stalking both astronauts, who cannot fight back. Both Ariane and Thomas will need to hide and move stealthily to avoid detection. Ariane and Thomas are not together in this journey but are looking for each other after crashing onto the planet of Persephone.</p>
<p>Aphelion is due to be released for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mtg-avatar-last-airbender-everything-you-need-to-know</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mtg-avatar-the-last-airbender-%E2%80%93-everything-you-need-to-know.1337482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> makes its way to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> in a little less than a month on November 21st, and we just got the rundown of the whole release at a press event. We have some new cards to show off, some new information, and we'll give you the rundown on things specific to this set, some of which you may know already. There's also a look at a Secret lair drop.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Where Are the Avatar: The Last Airbender Commander Decks?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>To get the biggest question out of the way, we learned why there are no precon Commander decks in the set. It seems so obvious with the four types of airbending right?&nbsp;</p>

<p>When they were preparing for this set, they sought a lot of feedback about what people wanted from an <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> set in <em>Magic</em>. The team told us the surprisingly biggest thing people were most excited about was using <em>Avatar </em>as a way to teach people in their life to play <em>Magic</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s generally one of the bonuses to Universes Beyond, but we were told that there was so much specific feedback for <em>Avatar </em>they couldn’t ignore it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it came down to it, they realized they only had the bandwidth to do one of two things: Commander or Jumpstart.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With all the feedback they got early on, they went ahead with Jumpstart.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They also added that not all of the different bending mechanics lend themselves well to a Commander deck, airbending mentioned specifically. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>What’s in the Commander’s Bundle?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Commander is not ignored, however. They are selling a Commander’s Bundle that is very similar to gift bundles in previous sets.</p>

<p>It includes 9 booster packs, one collector booster, 30 <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> lands (15 foil , 15 nonfoil), a click wheel life counter, and some Commander specific staples.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Featuring the <em>Avatar </em>art above, the bundle includes five nonfoil promo cards. Three of them are the same in each bundle: a Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, and Swiftwfoot Boots. The other two are borderless versions of “classic” Commander spells.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Jumpstart Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Jumpstart boosters make a return in <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, as discussed above. &nbsp;If you’re not familiar, these are packs of 20 cards that are all themed around one sort of mechanic or some sort of synergy.</p>

<p>With Avatar, there are 46 Jumpstart themes in total.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will also be some cards from <em>Avatar </em>that are only found in Jumpstart boosters. Here’s some of them:</p>

<p><em>Avatar </em>will join <em>Arena </em>on November 18th and will feature every card in the set, aside from some art variants that will only be in the tabletop version.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unique to <em>Arena </em>will be some sleeves, featured above. The Aang and Katara sleeves will be in various bundles you can purchase, one with a ton of packs aimed at people making decks and the other for those more interested in drafting..&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sokka sleeves will be included as part of the Mastery Pass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will be three pets to collect as well, featuring the animal companions from the show: Appa, a baby Appa, and Momo.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Avatar: The Last Airbender Bonus Sheet&nbsp;</h2>

<p>There will be a lot of source material cards in the <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> set, 61 in total. Each card will feature a frame or part of a frame of an episode from the show so all 61 episodes are represented.</p>

<p>If you look at the cards, in the bottom left you’ll see exactly which episode that card’s art is from as well. Check out some below.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair – My Cabbages!&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Unsurprisingly, there will be an <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender </em>Secret Lair superdrop. There are still details to come on that, like the rest of the drops and the release date, but they did reveal one to us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think we all saw some form of this set coming, featuring the cabbage merchant from the show. Each one features new ways his cabbages get absolutely wrecked.</p>

<h2>Art Variants in Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Bloomburrow fans who liked the field notes treatment will be happy to see it return with <em>Avatar</em>. Because the world is so full of weird and unique animals, the team thought the aesthetic fit perfectly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another is the borderless elemental frame, each of which will focus on a specific character and highlight the type of bending they are associated with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to some of the new cards shown above, here are some new cards that you likely haven’t seen yet (aside from the Appa Lands, you’ve probably seen those but if not I included them):&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>October brings with it an annual flood of big game releases but a relative desert when it comes to gaming showcases. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rtt9pnU_xA">Fall 2025 ID@Xbox livestream</a> did its best to fill that void, teasing updates and new reveal trailers for a number of smaller indie releases you probably don’t have on your radar.</p> <p>If you’re excited as I am <a href="https://kotaku.com/planet-of-lana-follows-in-limbos-lushly-illustrated-foo-1847076146">for <em>Planet of Lana 2</em></a>, you’ll be happy to hear it’s double the length and scope of the original, taking players into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trQYZNIOzBE">completely new types of environments</a>. We also got confirmation on some release dates, console ports, and Game Pass day-and-date arrivals. Remember co-op off-road trip <a href="https://kotaku.com/art-rally-over-hill-trailer-minimalist-steam-coop-1851746273"><em>Over the Hill</em></a>? It’s coming to Xbox and PC in 2026. Platformer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mcOQY8qhpU"><em>Egg On</em></a>, meanwhile, arrives November 6 via Game Pass on both console and PC. And tower defense roguelike <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kVZpnNukOU"><em>Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp;&nbsp;Road</em></a>, which I’ve really been looking forward to, arrives on the subscription service just a few weeks later on November 20.</p>

 <p>Here’s a bunch of other new game trailers that caught our eyes:</p> <h2><em>Puppergeist</em></h2>  <p>Do all dogs go to heaven? Not in this game. <em>Puppergeist</em> sees a young witch named Claire search for her puppy in the underworld. The only way to find him is by helping other haunted dogs with their troubles through rhythm-based mini-games.</p>

 <h2><em>Awaysis</em></h2>  <p>This 1-4 player co-op dungeon brawler hits Game Pass in 2026. It looks like 3D <em>Castle Crashers</em> with bigger maps and detailed physics gags.<em> Awaysis</em> bravely asks you to consider completing that epic combo while trying not to rag-doll across the level.</p>

 <h2><em>Ungodly</em></h2>  <p>Once upon a time, Mark Otero was creative director on <em>Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes</em>. Now he’s making<em> Ungodly</em>, a dark fantasy RPG from Azra Games. There are barbarians, wizards, and lots of monsters. It looks like an over-the-shoulder dungeon crawler. Unconfirmed if it will be monetized like a free-to-play mobile game or be a complete RPG experience. It was supposed to come out this winter but looks slated for later in 2026 now.</p>

 <h2><em>Task Time</em></h2>  <p><em>Task Time</em> looks like <em>Gang Beasts</em> meats <i>Fall Guys</i>, i.e. it’s a party game that takes place over a series of races in which the best-laid plans are easily ruined by a gnarly physics sandbox. “This is your new favourite friendslop,” reads the YouTube description. See, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/focus-group-man-you-have-no-good-car-ideas">they admit it</a>! Still, my kids are going to go crazy for this one, right up until it causes too much chaos and I threaten to never let them play games again.</p>

 <h2 data-cy="title2"><em>Agni: Village of Calamity</em></h2>  <p><em>Agni: Village of Calamity</em> is a horror noir police procedural set in Indonesia where a covert agent goes rogue to uncover a monster-filled conspiracy. It looks cool and creepy, like indie <em>Silent Hill</em> for Indonesian folklore.</p>

 <h2><em>Don’t Fret</em></h2>  <p>In<em> Don’t Fret</em> you play as a human guitar chased by a giant cassette tape. That’s it. That’s the game. It looks lowkey terrifying.</p> <h2><em>Darkwood 2</em></h2>  <p>The top-down survival horror game returns in an equally moody sequel. You make your way around the “scorched deserts of a dying sea” foraging for food and supplies before night falls. It features an entirely new story so you won’t need to have played the first game to enjoy it.</p> <h2><em>Routine&nbsp;</em></h2>  <p>Explore deteriorating environments. Piece together the past. Don’t get eaten by whatever’s lurking around the corner. <em>Routine</em>‘s analog ’80s flavor of survival horror has been in the making since 2012. It finally has a release date of December 4. It’ll also be day-one on Game Pass. Oh, and Mick Gordon (<em>Doom 2016</em>, <em>Doom Eternal</em>) is doing the music!</p>

Unfortunately, Blackwell Fields is a large-scale area with a ton of open ground, causing players to voice their complaints about the map.</p><p dir="ltr">Blackwell Fields is set on a massive oil field in California, with lots of open ground for snipers and long-range combat. The map offers structures like oil wells, construction equipment, and small pieces of cover, but it doesn't feel like enough to cater to all playstyles. Close-quarter tactics are difficult to utilize here, and it can feel overwhelming to try and capture points.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 10 Minutes Of Battlefield 6 Season 1 New Maps Gameplay (Blackwell Fields and Eastwood)</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oib9am/you_can_be_spawn_killed_by_aa_from_their_hq/" rel="nofollow ">Square-Border-7525</a> on Reddit, it seems players are also being spawn killed at their HQ by the map's AA guns.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, Blackwell Fields also features a lot of fire and haze effects that make visibility poor for fights at range. It can be difficult to see threats well, unless you're spotting all the sniper glints coming from the outer hillside portions of the map.</p><p dir="ltr">Many players are upset and sharing screenshots to showcase the map's poor visibility. <a href="https://x.com/BSoD__Gaming/status/1983168594084278624" rel="nofollow ">BSoD on Twitter</a> shares an image of the map and asks, "Can you see the four players crouched on this hill? No, neither can I."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/BSoD__Gaming/status/1983168594084278624" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Correction, Blackwell Fields is the new worst map in the game<br>Can you see the 4 players crouched on this hill? No, neither can I. <br>The map looks great...plays horribly. Visuals &gt; playability was a bad choice in their part. It makes a game with already bad visibility, worse. <a href="https://t.co/3cDP2NtuzG" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/3cDP2NtuzG</a> <a href="https://t.co/B5kk8wK86z" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/B5kk8wK86z</a></p>  — BSoD (@BSoD__Gaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/BSoD__Gaming/status/1983168594084278624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Of course, not everyone is going to hate Blackwell Fields. Despite the poor visibility, it seems a lot of players are sniping on this map. It also offers plenty of ground for tanks and other vehicles to dominate.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer has yet to comment on the map's poor reception, but there's still potential for the map if updates can be made to add more cover and improve visibility.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 1 also launched with Battlefield Redsec, a new free-to-play battle royale for Battlefield 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As part of Amazon’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/807825/amazon-job-layoffs-2025-ai">mass layoffs announced today</a>, the company is making “significant” changes to its gaming division, including halting much of its work on first-party AAA MMOs, according to a memo from Steve Boom, VP of audio, Twitch, and games.</p><p>“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” Boom said in the memo, which Amazon shared with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>The developers of <em>New World: Aeternum</em>, one of Amazon’s MMOs, <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world?tag=updates">have already announced plans</a> to stop providing new content updates. The team said it’s not sunsetting the game “at this time” and that “servers will be live through 2026.” The developers will provide “a minimum of six months’ notice before making any changes that impact your ability” to play the game.</p><p>Amazon also publishes the MMOs <em>Throne and Liberty</em>, which is developed by NCSoft and FirstSpark Games, and <em>Lost Ark</em>, developed by Smilegate RPG. “We will continue supporting <em>Throne and Liberty</em> and <em>Lost Ark</em> with regular updates and community engagement,” Amazon spokesperson Brittney Hefner told <em>The Verge</em>. They’ll get new content updates for the foreseeable future, Hefner confirmed.</p><p>In 2023, Amazon announced that it would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23723787/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">developing a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO</a> in partnership with Embracer Group. Amazon and Embracer didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment about that game.</p><p>Last year, Amazon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/28/24230555/amazon-games-blue-protocol-western-release-cancelled">canceled a planned Western release</a> of the Bandai Namco-developed MMO <em>Blue Protocol</em>, which was shuttered in Japan in January.</p><p>Amazon isn’t fully pulling back on its work in games. Boom pointed to the launch of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789658/amazon-luna-cloud-relaunch-gamenight-social-gaming">revamped Luna</a> and said that its Studio 5 team, which developed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnqfKmQd2Hs">courtroom game with an AI Snoop Dogg</a> for the cloud gaming service, will “continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games, optimized for Luna.” He also said Luna is a “great example” of “how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon” because it “leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members.”</p><div><p>In addition, Boom highlighted a “successful closed alpha” for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDAH6H-5TOs">the MOBA <em>March of Giants</em></a> and noted that Amazon is still working with Crystal Dynamics on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/15/23510923/amazon-tomb-raider-game-crystal-dynamics">a new <em>Tomb Raider</em> game</a> (Amazon is also making <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770357/amazon-lara-croft-tomb-raider-sophie-turner-series">a <em>Tomb Raider</em> series</a>) and with Maverick Games on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24166351/amazon-maverick-games-publishing-deal-forza-ps5-xbox">a new open-world driving game</a>.</p></div><p>You can read Boom’s full memo below.</p><div><blockquote><p>Dear Games Team,</p><p>This morning, we are making a number of changes in our Games business. While you’ve likely seen Beth Galetti’s note earlier this morning regarding the larger changes at Amazon that are taking place today, I wanted to dive a bit deeper with all of you, since the strategic changes we are making in Games go beyond what is happening company-wide.</p><p>Over the last several months, we’ve been evaluating our go-forward plans, specifically through the lens of our mission to deliver the very best gaming experiences to customers while leaning into the things that Amazon does best. We believe that this is how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon. Last week’s launch of the all-new Luna is a great example, as it leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members, two tenets that are always top of mind in our group. Luna launched with a great catalog of social party games and AAA blockbusters, and we have a lot more to come from Jeff’s team on that front…it’s still Day 1.</p><p>We’ve also taken a critical look at the evolving dynamics of games industry and competitive landscape. While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team.</p><p>While these changes are significant, we still have a lot going on in game development. Our Montreal studio recently concluded a successful closed alpha of March of Giants and is working hard to finish the game. Our Studio 5 team just released <em>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg</em> as the launch title in Luna and will continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games, optimized for Luna. Finally, we are continuing to work with our external studio partners Crystal Dynamics on an upcoming <em>Tomb Raider</em> title and Maverick Games on an upcoming open world driving game.</p><p>Over the course of the day, both Christoph and Jeff will reach out with more details on how these changes will affect you and your teams. Most countries with impacted employees have been notified. Our other global hubs will follow local processes and be notified at a later date.</p><p>There is no getting around the fact that days like this are hard, and we will be losing team members whose work and dedication have had an incredible impact on our customers over the years. We don’t make these decisions lightly, and yet they are necessary for us to continue to drive our business forward.</p><p>Please reach out directly to your manager or to your HRBP with any specific questions.</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Steve</p></blockquote></div><p><em><strong>Updates, October 28th:</strong> Added details from the </em>New World: Aeternum <em>team</em> <em>and from Amazon about two of its other MMOs</em>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/808332/amazon-gaming-layoffs-mmo-aaa-first-party-games]]></content:encoded>
