                <p dir="ltr">In September 2021, a massive leak at Nvidia revealed multiple then-unannounced projects, and as years have passed since the leak, all but one of the leaked titles associated with Square Enix has been officially confirmed. That one is a remake of Final Fantasy IX, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary today--and Square Enix has commemorated the milestone by fueling those remake rumors with a new anniversary video.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/remake-reports-persist-as-square-enix-releases-final-fantasy-9-anniversary-movie/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, the minute-long video--set to the iconic song Melodies of Life from the FFIX soundtrack--runs through key moments from the ninth Final Fantasy adventure, with shots of main characters Zidane, Garnet, Vivi, and more peppered throughout. The video ends with new artwork of the team, with the words "Final Fantasy IX 25th Anniversary" included.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFDDlEaUXxw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oFDDlEaUXxw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The video has intensified the rumors of a remake which began with the Nvidia leak, with many wondering if the project is still in development. Prominent leaker NateTheHate, in a <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1942164160365703368" rel="nofollow ">comment on a ResetEra thread about the video</a>, mentioned that, perhaps, the remake may no longer be coming.</p><p dir="ltr">"As of last check it remains in development, to my knowledge," NateTheHate's <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-launches-final-fantasy-ix-25th-anniversary-news-page-on-the-final-fantasy-portal-site.1149465/page-31#post-142366968" rel="nofollow ">comment reads</a>, "but I need to do a fresh check and see what a more current status is--as I did hear a month or so ago that it was in trouble and possibly canceled.

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> team has shared a new piece of artwork for the mobile game's 9th anniversary, hinting that a few familiar faces may be joining very soon.</p>
<p>This artwork reveals Paradox Pokémon - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-scarlet-violet-paradox-iron-valiant-roaring-moon-locations-9015">first appeared in  Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> - could well be heading to Pokémon Go. Paradox Pokémon are a special collection of Pokémon, and are either a futuristic or prehistoric version of a present day Pokémon. In the new artwork, we can see both Great Tusk (an Ancient Pokémon) and Iron Treads (a Future Pokémon).</p>

<p>In addition to these two, we can see a Mega Butterfree, another yet-to-be-released Pokémon for PoGo. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-gen-6-list-x-y-kalos-region-7002">steel/ghost type Pokémon Aegislash is also in the artwork</a>, and will be arriving with the Steel and Scales event this month.</p>
<p>In addition to potential and confirmed upcoming Pokémon, it also looks like a new feature will be coming to PoGo. This is based on the character towards the left-hand side of the anniversary artwork, who is getting a thumbs up from a wrist communicator. <a href="https://x.com/ThatMonadoBoy/status/1941996071514763526">Some have suggested remote trading</a>, but it remains to be seen for now. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the inclusion of Zygarde 50 percent Forme may well be hinting at a future Route / Zygarde event. Hopefully the Pokémon Go team will reveal all soon, stay tuned!</p>

			<p>The troubles at Xbox may be far from over, as Microsoft's CFO has set an "utterly unrealistic" financial target for the division that will continue to hurt the company's gaming division in the future.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, Windows Central's Jez Corden revealed on X that Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood supposedly has given Xbox an utterly unrealistic financial requirement that will continue to hurt the division, suggesting that the troubles that led to the latest waves of layoffs are far from being over. The Verge's Tom Warren chimed in on the discussion, saying that these requirements are the reality of the Xbox business following the Activision Blizzard acquisition. Without the deal, Tom Warren added, revenue would be down, and the Game Pass gamble hasn't paid off yet.</p>

<p>Last week's wave of layoffs at Xbox has been particularly impacftful for a lot of game development studios under the umbrella of Microsoft's gaming division, such as Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10, which has lost over 70 employees and has reportedly been turned into a Forza Horizon support studio, Rare, whose Everwild project has been canceled, and The Initiative, which was completely shut down following the cancellation of the Perfect Dark series reboot. ZeniMax Online, developer of The Elder Scrolls Online, was also impacted by the cancellation of their next MMORPG, which was reportedly turning out so well that Xbox head Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">loved the game</a> when he played it back in March. Other partner studios were also heavily impacted by the latest wave of layoffs, such as Romero Games, the studio founded by the DOOM series co-creator John Romero and his wife Branda Romero, which also  shut down following the cancellation of the studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/">next FPS</a>.</p>

        <p>As EU petition surpasses 1m signatures.</p>

            <p>
Last week, Stop Killing Games - the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">consumer-driven initiative</a> demanding games publishers leave their titles in a playable state once support is terminated - surpassed 1m signatures. But now, EU industry body Video Games Europe - which represents the likes of Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - has weighed in, insisting the initiative's proposals would make games "prohibitively expensive to create".
</p>
<p>
Stop Killing Games was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">launched last April by Accursed Farms YouTuber Ross Scott</a>, calling upon video game fans around the world to petition their local governments regarding the increasingly common occurrence of purchased games becoming unplayable due to publisher actions. The games preservation movement was prompted by Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">shut down open-world racer The Crew's servers last March</a>, preventing access to both its multiplayer and single-player content due to its always-online nature. More controversy followed shortly after, when the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">began revoking customers' licenses to the game,</a> permanently removing it from their libraries and preventing hopes of resurrecting it through private servers.
</p>
<p>
After a year of campaigning and with an official deadline looming, last week finally saw Stop Killing Games' European petition surpass the 1m signatures needed for it to be submitted to the EU for verification and then, potentially, either progress to a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament. However, as that milestone was reached, organiser Scott <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1940798871678210158">warned many of those signatures could be invalid</a> due to mistakes or deliberate spoofing (a practice he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmkCQJrc9n4">later noted</a> was illegal on official government petitions such as this), suggesting the real tally was likely around 600–700k genuine signatures. As such, he encouraged EU citizens to continue signing it legitimately before the deadline to ensure it passes the approval process.
</p>
<p>
Yet while the exact number of legitimate petition signatures remains unclear at present, it seems the threat of its success - and a potential parliamentary hearing - has spooked video games publishers enough to spur them into action. A statement from industry body and lobbying group Video Games Europe, which represents over 30 major publishers and national trade associations around Europe, has now been <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/">shared on its website</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We appreciate the passion of our community," it reads. "However, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable. We understand that it can be disappointing for players but, when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws."
</p>
<p>
"Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players," it continues, "as the protections we put in place to secure players' data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable. In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create.
</p>
<p>
"We welcome the opportunity to discuss our position with policy makers and those who have led the European Citizens Initiative in the coming months."
</p>
<p>
Stop Killing Games organiser Scott <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1941562023973883972">shared a brief response to Video Games Europe's statement on social media</a>, calling its arguments against allowing customers to keep their purchases "flimsy". Scott added he'd provide a more lengthy video response soon.
</p>
<p>
Away from Stop Killing Games' EU activities, the initiative's <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">official UK petition</a> has now surpassed over 150K signatures. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/favourite-game-no-longer-playable-uk-government-says-it-wont-tighten-rules-to-punish-publishers-who-switch-off-servers">previous government response</a>, mandatory for any parliamentary petition that surpasses 10K signatures, said: "There are no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games". However, having now passed the 100K signatures threshold, the petition must now be considered for a debate in parliament.

<p>In sickness and in stealth</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>While Kojima fans on Switch might be feeling a little left out with all the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2</a> buzz, not to mention the lack of 60fps options in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid_master_collection_vol_1">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1</a> (we've still got our fingers crossed for a Switch 2 update), it seems like Rainy Frog and the one-person dev Rainy Night Creations might have a little something to help scratch your itch. As long as you're looking for retro-styled stealth, that is; Dollman lovers won't find what they're looking for here. Probably.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spy_drops">Spy Drops</a> isn't shy about showing love for its stealth-action influences, that's for sure. Coming to Switch (and Steam) on 31st July, the game's story features the requisite elements of shadowy operations and shady operatives. The plot apparently unravels through randomised missions that feature PS1-style visuals and gameplay that is very explicitly channelling the escapades of one Solid Snake.</p>
<p>It seems you'll get plenty of familiar spy tech — night vision goggles, drones, grenades — you know, the essentials. The PR blurb also mentions a "Dream Catcher," which you can use to "infiltrate the minds of soldiers and discover the locations of the next targets." As you do.</p>
<p>Beyond the gameplay, one aspect definitely worth noting is that the character designs in this one have been handled by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/companies/artepiazza">ArtePiazza</a>, the Japanese developer with a rich history with Square Enix and the <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> series, and who most recently worked on the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_rpg">Super Mario RPG</a> Switch remake.</p>
<p>The trailer above gives you a great idea of just how authentic-feeling the game's looking compared to the late-'90s classics it's aping. Here are a few screens and some more details from the press release:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A story that takes a turn….</strong><br>
As your mission unfolds, so does the truth behind it. What was believed to be a world-saving op in stopping a global threat quickly spirals into something far more sinister. Who can you trust when the people giving you the orders are hiding behind the biggest lie and conspiracy?<br>
-<strong>Forever replayable:</strong> experience randomly generated missions, letting you enjoy a fresh story and new challenges every time you play.<br>
- <strong>Dynamic Gameplay:</strong> from map layouts to enemy placements, no two missions are alike. Even the weather and time of day will keep you on your toes!<br>
- <strong>Stealth with Style:</strong> upgrade your character, master new stealth skills, and become the ultimate spy.<br>
- <strong>Spy Against Spy Mode:</strong> take on a friend in a head-to-head local multiplayer showdown. Who’s the better agent?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's tough to tell without getting our hands on it, but it certainly looks the part, and we're intrigued by the mention of spy versus spy local competitive multiplayer, too.</p>
<p>It's out at the end of the month for £13.99/$14.99, so we can only hope that the impeccable visual vibes carry over into Spy Drops' infiltration gameplay. Let us know below if your fancy is piqued.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-ix-remake-may-be-in-trouble-and-could-have-been-canceled-%E2%80%93-rumor.1237137/</guid>

			<p>The development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/">rumored Final Fantasy IX remake</a> may be in trouble, and the game could have been canceled altogether, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-launches-final-fantasy-ix-25th-anniversary-news-page-on-the-final-fantasy-portal-site.1149465/post-142366968">ResetERA forums</a>, well-known insider NateDrake commented on the current status of the unannounced remake, saying that, last the insider checked, the game was still in development. However, a fresh check may be needed, as around a month ago, the insider was told the game was in trouble and possibly had been cancelled. Only one source talked about the cancellation, so the information needs to be verified first, the insider added.</p>



<p>The possibility of the Final Fantasy IX remake having been cancelled couldn't have come at a worse time, as today marks the game's 25th anniversary. Many expected July 7 would be the perfect day to announced the rumored remake, but Square Enix, however, only released a special anniversary movie, which you can watch below, to mark the occasion. You can watch the movie below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake was originally revealed via a massive GeForce NOW database leak, which revealed a lot of unreleased projects at the time. In Square Enix's case, every game revealed by the leak proved to be real, with the exception of the remake of the ninth entry in the popular JRPG series, so there's no doubt that it has been in the works at some point. Hopefully, development hasn't been canceled, and players will be able to travel across the world of Gaia with Zidane and his companions again to experience one of the best entries in the series like they never did before.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The writer and producer of sci-fi anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners said he doesn't want to write a jolly story for the series, because "when people are sad", it makes him "a bit happy".</p>
<p>Edgerunners is an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-edgerunners-shows-cd-projekts-cyberpunk-is-still-worth-fighting-for">animated spin-off of CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-cyberpunk-2077-anime-edgerunners-arrives-13th-september">first debuted in 2022</a>. Following acclaim, a second season is now in production for Netflix. </p><p>

News of this next season arrived during Anime Expo, along with a new trailer. "Night City lives on," reads the official blurb. You can check out the trailer below.

<p>At the same event, a Cyberpunk: Edgerunners panel was held, where writer Bartosz Sztybor was asked about the human stories told within Edgerunners' dystopian world. Here, the show's writer replied that this type of narrative is incredibly important for CDPR, and the team always wants to "write stories that are character driven".</p>
<p>Sztybor then elaborated on this point further stating: "But the other thing is that we are a company from Poland. I'm from Poland and people in Poland are sad. They are born sad, they die sad, so I just wanted to make the whole world sad." This was met with plenty of laughter from his audience.</p>
<p>When asked if he had ever considered changing things up a bit, and perhaps offering up some joyful story lines, Sztybor replied, "no", with the panel's host joking the writer liked to feast on others' misery.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for the second season of Edgerunners yet, with the team merely saying it will arrive on Netflix when it is ready. We do know, though, that it will comprise 10 episodes, and feature a standalone story within the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>The Edgerunners team promise "a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge" on the second season's debut. "In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter," the blurb teases.</p>
<p>As for Cyberpunk 2077 itself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">it is now available on Switch 2</a>. Our pals at Digital Foundry have taken the game out for a spin on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> already, asking the question: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">Can the new Nintendo console handle it?</a></p>
<p>In addition, the team at CDPR are currently cooking up another update for Cyberpunk 2077, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-new-update-will-have-scope-similar-to-22-as-cd-projekt-announces-delay">which will have "scope similar" to 2.2</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/when-people-are-sad-im-a-bit-happy-cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-two-is-going-to-be-sadder-bloodier-and-darker]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following Microsoft's latest round of layoffs, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw over 9K lose their jobs</a>, including many at various Xbox-owned gaming studios, former Arkane founder Raphael Colantonio <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941503596870369388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to X</a> to explain that, in his opinion, Game Pass is one of the main culprits, not to mention potentially damaging to the industry as a whole.</p>



<p><em>Why is no one talking about the elephant in the room? Cough cough (Game Pass). I think Game Pass is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by Microsoft’s “infinite money”, but at some point, reality has to hit. I don’t think GP can co-exist with other models; they’ll either kill everyone else or give up.</em></p>



<p><em>What might happen once Microsoft has won: the games will start to suck and your sub will go up. Why? Because the current amazing deal you have is subsidized by Microsoft bleeding money into it with the hope they’ll kill the competition, but once they manage to do it, things will get real</em>.</p>



<p>Colantonio is in tune with Rhys Elliott, Head of Market Analysis at Alinea, who also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believes</a> that Microsoft bet on the wrong horse by putting so much effort into pushing its Game Pass subscription service. Games simply do not work in the same way as film or music since they take much longer to consume, and there's only so much spare time that users can dedicate to entertainment.</p>



<p>Anyway, Colantonio later added that Game Pass could only co-exist if it's focused on back catalogue games.</p>



<p><em>I’m fed up with all the BS they fed us at first, like “don’t worry, it doesn’t impact the sales”, only to admit years later that it totally does. “No shit it does! Really?” The only way Game Pass can co-exist without hurting everyone is for the back catalogue.</em></p>



<p>This is essentially Sony's strategy with PlayStation Plus: <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-says-playstation-plus-engagement-has-never-been-higher-still-wont-add-first-party-games-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never put big games there on day one</a>, only add them at a later date, when they enter the back catalogue phase. However, Microsoft is currently still very much keen to maintain its promise to consumers to bring all of its games to Game Pass when they launch. Even so, despite adding franchises like Call of Duty, Diablo, Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and DOOM, the total number of subscribers is believed to be around 35 million, far lower than Microsoft's lofty goals.</p>



<p>As a side note, Raphael Colantonio is the studio founder of WolfEye Studios, which made <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weird West</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/weird-west-i-kicked-a-bird-and-i-liked-it/" target="_blank">.</a>&nbsp;The studio is now developing a retro sci-fi first-person action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dishonored-with-more-rpg-elements-and-shooter-gameplay-is-apparently-an-apt-description-for-wolfeyes-next-game/" target="_blank">inspired by Dishonored</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-expands-publishing-portfolio-with-wolfeye-studios-partnership/" target="_blank">published by NEOWIZ</a>. It's not the first time Colantonio slams Microsoft, by the way—</span>that already happened <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkane-founder-slams-microsoft-for-closing-the-austin-studio-explains-why-immersive-sims-arent-mainstream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following last year's decision to close Arkane Austin</a>, his former studio. </p>

            <p>Evacuate your Deep Desert tents, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>'s latest patch enacts a timer tweak aimed at eliminating cheeky PvP zone border camping. It's also added some extra rewards to the Landsraad and switched up how goodies are distributed to PvE players.</p>
<p>This patch comes as Funcom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">continue to respond</a> to player feedback about the endgame loop, having already moved to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-devs-arent-waiting-the-deep-deserts-huge-new-pve-area-has-already-been-patched-into-the-full-game">split the </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-how-to-enter-deep-desert">Deep Desert</a> between PvP and PvE in order to placate folks who aren't a fan of the latter. Griefing's also been a big topic of debate, with ornithopters proving just as deadly as those big worms.</p>

<p>While Dune: Awaking <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-15-0-patch-notes/">patch 1.1.15.0</a> isn't massive, it's delivered some changes that're well worth the attention of those who've been sinking as many hours into the game as there are grains of sand on Arrakis.</p>
<p>First of all, the good news. Those who've been craving Landsraad rewards that don't depend on you getting in uber-quick and being the first to complete a task after it goes live can breathe a sigh of relief. You'll now get a "personal contribution" reward from turning in kills or deliveries on completed tasks, with the winning faction and how many guild votes were awarded staying set in stone.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Beyond that, the patch's other biggest talking point is that the delay timer you're hit with when leaving a PvP security zone has been "increased from five to 30 seconds to prevent border camping and allow PvP players to protect their area." Folks seem <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1ltph12/11150_patch_notes/">pretty split</a> at first glance as to whether this change'll be good or bad for would-be griefers, so we'll just have to see how it plays out in practice.</p>
<p>There are also a number of tweaks to crafting component, resource, and unique loot drops/spawns in the Deep Desert. "Tier 6 resources can now be collected across wider areas in the PvE part of the Deep Desert" is the headliner, and Funcom's added "an element of randomization to the respawn timer of unique loot containers" in the DD.</p>
<p>Rounding out the most noteworthy stuff to my eye, you can listen out for "a new audio alert" signaling PvP zone changes, and they claim they've fixed an exploit that somehow let you build vehicles with items from another player’s inventory.</p>
<p>Funcom have also "reduced the cases where the sandworm can push vehicles under terrain", which is good news for those keen to avoid a gitchy demise. Or maybe you liked having your Sandbike nudged into the terrifying void under the map. To each their own.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-latest-patch-takes-aim-at-pvp-border-campers-and-dishes-out-some-extra-landsraad-rewards]]></content:encoded>

            <p>One of the co-founders of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio Unknown Worlds has made a statement about the dramatic reshuffle of management at the studio, saying that it "stings" to have the game and company taken away from him by publishing overlords Krafton. He also asserts that the game is "ready for early access", but that Krafton may disagree. It doesn't explicitly answer any of the outstanding questions about what actually happened at the studio to cause the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">axing of three senior leaders last week</a>. But it does provide some clues.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For background, three chiefs at Unknown Worlds were "replaced" last week by the studio owners Krafton, who installed a new figure as CEO of the company. Co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max MacGuire, plus former CEO Ted Gill, were all summarily ousted from their positions. In their place Krafton shipped in Steve Papoutsis, a producer who has worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> series. </p>
<p>The exact reasons remain cloudy, but the language of Krafton's original press release suggested a disatisfaction with the pace at which Unknown Worlds was working. Following the power shuffle, Unknown Worlds <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-creators-offer-no-explanation-for-sudden-regime-change-instead-promise-no-loot-boxes">also released a statement</a> that asked fans to be patient while Papoutsis found his feet on the project. It didn't clear much up.</p>

<p>Now, co-founder Charlie Cleveland has spoken about the events in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/">a statement posted across social media</a>, saying that it hurts to find himself out of the studio. He writes at length about the studio's history, and significantly notes that Subnautica 2 is the second most-wishlisted game on Steam.</p>
<p>"So you can see why for Max, Ted, myself, the Unknown Worlds team, and for our community, the events of this week have been quite a shock. We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it. And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings."</p>
<p>The assertion that the game is "ready for early access" raises an eyebrow, as it seems to contradict Krafton's version of events. In their statement, they said that the studio under Papoutsis would have to commit to "clearly defined metrics and targets" presumably hitting the demanded quality by set deadlines. "This process is essential to delivering the right game at the right time," they said. They didn't mention any internal disagreement over whether the game was currently ready or not.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Krafton</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Altogether this suggests that the leadership of Unknown Worlds and their business daddies at Krafton were at loggerheads over the quality of the early access build, which was intended to release some time in 2025 with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-early-access-should-last-2-to-3-years-itll-launch-with-several-biomes-and-some-narrative">an early access life of 2-3 years</a> before hitting 1.0. Elsewhere in the statement, Cleveland talks about the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, and says: "There's no way it would've been as successful if we had waited until v1.0 before releasing it to the public." </p>
<p>This may help explain why Papoutsis was parachuted in. For context, Unknown Worlds are known for transparent and steady-paced development through early access. Papoutsis' studio Striking Distance is known for releasing a shonky shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/callisto-protocol-director-takes-responsibility-for-crunching-staff">badly affected by intense crunch</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Cleveland's statement does not go into the specifics of the falling out, beyond those assertions. So there are likely wrinkles to the drama we still don't know. His statement is mostly a nostalgic waltz through his career at the studio, which began as a group of modders. He does end with the line "this is not where the story ends", although doesn't specify if this means a new venture in video games, or something from his <a href="https://www.abyssal.co/">AI-assisted movie company</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the release schedule for Subnautica 2 itself seems to be under review. "An update to our schedule and more information, including the Early Access timeline, will be coming soon," said Unknown Worlds. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has released a special movie to celebrate the 25th anniversary of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>, but fans are still left wondering what's going on with the rumoured remake.</p>
<p>The movie is just a minute long, and is essentially a highlights reel from the game's FMV sequences, edited over a new recording of the game's iconic theme song Melodies of Life.</p>
<p>The video follows a number of other small releases in the run up to the anniversary. Back in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/official-final-fantasy-9-25th-anniversary-website-ignites-remake-hopes-once-again">Square Enix launched a 25th anniversary website</a> for the game that's slowly been updated with new artwork in celebration of the game's Japanese release on 7th July 2000 (it was released in the UK a year later in 2001).</p>

<p>New merchandise has also been released, and - perhaps most interestingly - a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5605">new prequel picture book has been released</a> from the game's event designer Kazuhiko Aoki and character designer Toshiyuki Itahana. It details how adorable black mage Vivi got his name - I won't spoil anything here.</p>
<p>So where, then, is the rumoured remake?</p>
<p>The rumour began back in 2021, as part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidia-acknowledges-leaked-pc-game-list-including-god-of-war-and-final-fantasy-7-remake">infamous Nvidia leak</a> which included a number of unreleased and unannounced Square Enix games. The leak has proven to be accurate so far, following the likes of the Chrono Cross remaster, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-real">recently revealed Final Fantasy Tactics remaster</a>. The Final Fantasy 9 remake is now the only remaining officially unannounced Final Fantasy game from the leak.</p>
<p>As on the anniversary website, a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5481">new vinyl subtitled Timeless Tales</a> is due for release later this week on 9th July - some fans believe this may be the name of the remake itself too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s latest expansion, Dawntrail, also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-patch-72-due-end-of-march-with-even-more-final-fantasy-9-references">heavily references Final Fantasy 9</a>. This could be coincidence considering the MMORPG regularly references past games, but its director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has denied remaking Final Fantasy 9.</p>
<p>With this 25th anniversary, Square Enix seems to be really pushing Final Fantasy 9. The company announced earlier this year the game had sold 8.9m units worldwide, but this is less than many others in the series, not only including renowned favourite Final Fantasy 7 and the widely released Final Fantasy 15, but also Final Fantasy 8 and 10 - the two games either side of FF9. Where was Final Fantasy 8's big 25th anniversary?</p>
<p>Released late in the PS1's lifecycle, Final Fantasy 9 launched a year after Final Fantasy 8, which proved popular for its realistic graphical style, and a year before Final Fantasy 10 on the more powerful PS2. Though critically well-received, Final Fantasy 9 hasn't always been the most popular of the series.</p>
<p>Still, a remake of the game would be great timing for Square Enix. The game's original PS1 release was seen as a callback to the origins of the series, with its more medieval setting and cartoonish art style. A remake release now - if it stayed true to the original - would parallel this callback at a time Square Enix needs it most.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy 7 Remake series</a> has proven divisive in its approach to a remake, despite some welcome modernisation, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-has-me-questioning-the-essence-of-the-series">Final Fantasy 16</a> was exemplary for some fans of Square Enix's decision to move further into action game territory.</p>
<p>A remake of Final Fantasy 9 would return the company to its turn-based roots and bring newer fans into the series with a classic remake. But at this point, Square Enix is just leaving us waiting.</p>
<p>If you're yet to play Final Fantasy 9, a remaster is already available across PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and mobile.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrates-final-fantasy-9s-25th-anniversary-so-wheres-the-rumoured-remake]]></content:encoded>

<p>Looking at the post above, you might think that's a stretch, but this reply from <a href="https://x.com/NitroExists/status/1942003844927435200" tabindex="-1">@NitroExists</a> helps illustrate how people have been matching the blurred and dimmed box art from the trailer. Observe:</p>


<p>Now, does this mean all these games are definitely coming to the N64 NSO app? Not necessarily, and despite being convincing, it's also possible the matches aren't 100%. It's <em>also</em> possible the team just added placeholder art for the sake of testing and the person making the trailer assumed that no one would be able to ID the art. Even if these are correct, it still doesn't confirm an official NSO release is on the cards.</p>
<p>However, all of the suggested games are possible. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">DK64</a>'s arrival to help promote <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> on Switch 2 feels very obvious, and surely it's only a matter of time until Smash Bros. and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Melee</a> end up on the subscription service. Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/glover">Glover</a> may seem unlikely given that it's already available on the Switch eShop, but so is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/turok">Turok</a>, and that's playable via NSO.</p>
<p>And happily, Forsaken was one of the games we wished could be added in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/9-mature-games-wed-love-to-see-on-nintendo-switch-onlines-new-n64-app">a feature we worked up last year</a> when the 'Mature' app appeared. We'd love to see that one added, too.</p>
<p><em>Do you think we'll be seeing these games on NSO in the future, near or far? Let us know in the usual place.</em></p>

<p>Colantonio then brought up Xbox's public denial and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-admits-game-pass-cannibalizes-sales">later admission</a> - in documents related to the Activision Blizzard merger - that Game Pass impacts direct game sales. He also suggested that Microsoft's stated goal of <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/behind-microsofts-layoffs-a-new-attitude-shaped-by-ai/">cutting costs to invest heavily in AI</a> was a "bs excuse" for the layoffs.</p>
<p>It's worth noting here that Microsoft laid off around 2,500 workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">across</a> its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsofts-mass-layoffs-will-affect-starfield-halo-infinite-and-gears-of-war-developers">gaming</a> division in 2024, with more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-is-laying-off-even-more-of-its-staff-with-potentially-almost-7000-workers-at-risk">across the company this year</a>, prior to the current round. It seems unlikely investments into AI have played no part in numbers like this. A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/">recent Wired report</a> (paywalled) implies significant correlation between studios adopting AI tools for specific disciplines before laying off workers that specialise in those areas, as was the case with ActiBlizz laying off artists after putting up Call Of Duty GenAI cosmetics for sale.</p>
<p>According to Colantonio's own math, however, the funds sunk into Game Pass are still significant. "When a deal is too good, there is a reason," he wrote. "They are still not profitable after 8 years, they are still in customer acquisition phase, hoping one day the subscription revenue will be &gt; to the investments ($100B in acquisitions+licensing+dev costs). Do the math, they have 35m subscribers, including the $1."</p>
<p>As IGN note, Xbox don't report on the financials of Game Pass in detail, though they have shared that "Xbox content and services grew 8% year-over-year, which was in part due to growth in Xbox Game Pass. PC Game Pass revenue increased 45% year-over-year".</p>
<p>"What *might* happen once MS has won: the games will start to suck and your sub will go up," Colantonio wrote. "Why? Because the current amazing deal you have is subsided by MS bleeding money into it with the hope they’ll kill the competition".</p>
<p>This line of argument echoes <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/former-xbox-executive-nervous-about-industry-impact-of-game-pass-3231799">comments made by former Xbox exec Ed Fries</a> on a podcast in 2022. "Game Pass scares me because there’s a somewhat analogous thing called Spotify that was created for the music business,” Fries said. “So we have to be careful we don’t create the same system in the game business. These markets are more fragile than people realise.”</p>
<p>Josh Herrman of The Intelligencer <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/10/spotify-is-eating-the-entire-music-business.html">described Spotify's 2022 financials</a> as a "weird, loser-take-all outcome — which happens from time to time in tech, where dominant firms are allowed to bleed money for years in pursuit of long-term sector domination". The music streaming giant has been long-criticised for giving artists the raw end of the deal, leaving them to rely on touring and merch sales for an income.</p>
<p>Whether this translates directly to games is contested, however. Here's a<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167811625000187"> 2025 study for the International Journal of Research in Marketing</a> arguing that Game Pass and PS Plus have "limited impact on video game revenue (contrary to the cannibalizing effects observed in the music, movie and TV industry)."</p>
<p>"Only the gamers like it because the offer is too good to be true," said Colantonio, "but eventually even gamers will hate it when they realize the effects on the games.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-pass-will-either-kill-everyone-else-or-give-up-says-dishonored-and-prey-dev-arkane-founder]]></content:encoded>

Both are versions of the classic Pokémon Donphan — and now fans are debating how Paradox Pokémon will debut. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, players can encounter Paradox Pokémon in the wild — though in Pokémon Go, there's an expectation that these powerful creatures will likely pop up in raids, similar to how the Ultra Beasts from Pokémon Sun and Moon debuted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paradox Pokémon originally being spotted in Scarlet/Violet's "Area Zero" crater has meanwhile led some fans to suggest the species would be a good fit for this year's Pokémon Go Wild Area event, which is designed to feel like something of a safari. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">22 Paradox Pokémon species exist, with a selection of more common and Legendary Pokémon remixed. Jigglypuff gets a billion-year-old variant named Scream Tail, for example, while the Legendary Terrakion gets a new variant, Iron Boulder, that looks like an anime robot. Regardless of how some of the Paradox species are introduced, these new versions of Legendary creatures seem most likely to be found in raids.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/07/xxwyyaad4cbf1-1751879193869.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go's 9th Anniversary artwork.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One note of caution about Pokémon Go's anniversary artwork is that the game has, on occasion, not always followed through with what these images have set up. Fans have been quick to point to past teases for Mega Mewtwo and fan-favorite Ghost critter Mimikyu in previous annual artworks, only to not materialise. But Pokémon Go's developer has seemingly become wiser to these expectations — and indeed Paradox Pokémon are the logical choice for the next big selection of creatures to join the game, after the recent debut of Gigantamax creatures, the fully-launched Ultra Beasts and almost all Mega Pokémon now being available. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other teases in this year's artwork include Gigantamax Butterfree, which fans expect to debut soon, Mega Metagross, one of the game's last remaining Mega species yet to turn up, and a player avatar receiving a virtual thumbs up (which some fans are taking as a sign that remote communication or even remote trading might be arriving). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's Zygarde, star of the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> for Switch and Switch 2. While already in Pokémon Go, fans are currently limited to having just one of the creature. Could we see more become available, and potentially through Mega Raids, if Zygarde does get a Mega in Z-A? As with the temporally-divergent Paradox Pokémon themselves, time will tell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Pokémon Go's developer said it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-developer-acknowledges-golden-pokstop-issue-ruining-games-big-9th-anniversary-event-now-investigating-fix">investigating an issue with Golden PokéStops that intefered with in-game 9th anniversary celebrations</a>.

            <p>Are you pretty happy right now? Well, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2, the follow-up to that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> Netflix anime, will make you nice and miserable when it arrives.</p>
<p>CD Projekt <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51617/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-is-now-in-production">revealed</a> this past weekend that the upcoming series, which'll deliver a fresh standalone tale set in Night City, is currently in production. Animation studio Trigger have returned to work on Edgerunners 2, with Kai Ikarashi directing and Bartosz Sztybor wearing many hats as writer/showrunner/producer. Right, from here on there'll be spoilers for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-finally-slides-its-futuristic-motorbike-onto-netflix-today">first Cyberpunk Edgerunners series</a>, so you've been warned.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We didn't get a release date for the 10 episode series as part of this official announcement that Edgerunners 2 is in the works, with CD Projekt only revealing that it'll be hitting Netflix "in the future". Which, er, yeah. There was a teaser, though, which was very clear that the first Edgerunners series' protagonist has definitely kicked the bucket.</p>
<p>"David is dead," it declares amid shots of Cyberpunky anime people doing Cyberpunky anime things, "but Night City lives on." Thankfully, there was a bit more info than that, with multiple hat wearer Sztybor outlining that you can expect "a raw, real chronicle of redemption and revenge, something unlike what we’ve done before."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>That said, one aspect of the first series will be definitely coming to Edgerunners 2, with the writer telling folks on the Tweeter to "be prepared for sadness". Yep, Edgerunners famously wasn't afraid to leave you feeling like you'd just been kicked in the cybernuts and exposed to massive amounts of onion chopping, and you'd better get ready for something like that again.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2503793299">the panel</a> that featured the Edgerunners 2 announcement, Sztybor <a href="https://x.com/sztybor_writes/status/1941300471546904696">outlined his approach to human stories in dystopian worlds</a> with some all-time quotes. Are you Polish? Thoughts on the below welcome:</p>
<blockquote>We're the company from Poland. I'm from Poland. People in Poland are sad. They are born sad, they die sad, so I just wanted to make the whole world sad...when people are sad, I'm a bit happy.</blockquote>
<p>So there you go, start stocking up on tissues and maybe setting aside some time to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-mod-literally-called-weeee-lets-you-leave-your-flat-via-a-big-slide-like-a-bin-batman">slide</a> into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-seeing-more-players-than-it-has-since-launch">five thousandth Cyberpunk 2077 playthrough</a> once CD Projekt release that final, final, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">final patch</a> they recently pushed back.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-gets-its-first-teaser-and-youd-better-be-prepared-for-sadness]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last week was a week of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">cancellations, layoffs and general immiseration</a>, so let's attempt to bless this one with some introductory dad jokes.</p>
<p>Did you hear about the femme fatale who had to phone tech support? You see, her legs wouldn't quit. Did you hear about the femme fatale who had to phone <em>Minecraft</em> tech support? You see, her logs wouldn't cut. Did you hear about the femme fatale with a very high ping who had to withdraw from a Counter-Strike tournament? You see, her lags wouldn't qualify her for competing in a professional esport. True enough, all of these witticisms are an offence against nature and you should write better ones in the comments. But first, let us speak of new PC games - and PC gaming news.</p><!--more-->
<ul>
<h2>Monday 7th July</h2>
<li>Time-poor players rejoice, for annual speedrunning festival <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/">Summer Games Done Quick</a> is now underway. It got started on Sunday, actually, but today is when the any%ing begins in earnest. Viewer donations go to Doctors Without Borders - they've rustled up around $179,000 so far.</li>
<h2>Tuesday 8th July</h2>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790160/Missile_Command_Delta/">Missile Command Delta</a> is Missile Command but turn-based and played inside a game in which you explore a sinister, puzzle-filled base. Someday, one of these batshit Atari revivo-splicings will stick the landing. Will 8th July be that someday? Or will it simply be the first day of <a href="https://www.developconference.com/">Develop</a> in Brighton, the UK games industry's annual mini-GDC and/or shady late night poker game?</li>
<h2>Wednesday 9th July</h2>
<li>Nothing really catches my eye today, so I'm going to steal a release from Thursday 10th: teampunk punkshooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mycopunk">Mycopunk</a>, which is sort of Destiny but set in a mouldy scrapyard.</li>
<h2>Thursday 10th July</h2>
<li>Let us plumb some depths. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/occlude">Occlude</a>, you play baleful transmogrifications of Solitaire to unlock access to an occult archive. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everdeep-aurora">Everdeep Aurora</a>, you are a bright-eyed drillcat tunnelling through a bountiful underground Game Boy world. If you're more builder than burrower, there are archipelagoes to decorate in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/islanders-new-shores-is-the-follow-up-to-2019s-gentlest-town-builder">Islanders: New Shores</a>.</li>
<h2>Friday 11th July</h2>
<li>Time to drag a small child kicking and screaming through the snow in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3775050/DOGWALK/">Dogwalk</a>. Or send troops screaming and possibly kicking into alien hives via banks of datafeeds in autobattler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2983410/Xenopurge/">Xenopurge</a>. Or watch Tony Hawk fall kicking and screaming off his skateboard in the remake du jour, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>. There is no kicking and screaming in turn-based mech strategy sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3415580/Death_Ring_Second_Impact/">Death Ring: Second Impact</a>, I think, unless it's one of those awful Evangelion situations where the mechs transmit battle damage to their pilots.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you hear about the femme fatale who had to take her pond birds back to the petshop? You see, her Lake Ducks wouldn't quack. Did you hear about the femme fatale who went bankrupt? You see, her long shot investments wouldn't quadruple. Did you hear about the femme fatale who had to call off her Roman-themed drinking party? You see, her legionnaires wouldn't quaff. Oh god, I can't stop. Somebody make me stop.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-tony-hawk-eerie-cat-miners-and-all-the-speedrunning-you-can-eat]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Game Pass - Microsoft's subscription service across Xbox and PC that offers members a catalogue of games and other perks - is "unsustainable" and "damaging" the industry.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941503596870369388">Arkane Studios founder Raphael Colantonio</a>, who shared his thoughts on "the elephant in the room" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">following last week's layoffs at Microsoft</a>.

<p>"I think Game Pass is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidised by [Microsoft's] 'infinite money', but at some point reality has to hit," Colantonio, whose works include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> and Prey, wrote on social media.</p>
<p>"I don't think [Game Pass] can co-exist with other models, they'll either kill everyone else, or give up."</p>
<p>Colantonio's observations were spotted by Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who said the "most vocal concern" from within his own network was: "What happens when all that money runs out?"</p>
<p>Douse said this was "one of the main economic reasons people I know haven't shifted to its business model", stating "the infinite money thing never made any sense". In response, Colantonio said he agreed with Douse, adding: "I'm fed up with all the bs they fed us at first like 'don't worry, it doesn't impact the sales', only to admit years later that it totally does."</p>
<p>The duo spoke about the "cannibalisation" of sales, with Douse stating that he recognised that for "smaller teams with new or riskier" titles, getting their game onto Game Pass does help minimise a certain level of risk. However, he personally favours "Sony's 'lifecycle management'" way of doing things.</p>
<p>"Yeah, the only way [Game Pass] can co-exist without hurting everyone is for the back catalogue," <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1941517481463701744">Colantonio replied</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1942054157566795931">separate exchange</a> following his initial post, Colantonio said he could appreciate why gamers like Microsoft's subscription model, calling it a "great deal" for consumers. However, "the maths don't work for [Game Pass], it only works because [Microsoft] injects billions into it to make it a good deal for the players... for now".</p>
<p>The Arkane Studios founder closed: "That's only my opinion, I'm respectful, be respectful."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Maestro VR is a rhythm game with a pretty big difference. Instead of wafting around lightsabers, shooting targets or hitting drums, you’re stood in front of a crowd of people wielding musical instruments at your direction. With a conductor’s baton in your right hand and the ability to cue instruments and sections with your left, I’m sure the leads of the string sections are quite glad you don’t have weapons… heck, thanks to hand tracking you might not even have controllers!</p>
<p><iframe title="MAESTRO: THE COMPLETE EDITION - LIV TRAILER!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D75YnBjWQ98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Inevitably the game begins with a lengthy tutorial that is essential to understanding the experience – this isn’t Beat Saber, where holding a lightsaber and seeing boxes with arrows and scary red walls is self explanatory. Without this tutorial you might be able to figure out the more obvious bits like tempo – moving your baton to the arrows is simple enough – but you’ll probably be a little confused about why there are glowing circles, not knowing that you should point at them with your left hand to cue the musicians. Raising and lowering levels for crescendos and diminuendos with your left hand flat, palm up or down, respectively, also isn’t obvious unless you’ve played or conducted a real orchestra.</p>


<p>This tutorial is given to you by the theater’s librarian, a faintly sarcastic man who looks a bit like a vampire in a courtroom thanks to his pallid skin and white wig. This guy will pop up between performances to give you some champagne, macarons, and anything you’ve unlocked – additional difficulties for the song you’ve just completed for example, or a new baton or environment to perform in.</p>


<p>Once you’ve completed the tutorial, you’re free to try conducting some of the musical pieces in the game. There’s fifteen in the base game, featuring absolute bangers like Beethoven’s 5th Symphony, Prokofiev’s Dance of the Knights, and Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries. It’s not all classical though, with a few jazzier additions to the tracklist like Sing, Sing, Sing by Louis Prima and Levy’s Whiplash, which are particularly satisfying to play due the faster tempo. There are also DLC packs available that add some crowd pleasers – how about the intro theme to Game of Thrones? The Bridge of Khazad Dum, from the Lord of the Rings, or Duel of the Fates from Star Wars, complete with a tiny lightsaber baton!</p>
<p>These aren’t all available from the start, most of them being unlocked as you complete the ones you start with, and they’re all available with three different difficulties as well. This will come as a relief because Hard mode earns its name here, with a significant increase in multitasking, by which I mean tempo with your right hand whilst also cueing or crescendoing with your left, which is very difficult to get used to.</p>

<p>After you’ve had some time to get to grips with it, Maestro feels impressive. It’s challenging and incredibly satisfying. Most of you won’t have ever raised a crescendo with your left hand, palm upwards, and closed the hand to stop an entire orchestra playing all at once. It’s honestly hard to describe how good that feels, or how bad it feels to miss something and mess up In the Hall of the Mountain King with an off or out of time note. I’s tragic. It’s cliched by now, but I do feel like a conductor whilst playing, even though I keep pouring champagne all over the poor librarian’s head whilst eating digital macarons between performances.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not really a conductor, so I can’t speak to the specific of how accurate the actual conducting of these songs is to the reality. You’re not having to read a full musical score, but it absolutely feels like&nbsp;every shred of footage you’ve seen where a conductor is waving their arms around wildly in time to the music.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest difference between Maestro and reality is that in reality, the orchestra likely isn’t dressed as a barbarian horde, performing against the backdrop of a burning revolution, or being conducted with a tiny lightsaber. You unlock these outfits, locations and batons as you progress – my favourite being at the foot of a hill with a very large, creepy mansion on it – and they help add a little more to the visual style. The game looks pretty good, with musicians that are detailed and surprisingly atmospheric locations, but the audience watching you always looks very samey, and is always sat in the same concert half. It would have been neat to have the audience transported to these wild locations as well as the orchestra.</p>
<p>Then there’s hand tracking, which blew my mind. While I initially played with normal PSVR 2 Sense controllers, like some kind of VR caveman, i put the controllers down for the second play session and then my actual hands were in the game. Just…there, being tracked by the cameras in the headset. Admittedly, there’s the slightest little bit of added lag that makes playing on Hard a bit too difficult, and you need to keep your hands in front of you so they don’t disappear, but this is the kind of thing that teenage me dreamt about. Rejoice, for we are truly in the future.</p>

<p>In general, I can’t tell if the game is a touch too forgiving, or if it sometimes registers cues that you’ve missed. I’ve often found that it will trigger musical cues when I’ve missed them, registering my left hand as pointing when it isn’t, but there is some generous timing to ensure that music won’t be interrupted if you’re early, though your score will be lower.&nbsp;If your score drops too low whilst playing, the performance will end whilst the audience throws rotten tomatoes at you, after which you can throw them back because this is a VR game and chaotic shenanigans are VR’s mouldy bread and gone-off butter.</p>

        <p>The shooter has "already had significant interest", says CTO</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Romero Games <a href="https://x.com/romerogamesltd/status/1940716112922190248">announced last week</a> that they'd <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-shooter-from-romero-games-loses-funding-as-staff-post-theyve-been-let-go-thanks-to-microsoft-cuts">lost funding</a> for their upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> in the wake of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">latest mass layoff spree</a>. According to one employee who spoke to Irish outlet <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/100-staff-laid-off-galway-romero-games-6753674-Jul2025/">The Journal</a> (the studio is based in Galway), Romero Games have now closed, via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/romero-games-reportedly-met-with-microsoft-just-a-day-before-the-publisher-pulled-funding-for-the-studio-and-there-was-no-mention-of-the-decision-that-put-over-100-people-out-of-work/">PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p>The closure has affected 100 workers, writer The Journal, with one anonymous staff member calling it "a big shock" - especially since they'd had meetings with "the publisher" the day before. While the publisher aren't named directly, former staff have <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346499500342935553/">mentioned Microsoft cuts</a> in their announcements.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The anonymous staffer had "suspected something might be coming given recent layoffs at Microsoft," write the Journal. But, as echoed in Romero Games's statement that they'd "hit every milestone on time, consistently received high praise, and easily passed our internal gates", they assumed the project was progressing well.</p>
<p>“It seemed so far away for us. The title was pretty well developed at the time,” the anonymous staffer told The Journal. For now, they say, the project is "completely closed, and the studio is closed", though add that they're still "trying to find other ways of funding the project."</p>
<p>The unnamed FPS has "already had significant interest", <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346939512960299010/">wrote</a> chief technical officer Keith O'Conor in a LinkedIn post offering hiring recommendations for former staff. He described the interest as "really heartening… but right now our priority is making sure our people are taken care of".</p>
<p>John Romero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/john-romeros-making-a-mysterious-new-fps-in-unreal-engine-5">announced the shooter in 2022</a>, a new IP made in Unreal Engine 5. Details have remained scant since. Prior to this, Romero's most recent new FPS project was his and Adrian Carmack's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blackroom-romero-carmack">Blackroom</a> - a game full of "ruined Victorian mansions", "wild west ghost towns" and "treacherous pirate galleons", itself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/john-romero-kickstarter-cancelled-for-gameplay-demo">cancelled in 2016</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/romero-games-have-completely-closed-doors-but-theres-still-hope-for-the-doom-creators-new-fps]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 To Stay Scarce Until Next Spring, According to Analysts]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to Japanese analysts, the Nintendo Switch 2 will remain scarcely available in global stores until at least next Spring. As <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Media-Entertainment/Nintendo-Switch-2-likely-to-remain-scarce-until-next-spring-analysts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by Nikkei, Toyo Securities senior analyst Hideki Yasuda and UBS Securities analyst Zhai Yijia estimate that the console's first-month sales following the June 6 launch might be around 6 million units.</p>



<p>Yasuda reckons that, even with the limited supply, the Nintendo Switch 2 could reach 20 million units sold by the end of this fiscal year (March 2026), while Yijia is a bit more conservative with his 18 million units. Regardless, these goals would outperform the original Switch by 20% to 30%.</p>



<p>Yiija is also more conservative in his long-term outlook on the console's sales:</p>



<p><em>Initial sales are higher than those of the Switch and Sony's PlayStation 5, but this should not be seen simply as an increase in demand. Those consoles suffered from semiconductor shortages at the time of their release that limited production, curtailing supply. It will be difficult to surpass the cumulative sales of the Switch.</em></p>



<p>His colleague Yasuda is more optimistic:</p>



<p><em>It is overwhelmingly popular compared to past game consoles, and consoles that have a strong initial response tend to continue to have high demand.</em></p>



<p>Market analysis firm DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 could sell over 100 million units by the end of 2029, which would definitely keep it on track to surpass the original console over time.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Nintendo has commented on the Switch 2 price, with President Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stating</a> that the company is evaluating the extent to which the pricing may be a barrier for certain consumers, especially the younger ones:</p>



<p><em>We believe the pricing of Nintendo Switch 2 is appropriate for the gaming experience it offers,<br>and what is most important is to provide entertaining experiences that demonstrate the value to<br>consumers. To achieve this goal, we have incorporated various features into Nintendo Switch 2.<br>It is true that Nintendo Switch 2 has a higher price point than our past gaming systems. We are<br>creating various opportunities outside of our gaming systems for young children to engage with<br>Nintendo characters and game worlds, with one of the ultimate goals being that they will eventually<br>play on our gaming systems. We are closely monitoring to what degree the price of the system<br>might become a barrier.</em></p>
