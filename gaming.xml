We bring you all the biggest news from the world of Xbox, as well as features, polls, talking points, reviews and so much more!</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many Xbox fans have been wondering whether one of the 'big three' Xbox franchises – <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/halo_infinite" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halo</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/gears_of_war_e-day" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gears</a> or <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/forza_motorsport" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forza</a> – would eventually make their way over to PS5. It turns out <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/forza_horizon_5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forza Horizon 5</a> is the first to make the jump, having been officially revealed for Sony's current-gen system with a Spring 2025 release window. Unsurprisingly, fans have been <em>very</em> opinionated about the announcement ever since it dropped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's even heartbreak over the decision to move such a treasured Xbox exclusive over to its rival console, but truthfully it's something we've been expecting for a while now. If you read between the lines, Phil Spencer and the team at Xbox have subtly tried to inform us about the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/11/xbox-boss-says-everything-is-on-the-table-when-it-comes-to-ps5-ports" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"no red lines"</a> rule when it comes to exclusives these days, which most likely means that Halo, Gears, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/starfield" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starfield</a> and many other Xbox franchises will be heading to PS5 and possibly even Nintendo Switch 2 sooner or later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why do this? Why risk alienating loyal fans who have aligned themselves with the Xbox brand <em>because</em> of its exclusives? The answer almost certainly lies in the numbers. We've seen time and again how hardware revenue has declined for Microsoft, while income from <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/01/xbox-hardware-declines-but-content-and-services-grows-in-fy25-q2-earnings-report" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox content and services has increased</a>. It's no wonder the company's priorities have shifted. This change in strategy means Xbox can focus more on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/01/xboxs-multiplatform-releases-made-microsoft-the-top-game-publisher-in-the-world-last-month" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">becoming a publishing behemoth</a> while also making its games accessible to more players on all platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year Spencer talked about <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/01/xbox-is-evolving-rather-than-losing-its-identity-says-phil-spencer" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox having "evolved" its identity</a> in order to continue thriving amidst challenging times for the industry. Furthermore, he believes Xbox's new approach would be best adopted by the masses, to allow major developers and publishers to keep making high-budget AAA games. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/01/xbox-has-right-approach-to-exclusives-and-playstation-may-follow-suggests-ori-dev" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moon Studios CEO Thomas Mahler recently agreed</a> with this idea, suggesting that, due to rising game development costs, the industry can only grow if it starts reducing its reliance on exclusives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it helps when those former <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/best-xbox-exclusives" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox exclusives</a> actually sell in big numbers. Back in February 2024, Xbox announced that <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/hi-fi_rush" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hi-Fi RUSH</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/sea_of_thieves" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sea Of Thieves</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/pentiment" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pentiment</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/grounded" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Grounded</u></a> would be heading to other systems, and we quickly discovered PlayStation and Nintendo owners had an appetite for games they previously couldn't play. Sea of Thieves, in particular, has become a massive success on PS5, and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/06/xbox-exec-talks-multiplatform-strategy-team-really-pleased-with-sea-of-thieves-on-ps5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft hasn't been shy in highlighting that fact</a>. That said, there was also criticism for suggesting <em>only</em> four titles would make the jump, which inevitably was never going to be the case once PlayStation owners started flocking to them in droves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that is the biggest issue I have with Xbox's new strategy at this point. Xbox has embarked on a major marketing campaign claiming <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/11/phil-spencer-explains-why-this-is-an-xbox-will-be-beneficial-to-console-owners" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">every device "is an Xbox"</a>, and everyone seems to have understood that message by now. However, it's never <em>really</em> explained what's happening with games going to PS5 and Switch. Initially it was four games, followed by a couple more, and eventually it might (okay, probably will) be Xbox's entire catalogue. Xbox fans still don't have a <em>truly</em> clear picture of what to anticipate, aside from rumours and the occasional hint from Phil Spencer.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Will Microsoft be able to sell hardware without major exclusives as a sweetener, and can&nbsp;Xbox Game Pass&nbsp;shift enough systems on its own?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Forza Horizon 5's debut on PS5 may feel like a new era or even the beginning of the end for some Xbox fans, but really it's just the evolution of a strategy that's been underway for some time – a strategy that's set to be very profitable in 2025. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/features/reaction-like-it-or-not-xbox-has-gone-full-throttle-on-multiplatform" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The multiplatform push is in full swing</a>, and even though Microsoft clearly doesn't want to give us much of a roadmap, we're bound to see more <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/features/xbox-game-studios-all-microsoft-first-party-developers-and-what-theyre-working-on" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox first-party titles</a> on PS5, Nintendo Switch 2 and other platforms before the end of the year. It'll be fantastic from a business and industry perspective, but obviously sad for those who'd prefer Xbox to keeps its games down as exclusives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also no telling how it'll fare in the long run. What happens when the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/next-xbox-console-everything-we-know-so-far-about-microsofts-next-gen-system" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next Xbox console</a> rolls around? What about the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/xbox-handheld-everything-we-know-so-far-including-the-latest-rumours" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox handheld</a>? Will Microsoft be able to sell hardware without major exclusives as a sweetener, and can <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/xbox-game-pass-in-2025-the-full-list-of-everything-announced-so-far" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Game Pass</a> shift enough systems on its own? I have no doubt Phil Spencer has thought about these questions and more and, hopefully, has answers to them. But there's a feeling of unease throughout the Xbox community right now, and Xbox will have to work harder than ever to keep its loyal fans coming back in the future. I just hope that's enough because Xbox is changing, forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Fraser Gilbert is the Editor of </em><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pure Xbox</em></a><em>.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div data-cy="carousel"><p><h2 data-cy="title1">Pure Xbox Column</h2></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Revenge of the Savage Planet - May (PlayStation, Xbox, PC)</h2>
<p>Journey to the Savage Planet was well-received, and Revenge of the Savage Planet is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/raccoon-logic-showcases-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-featuring-co-op-modes-new-pois-several-additions/">sequel to that title</a>, bringing you back into the fun, satirical sci-fi world. You'll get to traverse alien worlds while getting gear upgrades and uncovering secrets of the worlds that you traverse. Even the trailer itself is dripping in satire and comedy. You're bound to be in for a good time with this one.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Little Nightmares 3 - June (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC)</h2>
<p>When it comes to horror franchises, Little Nightmares is beloved by many. While it isn't particularly full of jumpscares, there are small details that make the game intense and horrifying. The third installment in the franchise is set to release in June, and this will be the first time that the franchise will have the option for full co-op throughout the game. Previously, the games were single-player, despite often telling a tale of two characters throughout the game. Make sure to put this one on your wishlist.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>MainFrames - March 6 (Nintendo Switch, PC)</h2>
<p>If you've been wanting to get that hit of nostalgia that comes from old PCs from the 90s, then this is a game you'll want to check out. It's an adorable little platformer set to release on March 6, where you play as a Floppy Disk and explore the ins and outs of a PC, taking you on a variety of journeys through mini-games and puzzles. It's set to be a cozy platformer, so stay tuned for the release of this one.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>A Webbing Journey - TBA</h2>
<p>Be warned, as this one isn't for the arachnophobes out there. However, if you've found yourself wanting to become a spider and swing around the house while building webbed structures, this is the game for you. It combines platforming, physics, and wholesome sandbox goodness. While it doesn't have a release date just yet, the game is already out on iOS and Android.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Yooka-Replaylee - TBA</h2>
<p>While you could just play the original version of Yooka-Laylee as that still stands up as a fantastic game, Yooka-Replaylee will be an enhanced version of the loved platformer, adding in new challenges and content to play with, as well as new secrets to uncover. If you are a fan of Spyro the Dragon or Crash Bandicoot, you'll definitely want to check out Yooka-Replaylee.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered - February 14 (PlayStation, PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox)</h2>
<p>What's a platformer without Lara Croft? For those who didn't get to experience the greatness of Tomb Raider 4 through 6, the remasters are just days away. It's set to release on Valentine's Day, so why not make it the gift to yourself, getting to see Lara in HD again? Angel of Darkness will be getting a huge revamp, and a lot of people will be playing it for the first time ever.</p>

                <p>Way back in the day, the original Mass Effect was my favorite video game. I played it more than a dozen times before Mass Effect 2 came out, eager to immerse myself in BioWare's slick new space opera and its cosmic mysteries. I was pretty young back then in 2007, still a college kid who wasn't old enough to legally drink alcohol, and a longtime Star Wars nerd dealing with how much I hated the prequel movies. Mass Effect hit the spot.</p><p dir="ltr">Cut to a couple decades later. I've just finished reading a series of novels, dubbed the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087RSGKS3?binding=paperback&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Revelation Space</a> series after the first book, by Welsh author Alastair Reynolds. In the early Aughts, Reynolds released a trilogy of these books along with a standalone side novel, a prequel novel, a pair of novellas, and a bunch of short stories. All of these works were set in his own original and extremely weird science-fiction universe that seems to have been extraordinarily influential on the games industry. Having now read them, it's difficult not to see the way that some of Reynolds' best and strangest ideas made their way into all sorts of games--Stellaris, Destiny, Dead Space, Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect are some that immediately spring to mind.</p><p dir="ltr">I myself finally got around to reading these books because they are commonly accepted as inspiration for Mass Effect's Reapers. In Mass Effect, the Reapers are a race of ancient machines who periodically pop up to wipe out any galactic civilization that may have risen up. In Revelation Space, published in 2000, we instead have the Inhibitors, a race of ancient machines who periodically pop up to wipe out any galactic civilization that may have risen up. While sci-fi writers have always loved their ancient space civilizations, these are too specifically similar to ignore.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4435674-masseffectreaper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435674" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4435674-masseffectreaper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435674"></a><figcaption>Mass Effect's Reapers appear to have been inspired by the novel Revelation Space.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4435674-masseffectreaper.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While Revelation Space's influence on Mass Effect is fairly obvious, I'm not accusing BioWare of plagiarism--like all stories, Mass Effect is a pastiche of a lot of things that came before. It's got as much Star Wars, Babylon 5, and Starship Troopers in its DNA as it does Revelation Space, and Mass Effect is not truly hard sci-fi the way that Revelation Space is. BioWare may have borrowed some concepts from Revelation Space, but it took them all in very different directions. And none of those other directions, in this writer's humble opinion, can hold a candle to Reynolds's vision.</p><p dir="ltr">Revelation Space, as a series, tells the future history of human expansion into the depths of outer space and some of the super bizarre things they find as they go. Thanks to Reynolds's background as an astrophysicist, Revelation Space is a work of "hard" sci-fi that delves deeply into the mechanics of how everything works, even when Reynolds is trying to describe impossible things. That penchant results in an unusual storytelling structure that may not be satisfying in all the usual ways--but it's more a matter of defying convention than it is one of competence.</p><p dir="ltr">Revelation Space is a sprawling series, but the heart of it is a 400-year saga that kicks off in the 26th century at an archaeological dig on a remote planet called Resurgam. The dig concerns an alien race called the Amarantin, who were rendered extinct a million years before, just as they began expanding into space. As we learn a little bit later in the book, the Amarantin were the victims of the Inhibitors, machines that emerge and destroy any civilization advanced enough to leave their home solar system and accidentally trigger any of the signaling devices that the Inhibitors had left all over the galaxy. And while humanity had managed to expand throughout a 20-light year bubble around Earth without yet triggering the Inhibitors, that streak of luck is coming to an end.</p><p dir="ltr">But with Revelation Space's hard sci-fi bent, this conflict is a very long one. One of the key pillars of this universe is that faster-than-light travel isn't possible--those who have tried, in a fun little twist, tend to accidentally delete themselves from history during their attempts. Without any FTL ability, travel between solar systems takes a <em>really</em> long time (like years or decades), and so there's no hopping around all over the universe like it's no big deal.</p><p dir="ltr">Along the way, we dive very deeply into a ton of spectacularly bizarre concepts. We've got alien entities like the Shrouders (beings who live in restructured and compressed regions of spacetime) and the Pattern Jugglers (apparently sentient ocean bacteria that do all sorts of weird and exciting and scary stuff to a human consciousness). We've got the human Conjoiners, who have computers in their heads that allow them a semblance of a hive mind, and who have been communing with future versions of themselves in order to be better prepared for the inevitable arrival of the Inhibitors. There's also a lot of fun cyberpunk concepts within the novels, including conversations about AI, digital consciousness, and all manners of body modifications. And I'd be remiss to not mention the neutron star that houses an alien computer from the beginning of time that a person can only access by having their body physically destroyed.</p><p dir="ltr">It's fair to say that Reynolds did not quite have the storytelling chops to pull off everything he wanted to do with these books--Revelation Space is absurdly ambitious for a first novel. The most common complaint about those early books in particular is their rushed climaxes, but that issue stems, I believe, from Reynolds' intense commitment to thinking everything all the way through. When he's in that mode, natural stopping points simply do not arise because one thing always leads to something else. So his endings are often abrupt and overly neat. But the journey to those endings is always so f**king strange and mind-opening that I can forgive those missteps.</p><p dir="ltr">It's that particular aspect of the Revelation Space universe that, nearly two decades later, is helping me process some residual subconscious frustrations I've long had about the Mass Effect trilogy but didn't know how to articulate. I always felt that Mass Effect 2 was the trilogy's weak link--it has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-2-tried-something-bold-but-didnt-spark-a-revolution/1100-6529017/">lot of cool individual stories, but they don't add up to anything</a>. Cerberus and the Illusive Man are completely inscrutable and make little sense, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-2s-human-reaper-was-dumb-and-im-sad-we-didnt-get-more-of-it/1100-6520609/">human Reaper</a> is a big wet fart, and you spend the entire game doing side quests that are largely unrelated to the main plot or each other. I understood <em>what</em> parts of that game frustrated me, but I didn't really get the <em>why</em> of it.</p><p dir="ltr">After reading these novels, though, I'm somehow mad about that human Reaper all over again, because now I have a better grasp of what it represents about how the powers-that-be at BioWare chose to tell Mass Effect's story. The premise with the Reapers is that when they wipe out a civilization, they "harvest" the people by breaking them down and uploading their matter to a new Reaper. Mass Effect 2 really doesn't want you to think too hard about this--it presents this process as simply a horror that needs to be stopped by any means. So you shoot the human Reaper until it's dead, and then are presented with a choice of what to do with the corpse that never matters in any way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4435679-masseffecthumanreaper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435679" data-ratio="0.56296296296296" data-width="1350" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4435679-masseffecthumanreaper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435679"></a><figcaption>Mass Effect 2's human Reaper idea has aged pretty poorly, and it wasn't particularly well liked to begin with.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4435679-masseffecthumanreaper.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But the human Reaper would have actually been a really interesting idea if BioWare had followed through with its original idea, which was that the Reapers were actually uploading those people wholesale into a digital construct of some kind--collecting civilizations, more or less intact, and storing them in Reaper form. Mechanically, it's basically the same concept as the neutron star supercomputer from Revelation Space that I mentioned above, but applied in a very different way.</p><p dir="ltr">But Mass Effect never had time for ideas that complex, and the whole concept was gutted. But imagine how much different the ending of Mass Effect 2, not to mention the entirety of the third game, would have been had BioWare been willing to go all the way on just this one concept. It would have fundamentally altered how we dealt with the human Reaper, it probably would have led to some actual understanding about what the Illusive Man and Cerberus are doing, and the entire fight against the rest of the Reapers in Mass Effect 3 would have had a different tenor.</p><p dir="ltr">That, to me, is the real tragedy of Mass Effect, looking back through this new lens. BioWare seems to have borrowed many concepts from Revelation Space, but very little of it is explored with any depth, and none of the ideas are given new twists that improve upon them. The human Reaper could have been one such improvement, giving the Reapers actual character and giving the player an actual reason to consider allowing the Reapers to keep existing at the end of Mass Effect 3.</p><p dir="ltr">But since Mass Effect avoided most of the extra weird stuff, the ending of Mass Effect 3 never really had a chance to be good. The choices presented by the Catalyst at the climax of the trilogy are very big and impactful ones that we are simply unable to process because the groundwork was never laid for them. It didn't matter how much extra exposition they added with the extended cut ending--since BioWare had simplified the rest of the story for the lowest common denominator for three straight games, any ending with actual big ideas was always doomed to feel like some goofy nonsense that came out of left field. Because that's exactly what it was.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, at least some corners of the games industry have matured greatly in the decade since Mass Effect 3 came out. Cyberpunk 2077 is a blockbuster title that goes hard on all the fantastical cyberpunk stuff that Mass Effect dodged, and nowadays I feel about that game the same way I did about Mass Effect in 2007. Cyberpunk 2077 and Revelation Space actually have a lot of commonalities in that regard, since Reynolds's books are chock full of cyberpunk weirdness--and 2077 actually explores those ideas with comparable depth. So that game serves as an excellent primer for Revelation Space, oddly enough.</p><p dir="ltr">But whether you're an old Mass Effect fan who wants a deeper and more interesting version of that story, or a Cyberpunk 2077 fan who's looking to get even weirder, Revelation Space will hit spots in your brain that you didn't even know were there. These books and stories are beautifully bizarre, and must-reads for any sci-fi nerd.</p><h3 dir="ltr">See Revelation Space series at Amazon</h3><p><strong>Main thread</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revelation-Space-Inhibitor-Trilogy-1/dp/0316462446/?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Revelation Space</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Redemption-Ark-Inhibitor-Trilogy-2/dp/0316462497?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Redemption Ark</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Absolution-Gap-Inhibitor-Trilogy-3/dp/0316462632?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Absolution Gap</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inhibitor-Phase-Revelation-Alastair-Reynolds/dp/0316462764/?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inhibitor Phase</a></li></ul><p><strong>Prefect Dreyfus noir thriller prequel series</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aurora-Rising-GollanczF-Alastair-Reynolds/dp/1473223369/?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Aurora Rising</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elysium-Fire-Prefect-Dreyfus-Emergency/dp/0316555673/?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elysium Fire</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Vendetta-Prefect-Dreyfus-Emergencies/dp/0316462845/?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Machine Vendetta</a></li></ul><p><strong>Standalone works</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chasm-City-Inhibitor-Alastair-Reynolds/dp/0316462470/?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Chasm City (novel)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Diamond-Dogs-Turquoise-Alastair-Reynolds/dp/0575083131/?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days (two novellas)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Galactic-North-Alastair-Reynolds/dp/0575083123?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Galactic North (short stories)</a></li></ul>

Punk talks that talk whenever he has a microphone in his hand. While that won’t necessarily help him win the Rumble, it has propelled him to becoming one of the most magnetic, controversial, and can’t-miss promos in the history of sports entertainment.</p><p>To honor Punk’s elite gift of gab, we assembled his nine greatest moments on the mic and broke them down, one pipebomb at a time.</p></div></div><div><p>A strong barometer for a wrestler’s proficiency on the microphone is how well they fare against one of the all-time greats. Three weeks ahead of the 2013 Royal Rumble, it didn’t matter what The Rock said. CM Punk was better.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-pee-red-one-1851695097&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-pee-red-one-1851695097">The Rock</a></span> returned to the WWE in pursuit of the WWE Championship, a belt he hadn’t held in 10 years. Standing in his way was CM Punk, who, at the time, was the longest-running champion of the modern era.</p><p>Punk was delivering one of his signature heelish sermons, questioning why R-Truth’s imaginary friend Little Jimmy (remember him?) was better positioned on the card than Tyson Kidd and claimed that “I am successful in spite of [the fans].” Rock interrupted, defending the WWE Universe (a la John Cena), and led the crowd in a “Cookie puss, cookie puss” chant at Punk. Rather than engage The Great One in a sing-along battle, Punk did what he does best—hit his enemies with the truth.</p><p>Whether Rock had a full-time schedule or showed up once a year Santa Clause style, Punk was going to kick his ass. Boom. Punk didn’t need a “tired, lame-ass shtick” filled with rhyming and catchphrases to get over. Pow. Rock was playing at the kid’s table, while Punk was in the big leagues, swinging for the fences. Wham.8</p><p>The champ landed a final haymaker, beating Rock at his own game by pulling out a catchy one-liner: “Come Royal Rumble, understand that when you step in the ring, your arms are just too short to box with God.” Knockout punch.</p></div><div><p>Pro Wrestling Illustrated voted CM Punk vs. Jeff Hardy the second-best feud of the year in 2009. It should have been number one.</p><p>Punk, a babyface at the time, shocked fans when he successfully cashed in his Money In The Bank briefcase on an exhausted Hardy who minutes before had outlasted Edge to become the World Heavyweight Champion. It was an underhanded move, the first of several for the slowly turning Punk.</p><p>At The Bash pay-per-view a few weeks later, Punk and Hardy fought in a rematch, with the former “accidentally” kicking the referee in the back (due to blurred vision from a supposed eye injury), which disqualified him and allowed him to keep the title.</p><p>Punk was firmly cementing his place as a smarmy, weaseling heel—and then, he made things personal. He began deriding Hardy for his “reckless” lifestyle and inability to say “no” to drugs, which stems from Hardy’s real-life history of alcohol and substance abuse.</p><p>On a July episode of <em>Friday Night Smackdown</em>, Punk unleashed his most resounding verbal assault. He flashed a vial of medication, teasing Jeff that he knows “a thing or two about prescription medication.” The only difference is, that Punk obtained his (for his “injured” eye) legally.</p><p>Then, Punk dealt a deafening blow: “Jeff, you’ve got two strikes. You know how many I have? Zero. Jeff, you know how many times I’ve been suspended? Zero. You know how many times I’ve been to a rehab facility? Zero. You know what your chances are of beating me at Night of Champions? Zero.”</p><p>It was a classic example of something Punk does exceptionally well. He took a piece of reality and wove it into a storyline, all while garnering nuclear heat and hyping up the next pay-per-view. In other words, it was a chef’s kiss heel promo.</p></div><div><p>You want people to hate you? Interrupt Rey Mysterio singing “Happy Birthday” to his daughter.</p><p>Punk was at his most abhorrent as the founding member of the Straight Edge Society in the late aughts. He preached a lifestyle free from drinking, drugs, and smoking while denigrating those (namely, fans) who partook in any of the vices.</p><p>It’s an underrated era of Punk’s career. And as he, Serena, and Luke Gallows crashed the Mysterio family celebration, the boos that rained down were giving Muhammad Hassan. (if you know, you know.)</p><p>Punk terrorized each member of the Mysterio clan, beginning with Aalyah, who pulled off one HELL of a performance as a child looking horrified. As she covered her ears, Punk said: “As my birthday present to you, I’ll let you shut your eyes while… I make [your daddy] beg for my mercy.” Sheesh!</p><p>To a young Dominik (yes, Dirty Dom was present!), Punk threatened that he was going to make his dad “squeal like a pig.” Finally, when Punk aimed his vitriol at Rey’s wife Angie, claiming, “After I do what I’m going to do to your husband, it will be the worst of times” and all Rey can do is stand between himself and his vulnerable family. As the Mysterios left the ring, Punk sang a sinister rendition of “Happy Birthday” to Aalyah.</p><p>The promo was disturbing, deplorable, and effective in positioning Punk as pure evil. It also makes you wonder why Dom hasn’t recruited his sister to join Judgement Day.</p></div><div><p>For years, fans clamored for a CM Punk return to the wrestling ring. They would often chant his name during random matches and segments (usually if they were bored) across promotions and around the world. That’s why his reemergence at AEW Rampage in 2021 felt as momentous as Jon Snow rising from the dead.</p><p>Set at the United Center in Chicago, a raucous crowd (already anticipating a Punk sighting) lost its shit when the Second City Saint actually showed up. As he walked through the curtain, the “CM Punk” chants drowned out his “Cult Of Personality” entrance song. He stage-dove into the front row, hugging fans who’d been reaching out to embrace him for years. Tears filled the eyes of many in attendance as if they were teens at a Taylor Swift concert—which makes sense, as Punk too was a rock star. And “FI-NALLY,” to quote another star wrestler who at one point left the business for 7 years, CM Punk had come back to the ring.</p><p>Punk grabbed a microphone and admitted that he hadn’t prepared a speech because he wanted to react to how he felt in the moment. He addressed the feelings of frustration and disappointment that fans might have experienced based on his past decisions, and that he understood. He hoped they would understand that he was sick—physically and mentally—from the last place he worked (WWE) and that he had to go away to get better.</p><p>Punk then spoke about the exciting promises of working at AEW, stating that much like how Ring of Honor was a “place where people could come work, get paid, learn their craft, and love <em>professional wrestling</em>,” so too was AEW.</p><p>Needless to say, things ended much differently from how they started for Punk in AEW, but this was a once-in-a-generation, passion-filled return of a pro wrestling icon.</p></div><div><p>True wrestling junkies may remember CM Punk’s pre-WWE career with Ring of Honor (ROH). Did you know the original “Summer of Punk” took place six years before his infamous Pipebomb promo (more on that later) in ROH?</p><p>It was June 2005 and Punk had agreed to sign with the big, bad WWE, which is why his victory over Austin Aries to win the ROH World Championship (for the first time) was shocking. Even more shocking was what Punk, then a face, said immediately after to the cheering crowd: “I am the devil himself, and all of you stupid, mindless people fell for it… Ladies and gentlemen, the champ is here.”</p><p>The reference to John Cena—a despised figure among independent wrestling fans given what he stood for—put an exclamation point on Punk’s heel turn. It was a legendary moment in Ring of Honor that gave Punk one final memorable run in the company as a corporate sellout, threatening to take the ROH title with him to the WWE.</p><p>Over a decade and a half later, Maxwell Jacob Friedman (MJF) remixed lines from his childhood hero’s promo in their feud. Speaking of which… </p></div><div><p>The type of wrestling fan you are will likely determine your favorite CM Punk mic moment in his program with MJF.</p><p>Maybe it’s when Punk compared the foundation of his career (being Straight Edge) to that of MJF’s (cheating to win with his Dynamite Diamond Ring), and challenged the upstart to a dog collar match to teach him a lesson. Or maybe it’s when a battered and bloodied Punk derangedly stared down a camera backstage with fiery, dilated pupils, and harkened back to one of his old Ring Of Honor promos to intimidate MJF.</p><p>To me, the best mic moment(s) came when Punk and MJF verbally sparred for the first time in the ring, trading hall-of-fame-level insults, a signature of both wrestlers. These are a handful of the ways Punk punked Max:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>“I had no idea your first name was Maxwell. This entire time, I thought MJF stood for ‘My Jealous Fan’”</li><li>“Look at me, Maxwell, I’m in your head. Probably has a lot to do with the fact that there’s a poster of me on your wall”</li><li>“He thinks what he does is revolutionary to the wrestling business when in reality, he’s just a less famous Miz” </li><li>“Who’s the man around here? Is it you? No, I don’t think so. The only way you’re going to be number one is if we all wait around long enough for Tony to have a daughter that you marry”</li></ul><p>The Scoville levels ratcheted up instantly between the two, and it aptly laid the foundation for the best and spiciest feud in AEW history.</p></div><div><p>Sometimes at work, you’re handed a shit sandwich and don’t really have a choice but to eat it. In CM Punk’s case, he picked up the rotten sandwich he was served and hurled it at the people who allegedly put it on his plate in the first place… then he took a flamethrower and torched his shit-covered enemies for good measure.</p><p>If you’re looking for 23 minutes and 30 seconds of pure entertainment and NSFW soap opera-level drama, do yourself a favor and watch (or rewatch) CM Punk’s press conference after AEW All Out in 2022. A bloodied Punk–who just defeated Jon Moxley to regain the AEW World Championship—expressed his genuine, non-scripted thoughts. He:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Ripped into Scott Colton (AKA pro wrestler Colt Cabana), adamantly dismissing the rumors that he convinced Tony to fire his former friend. Punk also revealed that he used to pay Colton’s bills and that Colton (at the time, 41) shared a bank account with his mom</li><li>Disparaged the executive vice presidents of AEW, namely Kenny Omega and Matt and Nick Jackson (the Young Bucks), who “couldn’t fucking manage a Target” </li><li>Called AEW star Adam “Hangman” Page an “empty-headed dumb fuck” for cutting a promo on Punk that strayed significantly from what they agreed to beforehand</li><li>Addressed the media directly about their lack of journalistic integrity: “If y’all are at fault, fuck you. If you’re not, I apologize”</li></ul><p>The rants were awkward yet hilarious, made even funnier by the fact that Punk did it while sitting next to (a wildly uncomfortable) AEW CEO Tony Kahn and calmly eating muffins. It was an all-time CM Punk performance, but it did result in a real-life physical altercation with Omega and the Young Bucks immediately following the scrum (the details are unclear), and then a whole bunch of ripple effects for the next year-plus, ultimately leading to Punk’s firing from AEW.</p><p>On the bright side, the ordeal ultimately led Punk back to the WWE, and now we all know that Mindy’s Bakery is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.</p></div><div><p>It was another ordinary episode of <em>Monday Night Raw</em> in 2011. Until it <em>really</em> wasn’t.</p><p>After interfering in John Cena’s tables match against R-Truth, causing the leader of the Centation to *gasp* lose, CM Punk grabbed a microphone, walked up the ramp, sat cross-legged in front of the Titantron, and delivered the most industry-shifting promo since Austin 3:16—which coincidentally occurred almost exactly 15 years to the day prior.</p><p>Punk fittingly donned a Stone Cold tee and aired out his list of grievances with the company. He also predicted a victory over John Cena for the WWE Championship at Money In The Bank the night before his contract with the WWE would end.</p><p>It quickly seemed that Punk was maybe, possibly going off script when he compared John Cena’s ass-kissing abilities (very not PG) to Hulk Hogan’s, who at the time was a persona non grata in the WWE. He strangely admitted that “I’m breaking the fourth wall” while waving directly to the camera and claimed he was the best <em>wrestler</em> in the world—a word that then Chairman Vince McMahon apparently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://wrestletalk.com/features/full-list-of-banned-words-in-wwe-updated/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://wrestletalk.com/features/full-list-of-banned-words-in-wwe-updated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forbade</a></span> his talent to use.</p><p>Punk claimed he would defend the WWE Championship he won from Cena in rival promotions, mentioning Ring of Honor and New Japan Pro Wrestling by name (something that never happened in the WWE). Shit felt really real when he began taking personal shots at McMahon: citing Stephanie (his “idiotic daughter”) and Triple H (his “doofus son-in-law”) as the reasons why the company won’t be any better after Vince is dead. Whoa.</p><p>When he threatened to reveal a true story about McMahon and the hypocrisy of his anti-bullying campaign, his mic stopped working. What the Hell happened? Fans were left genuinely wondering if “the boys in the truck” were told to cut him off.</p><p>Pulling off an effective worked-shoot promo (i.e. a promo where it’s unclear whether the wrestler delivering it is going off script) is the smallest of needles to thread. Punk did it masterfully. He grounded everything he said in at least some kernel of truth, but never <em>really</em> crossed a detrimental line. He complained about the stale, predictable WWE product—which ironically, felt very fresh and warranted—while also promoting an upcoming pay-per-view.</p><p>The influence of Punk’s pipebomb is clear in promos we see today in the WWE: fewer catchphrases and more (seemingly real) personal shots directed at fellow talent. Punk’s career is filled with accolades, but this is truly his shining moment on the mic. </p></div><div><p>Punk faced two of the biggest power hitters on the microphone and struck both of them out with nasty pitches. Bear with me on the baseball metaphor.</p><p>Coming off Punk’s pipebomb promo, the build to Money In The Bank in Chicago was reaching a head. The superstar would face John Cena in a heavily stipulated match. If Punk won, he’d leave the WWE with the WWE Championship and John Cena would be fired.</p><p>In a last-ditch effort to re-sign Punk, Vince McMahon took matters into his own hands, negotiating a new contract with him live on <em>Monday Night Raw</em> a few days before MITB. Vince was as brash and smug as ever until Punk reminded him who held the leverage.</p><p>Punk physically pushed his boss (a provision in the contract), demanded he bring back WWE ice bars (still need those!), and even dropped this dandy: “Vince, I’ll kick you in the nuts and you’ll smile at me and like it, and show me some respect!”</p><p>Shortly after, Cena joined the fray, and Punk lost it at his rival’s declaration that he had lost sight. Punk hit Cena with a harsh truth about his character and position within the wrestling business: The 10-time champ, who prided himself on being the underdog, was now the opposite. Cena was no longer like his hometown team, the underdog Boston Red Sox. Instead, he’d become the detestable New York Yankees. See? Baseball.</p><p>Cena took exception to the insult and punched Punk, causing him to retreat to the same place he cut his pipebomb promo weeks earlier. Sitting on the ramp, he revealed:</p><p>“I’m glad you just punched me in the face John… because it hit me like a bolt of lightning exactly why I no longer want to be here. It’s because I’m tired of this. I’m tired of you. I’m just tired.”</p><p>With that, Punk said that after Sunday night (Money In The Bank), the company will need to say goodbye to the WWE title, say goodbye to John Cena, and say goodbye to CM Punk.</p><p>BOOM. That is how you sell a story and a ca n’t-miss event in front of (as Punk referred to them) the George Steinbrenner and Derek Jeter of the WWE. More baseball! This Punk performance is often lost in the giant shadow of the pipebomb, but you could argue it’s just as effective. And epic. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fallout New Vegas and Horizon Zero Dawn lead writer John Gonzalez has announced he will be retuning to Obsidian after 14 years. </p>



<p>The announcement came via his LinkedIn profile, where he was quick to shoot down impending rumours of Fallout New Vegas 2, by simply saying, “No, it’s not Fallout: New Vegas 2.”</p>



<p>As for what Gonzalez is working on remains to be seen and could ride on the success of the studios next two upcoming games, Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2. If tremendously successful, he could be working on a future sequel.</p>



<p>However, Obsidian Entertainment has also released some stellar games in the past few years, including Pentiment, Pillars of Eternity, and Grounded, so he could also be working on a sequel to those, or a new IP entirely. But for now, all we know if that he’s not working on New Vegas 2… Apparently.</p>



<p>What do you think Gonzalez is working on? Would you like to see a Fallout: New Vegas 2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

		<p>The PC port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a> launched on Thursday, but the game has had a “Mixed” reception in the Steam user reviews as many players complain about performance, graphical issues and crashes.</p>
<p>Sony leant on their in-house porting team at Nixxes to handle the port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/16/marvels-spider-man-2-review/">Spider-Man 2</a>, but while they traditionally have a good reputation for their PC ports, this one has fallen flat, joining a number of other PlayStation PC ports that have had a rocky landing.</p>


<p>We’re working on our own impressions of the PC port, but just to grab <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/765Tet/recommended/2651280/">one </a>of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2651280/negativereviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_">the many negative Steam reviews</a>, “I have an RTX 4070ti, on high graphics and no raytracing I get crashes […] Even when it’s not crashing, shadows flicker for no good reason and it feels like it struggles to render hair at times.”</p>
<p>Part of this is down to performance. While <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/10/marvels-spider-man-remastered-pc-review/">Spider-Man Remastered</a> and Miles Morales were well received for their performance, those games fundamentally had the PS4 platform as the base target for Insomniac’s original creation, and were designed with ray tracing as an additive feature. Spider-Man 2 only launched for PS5 and so could always feature ray tracing, could always rely on the fast NVMe SSD loading times, and the fundamental uplift that the console provided.</p>
<p>Spider-Man 2’s PC port actually scaled back down to GPUs without ray-tracing features, with a broad set of hardware and performance targets to go from 720p30 up to full 4K with “Ultimate” ray tracing.</p>

<p>The problems that players are encountering seem to run the full gamut, and affect both Nvidia and AMD GPUs alike with performance dips, frame rate stutters and running out of VRAM even with a 16GB card. The majority of PC gamers have gone with Nvidia, and with many newly implemented graphical options seem to come plenty of problems.</p>
<p>Odd driver issues can lead to full-blown crashes citing GPU temperatures. Elsewhere Nvidia’s bespoke ray reconstruction for improving ray traced reflections and certain other DLSS features are claimed to actually reduce frame rates.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198820911436/recommended/2651280/">One user has a potential performance aid,</a> saying “Before you play, open the install folder of the game,make a new folder and drag dsstorage.dll and dsstoragecore.dll into the new folder to improve load times, low fps and micro freezes!”</p>
<p>Essentially, this ditches the game’s use of Direct Storage, which has certain requirements for SSD speeds and technology. It’s not clear how this would help, as in theory it would reduce SSD read performance, but perhaps there are some bugs with the system.</p>
<p>As for the other issues, turning down ray-tracing effects and relying less on DLSS features that use AI to fill in the blanks seems to have an effect. In general, it feels like players will want to wait for a patch from Nixxes and a fresh driver update from Nvidia and AMD. Nvidia is also juggling a new GPU generation launch and adding more trickery to their drivers right around now.</p>

After the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6ed521c-5f08-4830-865a-d3f962e557b4" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes" rel="nofollow">Embergard Core Game Set</a> and<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="04fef306-e2e4-49ad-ac52-5ca0c731a173" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-grandfathers-gardeners-and-jaws-of-itzl-review" rel="nofollow"> two other Warbands released in November</a>&nbsp;we now have another Warband of Grots ready to work together to survive another day. Both the&nbsp;Borgit's Beastgrabbaz and Edge of the Knife Rivals Deck favour high risk play so if you've been yearning for some additional excitement check out our breakdown below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To learn more about how to play the game, and to hear about what makes the new season of <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> so different be sure to check out our review for this season's <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6ed521c-5f08-4830-865a-d3f962e557b4" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes" rel="nofollow">Core Set</a></p>

<p>Borgit's Beastgrabbaz are a five-unit warband comprising of Borgit, Snagz, Rigg and Shamm, Uglug, and Dregg. These Grots are all out on an adventure to find Trugg, the Troggoth King, and while they might not have pure strength at their disposal they instead work together to empower one another to constantly be on the move and attacking.</p>

<p>There are a number of mechanics that are constantly in play; At the start of each Action Step you'll pick an enemy with Health of 3 or higher and mark it for +1 Attack dice when trying to hit it, your leader will be constantly put in danger, and there are different reactions that you'll be taking based on other actions that your fighters will be using.</p>

<p>While there's a lot to be keeping an eye on, it is also a lot for an opponent to be planning around. Something as simple as using one of Uglug's Core abilities then lets you push every friendly minion up to three hexes ending up adjacent to Uglug. This kind of swarming can very quickly sure up defences and turn the tides of battle.</p>

Interestingly though when these fighters become empowered they don't actually get stronger, they're just able to move further.</p>

<h2>Edge of the Knife Rivals Deck</h2>

<p>Pairing well with the frantic gameplay style of Borgit's Beastgrabbaz is the Edge of the Knife Rivals Deck. This deck is "tailor-made for those who prefer dirty fighting and high-risk maneuvers."</p>

<p>An additional mechanic that is part of this Rivals Deck is that "While using this Rivals deck, fighters with a Health characteristic of 2 or less and/or 2 or more damage tokens are tempered."&nbsp;The Rivals Deck is filled with cards that interact with those in the tempered state.</p>

<p>Some Objective cards that interact will have you making sure all tempered fighters are in neutral or enemy territory, if you're holding a feature token in enemy territory, or if every fighter is tempered.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borgits-beastgrabbaz-and-edge-of-the-knife-rivals-deck.jpg?itok=sCdah2wU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borgits-beastgrabbaz-and-edge-of-the-knife-rivals-deck.jpg?itok=Dz0RMUfZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Power Cards however go to great lengths to power up the fighters that you have in the tempered state. You can stop them being pushed, swap units across the battlefield, and you can even draw additional Power Cards allowing for more options in the battle.</p>

<p>There's a lot of very situational cards which makes this a difficult kind of game to play. While there are a lot of actions at your disposal you'll need to predict the kinds of situations your opponent will throw you into to ensure you always have the upper hand.</p>

<p>This deck will reward a player with knowledge of their opponent's Warband and Rivals Deck abilities so it might take some practice.</p>

<h2>Borgit's Beastgrabbaz and Edge of the Knife Rivals Deck Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There are some excellent ideas here for a seasoned professional at Warhammer Underworlds. With both the Warband and the Rivals Deck both being centered around risky play even a few mistakes will throw you well behind in the battle.</p>

<p>If you have the patience to learn the strategies and read your opponents there's a lot that you can do to always turn the tide of battle.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has revealed that Far Cry: New Dawn, the 2019 post-apocalyptic title, is getting a 60 FPS update on both Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 platforms. Fans of the franchise were quick to point out how ‘random’ the update is, with some stressing that other Ubisoft titles are in sore need of similar attention from the developer.</p>



<p>It was recently confirmed that on February 4, Far Cry: New Dawn will land on the Game Pass subscription service, which could go some way to explaining the performance upgrade.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-smoother-is-better">Smoother is Better</h2>



<p>It has taken six years, but Ubisoft is finally getting around to upgrading one of the most underrated Far Cry games ever made.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of the franchise, and New Dawn was a welcome addition to the series. Given that I love anything rooted in a post-apocalyptic environment, it made sense that New Dawn spoke to me quite nicely. </p>



<p>It’s set in the aftermath of Far Cry 5, which sees the player plunged into a bunker as nuclear war erupts across the world. What emerges after the bombs have fallen is something incredible – a world taken over by nature, roving bandit gangs, and settlements of survivors trying to get by.</p>



<p>It’s far outside the standard expectations of the Far Cry series, and it’s a twist on the post-apocalyptic vibe like no other. This isn’t a drab, woeful world like the ones portrayed in Fallout or Metro, for instance. It’s bursting with colour, representing an oversaturated take on the end of the world.</p>



<p>The 60 FPS upgrade on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 is a welcome thing, and it might be enough to pull me back in for another loop around the game when it lands on Game Pass next week.</p>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://x.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1885437595527557264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft announced</a> that ‘this wasn’t how (they) planned’ to reveal the upgrade. They had to cut off ‘FPS Boost’ on Xbox consoles to roll out the change, and assuming that players would notice that, they were forced to make the announcement early.</p>



<p>Have you played Far Cry: New Dawn before? Let us know your thoughts about the game on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>. While you’re here, stop by my list of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-far-cry-games-ranked/">best Far Cry games ever, ranked</a>.</p>

			<p>Fallout New Vegas remains the most beloved out of all the games in the popular post-apocalyptic franchise. While buggy, it featured excellent storytelling by Obsidian Entertainment, and many RPG fans believe this was their best work to date.</p>
<p>Over the years, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-in-development-rumor-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors about a potential sequel</a> have only <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-talks-reportedly-happening-at-microsoft-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gotten stronger</a>, particularly after Obsidian joined Bethesda in the Xbox family, and even more following the explosive success of the Fallout TV series on Amazon Prime Video. Besides, Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart didn't exactly hide his fondness for the franchise. In October 2022, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-entertainment-fallout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<p><em>Of course, if we ever got the opportunity to make another Fallout game, we'd make it. There's not even a question of whether or not we would do it, it's just 'Will the opportunity arise? I hung around at Interplay for probably an extra year because I wanted to work on Fallout more. I love Fallout.</em></p>
<p><em>At some point, we'll start looking into what those next games are going to be, and I would be surprised if Fallout is not on that list. If we were to do Fallout, it has to tie in with what Bethesda is doing with Fallout and a lot of other things, but I would always personally say my hope is that before I ride off into the sunset, I'd love to make another Fallout game.</em></p>
<p>Fans' hopes suddenly spiked yesterday when acclaimed game writer John Gonzalez <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnrgonzalez_im-happy-to-share-that-im-starting-a-new-activity-7290785057554767873-EjZ9?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that he had returned to Obsidian. Gonzalez is credited for his work on Tom Clancy's EndWar, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, Horizon: Zero Dawn and its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West. He was briefly the Narrative Director at Smilegate Barcelona and then at Fantastic Pixel Castle on their upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-mmorpg-qa-ex-wow-designer-opens-up-on-every-aspect-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost MMORPG</a>. And yes, we said that he returned to Obsidian because, as you probably have guessed by now, Gonzalez was also the Lead Creative Designer and Lead Writer on Fallout New Vegas (for which he publicly thanks God on his LinkedIn page).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, any hopes for a sequel were quickly dashed when he added the following under his new role as Creative Director at the studio:</p>
<p><em>Back to Obsidian for exciting times! (No, it's not FNV2.)</em></p>
<p>So, the time hasn't come yet, despite Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-might-be-here-sooner-than-we-thought-at-microsofts-behest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly wanting to push harder on the Fallout franchise</a>. Still, given the studio and the writer, we're definitely eager to learn more about this new project in due time. For now, Obsidian is certainly focused on the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a> in a couple of weeks, followed by The Outer Worlds 2, also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to debut this year</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-dead-ninja-marvel-rivals/</link>

<p>As Marvel Rivals has gone from strength to strength, the game’s main competitor – Overwatch – has floundered. Since being released by NetEase in December, Marvel Rivals has taken the gaming world by storm, racking up tens of millions of players and sitting proudly atop social and streaming charts worldwide.</p>



<p>Overwatch 2 is struggling by comparison. From concerns about the game’s player count to the lack of meaningful updates, the hero shooter that once stood atop the genre is imploding.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-overwatch-2-launch-was-abysmal">‘The Overwatch 2 Launch Was Abysmal’</h2>



<p>During a recent stream, Ninja broke down the state of play for Marvel Rivals and Overwatch. He stressed that Overwatch 2 has been in a pit since it was released in October 2022, which is accurate. It was seen by many as being ‘Overwatch 1.5’, and even a pivot to a free-to-play operating model didn’t do much to revive the game’s prospects.</p>



<p>He referenced the Overwatch 2 launch being ‘abysmal’ and then went in against the game, stressing that Marvel Rivals is taking over right now.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Overwatch is dead and gone.</p>



<p>It’s so unfortunate. Here’s the thing — first off, they already have a new map coming, which is incredible. Second, they have so much lore and so many heroes and villains and anti-heroes that they have enough for updates for the next ten years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hero shooter space is booming right now. Marvel Rivals is in a league of its own, but fans of the genre are still enjoying and anticipating the imminent arrival of Valve’s Deadlock, which has received global praise from some of the biggest streamers in the business.</p>



<p>VALORANT, a hero shooter with a serious esports ecosystem, is also enjoying rampant growth and popularity.</p>

<p>The Halo Championship Series is back for another season through 2025, and recently, Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) revealed the full schedule, format, and team breakdown for the year ahead. There’s a stacked roadmap for the HCS 2025 circuit, including four Major events and a $1 million world championship tournament.</p>

<p>Techland recently surfaced all over social media to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Dying Light franchise. In 2015, the first game was released, introducing a high-octane, intense zombie-slaying title to the world, and it quickly became known as one of the best games in the genre. In 2022, Techland followed up with Dying Light 2: Stay Human, a live-service title that’s going strong today.</p>



<p>As part of the celebration, the team at Techland published a video packed with stats, including a juicy one – <strong>45 million players </strong>have been through the Dying Light universe since 2015.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-populated">Populated</h2>



<p>In a promotional video posted on social media, Techland revealed that across two games, more than 45 million players have entered the Dying Light universe.</p>



<p>Collectively, they’ve played 1.1 billion hours of Dying Light and have killed more than 75 billion zombies – ‘9 times the world population’. By utilising the franchise’s fluid and advanced movement mechanics, players have made the equivalent of <strong>41 trips to the sun and back </strong>on foot.</p>



<p>Dying Light is well known for its aggressive and visceral combat engine, and with that in mind, more than 20.3 billion zombies have been beheaded by players in the last decade. </p>



<div><article><p><span>Since the release of the original Dying Light, we have been blessed with the best fans in the world. So it’s only right that we recognize you. Watch our summary video that shows off all the craziest feats you have achieved in those 10 years!

<p>There’s plenty more to come this year. In the summer, players will get their hands on Dying Light: The Beast, a standalone title that sees the return of Kyle Crane, played by Roger Craig Smith. I had the pleasure of catching up with the iconic actor at Gamescom 2024, where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/">we spoke about his role</a> in the upcoming open-world zombie game.</p>



<p>To celebrate the 10th anniversary of Dying Light, Techland has rolled out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-dying-light-next-era-10th-anniversary/">a series of events and special offers</a> across the universe, present in both Dying Light and Dying Light 2.</p>

<p>The Carolina Royal Ravens have had an unexpected start to the 2025 Call of Duty League season. The squad has put up some impressive numbers since day dot, floating around the top of the CDL standings and knocking the biggest teams in the business down a peg. It all started with a 3 – 0 win over Atlanta FaZe, a feat that any team hadn’t achieved for more than 500 days.</p>



<p>However, FaZe retaliated with a win against the Ravens in the GF of the first CDL Minor. At the Madrid Major, which is unfolding now, the Royal Ravens have kicked off a dominant run through the elimination bracket, after being pushed down into the depths by the LA Thieves.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-eliminations-galore">Eliminations Galore</h2>



<p>In the opening round of the elimination bracket, the Carolina Royal Ravens decimated the Vegas Falcons, producing a 3 – 0 scoreline that included a dramatic reverse sweep in the round of Search. Many have praised the Falcons for their resilience, but the lack of mental composure during much-needed clutch moments is becoming an issue.</p>



<p>Following that round, the Royal Ravens soared onwards, clashing with OpTic Texas, previously the favourite to win the Madrid Major. OpTic managed to close out just one map – the opening Hardpoint. That was as close as close could be, with the scoreline settling at 248 – 250 in Carolina’s favour.</p>



<p>From there, it was a sweep for the Royal Ravens, with the remaining maps including a 3 – 0 wash over OpTic Texas on Protocol Control.</p>



<p>There were concerns about the resilience of the Carolina Royal Ravens following the opening loss against LAT. It was revealed that Reece ‘Vivid’ Drost has an eye injury that he’s dealing with, but regardless of that, he has been frying in-game.</p>



<p>The Royal Ravens will now need to contend with the likes of Toronto Ultra or Atlanta FaZe, two formidable teams that have had a brilliant season thus far. It took a while for Atlanta FaZe to get the wheels turning, but the squad now sits on a solid win streak of nine matches – including a win at the first CDL Minor.</p>



<p>It’s anyone’s game right now, and the $150,000 grand prize is lying in wait for whoever has the talent to secure it.</p>
